00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
Hello everybody

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.080
It is coming up to Valentines Day

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.640
That time of the year when all your friends are going out and getting laid,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.020
and you're sitting on the sofa watching Titanic for the 50th time

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.220
Well if you are single on Valentines Day then don't fret

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.960
because I have got the perfect meal for you.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.580
I'll be showing you guys how to make and bake the most perfect pizza

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.740
for you to enjoy alone, or to bake for your friends and family.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.020
I've been lucky enough to have been shown how to make the most perfect pizza

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.180
by the most amazing chefs in London

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.300
So let's get started.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
..Flour, salt, yeast...

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.060
Alright.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.560
So apparently in order to bake something flat you need a bowl

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
which, to me, is the opposite of flat but

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.080
it's what Delia says. So whatever.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.340
So whatever.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.920
Firstly, flour

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
It says 175 grams

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.540
A little teaspoon of salt...

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.540
There we go

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.540
AH!

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540
AH!

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.540
Didn't work...

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.540
Okay, well Delia says we need to put sugar on the dough

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.540
I think Delia's on crack so we're not gonna do that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.280
I think Delia is on crack so we're not gonna do that

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280
That's sticking your fingers in it and whizzing it around a little bit

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380
...no, That's sex

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.740
No, That's sex

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.040
Four fluid ounces or 120 ml of hand hot water water

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040
It literally says water water

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.320
um, I'm assuming she means "water water"

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.560
And now we have to use a spoon to make it all into a dough

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.940
So now we have to use a spoon to make it all into a dough

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640
REALLY smellls of vodka

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640
This is the most disgusting thing I have ever come up with,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.940
Is that a good thing?

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.940
It's so sticky why is it sticky!?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.840
It's called kneading

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.540
I don't know!

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.040
I've seen it on the 'Food Network'

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.760
And this is the shit they do

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.080
I don't know!

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.640
Basically,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.620
if you can do that with dough and its not going gloopy and shit

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.940
You doing alright

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.700
I'm lucky I caught that

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.700
Dough.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.280
*Weird 'eh eh eh' sounds*

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.580
I'm gonna put that in the oven

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.600
Yeah

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.240
Yeah! I'm g-

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.220
Is that gonna set fire?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.720
*Sings* Fuck it!

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.420
Well...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.020
It's a...

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.200
...a pizza base...

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.940
It...

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.300
It's solid!

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.820
So...

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.400
We win!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.280
Now we get to the fun part:

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.800
The toppings!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.780
Tomato sauce with herbs pizza topping...

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.080
Just basically...

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.600
Pour it all over...

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.700
Like that...

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.440
Done.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800
I have been watching too much 'HowToBasic'

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800
Maybe I am 'HowToBasic'...

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.140
...I'm not...

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.860
So basically when you have destroyed all of your landlord's property

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.360
with pizza sauce

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.580
Now you need the actual toppings

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.380
So you're just gonna grab some onions...

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.780
Some peppers...

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.760
A cup of your tears...

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.540
Valentine's day,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.040
you're single,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.920
you're gonna be sad

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.940
Alright?

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.460
Duh

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.100
More onions

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.000
Onions are good 'cause you haven't got to kiss anybody

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.500
So...

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.720
Who cares about your breath?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.460
You know what else you should do?

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.220
On Valentine's day to relax?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.640
Use a bath bomb

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.940
Just like that.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.180
Have a nice bath

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.760
Oh it's fizzing on the pizza

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.940
Crumble all that up

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.440
Lush,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.280
Seriously

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.680
You're making some great products that I'm sure are very tasty too

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.500
You're single

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.000
Right?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.740
You're lonely

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.180
You have a cat

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.080
So prime 'Whiskers' cat food

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.300
WITH tuna

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.440
Because again,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.000
No one cares about your breath.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.500
Just...

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.120
...slide that congealed jelly...

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.000
...on to your pizza...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.660
Basically, slop that all in there,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.700
You wanna make sure the meat

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.000
is well spread, around the pizza

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.300
with the bath bomb as well.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.360
Now I do wanna say that this next part

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.880
I've never actually added this to any of the pizzas that I've done on my training course

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.180
with the top London chefs

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.020
I'm gonna add a picture of John Green

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.020
Basically my thought process is:

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.600
If we sacrifice John Green

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.080
to the pizza gods

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.940
he won't write anymore sad things about kids with cancer.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.820
So,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm sorry John,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.220
I've met you

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.500
and you're lovely

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.660
But I'm sick of crying

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.200
at a piece of paper.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.840
There

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.060
I'm sorry John Green

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.200
John Green is now dead

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.840
He's... He's on my pizza

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.960
Just, just his glasses

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.460
Just...

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.540
...right there,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.280
There you go John,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.780
Night night

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.320
Next up!

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.080
It's Valentine's day

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.740
You're sad

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.960
You want chocolate

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.880
Just put some chocolate all over

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.100
John Green's face

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.260
Next up get the roses

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.220
That

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.820
your boyfriend didn't buy for you

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.600
Just...

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.760
Just sprinkle a couple of roses on to there

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.540
It's just

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.040
You know,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.780
It's all good,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.440
Just- just slap a rose on it

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.360
I can assure you,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.900
That roses on their own,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.060
Taste great...

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.380
*Regret*

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.960
So the next thing you wanna do is find your nearest copy of 'Fifty Shades of Grey

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.180
and throw it the fuck away

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.440
Away from you

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.320
As far as you fucking can

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.500
That shit is nasty

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.260
Now simply...

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.980
...add...

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.640
...some mozzarella cheese

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.600
Just to cover the whole thing

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.200
More cheese!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.400
Cheese!

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.220
Cheese...

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.180
Lots of ch-

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.680
There we go

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.260
There we go, lots and lots of cheese

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.940
There we go!

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.760
That's your pizza!

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.480
Now,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.780
just pop it in the oven!

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.280
Oh...

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.720
Oh my god, it's...

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.780
I think it's done...

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.560
And here we have it!

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.560
There we go!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.480
The most perfect

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.780
Valentine's pizza you could ever want!

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.140
And if you can't afford to get a takeaway

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.040
Here's the shit that I just made

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.540
Get...

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.340
Oh god...

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.020
Okay...

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.740
There we go!

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.360
There is the perfect...

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.820
...slice of pizza

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.720
You can really taste...

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.740
...the cat food and the bath bomb

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.580
Imma just cut off a little bit here

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.000
*Sigh*

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.180
WHAT THE F-

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.560
Okay...

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.740
So...

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.960
There we have it...

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.240
The perfect...

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.400
Valentine's...

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.240
Pizza...

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.040
Made by

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.160
'Papa John's'

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.200
Just order a take away.
