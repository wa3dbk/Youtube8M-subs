00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.260
Método Abellán. Cajón flamenco

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.280
Initiation level. Soleá, soleá por bulería, alegrías and bulería

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Left hand accents

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.560
We continue with bulería

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.760
And now we re going to work on left hand accents

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.480
The first accent we are going to do is

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.900
The one between one and two

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.360
The one and the two in the second place, not at the beginning

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.020
And we get the following combination

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.040
The next accent we are going to do

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.440
Is the one between four and five

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.000
We keep the last accent

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.240
And we add one between four and five

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.160
To these two accents

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.840
We are adding one more

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.460
Between six and seven

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.040
We accentuate with the left hand

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.060
And we lower our right hand for seven and eight

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.220
Then we add the accent

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.680
Between nine and ten
