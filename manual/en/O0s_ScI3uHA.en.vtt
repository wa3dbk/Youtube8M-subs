00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.330
President Robert Brown is going to be announcing
an extraordinary gift to Boston University.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.230
A 25 million dollar founding and naming gift
by Rajen Kilachand.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.130
Education is going to be a key driver of how
we handle the future.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.150
I was lucky to get education from a great
country and a great institution like B.U.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.080
And I know what it... how it shaped me.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.860
It was B.U. which made my mind become truly
global, even way back in '71.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.840
Rajen Kilachand's gift is enormously important
in a number of ways.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.340
First it is the largest gift in the history
of this university, and I don't think one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.230
can possibly exaggerate how important that
is.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.720
To say that someone who graduated from this
university long ago and who lives in a very

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.149
different part of the world thinks that what
we're doing is important enough to merit his

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.149
philanthropy .

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.330
You have no idea of the good will of Boston
University back in Asia, especially in India

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.360
that I know of.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.350
Even people from my generation, we are so
proud.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.330
When I meet people from these great Ivy League
schools from the United States I say, "Oh,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.330
you're from Harvard?

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.330
Oh actually I'm from B.U.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.490
You should go there."

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.150
What we're celebrating this week is something
which is very rare: the formal naming and

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.710
founding of a college.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.530
The Honors College is above all a community,
a community of faculty and students.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.740
Honors College is a small program.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.880
Students from all the different colleges are
selected to participate in an interdisciplinary

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.390
learning experience.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.780
What we believe is that students of the arts
and sciences need to know about the subject

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.180
matter and perspectives of the professional
schools.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.240
And it's fantastic because unlike a lot of
honors programs that are like engineering

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.110
programs or CAS programs, the Honors College
has people from all different interests.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.720
Mr. Kilachand I think said it best.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.840
He said that when he began his career and
his own company he didn't have any idea that

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.980
he'd have to be a bit of an anthropologist,
a bit of a political scientist, a bit of a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.290
psychologist, and a bit of an engineer to
do the work he did.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.580
Our students are walking off into a whole
world which is going to be full of complex,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.590
unprecedented phenomenon.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.390
Students who have an understanding of a variety
of intellectual approaches will be well-prepared

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.760
to explore what's in front of them.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.250
I essentially believe that the Honors College
will produce truly a Renaissance person.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.930
True leaders of the world of tomorrow.
