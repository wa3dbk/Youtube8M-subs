Hi.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.150
I'm Adrena Wilhelm from Canine
Companions for independence.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.280
Today, we're going to learn how to
train your dog using treats.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.440
Rewards work better than punishment
when you're training, because the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.090
reward makes them more likely
to repeat the behavior.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.900
Positive reinforcement is one of your
most powerful tools for shaping or

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.970
changing your dog's behavior.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.400
So the first thing you'll need
are some treats like these.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.220
The best dog training treats are small
and something your dog really enjoys.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.040
Keep in mind that treats should only
account for a small portion of your

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.110
dog's diet.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.340
Too many treats may lead to obesity
in dogs and other health problems.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.630
Correct timing is essential when
using positive reinforcement.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.000
The reward must occur immediately within
seconds, or your pet may not

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.790
associate the proper action.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.800
For example, if you have your dog sit
but reward him after he stood back up,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.830
he may think that he's being
rewarded for standing up.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.730
Dogs don't understand sentences.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.970
Daisy, I want you to be a good girl and
sit for me now will likely earn

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.310
you a blank stare.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.770
Keep command short and uncomplicated.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:22.040
The most commonly used commands are sit,
stay, down, which means lie down,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:37.840
off, which means get off of me or get
off of the furniture, stand, come,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.020
heel, which means walk close
to my side, and leave it.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.645
Every one in the family should use the
same commands, otherwise, your dog may

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:53.590
be confused.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.660
It might help to post a list of commands
where everyone can become

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.850
familiar with them.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.170
Consistency also means rewarding the
desired behavior and never rewarding

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.220
the undesired behavior.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.530
Positive reinforcement is great for
teaching your dog commands.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.660
It's also a good way to reinforce
good behavior.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.740
You may have your dog sit before letting
him out the door to prevent

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.770
door darting, before petting him to
prevent jumping on people, and before

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.215
feeding him to teach good
meal-time manners.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.620
Give him a pat or a good dog for lying
quietly at your feet or slip a treat

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.760
into his toy when he's chewing
on that instead of your shoe.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.010
Be careful that you don't use
positive reinforcement to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.940
reward unwanted behaviors.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.660
For example, if you let your dog outside
every time he hears a noise in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.560
the neighborhood, you're giving him
a reward, access to the yard for a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.700
behavior you want to discourage.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.920
Treats are a great way to provide
positive reinforcement to the good

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.150
behavior you want to
see from your dog.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.380
Be sure to talk to your vet and trainer
before you get started.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.840
Now let's recap.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680
Rewards work better than punishment
when training.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.820
Timing is everything.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.090
Reward immediately after
a proper action.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.600
Keep your command short and sweet.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.740
Be consistent with commands
and rewarding.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.350
And lastly, use treats to
reinforce good behavior.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.250
