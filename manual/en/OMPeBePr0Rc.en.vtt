00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.840
Windows Defender helps protect your computer
against slow system performance

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.400
and security threats caused by viruses and
spyware.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.670
Malware might install itself without your
knowledge.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.060
It could come from an email, a website, or
software you installed.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.759
This video shows how to use Windows Defender
to scan for malicious software in Windows 8.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.300
To open Windows Defender, type defender in
the Windows Start screen.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.200
Then select Windows Defender from the search
results.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
The Home window opens.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.300
If PC Status: Protected displays in the window title bar,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Windows Defender is enabled and Real-time
protection is turned on.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.539
This feature allows Windows Defender to notify
you when malware tries to install itself or

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.000
run on your computer.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.700
If PC Status: At risk displays in the window
title bar, click the Turn On button to enable

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.900
Real-time protection.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.500
From the Home screen, you can select Quick
to run a quick scan that checks

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.160
the places on the hard drive where malware
is most likely to infect.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.000
Or, you can select Full to run a scan that
checks all files on your hard drive and all

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.890
currently running programs.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.220
Or, if you suspect malware in a specific area
of your computer, you can run a custom scan

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.670
on individual drives and folders.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.780
For this example, we will run a quick scan.
To do this, select Quick, and then click Scan now.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.700
The progress bar shows the status of the scan. Scan times will vary.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:42.100
When the scan is complete, the results appear. In this case, you see number of items scanned and the message

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.000
"No threats detected on your PC during this scan." If Windows Defender detects

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
harmful software, the software names would appear in this window.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200
With a custom scan, you can change the file
types, locations, and processes that are scanned.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200
To include archived files, such as .zip or
.cab files, and removable drives in a scan,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.689
click the Settings tab, click Advanced, and
then make sure the Scan archive files box

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.040
is checked.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.040
To include removable drives, select Scan removable
drives, and then click Save changes.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.100
To increase the speed of a scan, you can exclude
files, locations, and processes from a scan.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.300
To exclude specific files and locations, click
Excluded files and locations.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.519
Click Browse. Find the file or location you
want to exclude.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.370
For this example, we will select the Saved
Games folder. Click OK.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.219
The folder name appears in the File Location
box. Select the file and click Add.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.700
The added file name displays in the Name box.
To select more files or locations,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.400
click the Browse button and repeat the process.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.500
When you have added all the files you want to exclude, click Save changes.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.500
The selected files and locations will be excluded from the next custom scan.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.100
To exclude all files of a certain type, click
Excluded file types.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.100
For this example, we will exclude all "MOV"
videos. Type "mov" in the File extensions

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.000
box, and click Add.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.300
The file types and extensions appear in the
box below.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.700
If you change your mind, you can also remove
them from the box by highlighting the file

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.400
and clicking Remove.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.700
Click Save changes.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.670
The file type will be excluded from the next
custom scan.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.510
To exclude processes, click Excluded processes. You can click Browse to find the process file.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.620
Or, if you know the process file name, type
the name in the Process names box.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:05.300
For this example, we will exclude the WinMail.exe process. Type "WinMail dot exe" and click Add.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.010
The file name displays in the Name box. After
you have added the process files you want

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.999
to exclude, click Save changes.

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.190
The processes will be excluded from the next
custom scan.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.070
After making changes to the scan settings,
use the Custom scan option on the Home tab

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.800
to run future scans.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.070
If Windows Defender detects malware, it quarantines
the software and prevents

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.290
the software from running until you restore
it or remove it.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.500
To view a list of quarantined items, select
the History tab, click Quarantined items,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
and then click View Details.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.600
Quarantined items appear in the Detected item
box. To get additional information, click

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.390
the item and scroll through the box below.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.390
After reviewing the information, you can choose
to Remove all, Remove, or Restore the item.
