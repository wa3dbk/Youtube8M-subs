00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.390
In this video, we're going
to multiply 36 times 27.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.470
So we're multiplying
a two-digit number

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.152
times another two-digit number.

00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:09.735
And the way that
we're going to tackle

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:13.130
it is we're going to
first multiply 36 times 7,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.190
figure out what that is.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.190
Then we're going to
multiply 36 times 20,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.850
figure out what that
is, and then add

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.530
those two numbers together.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.440
And what I want to do is
first do this, just show you

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.835
the process for how to
multiply these two numbers.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.210
And then I'm going
to do it again

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.043
where we're going to
think a little bit more

00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:32.340
about what the different
numbers represent.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.070
So first let's start
with the process.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.140
So I'm going to multiply
36 times 7 or 7 times 36.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.010
So I can start in
the ones place.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.090
7 times 6 is 42.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.760
Write the 2 down here.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790
And then the 4,
which represents 40,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.770
I can put in the tens place.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.680
7 times 3 is 21, plus 4 is 25.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.980
So I could write the
25 right over here.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.710
There's no place
to carry this 2,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.450
so I just wrote the 2 right
over here in the hundreds place.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.290
Now let's move over.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.430
So let me clean this up
so we don't get confused.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.600
So we just figured out
what 7 times 36 is.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.760
It is 252.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.647
Now let's worry about
what 36 times 20 is.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:18.230
And so what we're
going to do is we're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.290
going to throw a
0 right over here,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.760
because we're now
going to multiply

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.880
36 times something
in the tens place.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.250
This isn't just a 2.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.470
This is a 20.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.090
So let's just go with
the digits right now

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.660
and then we'll think about
it in terms of place value

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.020
the second time around.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.200
2 times 6 is 12.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.160
Write the 2 right over here.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.490
Carry the 1.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.750
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.059
So we just figured out
that 36 times 20 is 720.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:54.850
And just think about
what would've happened

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.230
if we didn't put the 0 here.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.130
Then we would have figured
out that 36 times 2 is 72,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.510
but this 2 isn't just a 2.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.520
This is a 20.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.010
So 36 times 20 is 720.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.030
And now we can add these two
things because 36 times 27

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.280
is the same thing as 36
times 20 plus 36 times 7.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.480
So let's add these
two numbers together.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.450
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.860
5 plus 2 is 7.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.970
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.680
And we get 972.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.600
Now I'm going to do this
exact same problem again.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.070
But this time, I'm
going to really talk

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.200
about what these
digits represent.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.640
Hopefully the first pass,
you kind of saw the process

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.515
for doing it.

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:43.890
Now we're going to think about
what these digits actually

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.990
represent.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.090
So we're going to
multiply 36 times 7.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.650
So 7 times 6 is 42.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.170
We would write the 2 in the
ones place, and then the 40

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.950
we can write in the tens place.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.900
This 4 represents 40.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.990
7 times 30 is 210,
plus 40 is 250.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.750
And we already had that 2 in
the ones place, so we get 252.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.460
36 times 7 is 252.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.210
Now let's clean this up.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:26.050
Now let's multiply-- 20 times
6 is going to give us 120.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.340
So let's write the
20 in the tens place,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.520
and then carry the 100, or carry
the 1, which represents 100.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.060
Now, 2 times-- or I
should say 20 times

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.970
30 is going to give you
600, plus one more 100

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.770
is going to give you 700.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.912
So we just figured out
that 36 times 20 is 720.

00:03:53.912 --> 00:03:57.350
The 7 is in the hundreds
place, 2 in the tens place.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.150
And then we can add again.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.510
And just like we did the
last time, we got 972.
