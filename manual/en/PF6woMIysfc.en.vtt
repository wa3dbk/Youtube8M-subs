00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.962
My name is Paulo Gustavo Moraes Novo

00:00:01.962 --> 00:00:04.458
but I'm known as Guga Morales

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:09.177
I'm a balancer, juggler, have a number of seal man

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.555
i practice circus and juggling for 10 years

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.475
I think professionally I'm already in that environment for about 7

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:16.548
7 years

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:19.800
I also work with a company called the Duo Morales

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.897
which is a fusion between artists of Rio de Janeiro and sao paulo

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:27.050
and now I'm working with my solo number

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:28.841
called the Seal Man

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:30.638
due to a traditional circus technique

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.254
balancing and manipulating objects with the mouth

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.611
with a mouthpiece

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:42.647
I think the same way that the word circus carries this thing a little heavy

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:44.130
this gypsy thing

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.500
this traditional thing, circus tops, Families

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049
that is nomadic

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:50.453
it has another meaning at the same time

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:53.475
this meaning that comes from the schools

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.769
the circus schools, social circus schools

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.940
schools in Europe

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.977
which is now having a lot of artists coming and going

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:06.376
we already see a lot of exchange between Brazilian artists

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:09.699
and German artists, european artists

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.818
and all this is giving a new face to the Brazilian circus

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:20.014
I think it's a lie when people say that the circus is dying

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.539
I think this root doesn't die

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:22.897
will not die anytime soon

00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:24.755
and it's time for us to seek this fusion

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:29.813
and increasingly stop to separate the idea of modern circus

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:33.285
contemporary circus, traditional circus, family circus

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.924
it's time to end this separation!

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:38.371
would be very important for every juggler to go to a school

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:39.979
but not any school,

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.127
you know? I think juggling is a very delicate art

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.126
where we have many techniques

00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:49.497
teaching artists, posture techniques

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.302
things we don't yet have here in Brazil

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.541
we're still very ...

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:59.384
is very difficult for us to find a good juggling class

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.618
perhaps basic, beginner, yes, you can find

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.783
because we have very good jugglers in Brazil

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:08.328
now different from a school in Russia

00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:10.493
or different from a school in Europe

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:14.205
because there they have this technique

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:16.249
someone studied for a long time

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.899
to teach you a juggling technique

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:24.674
the russian technique, the German technique, Chinese technique,

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:28.277
but there is a technique, there is somebody else who studied to teach you that technique

00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:30.402
here in Brazil we have the guts

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.490
we win, we learn because of our will

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.045
hardheaded, you know?

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:40.840
and I think that's one thing missing in schools of Brazil

00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:46.762
people trained to give this kind of information

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:50.948
europe is already a step farther than us, right?

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:56.068
I think Brazil is on this path, the path to get there

00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:03.883
to have a certain respect in relation to the artistic level, you know?

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:05.849
we already have a lot of encouragement, already have schools,

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:10.117
just missing us, we Brazilians, open a little bit more our heads

00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:11.520
open our heads

00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:15.329
I usually say that one of the things that made me professional

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.419
is I have been very stubborn

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:20.774
I have a very strong focus

00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:23.146
I had a question of focus of 1 year and a half

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:24.811
I focused on a trick

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:28.573
I knew I would only be able to do it in 1 year and a half or so

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.086
and I trained every day, hardhead

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.797
to be able to learn this trick

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:38.618
I think this was my creation process ...

00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.576
not Creation... learning

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:42.643
all creations came from my reference

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:45.516
my reference of the traditional circus, old jugglers

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.436
Francis Brunn, Enrico Rastelli

00:03:47.837 --> 00:03:50.225
Bobby May, Bob Branson

00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:56.016
all these old school who were very my reference. you know?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.071
and I've always been very practical

00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:01.831
so all I learned was practicing was with a hardhead

00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:03.282
was going there and doing it

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:07.541
in my work on stage and on the streets

00:04:08.008 --> 00:04:09.553
the same thing

00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:12.314
was always going...

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:15.723
going, doing stupid things, going missing, missing, doing it right

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:17.306
missing, hitting, hitting, hitting

00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:19.693
and I think so I will continue

00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:21.955
missing, hitting and practicing

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:31.736
