00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.375
Hi guys, Jillian Beck back
with another healthy recipe

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:07.292
with Bodybuilding.com.

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:10.042
Today I'm gonna be showing
you my lettuce-wrapped

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.833
turkey muffins.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:14.792
I know there are a lot of
turkey muffin recipes out there.

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:16.500
This is just my version.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.083
It's pretty simple.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.792
It's very versatile so I'm just
gonna show you how to put

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:23.208
it together, give you
some different options,

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.875
but you can play around
with it and we'll get started.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.500
It should take about
25 minutes to make altogether

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.708
with the baking.

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:35.458
It's gonna be in the oven for 20
minutes at 375 and then it takes

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.208
about 5 minutes just to
throw everything together.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.583
So what you're gonna
need is our ground turkey.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:45.458
I usually go 96% and above.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:49.042
Right now I think
this is 96% lean.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.000
If I'm closer to like a
show or a photo shoot,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.208
I definitely go leaner, 99%
is what I usually go with.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.208
So I got this.

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.042
I basically just went through my
fridge since we're doing kind of

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:04.292
mid-week meal prepping at our
house and kind of just grabbed

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:07.333
whatever veggies I had in stock.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.583
And so we have some spinach,
some bell pepper and some onions

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.458
and then I usually like to
throw in like a fresh herb.

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:17.667
I've done fresh basil, I think
that was last week and this week

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.875
I'm gonna do some
fresh cilantro.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:22.500
So those are the veggies
we're gonna use to throw in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.208
with the ground turkey.

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:28.542
You'll also need one egg
white and then our seasonings.

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:32.500
And I like to use
Bragg's liquid aminos.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.208
It's a natural soy
sauce alternative.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:40.458
I go with my staples of
seasonings which is garlic,

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:44.958
ginger and then a little bit
of sea salt and cracked pepper.

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.875
And then you'll need some
cooking spray for our muffin tin

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:51.750
and then some romaine lettuce
leaves like for the hearts to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.250
wrap the turkey burger
or turkey muffins in.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.708
So it's really
simple, really easy.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.000
I've got the
turkey already in here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.083
I've chopped our veggies up
so I'm just gonna go ahead

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:04.875
and add those.

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:07.583
And so you don't
have to like stick with

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:09.375
the exact veggies that I do.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.750
Definitely play around with what
you like and what you have

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.917
in your fridge at the time.

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:18.083
We're gonna
throw that in there.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:21.750
There's kind of the
staples we have around.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.833
If we have some green onion,

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:26.083
I like to throw
that in there as well.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:30.792
If I want them spicy,
I put in some chili flakes.

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:35.000
These are just gonna be pretty
standard and they're just great

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.875
to have on hand during the week.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:40.833
You know, for quick lunches,
you can break them up

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.042
and put it over brown rice
if you want some carbs.

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.208
If we have them for dinner, I
usually just wrap them in the

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.792
romaine lettuce leaves and so
they're really good that way.

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:54.750
And then I put some mustard or
Walden Farms like barbecue sauce

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.833
is amazing so I
like that as well.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.917
I'm gonna add my
one egg white here.

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:07.292
And some turkey muffins call for
like quinoa flour or out flour

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:10.125
to help bind
everything but like I said,

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:11.417
mine's pretty simple, basic.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:15.708
I don't have a ton of
ingredients and so it's just egg

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:19.833
white, turkey and veggies and I
like to keep it simple that way.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.208
So I'm adding these spices and
I don't really measure them, but

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:27.042
I would say maybe it's like 1
teaspoon, but I just kind of go

00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:32.458
with eyeballing it since
I do this all the time so.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:36.958
And then for the liquid aminos,
I would say 1--let's see here,

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:43.292
1 teaspoon about so.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:45.708
We'll mix all these
ingredients together.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:50.208
You can get in there with your
hands too and really make sure

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:54.167
everything is combined well.

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:59.708
I'm just using this
wooden spoon here.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:06.500
It's almost ready.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.542
It's kind of just
a different version

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.000
of the turkey burgers
that I make.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.042
So when I want to do turkey
burgers like if we're having a

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:18.583
barbecue or, you know, and I
want to make my own burgers,

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:21.292
I'll do turkey burgers with
a recipe very similar to this

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:24.250
but I'll make patties and I'll
grill them up and then wrap

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.750
them in butter leaf lettuce.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.917
But these muffins are just super
easy, especially when you're,

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:32.542
you know, in the kitchen so much
and doing a lot of meal prep.

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:38.250
So, I just wanted to keep it
simple and healthy for you guys.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.458
So that's all mixed.

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:45.458
I'm gonna ahead and spray
the muffin tin with this Pam.

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.417
Good to go.

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:51.333
I'm gonna use a spoon here too.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:55.375
I'd say it's like a baseball
size for each muffin

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:59.000
and we'll just
pop that in there.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:10.917
And so if you want to find out
kind of like what your macros

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:16.083
for this meal are, definitely
what I do is take like two

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:18.250
muffins and put it on the
scale and kind of measure it

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.833
out and see what I'm at.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:22.708
I usually try to go for
3 to 4 ounces of protein

00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:27.375
and that's usually about
200 calories or less.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.250
I mean it's all just
veggies in here so it's not

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.208
a whole lot of anything else.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:38.000
So depending on what your
macronutrient needs are, you can

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
have two or three, you know,
turkey muffins or more than that

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.792
if you're trying to put on
some more size or muscle

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:52.333
and you need a higher
dose of protein so.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:06:02.417
Almost ready here.

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:11.708
And that made
perfect 12 muffins.

00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.708
Put that back on here.

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.083
Sit that aside.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.708
My hands are really gross
right now so I'm gonna go

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:29.875
rinse them real quick.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:32.625
Okay, so here
are our turkey muffins

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.833
before they go in the oven.

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.625
So I'm gonna go ahead
and put them in there at 375

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:42.083
for 20 minutes
and I will be right back.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:50.708
All right, guys, so the
turkey muffins are done.

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:54.833
They've baked for about 20
minutes at 375 and I went ahead

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:58.167
and let them cool off
for about 2 minutes or so.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:02.667
And I've taken out the romaine
lettuce hearts and I placed

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:05.958
two muffins on there,
if you can see them.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.833
And--I guess you
can't but they're there.

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:12.958
And I'll go ahead and probably
put some spicy mustard on there.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.333
If I'm getting a little
crazy with it, I might add some

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:18.792
avocado, which will be a really
excellent choice, especially for

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:22.208
dinner time if you're, you know,
omitting like any other carbs

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.208
and you want to add
some extra fats,

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:27.167
sliced avocado on these
would be excellent.

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:30.792
So yeah, I might do some
spicy mustard and avocado,

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:32.458
but again it's your choice.

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.708
You can add
Walden's barbecue sauce.

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:37.208
Some low-sugar
ketchup would be good.

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:39.750
So feel free to
make it your own.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.500
It's really simple,
really quick and delicious.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.375
