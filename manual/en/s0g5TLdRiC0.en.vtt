00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.866
Hi, Dr. Mark Burhenne here of AsktheDentist.com. 

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.532
Today, we’re going to do one of my favorite demos for my patients 

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.699
—and for you—

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.900
and that is to wash my hands with toothpaste. 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.500
Now, you’re wondering, “Why would I do that?” 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.600
Well...

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.700
I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but a lot of hand products, things that are in hand soaps

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.166
are appearing in toothpaste, 

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.699
and I thought to myself, 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.500
“Well, maybe I should be washing my hands with toothpaste.” 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.033
It’s like a hand soap. 

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.533
I’m being sarcastic, of course. 

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:44.833
But the purpose of this demo is to give you an idea of what the inside of your mouth feels like 

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.266
after you brush your teeth with these toothpastes, 

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.432
my least two favorite toothpastes. 

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:52.966
So, I’m going to grab this one. 

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.366
This one has triclosan in it. 

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.099
This has micro-beads in it. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.566
They both have sodium lauryl sulfate in it. 

00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.432
They’re emulsifiers.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.366
It leeches all the oils out of your skin whether it’s your mouth or hands. 

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.166
And I’m going to wash my hands with toothpaste. 

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.532
Here we go! 

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.666
I’m going to add a little water. 

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.932
It’s pretty sticky stuff. 

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.233
It’s going to be very hard to remove. 

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.699
But I want you to get it all over your hands. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.000
And again, this is an antibacterial. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm kind of... I mean, I'm trying my best.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.100
This is stuck in your mouth now. 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.433
The purpose of the demo is to give you an idea two or three hours down the road 

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.999
from having done this, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
you’re going to feel something very strange in your hands. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.333
And I want you to experience it for yourself. 

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.966
That's essentially what’s happening in your mouth. 

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.732
You’re not going to like it on your hands, so why would you use this in your mouth. 

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.066
Anyway, I did the best I could. 

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.033
It’s a very kind of a dry—

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.300
oh, it’s still not off. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.266
It’s a very dried out, yet kind of a film layer feeling on your hands. 

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.199
And the smell is a little overwhelming. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.133
And again, that will not go away for a while. 

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.799
It will be there for about two or three hours. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.633
So, try that at home. 

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:10.599
This gives you an idea of what these toothpastes do to your mouth. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.666
I don’t recommend it. 

00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:14.232
But I do recommend you try this, so you get an idea what this is like. 

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.266
Thanks for listening!
