00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:05.859
What's up, guys?

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:06.979
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.711
Another ATHLEAN Express tip for you.

00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:10.940
So, you want to workout at home.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.519
You want to train your legs.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.520
Maybe you don't have a squat rack, or maybe
you want to try to replicate the Hack Squat

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.740
Machine from the gym, or maybe you're just
looking for more options.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.630
Guys, I got you hooked up here.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.110
Basically what I have set up is a land mine
setup.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.110
Right.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.899
You take one bar, you stick it in the corner.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.630
You throw your plates on the end.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.060
Once we're here, guys, we put it up on our
shoulder.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.240
Because of the angle of the plate, you're
going to angle your body alignment with that.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.280
Now we're in a Hack Squat position.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000
We know that Hack Squat is great for hitting
our quads and getting our hips involved.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.710
But one of the things it doesn't do is really
target our glutes.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.070
Problem solved with this.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.399
We come down and then from here, guys, we
come and push up.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.010
We're almost in a bridge position as it is
so we can get great glute activation.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.690
So, we're down to the bottom, right here.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.040
Right, you can see the leg, everything working
all the way up to the top.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.040
Ok.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.409
So, down.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.740
All the way up to the top.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.951
Maybe that's not what you want to do.

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:17.630
You want to work on something a little bit
more athletic, then you want to get a single

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.590
leg version of this exercise.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.180
No problem.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:30.409
You pick it up, come up again, one plate,
and now we get in the same angle.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.439
Again we come down and then from here we lift
up, ok.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.010
Down with one leg, come and lift up and drive
the leg forward.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.480
Down, lift up and drive the leg forward.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.950
So again guys, you're not out of options just
because you don't have a squat rack at home.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.280
If you've got a barbell and you've got a corner
in your room, you can certainly create some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.490
squat variations.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.170
And that's what I want you to see guys, you're
never out of options here when you train with

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.170
ATHLEANX.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.250
As a matter of fact, you're never out of safe
options.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
Guys, I'm a trained physical therapist.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.129
I'm supposed to be able to come up with variations
that cover everybody.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.880
No matter what level of ability you're at
right now.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.780
And make sure I can take you to that next
level.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.760
That's exactly what we do in the ATHLEANX
Training Program.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.530
If you haven't already guys, head to ATHLEANX.COM
right now and get that yourself.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.730
Meantime guys, let me know if you keep liking
these quick tips, I'll keep making them.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.730
I'll see you guys back here in a couple days.
