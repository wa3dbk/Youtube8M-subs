00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.640
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to remove, inspect,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.950
and overhaul your vehicle's alternator. In
this step, we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.770
service procedure for replacing our brushes
and reloading our voltage regulator. Let me

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.240
turn the regulator over, and you'll see we
have two more screws. The screws that go into

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.670
the plastic only, are actually the bolts that
hold the brushes on. They have little slip

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.500
nuts here that slide down inside the plastic,
and are held in place. You're going to want

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.900
to be very careful when loosening these. They
are lefty-loosey, righty-tighty. If you over-tighten

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:52.240
them, they will break. Go ahead and remove
it right here.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:11.870
Just like so. Take and dump that out in my
hand. I'm going to set this on my magnetic

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:20.010
tray. And as you can see, we can slide our
brush out. Now, the nut is going to stay there,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.910
but it will drop out if you tip it over. So,
you're going to want to make sure to keep

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.030
an eye on that so your nut doesn't slip out
on you. Go ahead and put that guy back where

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:49.270
he goes, and remove the next retaining bolt.
Just like so, and slip my brush out, oops,

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.950
and set it aside, let's slip my nut back in,
just like so. What I'm going to do is take

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:06.380
the metal part of the brush and slip it down
between the retaining nut and the housing.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.810
From here I'm going to just go ahead and slip
this screw in there to hold it in place. Now,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.190
I'm going to run it down just a few threads.
We're going to be re-disassembling this here

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.500
shortly. On the other side, I'm going to take
and drop my nut back in, and slip it in in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.890
a similar fashion. Just like so. I'm also
going to spin that retaining nut in, a retaining

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.730
bolt, for that matter, just like so, just
a few threads until we get it loaded. Now

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.200
how you load the voltage regulator, we're
going to take a spring, they come with new

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.340
springs, drop it down inside. Take another
spring and drop it down inside, just like

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.380
so. Now the wire is going to take and loop
around down through here and slip inside,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.130
just like that. Once you have that in there,
we're going to take and slip a toothpick through

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.630
this hole here. Just like so. We're going
to take a small screwdriver and depress the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:24.880
brush until we can get our toothpick inside.
As you can see that there, we're using the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.270
toothpick to take and hold our brush down
in there. We're going to take and load the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.739
other side, this wire, and you can see there
is a slot, your wire is going to ride up and

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:53.680
down in that slot,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.190
just like so. Again we're going to take our
small screwdriver and compress that spring

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:10.120
and slide our toothpick through into position.
Just like that.
