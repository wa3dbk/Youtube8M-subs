Hello, and welcome to the Massachusetts Commission
for the Deaf and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.930
Hard of Hearing VLOG. I am Dianne Shearer,
and I'm the Director of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.660
Interpreter and CART Services here at the
Commission. This VLOG talks about

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.280
the new law called the Safe Driver Law, which
will go into effect this Thursday,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.680
September 30, 2010. We think it is important
that people be made aware of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:53.170
this new law. This law makes it illegal to
text while driving. Starting

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.789
September 30th, it is prohibited to do the
following things while driving: You

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.250
may not send or read text messages, send or
read e-mails, or check the Internet,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.090
no matter which type of device. You may not
send messages from your cell

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.420
phone, your pager, or your laptop. Adults
are still permitted to talk on the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.711
telephone using their cell phones.
Should you be stopped at a red light or a

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:38.630
stop sign, it is still prohibited to
use those devices. The reason for that is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.240
that you are still considered actively
driving, despite the fact that your car is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:54.040
at a stop sign or a red light.
If the police should catch you sending or

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.950
reading text messages or checking
the Internet, you will be fined $100 for the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.740
first offense. If you are caught for a
second time, it is $250 for the second offense.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.340
And for the third offense the fine
is $500.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.810
For junior operators under the age of 18,
they must follow the same laws

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.200
regarding texting, but in addition, junior
operators are not permitted to use cell

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.859
phones at all while driving, in addition to
not being able to send or read text

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.109
messages, send or read e-mails, and checking
the Internet. They may not do

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:40.909
any of those things. If a junior operator
is caught using those devices, the first

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:48.549
offense is a $100 fine and a 60-day license
revocation. They must also prove

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.650
that they have completed a class designated
by the Registry of Motor Vehicles to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.019
get their license back.
For junior operators, the second offense is

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:07.299
a $250 fine, with a license
revocation of 6 months or 180 days.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.700
For junior operators on a third offense, the
fine would be $500 with a one

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.310
year license revocation.
Governor Patrick signed Bill H7495 for the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:33.400
Safe Driving Bill on July 2nd of
2010, in order to prevent injuries and potentially

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:43.040
fatal accidents caused by
distracted drivers.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.120
United States State Transportation Secretary
has shown facts that indicate

00:03:49.120 --> 00:04:00.810
that since 2009, 5,474 people have died, and
484,000 people were injured by

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.049
accidents involving distracted drivers. We
need your help to spread the word to

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.029
your friends, and family members, and co-workers
to let them know about this

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:19.181
law.
Thank you, and we hope that you will all drive

00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:19.720
safely.
