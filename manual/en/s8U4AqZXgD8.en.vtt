00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.070
Help!

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.730
Global warming is killing you and me.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.370
But what is the main cause of global warming?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.330
What produces more greenhouse gas than

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.530
all the world’s transportation combined?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.230
Methane is 72 times and Nitrous oxide is 310 times

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.670
more potent than carbon dioxide.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.400
So who really is the world's largest producer

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.170
of these greenhouse gases?

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.070
What drives one-third of the world’s deforestation?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.100
The answer is: the meat industry.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.300
The survival of the the world is in our hands.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.770
Be veg. Go green. Save our planet.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.700
Dr. Robert Goodland, the co-author of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.600
the World Watch Institute report that traces

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.370
at least 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.930
to livestock raising

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.630
I just had some information just recently,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.000
that the new figures now indicate that at least half

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770
of the greenhouse gases that are up there now,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.330
not that 15 or 20%,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.470
at least half - and maybe considerably more -

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.170
are due to livestock production.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.330
Well I think one of the issues is that

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.530
this huge environmental impact that livestock have

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.730
is not well understood by the public.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.330
It's not generally known but

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.000
between 40 to 50 percents of all cereals

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.030
are not eaten by humans but by livestock.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.370
And for soy, that's about 75 percents.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.830
If you consider that it takes about 7 kg of grain,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.530
that's corn and soya bean,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.330
to just make 1 kg of beef,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.570
we are talking about hundreds and hundreds

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.930
of hectares of soy bean planted and former rainforests

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000
to provide meat.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.430
Like the life cycle of livestock,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.170
which may never see a meadow.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.830
Manufacturing meat faster than the animal

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.170
has become a daily routine.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.370
In these vast foodlots, trampled by millions of cattles,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.830
not a blade of grass grows.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.830
If you eat further down the food chain

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.230
rather than animals,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.700
which have produced many greenhouse gases,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.430
and use much energy in the process of growing that meat,

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.370
you can actually make a bigger contribution

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.570
in that way than just about anything.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.670
As we speak, the human population is increasing rapidly.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.470
We have to stop the current trend of meat-eating right now.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In order to stop Fluorocarbons release

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.800
from refrigeration of meat.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.630
Stop carbon dioxide release from transporting

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.230
the meat to the market,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.200
the slaugthering process

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.070
and transporting the animals to the slaughterhouses.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.970
Stop carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide release

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.430
from the animals and their wastes.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.270
Stop carbon dioxide release from ploughing, harvesting

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.500
and transporting the crops to feed the animals.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.770
Stop nitrous oxide release from the fertilizers used

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.130
for growing the crops.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.870
Stop carbon dioxide from the burning trees in the rainforests.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.230
cleared to grow food for the animals and for animal grazing.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.370
And keep the rainforests to absorb the greenhouse gases

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.730
in the atmosphere.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.700
It's a win-win situation if you eat less meat.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.600
Living in harmony with the natural world

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.570
is the only way for the future,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.230
9 billion people,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.730
one planet, one chance to get it right.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.330
Go Veg, Be Green and Save our planet.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.770
This video is about us.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.870
We have the power.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.270
Because we can choose not to eat meat.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.900
While it takes decades to change our massive infrastructure

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.200
of cars and power plants,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.030
Going veg is something every person can do every day

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.800
to effectively combat global warming.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.700
Here are more reasons to go veg.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400
The Committee recognized that

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.430
the H1N1 pandemic is unstoppable.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.370
According to the World Health Organization,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.970
the 2009 swine flu pandemic is the fastest ever

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.400
spreading pandemic in history,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.600
with millions today likely to be infected.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.700
It developed in pigs, mutated,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.870
and now it propagates among humans.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.970
Swine flu is far more prevalent in areas

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.570
with intensive pig production.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.070
Canadian agencies have seen a 99% correlation

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.930
between the number of pig factory farms and the total

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.400
number of human swine flu cases, per province.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.200
When we cram tens of thousands of animals

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.370
into these cramped filthy football field size sheds

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.770
to lie snout to snout atop their own waste,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.230
it's just a breeding ground for disease.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.630
The rate of hospitalization and fatality is also higher.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.230
In the Province of Manitoba,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.470
where there are 2.4 times as many pigs as humans,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.630
residents are 3 times likely to be hospitalized

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.970
and 3.7 times as likely to die from the swine flu

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.030
than the Canadian average.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.270
And animal cruelty.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.570
Think about it. Follow your logic and your heart.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.770
This is not uncommon.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.270
Sometimes they are still alive even after they have been bled.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.170
And they are well on their way down the assembly line

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.030
to be butchered.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.000
And by dumping struggling and dying steers

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.370
through metal chute, onto blood soaked floor,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.200
with their bleeding tubes and goblet dangling out.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.270
Others may be placed head first in tubes

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.970
to restrict their movement while they slowly bleed to death.
