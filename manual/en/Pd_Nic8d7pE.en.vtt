Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and we're going

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.940
to make party hats. Another very simple hat
to make out of construction paper is a Robin

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.480
Hood hat. The first thing you need is a full
size piece of construction paper, fold in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.199
half this way and then you're going to start
in the corner and you're going to make this

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.320
shape, because you want the hat and you want
the edge to fold up. So you're just going

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:42.960
to draw from this corner and curve it around
about to here and then come down. So you end

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:56.510
up like this. Then you just cut off the edge,
fold it up and then bring it around in back

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.260
and make it fit the head. You can make it
larger or smaller, bring the points together

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:14.330
in back and you have you're basic hat. Once
you've done that you can leave this pointed,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.540
you can push it in and fold it down, you can
create different, a different look for your

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.430
Robin Hood hat. I made this feather out of
construction paper and basically I just use

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:40.140
two pieces of paper, so I have four pieces
all together and I just cut out a feather

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:51.730
shape making sure that I kept the folded edge
in so that I had my stem. Cut it like this,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:02.140
cut out a feather shape
and then just cut slits. You donâ€™t want

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.090
to get too close to the stem because then
your feather will be weak. Once you've cut

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.140
slits all the way through, what you'll want
to do is lay a bead of glue on the inside

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.440
here and that will give your feather strength.
So lay a bead of glue down the middle, making

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.940
sure you don't get it on the sides because
you want your feathers to feather. Lay your

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.950
second feather inside your first feather and
let it dry and then fluff it up and then you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.770
just put in your hat where ever you want it
to be. And there you have it, a dashing hat

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.260
for your favorite Robin Hood.
