00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
So now we're here on the stairs, we took it
from the grass. We're still doing some plyometric

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
routines here. This one, were going to do
three, I'll show you three. The first one

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.559
is called double leg hops. The second one
is called single leg hops and the third one

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.240
is called lunges. Now double leg hops and
single leg hops is pretty much just simply

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:27.120
building strength in the legs, your power
in the legs. Your loading your leg to have

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.180
that momentum when you get on the track and
when your running on the track your using

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.200
a lot of speed and agility, but plyometrics
are simply to build power and to load your

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.640
legs and to build the muscle that's going
to take you through a good hurdle exercising

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.050
and ultimately competition. So the first one,
double leg hops. Simply your on the bottom

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.200
of the stairs, arms to the side, you load
up like a spring and you jump and as you jump

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.670
your arms come up with you. It's simply to
help you with balance so you don't fall over,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.460
okay. So double leg hops and you just keep
going, you don't stop and for single leg hops,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.159
single leg hops similar thing except your
on one leg. Same thing with your arms, range

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.330
of motion, up and you do one leg at time,
single leg. See you want to go all the way

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.061
up the flight of stairs one leg and then walk
it back down and then go up again with the

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:31.920
other leg. So as your first starting you might
not be able to make it all the way up, but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.320
as you get stronger your building up that
stamina, you should be able to make it all

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.970
the way the flight of stairs. With double
leg hops walk down, single leg left leg, single

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.009
leg right leg and then the last one that I
mentioned is called vertical lunge. So what

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.100
your doing is your going in a vertical motion
because the stairs are at an incline and your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.670
going to skip two stairs. If your six feet
tall you probably might be able to do three,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.799
but if your about average size person you
want to do about two steps and what your doing

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.149
is your simply building up the muscles in
your hamstrings and your quads are getting

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.960
a good stretch with the leg that's behind
you. So your simply opposite arm, opposite

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.340
leg again, up and you want to lift. You really
want to lift with the lead leg that's in front

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.060
of you, so that your quad is getting the maximum
amount of a workout going, okay. So again

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.790
down like this, up, down, up and as you can
see also my calves are even getting a good

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.121
workout in there too. So sometimes you go
to the gym and you have weights and you do

00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:46.680
those lunges, well this is in exchange for
weights as well your doing the vertical motion.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.489
You can get that maximum range of motion as
you go up and that will again transfer over

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.760
to the track when your running and your doing
your exercises. Okay, so that's double leg

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.150
hops, single leg hops and vertical lunge.
