00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.589
drive through any of the residence hall
parking lots on campus this week

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.460
It can be a little chaotic and you'll be
lucky to find an open parking space

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.800
It's just a crazy time. That's when you'll know

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.660
it's pretty busy we have a lot of
students moving out, summer break is near.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.579
it's an exciting time

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.690
there's alot of excitement.The students are excited to

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.710
have that academic year finally over
because all of the long hours and hard

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.700
work throughout the school year are
worth every minute

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.310
knowing this time of the year

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.910
is finally here you're running to get

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.000
everything set up to make sure  your parents
 have taken the day off to come get you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.130
not just for the students but
also for their families excited

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.250
obviously they are excited to see their student again, but before they go home, they have to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.190
pack up

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.140
and move out

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.920
it depends on how much

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.720
you came with to school

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.150
I definitely try to keep that in mind at the beginning of the semester.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.530
Because once saturday rolls around everyone

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.439
must be out a lot of those students are
taking to that last minute

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.680
and all of a sudden it gets to be two
forty five and they still have all their

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.450
stuff in their room so it's not uncommon
to see a last minute rush

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.659
they think oh, I've got

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.859
just a small room and so they plan for
an hour or two.. packing up and then all

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.579
of a sudden it takes three or four hours
and the sea of cars s_u_v_'s and

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.870
pickups

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.820
packed to the max try to fit too much and a
little car or

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.680
you know not having a moving van early
enough all sights and sounds of a week

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.230
for moving thousands of students out

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.119
we actually see some students get a
full-size u-haul are bonded truck that

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.419
they fill that whole thing up with 3 or 4 other people. But thanks to Iowa State's

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:48.139
Save program it's a great
opportunity for some of our students to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.989
recycle some of the clothing some
of their furniture items

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.959
some of those other things that
they may have picked up along the way so

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.509
that students and parents don't have to
lug on but unwanted stuff back home and

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.049
I dropped off a few

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.780
shirts that I was going to get rid of

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.759
I figure it was an awesome way to get it off my hands. With more than a dozen

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.930
collection sites across campus there are
a lot of different things that are

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.539
donated we get food

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.090
we've had couches um... we have water
bottles

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.390
whatever they want to donate as long as
it's not going into a dumpster we will find

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.590
some way to put it to use. it's really a
great opportunity for them to give back

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.250
to the community with some of their
gently used items not only helping those

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.209
in need

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.329
but also lightening the load for the
trip back home it's all about being a little more

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.860
sustainable more conservative with their
kids

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.890
and giving students an opportunity to give back

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.889
because leaving stuff behind in your dorm

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.199
isn't an option we have conferences all
summer and will start ah... basically

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.549
as early as next week is that's
essentially what we have to get the

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.989
students out in a timely manner

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.389
We have a lot of conferences come in, football camps,

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.819
various athletic camps. special
olympics will be here in the next couple

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.919
weeks out

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.309
uh... there's plenty of turnover in a
very quick time
