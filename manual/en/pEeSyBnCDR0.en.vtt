00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.920
My name is Michelle Dittrich and I'm a makeup
artist.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.059
I've done makeup on a lot of celebrities.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.740
Pam Anderson, Kanye West, Lenny Kravitz, Cynthia
Nixon.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.840
There's a big misconception that "I could
never do that look on the runway," and you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.050
absolutely can!

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.119
Everybody can, and you'll play to your best
attributes and I can show you how to do that.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.970
We've just finished the Taylor Swift Red Carpet
Ready lips, which are well defined and long

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.970
wearing.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.880
Now we're going to move on to her signature
eye and we're going to switch it from our

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.950
wedding/contour/photo eye.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.129
Right on top of what we already have on her
eyes I'm going to just blend out the color

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.460
with you know any clean brush that you have
you can kind of, as long as it's a little

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.870
bit fluffy.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.769
We're not going to remove what she has on
because it's going to work well; it's neutral.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.290
We're just going to blend it out more so it's
not so defined, because we're about to do

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.909
some serious black liner to cat..cat up the
Taylor Swift eye.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.270
So go ahead and close for me Delphine.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.670
And you don't have to really be very specific
about it.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.180
Just see how quickly because we did neutrals.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.590
It's a clean brush so it's kind of like wiping
it off and use like little circular motions

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.030
with a little bit of pressure and it blends
right out.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.360
Can you see the difference?

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.960
(Little circle motions...and brush on the
back of your hand) and now it just looks like

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.710
we have a very clean and neutral lid to work
with.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.110
So, the next step is going to be the black
cat liquid liner.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.190
She already has a dark brown liner to define
her lash line and fatten it up in photos that

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.810
we used for the wedding look, but now I'm
going to use the liquid black and really give

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.170
her a little cat Taylor look.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.580
So just with a, you know it could be a concealer
brush...I used a concealer brush before when

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.620
I was applying the mascara um to pull the
lid up to apply the mascara to the lash line,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.600
but now I'm going to go ahead and have Delphine
look all the way down and tilt her head all

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.720
the way up, and I'm going to use a black liquid
liner to create the Taylor Swift eye that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.410
she's known for.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.810
So we're going to go right over the brown...dark
brown, and we're going to do it a little bit

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.110
fatter, and like we did with the brown like
don't worry you don't have to do this in one

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.290
fail(sic) swoop, you're just going to do it
in dashes, so...and we're going to take it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.290
above.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.760
We're not just trying to fatten the lash line
at this point for photos, we're really doing

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.930
a look, and that means above and beyond.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.160
So when you're doing this in the mirror at
home do the same and see it's a little more

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
dramatic.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.610
We've just finished doing the black liner...liquid
liner, giving her cat eye effect, but I wanted

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.230
to show you a trick or tool that you could
use, say you didn't get the wing exactly perfect.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.090
Um, so I'm going to mess it up a little bit.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.480
So lets say you went a little bit too far
out, ok?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.080
You're like, "Oh no I went too far out that's
not cool, that's not cute at all" like um...

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.840
you're going to take a small either retractable
lip brush that I spoke of earlier or something

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.520
synthetic and small and we're going to use
some of the concealer to take away our liner,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520
ok?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.580
But we want to keep the liner defined, so
instead of using what I've used before to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.110
correct mistakes like on the eyelid or whatever
um like with a translucent powder or a tiny

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.420
bit of moisturizer we're going to use concealer
because it's black liner so we want to fix

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:29.770
it, so we're going to go draw the liner out
with the concealer ok?

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.160
You're going to wipe off your brush cos you're
going to maybe use it again.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.670
And then we're going to go with a clean q-tip
to remove the concealer that we just put on

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:48.580
but it's also going to pull off the black
liner, so that and you kind of have to twist

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.199
as you pull out (and you might have to do
a little bit more concealer) so that's why

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.979
we clean the concealer off ah...the concealer
brush off because if it doesn't remove it

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.889
in one do it one more time to get that smudge,
and use the other side of the clean q-tip,

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.090
and it should be pretty perfect.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.449
People are often afraid of makeup for the
mistake but it doesn't mean you have to re-do

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.199
it all, you can just fix it.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.571
Next, the other eye.

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:28.920
(so go ahead and look down)I'm gonna use my
brush to kind of get nice and... (close) we'll

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.030
go back at the end with the black liner to
really get that inner corner.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.950
Like I said we're really just going on top
of your brown liner that you had.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.539
(dashes...fattening up the dashes...)

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.490
And so there's the black liner.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.840
What we're going to just take in a little
bit into the corner is a black pencil because

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.169
the liquid liner can move around when you
get it inside of the eye a little bit.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.790
I've just finished with the black liner and
now I just want to go back with a little bit

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:06.979
of the pencil right into the inner corner
of the eye...ok so when you do this into the

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.340
mirror or whatever you're still going to tilt
your head back but you're going to like try

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.969
and tilt your head to the side too and get
into the mirror so you can get into the corner,

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:21.770
because what I'm going to have Delphine do
is down and over to the side and I'm going

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.319
to get right into the corner there.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:33.009
So now I'm going to have you look down and
over to this side while I get into this corner

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.280
of your eye, so there you go.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.599
It's pretty easy.

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:48.189
You just follow the natural line of your tear
duct, but use a pencil liner um just because

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.849
it's softer on your eye.

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.759
So that is basically how I would finish the
Taylor Swift look.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.529
It's already photo ready because of wedding
makeup that we applied earlier, and if you

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:06.590
didn't see that you can go back and watch
that, but it's the defined starlet, red carpet

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.479
ready, pretty, catty, but youthful look.

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.539
Taylor Swift!

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:14.599
Right here!

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:15.009
Delphine
