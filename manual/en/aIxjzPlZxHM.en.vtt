00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.290
Top 5 Stars That Put Our Sun To Shame

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:29.170
No. 5 - The Cold Shining Star
La Superba is a dying red giant about 710

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.340
light-years away from Earth. At around 2,400
degrees C, it is very cold for a red giant

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.470
star, and yet it shines with a brightness
that makes our Sun look like a mere nightlight,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.330
being over 4,400 times more luminous. This
brightness allows the red glow of La Superba

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.430
to be seen with the naked eye.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:59.070
No. 4 - The Diamond Star
There is a binary system, in which the bigger

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.780
star sucked away all of the other star's mass,
leaving only the core, making it more like

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.000
a planet than a star. It literally shines
bright like a diamond. It is incredibly dense

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.030
and heavy, which's composition appears to
be crystalline in nature, therefore it likely

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.570
resembles a giant diamond.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:26.590
No. 3 - The Most Massive Star
UY Scuti is a bright red supergiant, and it

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.080
is currently the leading candidate for being
the largest known star by radius and is also

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.550
one of the most luminous of its kind. It is
about 1700 times bigger than the Sun, and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.060
is about 1.2 billion km wide. If placed at
the center of the Solar System, the edge would

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.909
reach Jupiter, although the radius is not
known for certain and it could even reach

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:49.280
Saturn.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:02:00.430
No. 2 - The 
black hole's dinner
Scientists have discovered a star that is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.150
currently being devoured by a black hole over
a million times more massive than the Sun.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.950
This discovery occurred because scientists
noticed bright gamma-ray bursts that were

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.530
peculiar. They were brighter and moved more
rapidly than most other gamma rays they'd

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.030
seen. In fact, as the rays were approaching
the center of its galaxy, they were moving

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.780
at 99.5 percent the speed of light, which
had never been observed before.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:32.760
No. 1 - The Star that Stuttered
In 2007 a pulsar was discovered which rotates

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.270
at a rate of 200 revolutions per second. Such
big speeds cause immensely bright rays of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.730
light, known as pulses. However, back in 2009,
researchers noticed that the regular pulses

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.780
of light simply stopped. For a typical pulsar,
these shut downs happen regularly for a few

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.980
minutes at a time. However, this pulsar shut
off for one and a half years. Everyone declared

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.060
the star dead, but in 2011, the star started
pulsating again like nothing ever happened.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.030
No one is sure why the star turned off or
what caused it to turn back on.
