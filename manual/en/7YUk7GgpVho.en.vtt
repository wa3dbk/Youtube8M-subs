On your path to getting clear and clean one
of the things that you may be looking for

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.170
is a ionic foot bath. My name is Mark Brinson
doctor of Oriental medicine, physical medicine

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.430
and human performance specialist. Ionic foot
baths work on several different principles

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.570
that I'd like to kind of briefly go over with
you right now and where you can maybe get

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.009
these treatments. The feet for centuries have
been known that they can not only transfer

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.289
out of the body, but they can also transfer
certain things into the body. And with an

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
ionic cleansing foot bath what we are working
on is that particular principle by using very

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.040
warm water on the feet and also by adding
an electrical current to the water that's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.360
meant to draw things out from the feet. And
when I say things I am talking about toxins

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.310
that are located in the blood. The ionic foot
bath is kind of interesting, it's going to

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.750
cost you anywhere between thirty and sixty
dollars per treatment with ten treatments

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.390
being recommended and what you'll find that
once you go into the water it's going to be

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.600
nice and clear and after you know an hour,
thirty minutes to an hour in this ionic foot

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.540
bath, all of a sudden this water is going
to be tremendously dirty. What does happen

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.460
is over time like say on your third, fourth
and fifth you are going to notice that the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.740
color of the water gets much, much clearer.
But you'll never see it get very clear. There's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.780
always going to be a little bit of a coloration
to it. Particularly in the yellows and things

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.370
like that as it's cleansing the blood of different
toxic materials. Now some people may say that

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.570
if I were to stick anything organic in this
water and add the current into it that it's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.280
going to discolor the water and that to a
certain extent is true. But from what I've

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.740
seen personally the water is or the electric
current is pulling much more out then just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.300
oxidizing whatever organic substances are
in there. So I think that they can be a very

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.200
good addition to any type of cleansing program
that you may be undergoing. Make sure of course

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.960
that you are drinking plenty of water and
you are eating appropriate foods while you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
are doing this cleanse. My name is Mark Brinson
doctor of Oriental medicine, physical medicine

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.140
and human performance specialist wishing you
a happy, healthy and nurturing day.
