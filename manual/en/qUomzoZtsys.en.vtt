00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.952
- When it comes to quick and easy meals,

00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:03.754
few things beat the quesadilla.

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.320
All you need are two
tortillas, a little cheese,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.061
and the fixings of your fancy,

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.419
and you have a delicious dish
that's also great on the go.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.219
I'm going to show you my
classic breakfast quesadilla,

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.209
my pesto chicken quesadillas
that are great for lunch,

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:19.944
and my vegetarian black bean quesadillas

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:22.045
that are perfect for "Meatless Monday."

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:24.309
Now once you're done
watching this yummy video,

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.412

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:28.701
on Kin Community.

00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:31.458
I'm making another awesome quesadilla

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:33.276
that I think you guys are going to love.

00:00:33.276 --> 00:00:35.554
So be sure to head over and check it out.

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:38.872
Now let's get to our classic
breakfast quesadilla.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:41.754
What I love about these quesadillas

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:43.356
is that they can actually all be assembled

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:45.690
in advance during your Sunday meal prep.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.824
Then all you have to do is
heat them up in a frying pan

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:51.525
the morning of and you
can eat them on the run.

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:52.918
How convenient is that?

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:53.969
So for these quesadillas,

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.082
I am using some whole wheat tortillas.

00:00:56.082 --> 00:00:57.708
If you prefer to keep them gluten-free,

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.511
you could also use corn tortillas.

00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.077
Those would work just as well.

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:02.018
Now if you're going to be cooking

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:03.397
your quesadillas right away,

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:05.859
you can assemble them
entirely in your frying pan

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.601
and save yourself an extra dish.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.553
But if you plan on making

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:10.178
more than one quesadilla at a time,

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:12.792
I actually prefer baking
them to frying them,

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.021
because it makes the
process go a little faster.

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:17.460
I'm starting with my first
tortilla in my frying pan,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.742
and to that I'm going to
add a layer of cheese.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:21.883
Cheese is critical, because
it's really the glue

00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:23.835
that keeps your quesadillas together.

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:25.783
Next, I'm going to add some boiled eggs

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.780
that I've given a rough chop
to and some chopped ham.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.824
You can leave the ham out

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.682
if you prefer to keep these vegetarian.

00:01:31.682 --> 00:01:35.122
I am also going to add

00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:36.748
a little drizzle of hot sauce.

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:37.769
Now this is just me.

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:41.008
Some people are not into
the heat in the morning.

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:42.169
If you are not into hot sauce,

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:43.610
I highly recommend adding

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.844
a little drizzle of ranch dressing.

00:01:45.844 --> 00:01:48.920
That tastes absolutely
delicious in this dish as well.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.265
And we're going to finish this
off with some green onion,

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:55.002
'cause it's always good to have
some green in these things.

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:56.818
Then we need to finish it

00:01:56.818 --> 00:01:59.284
with the glue that holds it all together.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:00.858
More cheddar cheese.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.022
On goes my second tortilla,

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.275
and this baby is ready for the stovetop.

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.224
I'm going to cook it over medium-high heat

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:08.922
until it gets crispy on the bottom,

00:02:08.922 --> 00:02:11.499
and then very carefully
I'm going to flip it.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:13.845
It should only take between
30 seconds and a minute

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.365
for the other side of your
quesadilla to crisp up.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.547
Once they're done I simply
cut them with a pizza cutter,

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:20.277
and they are ready to eat.

00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:23.179
The perfect protein-packed
breakfast on the go.

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:27.152
And for lunch, I've got my
pesto chicken quesadillas.

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:29.763
This is a great way to use
up any leftover chicken

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.527
you have hanging out in the fridge.

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:34.046
So I've got my first tortilla in my pan,

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:35.138
and I'm just going to top it

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.149
with a layer of mozzarella cheese.

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.517
You could also do this
with goat cheese as well.

00:02:39.517 --> 00:02:41.015
That would be fantastic.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.036
Next, I've got some
chopped chicken in a bowl,

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:45.138
and to that I'm going to add some pesto.

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:46.975
Now you could totally
use store-bought here.

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:48.234
That would be fine.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:51.017
Or you could click on this
thumbnail and learn how to make

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:53.474
your very own pesto sauce from scratch.

00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:56.021
Trust me, there is nothing
like homemade pesto.

00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:56.998
It's delicious.

00:02:56.998 --> 00:02:58.204
We're just going to mix our chicken

00:02:58.204 --> 00:02:59.540
and our pesto together well

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.568
and then spread it
evenly over our tortilla.

00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:04.725
Next, we're going to add
even more yummy flavor

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.745
with some roasted red peppers

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.664
that I've just given a nice chop to.

00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:10.882
We're going to top this with
some more shredded mozzarella

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:14.101
and our second tortilla
and to the stove it goes.

00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:15.652
These are an excellent lunch option,

00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:17.426
because they will keep
you full till dinner.

00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:21.804
Finally, I'm going to
show you some vegetarian

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:24.022
black bean quesadillas
that are so flavorful

00:03:24.022 --> 00:03:25.824
you won't even miss the meat.

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:28.020
So I've got my whole wheat
tortilla in my frying pan,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.668
and I'm going to top it with
a layer of shredded cheddar.

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.062
In a bowl I've got some canned black beans

00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:33.875
that I've just rinsed and drained.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.707
I like to give my black beans a quick mash

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:37.471
before I put them in my quesadilla

00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:39.321
so they don't roll around.

00:03:39.321 --> 00:03:40.638
Once your black beans are mashed,

00:03:40.638 --> 00:03:42.235
into the quesadilla they go.

00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:45.161
Next, you can top them with
any sort of flavors you like.

00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.239
Today I'm using red bell pepper,

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.013
some canned corn, and
some chopped green onion.

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:52.300
I'm going to season these
with a little chili powder

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.739
and some hot sauce,
because that's how I roll.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.877
And I'm going to finish them off

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:57.537
with another layer of shredded cheddar

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.176
and my second tortilla.

00:03:59.176 --> 00:04:00.535
To the stove they go,
and all you need to do

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:03.462
is cook them until they're
crispy on both sides.

00:04:03.462 --> 00:04:05.997
These babies are delicious
just on their own,

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:09.336
or served with sour
cream, salsa or guacamole.

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:11.232
