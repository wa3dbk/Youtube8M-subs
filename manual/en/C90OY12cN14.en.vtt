00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:03.816
&gt;&gt; A cat from Jersey has been
given a new lease of life

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:06.386
after vets carried out
a pioneering operation

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:08.936
to give him a pair
of prosthetic limbs.

[ Music ]

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.176
&gt;&gt; The whole process
has made me sort

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.116
of re-evaluate how well I
could manage before and now

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.356
and it has been
just a profoundly

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.086
life-changing experience.

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:32.966
[ Music ]

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.476
&gt;&gt; My name is Gordon
Blunn and I am Professor

00:00:36.926 --> 00:00:39.316
of Bioengineering at UCL.

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:42.366
What we have done
is we have tried

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:45.496
to attach the external
prosthesis, the artificial arm

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:51.296
or leg, to the skeleton and
that has obvious advantages:

00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:54.416
it sort of transmits
the load through bone,

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:58.536
which is the natural way of
transmitting load in the body,

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:03.716
and it sort of alleviates
the rubbing

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.516
of the soft tissues
in the stump.

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:07.796
You don't need a
socket for example.

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:13.916
This is a lady that had her arm
blown off in the London bombings

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.946
and we inserted an ITAP
device, and this is her

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:20.136
with the projection
out through the skin,

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:24.906
which you see is fairly stable
after two years and you can see

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:27.676
that this is an artificial arm.

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:31.236
With the ITAP device, the part
of the implant that's stuck

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:37.296
into the bone projects through
the skin and the crucial part is

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:40.856
that you have to provide
an infectionÐfree seal.

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:45.566
So you don't want bacteria
getting along the skin interface

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:48.046
and causing an infection.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.596
&gt;&gt; It always occurred to me
that if you could attach a leg

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:53.836
without having to
have the socket,

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:56.906
then you overcome the
major disadvantages 

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.646
of conventional prosthetics.

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:06.276
It was limited by the fact
that the socket was very rigid

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:10.456
and if I walked too
far, I'd get sore bits

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:11.946
where the socket rubbed on me.

00:02:12.046 --> 00:02:14.376
It was also very
difficult to wear

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:18.616
in the heat 'cause I would sweat
and then the suction would break

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:21.436
down and the leg tended
to fall off occasionally.

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:24.656
There's the implant, which feels 
really warm 'cause

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:32.626
it sort of conducts the heat
out of me. It just slides on;

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:36.346
do up the end bolt;
remember to switch it on.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:37.716
And there, it's good to go.

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:44.766
&gt;&gt; We had a research programme
associated with ITAP here

00:02:45.296 --> 00:02:49.876
and we started to translate that
research work into human beings

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:52.806
for finger replacements
for patients

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:54.656
that had an amputated finger.

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:56.876
We then had connections

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.666
with Noel Fitzpatrick 
who then started

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.696
to use ITAP in dogs
and in cats.

00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:07.766
&gt;&gt; Until this time, the
technology to bond skin

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:10.826
to metal was very, very
difficult to imagine;

00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:14.576
now I would say we've pretty
much conquered the technique

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:17.376
of doing that and it
provides reliable results.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:23.896
&gt;&gt; Oscar was a cat who had his
back feet removed in a combine

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.596
and I think that without ITAP,

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:29.926
the cat would have
had to be put down.

00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:36.976
&gt;&gt; Roly, come on.

00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:39.226
&gt;&gt; I first realised
something was wrong with him

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:41.836
when he was lifting
his left hind leg

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:43.516
up as we were walking along.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:46.656
Although he didn't seem to be in
any pain, he was holding it up;

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.716
I knew there was
something wrong.

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:51.936
My vet did x-rays initially, but
they didn't show up anything,

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:56.746
so he was referred to Noel
who did CT scans

00:03:56.746 --> 00:04:00.106
and MRI scans which showed
up the osteosarcoma in the top

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.126
of the femur and the hip.

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:09.046
&gt;&gt; Seems to be doing well, Dennis.
&gt;&gt; Very well Noel, thanks, yeah.

00:04:09.546 --> 00:04:13.296
&gt;&gt; He had to have his
femur largely resected,

00:04:13.346 --> 00:04:15.806
so the upper part of
his thigh bone was cut

00:04:15.806 --> 00:04:17.866
out completely because
of cancer.

00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:20.276
What's unique about
Roly's procedure is

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.716
that he's the first dog
in the world that we know

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:27.766
of that's had tendons
reattached to a metal bone.

00:04:27.936 --> 00:04:32.106
&gt;&gt; One of the ways that bones
and joints move of course is

00:04:32.186 --> 00:04:35.426
through attachment of
muscles via the tendons,

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:39.266
and in an artificial piece of
metal, it's very difficult

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.826
to reattach those muscles
and tendons and it seems

00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:45.846
to have worked in
Roly's case.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:48.846
The proximal femural replacement
has been used extensively

00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:54.176
in humans to treat osteosarcoma,
bone cancer essentially,

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.856
but what we have never 
done is used porous metal

00:04:57.356 --> 00:05:00.876
to reattach the tendons
onto the implant,

00:05:01.286 --> 00:05:03.386
which is what we've done
with Roly, and that's

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:07.296
why Roly's operation was
quite pioneering. So in patients

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:12.696
that have a proximal femural
or a trans-radial amputation,

00:05:13.256 --> 00:05:18.016
you still have residual
nerves and what we want to do

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.626
in the future is to
couple up electrodes

00:05:21.626 --> 00:05:27.116
with those nerves internally
and transmit those signals

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:31.906
through a hard wire out to
an artificial prosthesis,

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:34.576
and in theory you would be able

00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:39.286
to control an artificial hand
using a thought process

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:42.756
in the brain.

00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:43.336
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about bionic limbs, 
as it were?

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:46.886
&gt;&gt; We're talking about bionic limbs, yeah.

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:52.066
And I think it's -- it may be,
you know, a few years away,

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:53.306
but I think it is doable.

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:58.886
&gt;&gt; Roly was walking again
within a couple of days.

00:05:59.536 --> 00:06:02.396
His recovery then was
over the next six months.

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:08.826
&gt;&gt; Roly has an excellent
life, runs around very happily

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:12.826
and would not be here if it
wasn't for that technology,

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:15.266
so I would say to people
who say, well, 

00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:17.996
why should you use that
technology?, well look him

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:20.386
in the eye and you
tell Dennis, his owner,

00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:23.276
to put him to sleep because
that wasn't necessary

00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:27.566
and Gordon's research
made this possible.

00:06:29.516 --> 00:06:34.076
[ Music ]

00:06:34.576 --> 00:06:38.796
&gt;&gt; He's getting more treats
and more fun out of life

00:06:38.896 --> 00:06:41.156
because he has only, in theory,

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:44.746
maybe he only has another six
months to go, so his quality

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:46.016
of life now is much better.

00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:48.916
We do more now than we did
before because I'm trying

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:51.716
to cram in what we would maybe
be doing over three

00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:53.956
or four years into
the next six months.
