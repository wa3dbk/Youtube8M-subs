My name is Darin on behalf of Expert Village.
I am going to show you guys how to do the

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:14.460
Melbourne Shuffle. Alright Arm Movement: This
is where the free form free style comes in

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.500
play. It can come into play with the shuffles
and the Ready man as well. Pretty much you

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.199
just had your own stuff to it. I guess I can
just show you a couple of things that I do

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.890
with my arm movements. When you are doing
the shuffle basically you just don't have

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.649
your hands staying in one spot, they just
look kind of sloppy. You have this sick style

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.309
of doing the shuffle and the Ready Man. That
looks very cool, but your other part isn't

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:55.510
moving. So what you got to do here is move
your arms out. So when you do the Ready Man

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:04.159
and the Shuffle. Just pop it out left and
right anyway you can. What I like to do is

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:13.509
a little liquid with it, just pop it. Or you
can pretty much do the elbows. Or with the

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.635
Ready man pretty much do the running. It's
pretty much free form just sees what you can

00:01:18.635 --> 00:01:27.570
do with it. Now in spins you make it cool
like a helicopter like this, like this, like

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.909
this, just it's just pretty much that you
can do with the running man an the shuffle.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.729
It's just all free style. So this, is just
a couple quick some of ideas that I do with

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.399
my hands moving when doing running man and
the shuffle.
