The Black Rocks are a popular cliff diving/jumping
area on Presque Isle, I grew up doing it as

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.020
a kid, I bring

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:22.519
my kids there, so its just kind of a place
that geographically captured a little bit

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.689
of Marquette's adventurous

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.869
spirit

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.419
you're gonna jump 17 feet into icy cold water,
you better muster up a little bit cause its

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.500
not gonna be easy

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.030
and you're gonna get a little shock, so we
kinda felt that thats somewhat of an embodiment

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.030
of what we are

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
you know, it represents Marquette in a way
that people are like, oh yeah, I know Black

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.260
Rocks, well now they

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.050
know both

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.590
you know I think we're serious, don't get
me wrong, but we're also kind of done with

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.590
being serious, you know

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.980
we were in corporate world for a long time
we wanted to be able to be whimsical if we

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.980
wanted and we wanted to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.960
be able to be light but make a quality product,
and so I think it kind of developed both as

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.820
a culture in the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.050
pub as a cool place to be, a good place to
hang out and meet people, I mean we have people

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.640
that have met and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.940
fallen in love, gotten engaged, gotten married,
we have people that became friends because

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.650
of their interaction

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330
and its cool cause we don't have to do all
the thinking now because we have a lot of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.260
other fun, creative people

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.390
that are involved with Black Rocks and make
it what it is

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.030
I think if we just have that atmosphere where
you know we keep it open and people can feel

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.030
that and they can

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.152
come in from anywhere and say, you know this
would be really cool if you guys did this,

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:45.152
hmm, not a bad idea

00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:55.630
its really hard to put a name on it, its really
just kinda, fun
