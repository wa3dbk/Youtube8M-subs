Hi.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
I'm Jennifer from Workroom Social.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.380
Now, let's talk about stitching.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.940
So, once your machine is already set up and
you want to start sewing, this is what you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.940
do.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.460
We're going to do a straight stitch right
now.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200
We're going to start with a basic stitch length.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.220
We're going to go 2.5 on the stitch length.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.680
We've got a pretty low, low-ish tension, between
a 3 and a 4, just for what I'm doing here.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.930
And I want to sew this fabric in half so that
one side is touching the other.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.860
So, I'm just going to make the raw edges touch.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.030
I'm going to lift my presser foot and put
my fabric underneath.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.770
I'm going to line the raw edge with the seam
guide on my throat plate at five-eighths of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.880
an inch, five-eighths of an inch seeam allowance,
which is very common for home sewing projects.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.240
I'm going to lower the presser foot.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880
Make sure everything is straight.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.310
And then, I'm going to sew a straight line.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.630
So, the best thing to do while you're doing
this is you want to hold the fabric.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.610
Your fabric's to the left and you're using
your seam guide to your right.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.930
You want to just let the feed dogs, which
are the little teeth that sit underneath the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.040
presser foot, you want to let them pull the
fabric.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.330
You don't want to push.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.220
You don't want to pull from the backside.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.470
It's going to stretch your fabric and it's
really uncomfortable to do that, anyway.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.440
So, we're just going to go.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.080
Once we're all set up, we'll sew a straight
line.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:52.520
As you're going along, feel free to stop at
any point if something is going a little funny

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.810
or you're not sure if you're going exactly
straight or if you need to reposition the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.810
fabric.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.900
You don't have to sew your straight line all
at once.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.160
It's okay to take a break.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.529
You'll notice I'm not using pins here, so
I want to stop every once in a while and go

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:21.420
back and realign my fabric, making sure my
raw edges are together.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.659
When I got to the end, I just sewed off the
fabric, I'm going to pull my piece of fabric

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:38.459
out, cut my tails, and then here is our straight
stitch, parallel with our raw edge because

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.409
we used our seam guide.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.760
And now you're ready to make all kinds of
fun things.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.239
And that's how you do a straight stitch.
