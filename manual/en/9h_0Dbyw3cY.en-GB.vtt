00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.529
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's
game development log video diary, and this

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.919
week I started work on the attack editor tool.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.280
So the attack editor tool is going to allow
me to create and edit any attacks or animations

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.670
for the game, and it will allow me to add
visual effects, particle

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.160
effects and sound effects to them.
However, this week I spent most of my time

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.640
just planning out and setting up this attack
editor, so as you can see I haven't really

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.530
added many features to it quite yet,
but what I can do it I can open up an attack

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.500
file which loads the attack into the editor,
and then I can preview this attack in the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.429
test area
by pressing fire.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.789
This of course works with visual effects as
well, so if I open up the beam attack here

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.889
and I fire that, you can see that the visual
effects are all working

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:48.199
as expected.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.039
I also added this timeline slider here, which
allows you to take control of the attack,

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.030
and go through the animation at your own pace.
You

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.079
can also of course stop and change the camera
position whenever you want, allowing you to

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.189
see the attack frozen at any point in time.
And this looks

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.020
pretty cool with the beam attack, but it will
look even cooler net week when I have this

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.710
working with particle effects and explosions
and other things like

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.710
that.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.850
Back in the game I've been continuing my quest
to make the game look as appealing as possible

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.060
before the Kickstarter, and I added in a few
new models this

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.649
week. Firstly, I've pretty much finished off
the tavern model which is looking fairly monstrous

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.259
here, and next week I'm going to get started
with the

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.510
harbour area which is where these new houses
are going to be.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.899
I also made a bit of an attempt this week
to create some hand painted flower textures

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.631
for the game, and I wasn't too disappointed
with the results so I was

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.780
able to create some nice flowery areas in
the game. I'm also planning to optimise my

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.380
grass and plant rendering process soon, which
will hopefully allow

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.429
me to fill the whole world with a bit more
greenery.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.220
And seeing as I was adding some flowers into
the game this week, it seemed only logical

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.679
to also add in a few butterflies. So, I updated
my particle effect system a bit to allow a

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.360
particle to loop through the same texture
atlas multiple times in its lifetime, and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.700
that allowed me to
add these butterfly particle effects into

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.490
the world, meaning that I can have as few,
or as many butterflies as I want.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.650
Finally this week there is one new mob in
the game, which is this foxy looking character

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.670
here. Here's not quite finished yet, I still
need to do a bit more work

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.090
on the texturing and he needs a few more animations
such as some damage animations for when he

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.610
gets attacked, but he's looking pretty nice
so far.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.060
So that is unfortunately pretty much all I've
got to show you this week. As I said earlier

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.040
I spent most of this week just setting up
the attack editor

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.840
and getting the rendering engine to work with
it, but next week I should be able to add

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.870
in all of the features to the attack editor
and I'll also be

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.080
starting work on that new harbour area. A
big thanks of course to everyone whose models,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.390
textures or animations were shown in this
video, and if anyone else would like to involved

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.190
by making content for the game then please
do send me an email. You can see more updates

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.480
of what I'm getting up to during the week
by following any of my social media pages,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.200
all of the links are in the description below,
but yeah, thank you guys very much for watching

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.450

have a fantastic week,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.140
