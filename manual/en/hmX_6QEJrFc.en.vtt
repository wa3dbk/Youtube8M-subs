00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.309
This video will contain spoilers for Dark
Disciple.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.510
Asajj Ventress was born into Mother Talzin’s
clan of Dathomirian Nightsisters.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.980
As an infant, she was taken from her sisters
and forced into slavery by the pirate Hal’Sted.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.640
Hal’Sted was murdered on the planet Rattatak,
and Asajj’s Force-sensitivity was discovered

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.050
there by stranded Jedi Ky Narec.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.000
He took her as his Padawan, and together they
protected the residents of Rattatak from pirates.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
Narec was eventually killed by marauding Weequay.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.950
Consumed with grief, Asajj took her vengeance,
and gave herself over to the Dark side.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.020
Her power was noticed by Count Dooku, who
took her as his Sith apprentice.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.120
But he held back the full breadth of his knowledge,
instead using Ventress as an assassin until

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.680
his own master, Darth Sidious, demanded she
be killed.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.740
She escaped Dooku’s attack, and made her
way back to Dathomir.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.020
She and Mother Talzin made multiple failed
attempts on Dooku’s life.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.810
On the day that Asajj was baptized as a Nightsister,
Dooku attacked the clan, and killed all of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.950
her sisters but Talzin.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.579
Broken, Asajj chose the life of a bounty hunter.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.100
It was on one of her jobs that she was approached
by Jedi Master Quinlan Vos, who revealed that

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.530
despite her former Sith affiliation, the Jedi
Council requested that the two join forces

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.790
to assassinate Dooku.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.959
She accepted, and fell in love with Vos during
their time together.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.200
During their final confrontation with the
Count, Ventress sacrificed her life to save

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740
Quinlan from a blast of Force lightning.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:02:02.669
Dooku escaped, and Quinlan took her body to
rest with her sisters on Dathomir.
