I want to thank you for visiting expertvillage.com.
Today we’re going to learn about some makeup

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.269
techniques and this is my beautiful model
Ana-Lucy Corona. Always, always, always this

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.300
is a basic rule: start with your dark color
first. Why you ask? Because the dark color,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.500
when you apply it in your contour, that’s
what’s going to give you the definition

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.519
and depth that you’re looking for. So I’m
going to use a brown, okay and I’m going

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.950
to lift up her eye right here. I’m going
to move it like that and I’m going to lift

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.249
it up. Now when I lift it up, you can see
the concave, her contour come through. Now

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:40.879
I’m not saying lift it all the way, just
be gentle and lift up and this will allow

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.019
you this area right here to apply your dark
color, and then when you release and open,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.359
open your eye, you can see the base. Now when
you open your eye and you look in the mirror,

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.989
I want you to be able to see this line. If
you are not able to see it…close your eye…

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:04.920
you did not go high enough when you applied.
Now if you notice I haven’t blended, I’ve

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:32.939
only done the contour. I kind of have a look
at my model make sure that I placed it where

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:44.520
I want to place it, and I do the same for
this side. I lift it up slightly and I’m

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.630
just applying the depth color. I have not
blended, don’t blend yet… okay, open…

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:03.630
and that’s kind of where I want the color.
I have not blended it yet. I take the same

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:19.800
brush and I’m cleaning it; you can use a
rag, a towel, you can use anything to remove

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.870
all the makeup on the brush, so now the brush
is cleaned. So what I want to do is I’m

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.739
going to blend I’m going to do the same
thing, I’m going to gently lift up her eye,

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.390
and I’m blending that contour line so it’s
a very soft pretty smoky look. Now remember

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.050
we’ve only applied the base lid eye shadow
color and her dark contour color and look

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.810
how pretty that looks once it’s blended.
And I’m going to do the same with the other

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.470
eye; and once you have a cream foundation
eye shadow beneath it, it makes your blending

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.680
much easier.
