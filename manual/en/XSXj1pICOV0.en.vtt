00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Champions playing dressup and some unbelievable animation videos on this week's Summoner Showcase!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.900
Summoners, It's me, Nika, and it's great to see you again!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.900
Luckily we also invited some AWESOME fan projects.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.900
So let's start it off with a taste of the melancholy?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.900
A dirge for her, the doubly dead, in that she died so young, and dressed the part is Funeral Dirge Morgana drawn by Apollo661.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.900
Not the most welcoming sight to see when approaching the afterlife I would think,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
but she is a support champion after all.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Oh, all that funeral stuff, lighten up already, wait I know the perfect way.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Cats, on the internet!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Or, in champion form!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.900
Seiren created catlike pictures of a whole bunch of champions, which makes themů waaait for it ... LoLCats.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
It's so meta!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
Sure, the joke is long overdue, but it's done way better than I expected!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.900
Unusual how well the cats suit certain champs too.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
Sona, lookin' at you.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.900
BeyondHorizons lets us know that it's time to rock.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900
It's subtly inspired by his favorite champion, Irelia.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.900
Not what you'd expect, huh?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
But when you think of Teemo, you definitely expect CUTE,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
and with Tuxette's plushie that's exactly what you get.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
He looks kinda flat and pillow-like, which is in no way a detriment, it makes him a lot easier to hug,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.900
or lay on if you're waiting for a friend to log on or something.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900
They take forever, but you can take a nap!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
Now, I've been enamored with this entry for ages.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Dark Coraline, thank you for sharing! School Uniform Katarina.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.900
wow, that's really all there is to say about THAT.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.900
But the Harpy Morgana is also a show-stealer!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900
Naturally, I have an affinity for harpies, don't you?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.900
That's all for this week, but don't forget to submit your own art!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.900
And remember to include your summoner name too.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
And remember... to.. uhhhhh...something about thumbsů

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900
OH oh, Click the Like button, before you forget!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.900
Until next time,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.900
Load time is nap time.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.900
We'll see you next week.
