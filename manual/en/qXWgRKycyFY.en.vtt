00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.940
Hi I'm Chris Wardlaw for CarGurus and
today we're going to talk about the pros

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.520
and cons

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.879
at the 2015 Infiniti QX60

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.930
this is a luxury crossover SUV

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.800
with seating for up to seven people
let's get right to it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.220
starting with the things that I really
like about the QX60

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.800
in the QX60 Infiniti employs a
3.5-liter V6 engine

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
now this is long been known to be a
refined and dependable power plant

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000
it makes 265 horsepower

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.580
which is sent to the front wheels are
all four wheels through a continuously

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.930
variable transmission

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.720
now before you think yourself eh CVT not
so interested

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.700
you should know that for 2015 infiniti
has made some software changes

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.200
that are designed to make the CVT a
little bit more natural and feel more

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.190
like a traditional

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.920
automatic in my opinion having spent a
week driving this vehicle

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120
the changes work

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.540
now when you get into
the QX sixty especially one that's loaded up with all the bells and
whistles like my test car is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.630
you're going to find a very comfortable
in classy cabin

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.690
these front seats are truly amazing in
terms of their comfort

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.659
you sit in them rather than upon them in
they're plush and supported at the same

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.280
time and this leather is nice

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.490
and smooth feels great looks terrific
plus you can get

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.250
ventilated front seats which are
fantastic on hot days

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.510
another great thing is that there's
nothing about this interior that screams

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.070
Nissan since this vehicles based on the
same platform as the pathfinder

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.280
would be easy for infinity to raid the
corporate parts bin but they don't do

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.750
that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.190
instead they use unique tones textures
and materials

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.910
this sober trim these chrome accents
this nice wood

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.160
all really comes together for a modern
and contemporary look and check this out

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.570
they are even buttons knobs

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
and a full row of radio station presets
here in my opinion not having to use

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.080
this

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.629
access the radio thats true luxury

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.360
now for the most part infiniti has done
a great job designing this vehicle for

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.340
families

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.849
one really neat feature is the fact that
you can move this section of the

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.890
second row seat out of the way

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.319
with a child seat installed so that
people can get back into the third row

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.860
seat

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.049
another nice thing is that the second row
seats slide forward back so you can

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.129
adjust them

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.989
to mix and match leg room or cargo room
as you see fit

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.030
now in addition to this
user-friendliness the QX60

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.170
is a crash test a rock star it gets a
5-star overall rating from the NHTSA

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.390
and it gets a Top Safety Pick rating
from the Insurance Institute for Highway

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.090
Safety

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.390
so we've covered 3 the things that I
really like about the QX60

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.940
what don't I like about it let's find
out

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.810
now one at the disappointing things about
the QX sixty is the real world fuel

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:10.459
economy

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.079
the EPA leads you to expect that my test
car will get

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.579
23 miles per gallon in combined driving
but on my test loop I actually got

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.530
18.9 miles per gallon and
I was using the econ mode

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.859
for much of the city driving and some
of the highway driving

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.880
now they use to offer a hybrid version
of this which would rectify that problem

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.340
but Infiniti has canceled it due to lack
of interest so

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.950
 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.860
I guess luxury SUV buyers really just
don't care about welcome

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.890
now before I said that the QX60

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.400
is designed for families and that's true
with one important exception

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.510
especially if you have teenage kids in
your household

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.300
their are no connectivity options in
this vehicle

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.260
you can't get wifi hotspot connectivity

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.950
through the Infinity in touch or the
Infiniti connection services

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.640
there are no USB quick charge ports
located back here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.040
there's not even a power outlet where
you can plug in a laptop computer

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.049
so if you buy QX60 even a fully loaded
one like this and you bring home and

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.100
you got teenagers

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.630
chances are they're going on mom dad
this new car kinda sucks

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.490
now one of the things that I really did
not like about driving the QX60

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.790
and I don't think this is going to
impact everybody is how

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.479
the steering feels around town at lower
speed is just fine

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.419
its on the highway where on center just
feels really

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.760
dull and lifeless and wooden when
you're going in a straight line and then

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.400
if you

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.510
bend the SUV into a freeway transition
ramp or your going over a couple a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.200
bridges

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.630
and it's on a curve section of highway
the steering this

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.060
almost fighting in resisting your input
like it really wants to return to center

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.800
and if the pavement's uneven and the
front and unloads

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.280
then the SUV just kinda feels unstable

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.380
it's not really especially with the
optional 20-inch wheels and tires that

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.330
are on my test vehicle

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.060
it just feels that way so if infinity is
looking for suggestions for improvement

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.910
I would say

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.130
go check out what Cadillac is doing in
this regard because

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.400
they're getting the tuning right

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.770
so at this point we've talked about a
major pros and cons of the Infiniti QX60

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.080
so what's the verdict should you go and
test drive this vehicle right away

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.460
is that a work in progress or should you
just cross it right after shopping list

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.750
I'd say you should go and test drive it
in part because there are so few

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.350
direct competitors to this vehicle and
I'm talking about true crossovers with

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.590
three rows of seats and seven passenger
seating

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.550
be sure to check my full report on this
vehicle on CarGurus.com

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.919
and thanks for watching
