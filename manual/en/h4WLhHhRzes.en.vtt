00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.875
(upbeat music)

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:03.990
(knocking)

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.087
- Oh my God, coming!

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:06.573
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.059
(screaming)

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.614
(indistinct greetings)

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.773
Bring your stuff in. How was your flight?

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:14.584
- It was fine, there was
this woman who brought this

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:16.186
like weird chicken sandwich on the plane

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:17.416
and I was just like, "Could you not?"

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:19.065
- Eww, gross, everyone's the worst.

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:19.844
Okay, it doesn't matter.

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:20.719
I have so much planned for us.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:21.271
We have that--

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:21.984
(phone ringing)

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:23.447
- Uh, just one quick sec,
I just wanna take this.

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:23.899
- Oh.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.055
- Hey babe!

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:26.611
Hey, I know, I just got to Ashley's house.

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.144
Yeah, no, it's so good to see her I know.

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:29.792
- Curt, get off the phone,
Jamie just got here.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.185
- Okay, I miss you too.

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:32.416
Alright baby, can I call you back later?

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:33.809
Okay cool, love you too, bye.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.506
(laughs)

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:34.993
Sorry. Sorry.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.224
- Aren't you the fancy married lady now?

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:38.415
"Okay baby, I'll call you back later."

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:39.000
(laughs)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.203
- Well, we can't all be free spirits.

00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:41.132
(laughs)

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:42.247
- Guess not.

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:43.500
Okay, let's go.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.090
What do you mean you
don't know where you were

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.204
when Beyonce's album dropped?

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:48.574
What are you, like an alien?

00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:51.105
- No, I guess I'm just
not really up on the news.

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:52.010
- Don't you check Twitter?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.055
- There's just so much on there.

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:54.588
Like, what do I care what some guy

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.772
from Arkansas had for lunch?

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:56.608
- Fair enough.

00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:58.280
- Besides Beyonce, like,
what's new with you?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.371
Are you dating anyone?

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.507
- Uh no, dating is dumb. I'm over it.

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:02.807
Also, how can you be eating that

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:03.968
cheeseburger right now?

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:04.781
It's huge.

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:06.522
- Okay, so you leave Texas and suddenly

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:07.846
you're like, too good for meat?

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:09.494
The next thing you're gonna
tell me you're a vegetarian.

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:11.956
- I am doing hashtag
Beyonce's 27 days vegan,

00:01:11.956 --> 00:01:13.633
so technically, yes I am.

00:01:15.103 --> 00:01:16.719
It's not that I don't like Texas anymore,

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.059
it's just that I'm different now.

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:19.398
- Yeah, but how much longer do you think

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:20.652
you're gonna be out here?

00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:22.696
Like, I thought we were
both gonna get married

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:24.112
and buy houses in Austin.

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:25.459
Do you not wanna do that anymore?

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:26.457
- I don't know, Jamie.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:28.477
Oprah Winfrey didn't start
the fucking Oprah Winfrey Show

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:30.079
until she was 32.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.170
I feel like I have some time.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749
- I see someone learned the F-word

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.910
while they were in the city.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.002
- Are you serious?

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.743
- Sorry, it's just been a really long day.

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:38.461
Let's, let's just go back to your place

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:40.435
and we can go to that bar you've
been talking about tonight.

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:41.642
- The Leaky Whale?

00:01:41.642 --> 00:01:42.223
- Sure.

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:43.407
- That's gross. You're
probably gonna hate it.

00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:44.475
I don't know.

00:01:44.475 --> 00:01:45.613
(laughs)

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:48.561
(techno music)

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:51.371
(laughter)

00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:53.144
- Remember that time
that Brent spilled coffee

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:54.490
all over his desk?

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.791
(laughter)

00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:56.766
Oh my god!

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.368
- Or, how 'bout the time
that he thought wasabi

00:01:58.368 --> 00:01:59.598
was a Japanese desert--

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:00.202
- [Woman] Oh my god!

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:01.177
- ate the whole thing.

00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:02.594
- And his face got all
white and he was like--

00:02:02.594 --> 00:02:03.708
- Hey you guys, what about that time

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:04.707
we're at the birthday party

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.727
and Brent got in the
trampoline and broke it.

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:07.354
(laughter)

00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:08.329
- [Woman] That was so bad.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:08.927
(laughter)

00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:11.256
- Um, it's actually getting kind of late.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.487
Um, do you wanna, do you wanna go?

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:15.854
- Oh, um, yeah. Totally, yeah. Okay.

00:02:15.854 --> 00:02:17.131
- Um, hey guys.

00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.176
I think we're gonna go

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.662
'cause it's getting kind of late.

00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:20.567
- Oh, really?

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:22.285
- [Jamie] It was really nice
to meet you guys, though.

00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:23.469
- Yeah, so nice meeting you.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.538
- [Ashley] Bye, guys!

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:25.652
- I'll call you guys.

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:26.771
- [Woman] Bye, text us.

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:27.432
(inaudible)

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:30.324
(crickets chirping)

00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:33.500
- That was fun.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.588
- Yeah, definitely.

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:38.224
- You know, that story
about your friend Brent,

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.487
it reminded me of that time at summer camp

00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:43.647
when we broke onto the ropes course

00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:44.527
in the middle of the night.

00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:44.969
(laughs)

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.645
- Oh my god!

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:47.060
And we climbed to the top of the platforms

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.012
so we could jump on the trampoline.

00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:49.829
- Yeah, I still can't
believe that I broke my leg.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.523
Like, you jumped, I was trying save like--

00:02:52.523 --> 00:02:54.334
- Well that's what you
get for being a chicken.

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:54.853
- I know!

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:55.456
- You should have jumped with me.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:57.732
Your face was like, "Awwwww!"

00:02:57.732 --> 00:02:59.394
(laughs, snorts)

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:01.707
- Oh my god, so stupid.

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:02.994
- Oh, god!

00:03:02.994 --> 00:03:04.045
(laughs)

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:05.297
- Good times.

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.495
- I completely forgot about that.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:10.235
God.

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:12.752
(birds chirping)

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:13.805
- Thanks so much for coming.

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:14.943
It was so good seeing you.

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:16.336
- It was so fun. Thank you.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:18.893
- We should, um, Skype
or FaceTime more often.

00:03:18.893 --> 00:03:19.821
- Yes, no. Absolutely.

00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:20.488
- Totally.

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:21.514
- Awesome.

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:22.091
- Bye girl.

00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.791
- Take care.

00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:24.718
- Okay. Let's get you in here.

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:25.629
- Oh, cat bag.

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.227
- Cat bag.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:27.388
- [Ashley] Have a good flight!

00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:29.292
- [Jamie] Sure, sure. Bye!

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.124
- [Ashley] Bye Jamie!

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:31.330
(car door shuts)

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.640
(birds chirping)

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.470
(light street noise)

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.120
(birds chirping)

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.460
(light footsteps)

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.544
(pensive music)
