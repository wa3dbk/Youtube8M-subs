Come on in. This is my lovely bed, this is all from Pottery Barn I love this comfy sheets they're so cool.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.090
My mom hand painted my wall.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.180
This is my little mirrors that my mom put on for me they are also from Pottery Barn 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.030
I think they are really cool because they look like polka dots 3d popping out.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.180
and these are my lovely curtains they match my room. Very cool.
Really cute yes.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.150
and this I love to do my homework in, it folds out to put my feet on.
Very very comfortable. 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:01:01.140
and then these that one and this one the little penguin I hand painted
when I was at camping and this one I put all my money in.  Don't tell my parents

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.040
And my mother hand made this thing for me to put my stuff on.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:20.060
and my mother bought me this calendar so I can keep like stuff, specials  for school then we have all this to put my pictures on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:34.070
I just got some new stuff in my closet that is kind of cool. This is my open wardrobe.  It's kind of cool because it has tons of flowing drawers
