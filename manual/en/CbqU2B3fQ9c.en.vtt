00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:02.037
- Hey guys, I'm Sara Lynn otherwise known

00:00:02.037 --> 00:00:03.814
as The Domestic Geek.

00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:05.470
Join me and my healthy food truck

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.448
as we hunt down unhealthy meals

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:10.225
in need of a mobile meal make over.

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.674
I'm on the hunt for my first
offender, wish me luck.

00:00:12.674 --> 00:00:16.198
(electronic music)

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:19.768
Can I talk to you for one second?

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:20.288
How are you?

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:21.406
- I'm doing great, how are you?

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.665
- I'm excellent, I'm excellent.

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:23.618
What are you eating there?

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:24.675
- Slice of pizza.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.583
- I do love some pizza.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:27.379
- What's going on?

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:29.532
- So I've a bit of a
strange proposition for you.

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:30.114
- Okay.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:31.653
- A block this way, I have a food truck,

00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:34.010
and what I'm doing is trying
to make people's meals

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.149
a little bit healthier.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.005
- All right.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:37.950
- You interested in something like that?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.288
- I'm very interested in being healthy.

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:40.935
- I love that you're
still eating the pizza

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.032
as we're talking.

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:42.953
Listen, what's your name?

00:00:42.953 --> 00:00:43.603
- John.

00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:45.957
- John? You have anywhere
to be for the 20 minutes?

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:47.418
- My barber shop's
right across the street.

00:00:47.418 --> 00:00:48.229
- Oh, is it really?

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.004
- Yes, it is.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.176
- You wanna participate?

00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:50.742
- All right, let's do it.

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:51.927
- Are you into it?
- I'm into it.

00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:52.489
- Love it.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.246
John, this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:56.973
Just sit tight, give me 10 minutes,

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.916
and I'm going to make you a believer.

00:00:58.916 --> 00:00:59.456
- Will do.

00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:01.860
- May not taste like pizza but
I bet you it's even better.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.599
All right, so it's clear
that John is a growing boy,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.248
he's going to need some protein,

00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:09.197
and a really delicious filling lunch.

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:13.213
Now I'm going to make for him
my Philly cheese quesadillas.

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:15.498
Now these are sort of a play
on a Philly Cheesesteak,

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:16.860
they can be made with chicken,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.105
they can be made with beef.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:19.219
Today I'm making it with the chicken

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.998
cause John actually
doesn't eat beef at all.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.111
We're gonna get this frying pan fired up,

00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.529
and once it's ready we
are going to heat up

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:29.820
some red onions,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.065
some nice green bell peppers.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:34.656
And a handful of mushrooms.

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:37.104
Philly cheese glory if you ask me.

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:39.190
Then I'm going to get some corn tortillas

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.887
and fire it up.

00:01:39.887 --> 00:01:42.159
Now, I prefer to use
corn tortillas over flour

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.970
because again they're totally gluten free,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.477
so they're great for everybody.

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:47.103
You can use flour if you prefer.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.870
Gonna get those going over here,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.297
give this a good toss.

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:54.166
Now the good news is our
chicken's already cooked.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.971
So it's not gonna take a
long time to get going.

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:58.579
And of course, you cannot make

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.399
Philly Cheese Quesadillas
without the cheese.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.834
I'm using some shredded provolone

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.586
because that's sort of classic
Philly Cheesesteak stuff.

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:07.891
But you can use whatever
kinda shredded cheese

00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:08.811
you have on hand.

00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:10.112
This isn't a fussy dish,

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:12.929
which is why I really love it so, so much

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.048
So, now that our veggies have
softened up a little bit,

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.564
we are going to add our chicken.

00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:18.583
What I like to do on a Sunday

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:19.586
is to roast a whole chicken,

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:20.694
and then shred it all up,

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:22.505
and I have tasty protein for me

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:24.171
for the next three or four days.

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:25.967
What I don't end up using, I just freeze.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:27.359
Now that we have all of our goodness

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.681
getting fired up over here,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.733
we're going to start building our flavor.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.172
What I'm adding is a little
bit of garlic powder,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.139
a teeny-tiny scoop of horseradish.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.095
When it comes to horseradish,

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:41.484
trust me a little goes a long way,

00:02:41.484 --> 00:02:42.709
be warned.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.705
Don't say I never told you.

00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.152
And to that, we are also
going to add some hot sauce.

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:48.667
Now, John says he can take the heat,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:49.999
so I'm gonna go for it.

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:53.506
We're just gonna add a little
bit of salt and pepper,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.642
and that's it.

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:56.444
This is going to be the
delicious filling of

00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:57.712
our quesadillas.

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:03.924
It smells so good in here.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:06.632
Now that my glorious
chicken mixture is ready,

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:09.978
I'm gonna bring it over to
my tortillas that have been

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:11.203
heating up beautifully.

00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:15.003
And then it's time to
add our provolone cheese.

00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:15.918
Now the cheese really

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:18.032
is the glue that holds
these quesadillas together,

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.475
so you can go for it,

00:03:19.475 --> 00:03:21.567
don't be afraid to add enough cheese

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.285
to make sure everything
sticks really well,

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:26.587
and you want to add cheese to both sides.

00:03:26.587 --> 00:03:28.778
Once that cheese is starting to melt,

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:33.072
we're going to add our amazing
Philly Cheesesteak filling.

00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:34.145
Pizza schmizza,

00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:37.742
I feel like I'm honestly
offering up a way better option.

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:40.266
Somedays eating healthy
feels like a chore,

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.071
today is not that day.

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.440
We are going to top these quesadillas

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.403
with just a little more cheese,

00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:47.579
and then once that's had a chance to melt,

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.768
we're going to top them with
our second round of tortillas,

00:03:50.768 --> 00:03:52.256
and then we will flip them.

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.085
Now it's important to flip these guys,

00:03:55.085 --> 00:03:57.813
make sure to get toasted
evenly on both sides,

00:03:57.813 --> 00:03:59.595
I love using this flat top grill.

00:03:59.595 --> 00:04:01.607
You probably don't have
a flat top grill at home,

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:02.856
neither do I.

00:04:02.856 --> 00:04:05.263
A frying pan will work
just as well for this.

00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:06.847
Or you can even put them on a sheet pan,

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.270
and bake them in the oven.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.951
And for three more awesome
quesadilla recipes,

00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:13.974

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:15.760
Because there's lots more deliciousness,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.113
just like this, there.

00:04:18.113 --> 00:04:19.757
These guys are almost ready.

00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:21.163
John are you holding up okay?

00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:22.193
- [John] Oh, I'm doing well.

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:22.707
- [Sara Lynn] All right.

00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:24.236
- I can't wait my mouth
is watering over here.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:25.345
- [Sara Lynn] Sit tight, it's just another

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:26.812
minute or two.
- All right.

00:04:27.918 --> 00:04:29.666
- And off these beauties come,

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:32.157
we're just going to quarter them,

00:04:32.157 --> 00:04:34.370
and they will be ready to eat.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.794
Do you see this ooey gooey goodness?

00:04:38.794 --> 00:04:40.612
Now, as far as I'm concerned,

00:04:40.612 --> 00:04:43.032
these are a masterpiece of flavor.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.361
Let's hope John thinks the same thing.

00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:49.058
All right my friend, I know
I stole your pizza from you.

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:50.712
- Oh, thank you. That looks delicious.

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:54.501
- But what I'm hoping is you
will enjoy this even more.

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:57.762
These are my Philly Cheese
Chicken Quesadillas.

00:04:57.762 --> 00:04:58.987
- Mmm.
- [Sara Lynn] All right?

00:04:58.987 --> 00:05:00.132
- All right.

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:01.884
- I hope you enjoy them.

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.055
Be careful.

00:05:04.597 --> 00:05:06.734
- Mmm, I love it.

00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:07.596
- [Sara Lynn] Was that good?

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:08.276
- I love it.

00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:09.302
- Better than pizza?

00:05:09.302 --> 00:05:10.328
- Way better, I love it.

00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:12.259
- I think so.
- [John] Mmm.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.026
- Is this something you
would like make for yourself?

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:15.943
It's super simple to put together.

00:05:15.943 --> 00:05:17.298
- Where can I get the recipe?

00:05:17.298 --> 00:05:19.954
- Oh, listen my friend, I
will give you the recipe.

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:21.185
Is there enough heat in there for you?

00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:22.664
I know you said you like the heat.

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:24.655
- I love it, it's nice and spicy.

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:27.066
I could use a little more
hot sauce but not a problem.

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:29.305
- [Sara Lynn] My man, I'm here for you.

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:30.364
- Oh, you came prepared.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:31.324
- [Sara Lynn] I got you.

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:34.135
- Oh, that's a lot.
- [Sara Lynn] Oh, see?

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:35.127
- That's a lot.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:38.559
- That's how I like to eat my quesadillas.

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:40.066
John, thank you so much for letting me

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.062
make you lunch, enjoy.

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:44.065
- Oh yeah, I will.

00:05:44.065 --> 00:05:45.091
- Amazing.

00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:46.749
