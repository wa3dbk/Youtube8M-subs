types of budgets. Tourists can check out the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.179
beauty and architecture of Le Suquet, with
its cobbled streets and breathtaking views,

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.200
or sit at street side tables and enjoy the
favoured hobby of people watching up and down

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890
the lovely marina.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.999
