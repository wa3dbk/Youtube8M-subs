Hi, my name's Rachel and I'm the owner of
a street fashion site, austinstylewatch.com,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.849
and I'm also a freelance style reporter, and
today we're going to talk about one way to

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.419
tie a scarf that's called a "ring knot". Whenever
I see the ring knot it kind of reminds me

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:20.090
of the way a Cub Scout or a Boy Scout's necklace
looks with the little ring emblem they have

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.860
that brings the two sides of the bandanna
together, so it's kind of a reminiscent look

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.060
and it's a really classic scarf tie. So what
you're going to do is start with your scarf,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.500
lay it out on the table, and bring the points
together in a big triangle. Now our goal here

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.780
is to make a long strip, so we're going to
take it from the middle and begin folding

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.751
inward until we have about a two inch long
strip. So you're going to take that, put it

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:54.230
behind our neck, we want one short end and
one long end, and the long end should be at

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:03.379
least six inches long. So we're going to take
that end and tie a knot in it, and then try

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:15.460
to bring that knot up so it's close by the
neck. Our next step is going to be able to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.610
take that short end and bring it through that
knot so that what we're getting is a ring

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.469
formed by that knot we tied that brings together
both ends and sort of looks like that Cub

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.090
Scout tie I was just talking about. So, that's
your ring knot. If you want to jazz it up

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.750
a little bit you can bring it up tight, take
it around your neck, bring the rest to the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:59.719
front, tie it in a little knot, and then hide
it with the other part. So this gives you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.850
a bit of a choker look rather than the Boy
Scout kind of ring knot. So this is how to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.810
tie a ring knot in a scarf!
