00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.440
We came from Murcia in Spain,
a very dry climate.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.240
It is almost 15Â° Celcius cooler here.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.560
And we didn't even realize it, because
this bike gear helps the body

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.080
to adjust itself to any kind of weather.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.400
We were very happy and pleasently surprised.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.720
It is cooler now and it is raining,
but I still feel warm.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.160
On the bike I certainly heated up
for a moment, but then...

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
I cooled down again pretty quickly.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.960
I would say I could use this gear just as
well in hotter as in cooler conditions.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.720
No matter when you wear it,
it never feels to hot, nor to cold.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.800
That is precisely what X-Bionic is about.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.360
To me it is important to not notice the gear
so I can really concentrate on my sport.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.760
It just feels so comfortable.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.360
And it does not cause any sores
nor any strange friction.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.240
In fact, even though it is close
fitting, you don't feel constricted

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.280
or limited in your movement.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.880
We really appreciated that.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.200
Surrounded by bike freaks, the trails
were great, too. Pretty hilly and challenging.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.880
I could definitely use up some performance.
