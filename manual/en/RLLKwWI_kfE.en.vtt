00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.030
Today we are going to be installing hitch
part number 24792 from Draw-Tite on a 2008

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.209
Honda CR-V. OK, we are underneath the vehicle
and we are going to go ahead and point out

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.959
the mounting locations for the trailer hitch.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.309
Over here on the drivers side frame rail you
can see the 1/8-inch hole.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.949
We are going to be using the 7/16 bolt-and-block
assembly to go up and through this position

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.420
and we will pull it back down into place.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.619
You can see the hole is a little bit small
for the block, so we will need to enlarge

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.220
it just a little bit so that we can get the
bolt-and-block assembly up into place.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.340
We do the same thing on the passengers side
as well.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.210
But, as you can see, on the passengers side
the exhaust is in the way.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.180
So the first thing we are going to need to
do is to go ahead and lower the exhaust off

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.180
of its hangers.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.861
We have got one here on the inboard side and
then one here on the outboard side.

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:50.609
For the center attaching point, you can see
we have got a tow loop here.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.019
That will be the center attaching point for
the trailer hitch.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.370
So the first thing we are going to do is go
ahead and lower the exhaust and get it out

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.679
of the way, and then we will enlarge the holes
in the frame to accommodate the bolt-and-block

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.679
assemblies.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.379
OK, to ease in the removal of the exhaust
off its hangers, it is a good idea to spray

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
them down with WD-40 or some form of spray
lubricant.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.840
Spray on each side of the studs, and that
will make the removal a lot easier.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:27.880
And pry the hanger off.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.220
To enlarge the holes, I am just going to use
a basic air chisel.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.660
If you do not have that, you can just use
a regular cold chisel at home, or anything

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.930
that you may have to enlarge the holes.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.509
And now we can get the block into place.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:53.900
So go ahead and feed the block onto the bolt
leader and then take the 7/16 bolt and wrap

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.299
the threads of the bolt with the bolt leader.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:09.350
We will take and feed the carriage bolts up
into place, followed by the block, and pull

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.820
that back down into position.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.560
We want to repeat that procedure for the other
side as well.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:36.940
OK, now that we have got both the bolts up
inside 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:03:21.940
the frame, we can go ahead and put the hitch
up into position.
