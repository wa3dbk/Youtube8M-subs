Welcome to twominenglish.com. Teaching you English through two-minute lessons.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.084
In this lesson you will learn how to talk about endangered animals.

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:20.455
Amelie, is the tiger skin in your house real?

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.708
Yeah, that’s real. My granny says it’s the skin of a Siberian tiger.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:36.511
Oh! The Siberian tigers are the largest living felids! Unfortunately 
 there are only a few hundred alive now.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.571
I know. My great-grandfather was a hunter and he 
 hunted it. I really wish he hadn’t.

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:48.913
Well, it’s not your fault. I’m sure you don’t like to hurt animals.

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:54.408
No Jack, I don’t. I love animals. I’m an animal rights activist in fact.

00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:58.161
Why do you still keep that skin in your house?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.526
I can’t help it. My parents think it’s a souvenir from their ancestor.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:15.039
I’ve never seen a real rhino. They look like dinosaurs, right?

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:24.144
No Amelie! Rhinos are mammals, dinosaurs were reptiles. Rhinos look like Rhinos.

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:29.354
Oh, I am sorry. I haven’t seen a dinosaur either.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.335
That’s because dinosaurs are extinct.

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.254
But we still have Rhinos around, don’t we?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.270
Yes, but very few. If it continues like that, they will become extinct too.

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:46.090
What’s happening to them?

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:52.010
People are cutting down the jungles, and hunting 
 them for their horns. It’s a shame.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:58.140
It’s terrible. When will human beings learn to be human?

00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:08.040
The blue whale is the largest creature on Earth.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.540
A blue whale is an incredibly large mammal! Its 
 tongue is as heavy as an elephant!

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.970
Wow! My granny used to say that we could even live inside its stomach.

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:24.440
Not really, Nina. That happens only in tales.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.710
Maybe. Well, I’ve heard that blue whales are dying.

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:32.220
Actually they are being murdered.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.080
Murdered? By whom?

00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:40.380
By greedy and cruel people who hunt them for their meat.

00:02:41.184 --> 00:02:42.160
That’s awful.

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.230
I’ve been thinking, Amelie.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.040
About what Nina?

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.550
How can I help stop animal cruelty?

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:01.920
Well, we are not the government, but there are some 
 things we can do to make a difference.

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:03.410
Like?

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:08.880
I don’t wear leather jackets or shoes. Nor do 
 I wear fur. I use synthetic alternatives.

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:13.380
That’s a great idea! I will do that too. Is there anything else?

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:20.140
Well, I talk to my friends and the people I know 
 about these issues. Just helping to spread the awareness.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:24.110
I know. You made me aware of the way we treat animals.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.930
If you can minimize your own impact on the lives of the animals, and also 
 ask your friends to do it, you’ll be making a great difference, Nina.

00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:35.220
Thanks, Amelie. I will remember that.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.570
The Siberian tigers are the largest living felids!

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:52.340
Unfortunately there are only a few hundred alive now.

00:03:57.983 --> 00:04:00.250
I’m an animal rights activist in fact.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.290
I’ve never seen a real rhino.

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:12.410
But we still have Rhinos around, don’t we?

00:04:16.158 --> 00:04:19.350
A blue whale is an incredibly large mammal!

00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:25.700
Well, I’ve heard that blue whales are dying.

00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:33.220
How can I help stop animal cruelty?

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.160
You made me aware of the way we treat animals.
