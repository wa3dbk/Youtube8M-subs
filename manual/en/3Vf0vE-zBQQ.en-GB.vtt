00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.175
SEMMI LIU: Okay.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:14.514
Now, it's almost 9:30 and I'm
ready for my chef school.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.083
Oh my gosh, say "hi".

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.552
Everyone get ready.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:23.557
Front of the house, as you
can see; we wear ties.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.993
We have an apron like this.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:31.265
We have our little leather
shoes and everything is pressed.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:37.404
What I learn at the Chefs'
House I think the most is

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.339
interact with people.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.142
The communication, teamwork.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.211
This is my dream team.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.579
This is my dream team.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.848
Look around.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.517
See this place?

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:56.023
See all this kitchen
and all these co-workers?

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.058
I mean the first-year students.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.427
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.762
How it prepare me?

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:04.231
Well, the people here.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.734
The environment here,
it's just -- just --

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.571
just too good to be true.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.473
Now we're ready to serve.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:14.875
Follow me.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.077
Hi there.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:17.511
MAN 1: Yes.

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.012
SEMMI LIU: Flank steak.

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.080
MAN 1: Oh wow.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.881
SEMMI LIU: With the
grilled vegetables

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.382
and a crispy polenta.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.150
MAN 1: Thank you.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.251
SEMMI LIU: Which is super tasty.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:26.253
MAN 1: It looks delicious,
thank you very much.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.254
SEMMI LIU: Thank
you very much.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.324
And sir, here's a
pan-seared trout with

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:33.994
a lentil at the bottom and
cauliflower purÃ©e.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:34.428
MAN 2: Excellent.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.395
Looks very nice.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.263
SEMMI LIU: Enjoy it.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.998
MAN 2: Thank you.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.973
SEMMI LIU: I plan to
work in hospitality to,

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:49.142
of course, to be the
manager and eventually,

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.812
I wish I could own
my own restaurant.

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:55.349
That's what I learn in the
Chefs' House and which is great.
