First we are going to make the butter mixture. Make sure that the butter is softened 
 - you can put it in the micrawave for 20 seconds to soften it.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:11.529
In a large bowl, cut the softened butter and sift the powdered sugar over it. Mix the butter and 
 sugar using a spatula or your hands. It may be easier to do it with your hands.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:18.988
Add the almond powder. Almond powder is just raw blanched almonds mixed 
 in a food processor until you get a fine texture. 

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:34.077
Add a pinch of salt. Whenever you are baking something sweet, add a bit 
 of salt as it highlights the sweet flavors. Mix all the ingredients. 

00:01:47.991 --> 00:02:07.830
I am flavoring the pate sucree with vanilla extract, but feel free to flavor it to your taste with spices 
 or other extracts. Add the vanilla extra to 1 large egg and lightly beat with a fork. 

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:13.990
Add the egg to the butter mixture. Mix using a spatula.

00:02:15.743 --> 00:02:30.070
Finally, sift the flour over all the ingredients. Mix all the ingredients together.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:49.280
It is important not to overmix the dough, otherwise it will shrink when baked. You just 
 need the ingredients to be well incorporate until it create a soft dough. 

00:02:49.284 --> 00:03:19.680
Wrap the dough with a plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for at least 1 hour. This will let the dough rest 
 so when we bake it, it does not shrink. You can actually make this dough 1-2 days in advance and bake it then. 

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:49.860
After cooling down the dough, we are going to shape it. You can use small individual molds 
 or a large one that usually comes in 2 pieces. I personally prefer the small ones.

00:03:58.497 --> 00:04:01.590
Butter the molds with a little bit of butter. 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:33.980
Sprinkle flour over your work station and rolling pin. Place the dough, and give it a 
 little tap with the rolling pin to flatten it. Then roll it (not too thin).

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:59.710
To transfer the dough into the modle, we are going to roll it over the rolling pin and place it in the mold. 
 However, it has a tendancy to break, so dont worry about it, you can just patch the pieces using your hands. 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:36.570
When you transfer the dough into the modle, run the rolling pin on the edges to cut the dough. Press the dough into the mold. 
 Add a bit of dough on the edges if they are not completely covering the mold, because they tend to shrink when baking. 

00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:39.600
Place the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes before baking. 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.830
Preheat your oven to 360 F degree (180 C).

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.080
Bake the dough for around 15 minutes until 
 it gets a golden brown color. 

00:06:54.232 --> 00:07:09.310
Remove the dough from the oven and let it rest on your kitchen counter before remove it form the mold. Let 
 the Pate Sucree cool down a bit and fill it up with custard, cream, top it with fruits, etc. 

00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:29.430
You can wrap the Pate Sucree with a plastic wrap then place it in a freezer bag. You can freeze 
 it for up to 2 months. You can just heat it up in the oven before using it.
