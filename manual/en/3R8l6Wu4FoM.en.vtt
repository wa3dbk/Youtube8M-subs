00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.790
cars.com auto review hi I'm Dave Thomas
with cars.com we're with the 2009 BMW 535i

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
sports wagon now it only comes with
all-wheel drive and only comes with one

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.220
engine and it's not for everyone

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.039
mainly because of its price we're going
to walk you through because it's a lot

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.420
of fun to drive

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.840
you're taking this car for a test drive
what's really going to win you over

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
is the engine so twin-turbo six-cylinder
it's good for 300 horsepower even though

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.439
there's a large wagon

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.370
there's a lot of acceleration going on
and the best part is it's really smooth

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.050
there's a price of entry for all the
performance the 535 wagon starts at

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.000
fifty-five thousand dollars the test we
have here equip the 74 thousand dollars

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.539
maybe even if you throw something
extravagant stuff i price it out to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.969
sixty-six thousand dollars just what you
need a comparable equipped out da six

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.109
wagon 61,000 dollars with everything
can't get higher than 61,000 dollars

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.559
you're going to pay a little bit more
for the BMW want to save somebody get

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.790
some luxury and wagon but what makes a
very nice one is called the xc70 for

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
about forty thousand dollars but let's
see what the BMW has and see if it's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.299
worth all that money now what someone
would expect from BMW is a high-quality

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.590
interior and the 535 does not disappoint
come standard things like leather

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
interior and very nice wood trim so when
you get in it it's going to feel like

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.110
55,000 other car you do get some
standard features for fifty-five

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.850
thousand dollars like you should

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.869
chief among them is a new version of I
drives controller so it's much easier to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100
use I Drive now the software in our test
car has been updated to the new i drive

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.610
software we assume you go buy one it
will be so check on that for sure but

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.560
the controller loan has been upgraded

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.939
there's also a standard panoramic
sunroof is gigantic terrific standard

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
feature not standard for these contour
seats we have their about twelve hundred

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.219
dollars but let me tell you it they are
terrific very comfortable i would not

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.140
skip out on these definitely the contour
seats but i would kind of pass up on our

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.670
tester has night vision

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.340
it lets you see stuff on the road you
wouldn't see with headlights kinda like

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.580
deer on winding roads that's actually
what it's built for when you're on these

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.180
dark desolate Road you'll see the deer
and hopefully not hit them and destroy

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.290
your 55,000

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.420
our chances are if you're buying a wagon
you probably have a family and small

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.629
children obviously will fit in the
backseat just fine but they should fit

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.150
just fine in any car as a 5-10 adult I
fit fine as well the driver's seat is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.810
exactly where i had when i was driving
you can see there's plenty of me room

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.220
my feet have plenty of room underneath
the front seat to shoulder and hip room

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.720
terrific and the seats are pretty
comfortable too if you have very young

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.900
children either the backseat is quite
room as well we have a standard size

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.150
child here in the center

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.720
I have plenty of room on the side of it
is easy to see could fill neither side

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.530
as well

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.419
the one nice thing about the fighters it
has some very nice latch connectors one

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:59.040
reason you get a wagon is Isley for the
cargo room and the utility of it and the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.370
5-series actually has a very sizable
cargo area about same as the audi also

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.419
very cool

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.010
retractable cargo cover usually these
aren't that interesting but it rises and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.329
falls with the liftgate so you need to
get in and get out you can very easily

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.870
grab all your stuff and then closes and
covers at all and you have to touch

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.620
anything

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.819
the BMW 5-series is definitely the
pinnacle of the wagon world that's

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.629
because it packs being performance a
high-quality interior and lots of tech

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.690
features that sounds good to you and you
don't mind the sticker price

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.690
you should go drive one because that
performance that will win you over

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.700
