G'day everyone, this is Dr Peter Price of
Classroom Professor.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.440
Welcome to this weekly video in the Free Math
Worksheet Series.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.010
Now before I get started on this particular
video, I want to put out a special welcome

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.150
to all the new subscribers.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.849
We had a trade show last weekend or I should
say "Education Expo" in Brisbane and we met

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.410
a whole lot of new teachers and we invited
them to join the list, so the number of teachers

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.589
watching this video and using these worksheets
has just about doubled this week.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.600
So we're very excited to have you on board
and a big welcome to you and of course welcome

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.160
to everybody else.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.830
So the strategy this week is "Doubles plus
1" this comes from our new e-Book called "Let's

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.830
Go!"

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.070
For Grade 1 or Year 2 students and it's from
the second book which is all about "Addition

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.230
strategies".

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.170
So the strategy double plus one is base of
course on knowing doubles and first thing

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.360
to say if a student didn't know the doubles
then stop and go back and revise those first,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.210
because this strategy relies on knowing those.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.710
So double plus 1 facts aren't that simple
and I'm starting from "6 +7", if you don't

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.190
have something to go back on, you know that's
going to be rather difficult.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.200
So we're basically going to say to the student
"Do you know what 6 + 6 is?"

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.880
And they'll say they know the answer "12",
and then we'll say, "What's 6 + 7?"

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.280
And the worksheets take that approach, so
they're not just random double plus 1 questions,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.470
but they're in pairs so we have a double first
and then the double plus 1 and so on.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.850
So with the ten frame, it's a fairly simple
matter to show the doubles they should be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.170
familiar with that pattern.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.960
In the case of sixes, in the case of all the
doubles, we're going to use everyday context,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.380
so for sixes we can talk about eggs being
packed in dozens and half dozens and tell

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.350
stories about that.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.690
And then of course we'll just put one and
say "How many are they now?"

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.979
Refer to the number fact 6 + 7.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.610
Later on the worksheets there are some turn
around and facts like that and so we can use

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.130
the same approach.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.291
One thing to say here 7 plus 6, you could
have a child say "Well I know 7 + 7 and I

00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:27.570
can take one away, so it is actually the same,
of course as a double, take away one".

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.591
I wouldn't teach both strategies I think that
would confuse the students giving them too

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.790
many choices, but it's certainly an option
if the students can do it.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.670
Okay that's it for this video, hope you've
enjoyed it, and I'll talk to you next time.
