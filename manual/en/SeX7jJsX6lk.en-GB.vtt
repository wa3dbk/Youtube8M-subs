Macro photography is often thought to require
specific equipment,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.710
most noticeably a macro lens.
And this is why many amateur photographers

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.640
would only consider getting close up
after they have a solid lens collection.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.640
However, the Nikon 40 millimetre f/2.8G AF-S
DX Micro-Nikkor lens shows that anyone can

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.860
become
a macro photographer, or as I like to say

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.059
a macrogropher.
First of all, this is actually a macro lens

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.030
- you're probably like duh of course it's
a macro

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.670
lens, it says macro on the box.
Well, what a lot of manufacturers actually

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.170
do is they call a lens macro just because
it is

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.170
able to focus at really close distances.
But, macro doesn't just mean you can focus

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.630
at a close distance, it also means
you get a one to one scale, and this is what

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.420
this lens offers.
So the first thing I like about this lens

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.390
is that it is a macro lens, well
yeah it's a bit weird, but I like the fact

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.870
that it has that one to one scale.
This is a true macro, this isn't a fake macro,

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.780
even though it has the capability to be more
than

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.060
a macro its macro features and capability
are really powerful.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.060
But, if you are into shooting (not literally)
moving macro or shooting insects (again not

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.830
literally)
or stuff that's moving at a very close range

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.479
it will be quite difficult with this lens
because

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.920
it's 40 millimetres you'll need to get to
close to the subject for it to work.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.360
If you take a picture of an insect, it's going
to fly away before you can get that shot.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.360
If you are into taking moving macros, then
perhaps the limited focal length of this lens

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.560
isn't going to be so good for you.
That 40 millimetre focal length: it's midway

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.560
between 35 and 50 millimetres, more so towards
the 35. And I think that this is a nice sweet

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.310
spot, you get some of the benefits of 50 millimetres
which is that more creative, limited style,

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.780
but you get some of the benefits of 35: the
more

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.780
versatility, the greater wide angle.
So the 40 millimetre focal length is a bit

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.150
odd, but I think that it's a really nice middle
ground

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.459
between 35 and 50.
However, this does also have its own problems

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.470
because at times it does feel like a bit of
a compromise:

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.870
you never have a 35, you never have a 50.
You're always in that middle so sometimes

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.239
it does feel too zoomed in and sometimes it
feels too wide.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.220
Now, I personally can live with that because
I personally like the 40 millimetre focal

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.099
length,
but you will notice at times when it feels

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.720
a bit odd.
This lens is at a phenomenal price point.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.120
I'm not going to mention pricing because it
changes all

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.780
the time, but this is such a good bang for
buck lens.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.280
And this is a really good lens for amateur
photographers and this is another reason why,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.170
not only
is it a macro and a normal prime lens, it's

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.879
also a really entry level lens.
But with all great things there are a few

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.739
issues and the real issue I see with this
lens is

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.970
that it has a cheap build.
It's kind of expected, you get a really good

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.269
piece of glass for less than ï¿½300 and it's
not going

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.640
to be built out of metal, but is does feel
quite cheap.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.620
I wouldn't mind paying a bit more if it did
feel a bit more premium, but certainly

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.580
I think the extra photographic benefits really
do outweigh the cheap feel of this lens.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.580
And... finally, this lens also has a really
good aperture range: it goes all the way from

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.340
f/22 which is
a really small aperture to f/2.8 which allows

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.340
you to get loads of light and get bokeh!
Again, this emphasises the versatility of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.470
this lens. You can use it for portraits and
at f/2.8 you're going to really nice blurred

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.470
background, and then you can go macro and
you can shoot at a lower f stop because when

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.690
you're really close to a subject the slight
changes in focus

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.560
are much larger. You have a lot less in focus,
basically.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.979
In summary, this lens offers a really good
one to one macro scale,

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.520
its 40 millimetre focal length is versatile
as it's midway between 35 and 50,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.520
it's at a great price
and it has a good f stop range, from f/2.8

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.080
to f/22.
However, it's not suitable for you moving

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.560
macro photographers as
the wide focal length requires you to get

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.020
quite close to your subject.
The focal length can feel like a compromise

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.449
at times and
the build is rather cheap.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.259
But, overall I think this is a really good
lens for someone looking into macro for the

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.850
first time.
