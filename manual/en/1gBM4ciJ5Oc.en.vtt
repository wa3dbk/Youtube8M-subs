00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.600
Since its 2003 debut, Starbucks's Pumpkin Spice
Latte has been served over 200 million times
even though nobody seems to know what's in it.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:31.600
When asked for nutritional details, Starbucks
said they are "unable to provide this level
of detail for every beverage customization."

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:40.600
Representatives instead refer to an official
"pumpkin sauce" available for purchase, but it
is not the same used by Starbucks baristas.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Stolen 63-ounce jugs of the real pumpkin spice
reportedly have an astringent chemical taste
and extensive use can cause headaches.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.600
Even the official "pumpkin sauce" may have
problems... it contains no pumpkin and uses
"Caramel Color Level IV," a known carcinogen.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Starbucks claims to support the welfare of
farmers in developing countries...

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.680
...but a 2005 fight with Ethiopia's coffee
growers revealed that Starbucks's socially
responsible image is only a marketing tactic.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.720
To protect the value of their unique coffees
(sold to Starbucks for only 2-3% of what
the company charged consumers)...

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.680
...Ethiopia sought to trademark its brands.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.680
During the application process, the country was
shocked to find that Starbucks had already
applied for their own trademarks on the names.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.680
If successful, Starbucks would have been able
to use the names on any coffee that they sold... 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.680
...cutting out the Ethiopian farmers they
claimed to support and depriving them
of $80 million annually.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:07.760
When first opening its doors in Seattle in
1971, Starbucks chose a curious corporate
mascot to sit at the center of its logo...

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:17.760
The original symbol featured a bare-breasted
siren with a mysterious twin fish-tail intended
to represent the nautical history of the city.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.760
Later marketing-friendly versions of the
logo eliminated the bare breasts and
obfuscated the siren's odd tail. 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.760
Conspiracy theorists believe that the changes
were made to hide Starbucks's true intent...

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.800
Rotated upside-down, the siren's out-of-place
tail appears more at home as the
horns of Baphomet...

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.760
...the Sabbatic Goat god worshiped by
the Knights Templar.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.760
...a possible allusion to Starbucks's
inspiration for global expansion and
financial domination. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.800
In 2012, Starbucks decided to boost the variety
of teas it offered by acquiring Teavana,
a specialty retailer of loose-leaf teas.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:14.800
With Starbucks spending $620 million on the
purchase, investors looked very closely at
Teavana and were shocked with what they found.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Lab tests of Teavana's most popular teas were
positive for pesticide residue, and despite
being labeled as such, none were "organic."

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.800
77% of the samples tested would have failed
European Union pesticide import standards, with
one variety containing 23 different pesticides.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Most concerning was the finding that 62% of the
teas showed traces of Endosulfan, a chemical
known to cause infertility and birth defects.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.800
Despite the concerns, Starbucks pushed
through the acquisition and proudly
serves Teavana teas today.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:05.880
Responding to growing community discontent over
its rapid global brand expansion, Starbucks
turned to opening "stealth" locations in 2009.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.880
15th Street Coffee and Tea and Roy Street
Coffee and Tea were both opened in Seattle
as secret de-branded Starbucks.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.880
Gone were the siren logo, green aprons, and
"tall, grande, and venti" designations â€“ all
replaced to portray the shops as independent.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:33.880
The stores were proclaimed to be laboratories
for new Starbucks concepts, but independent
coffee shop owners suspected a stealth attack.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:43.880
Starbucks's move to squeeze local businesses
came after their 2008 purchase of Clover, a
brewing machine used by many independent cafes.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.880
The equipment is no longer available for
purchase and owners of existing Clovers have
complained of deliberately slow service repairs.
