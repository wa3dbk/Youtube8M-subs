00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.730
Hi welcome back to Expert Village I'm Pete
Perata and now we get to get into our first

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.870
shuffle. This shuffle is called the corner
riffle shuffle. It is called the corner riffle

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.840
shuffle because it is the corners of the cards
that come into contact with each other, added

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.970
with there riffling sound of the cards as
you shuffle. In order to do a riffle shuffle

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.430
get you fingers on the corners of the deck
as I showed you before. With your thumbs at

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.840
the back and your middle or index fingers
 - either way whatever is more comfortable

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.980
with should be at the outside of the deck.
Once you have that down, split the top half

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.510
of the deck up, like this like you are making
a mouth. You want to split the top half of

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.720
the deck up and pull the two halves away,
making arcs with your hands like this. This

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.470
should line these two inside corners up, which
puts you in a position ready to do a riffle

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:09.000
shuffle. Once you have the pack place your
index fingers against the back of each pack.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.530
As you grab the inside and outside edges of
the packs with your middle finger and thumb.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.190
I can now apply pressure down on the middle
of the packs as I lift up with my middle finger

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.510
and thumb which allows me to push the cards
by springing them down face-down on the table.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.880
Notice just the corners alternating back and
forth as I execute the shuffle. Once both

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.600
packets are interlocked take the pack by the
outside corners and turn them so that the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:56.369
edges are now fully inserted into each other.
Now push the decks together with the palms

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.549
of your hands. Square the deck in front of
you and you have completed a corner riffle

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:03.609
shuffle.
