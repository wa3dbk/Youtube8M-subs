How to Roast a Perfect Chicken. Everybody
loves roast chicken. It’s probably the number

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.590
one comfort food out there. And you can take
comfort in knowing it’s incredibly easy

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.751
to make. You will need A 3- to 4-lb. chicken
4.0 carrots, peeled and cut into large pieces

00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:21.259
2.0 white onions, peeled and cut into quarters
1.0 head garlic, cloves peeled 0.25 lb butter,

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.649
softened Salt and pepper 0.25 c olive oil
0.5 lemon, cut in quarters 8.0 sprigs of thyme

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:37.260
A large roasting pan A cutting board A paring
knife and 3-ft. piece of butcher’s twine.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:51.190
Step 1. Heat your oven to 450º. Step 2. Rinse
the chicken. Make sure to remove the bag containing

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:01.989
the neck &amp;#38; intestines. Step 3. Make a
bed of vegetables. Dump the carrots, onions,

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:17.620
celery, and garlic onto the bottom of the
pan. Don’t dump the vegetables when you’re

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:28.670
done—use them to make a nice sauce. Step
4. Stuff the chicken with seasoning. Insert

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:42.530
the garlic, thyme, and lemon into the chicken.
Step 5. Season beneath the skin. Separate

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:57.750
the skin and insert butter and thyme. Step
6. Truss the chicken. Trussing a chicken not

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.140
only makes it tidier—it cooks more evenly,
too. Step 7. Season the chicken in the pan.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.341
Drizzle olive oil onto the chicken and then
sprinkle salt &amp;#38; pepper. Step 8. Put the

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.939
chicken in the oven. The oven should be set
at 450º. If it appears the chicken is getting

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.209
too much color, you should lower the temperature
a bit. Step 9. Remove the chicken after 45

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.320
minutes (for a 3 pound chicken). It may take
more or less time, depending on the size of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.530
the chicken. Step 10. Check the chicken. Gently
move one of the chicken’s legs. It should

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.230
feel loose and easy to pull off. You can also
use a knife to cut into the leg. Clear juices

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.719
should drain out of the meat. Did you know
A chicken once had its head cut off and survived,

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.329
headless, for over 18 months.
