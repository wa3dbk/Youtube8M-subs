00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.950
I am Marc Begijn, and I have worked for 30
years at Volvo Cars.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.110
Since 2006 I have been the plant maintenance
manager of Volvo Cars in Gent in Belgium.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.230
In 2013 I was nominated for Maintenance Manager
of the Year."

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.960
Volvo has built cars in Gent since 1965.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.219
Initially the objective was to gain access
to what was then called the European Economic

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.219
Union.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.989
Gradually Volvo Cars Gent became a cornerstone
of Volvo's industrial structure.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.539
Today, the Gent plant is the largest assembly
plant of Volvo Cars and builds more than half

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.129
of all Volvos.

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.929
Their activities include welding, painting
and final assembly.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.059
5,000 People work at Volvo Cars Gent.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.750
They build 250,000 cars annually.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.690
It is a highly efficient and flexible factory
that makes four models, both in the large

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.550
and compact range.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:23.120
Each minute, a Volvo V-40, S-60, or XC-60
is completed.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.710
These cars are exported to all the countries
in the world.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.940
To keep the high-tech equipment in optimal
condition, there is a lot of attention for

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.940
maintenance.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.610
That is a 'conditio sine qua non' (indispensable
condition) for good results in terms of quality

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.610
and efficiency.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:51.670
And that is exactly why Volvo Cars Gent won
several awards for Total Productive Maintenance

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680
(TPM).
