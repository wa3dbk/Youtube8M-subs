00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.840
Good Morning John. I think by now you know,
and the people who are watching this know,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.001
that I like funny stuff, and I like nerdy
stuff. And so today, I'm going to do a video

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.339
about funny, nerdy stuff. This is 31 jokes
for nerds.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:17.320
This is hilarious, and also true: if a pizza
has a radius 'z' and a depth 'a' that pizza's

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.840
volume can be defined Pi*z*z*a.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.410
Knock knock. Who's there? To. To who? No,
no, no. To whom.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.830
As my chemistry teacher always said, if you're
not part of the solution, you're part of the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.830
precipitate.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.260
Argon walks into a bar. The bartender says,
"We don't serve noble gasses here!" Argon

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.260
doesn't react.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.739
The past, the present, and the future all
walk into a bar at the same time. It was tense.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.230
How many computer programmers does it take
to screw in a lightbulb? Whoa, no, that's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.230
a hardware problem.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.699
I'll be honest, particle accelerators totally
give a hadron.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.920
Oh yeah? Well electro-negativity totally gives
me a permanent dipole.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.370
Humanities Major: "Hi, nice to meet you! What
do you do for a living?" CompSci Major: "I

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.969
work with Unix." Humanities Major: "Oh my
god! That's, that's horrible. We have to organize

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.730
some kind of rally to help those poor men!"

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.850
Eunichs/Unix. And now it is the time for some
nerdy pick up lines.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.860
Hey baby, if I were a particle and you were
a quantum potential, would you let me penetrate

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.140
your classically forbidden region?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.530
Baby, I wish I was your derivative so I could
lie tangent to your curves.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.430
Having been a chemistry major, I can assure
you that this is the only one that actually

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.750
works. Um. Hey, does this smell like chloroform?
Yeah, that might've gone too far.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.570
Hey baby, why don't we go back to my place
and I can show you the exponential growth

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.570
of my natural log?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.950
Nerdy pick up lines end here.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.950
Man walks into a bar and says to the bartender,
"Give me ten times the number of drinks everybody

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.479
in here is drinking." And the bartender says,
"Now that, my friend, is an order or magnitude."

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.000
How many ears does Spock have? Three. A left
ear, a right ear, and a final frontier.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.689
What do I have in common with neutrinos? Uh,
we're both constantly penetrating your mom.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.840
Even though, you know, your mom's so fat,
that her patronus is a cake.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350
And she's so ugly not even fluorine would
bond with her.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.650
Now you might think that the glass is half
full, and you might think that the glass is

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.369
half empty, but engineers know that the glass
is actually two times larger than it needs

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.369
to be.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.930
Politicians, on the hand, have assured me
that the glass would be more empty if the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.159
opposition were in charge.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.110
While surrealists think that the glass is
half of a slowly rotting lemon.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.070
And physicists, well they happen to know that
you can never know how much water is in the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.460
glass because just by measuring it you’ve
changed the outcome.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.420
How many Freudians does it take to change
a lightbulb? Two, one to screw in the lightbulb

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.400
and the other to hold the peni- the ladder,
THE LADDER!

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.620
René Descartes was drinking some beer in
a bar, and the bartender asked him, “Would

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.530
you like another?” and Rene Descartes said,
“I think not.” Wait no! Wait, ohhh noo…

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.070
The majority of people have an above average
number of legs. Think about it! It’s true.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.052
How did the constipated mathematician solve
his problem? He, uh, he just worked it out

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:35.052
with a pencil.

00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:37.510
A Higgs-Boson particle goes into a church
and the preacher says, “Higgs-Boson’s

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.410
aren’t allowed in here. You call yourself
the God particle; that’s sacrilegious! The

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.580
Higgs-Boson particle says, “If you don’t
allow Higgs-Boson particles, how do you have

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.580
mass?”

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.490
There are two types of people in the world:
those who can extrapolate from incomplete

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.490
data…

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.490
What do The Force and duct tape have in common?
Well, there’s a dark side and a light side,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.960
and they both hold the universe together.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.770
Heisenberg and Schrödinger are driving in
a car and they get pulled over. The police

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.990
officer asks, “Do you know how fast you
were going?” Heisenberg says, “Well, not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.820
really but I can tell you exactly where I
was.”

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.920
The officer thinks that this peculiar response
is grounds for a search, and he finds a dead

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.410
cat in the trunk, and he says, “Do you guys
know that there’s a dead cat in your trunk?”

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.630
and Schrodinger says, “Well, I do now!”

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.450
There you have it! 31 Jokes for nerds in less
than 4 minutes. John, I will see you on Friday.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.860
End screen! Please let me know what your favorite
joke was. They were numbered; you can just

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.670
leave the number, and if there are any that
you didn’t get, which is likely, please

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.560
ask in the comments. Probably somebody will
come along and let you know the nerdy thing

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.652
you do not know about. It’s all about self
improvement here at the Vlogbrothers, becoming

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.410
more nerdy every day of your life. That’s
actually a really good tag line!

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.420
And if you have any other jokes, nerdy or
otherwise, please leave them in the comments

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.800
because I do like making these videos, and
I do like stealing your jokes. And, of course,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.531
there are videos around. If you liked this
video, chances are you enjoy those as well.

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.810
DFTBA.
