00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:04.534
(lively piano music)

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:08.848
Voiceover: "I will not
make any more boring art."

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.652
Voiceover: "I will not
make any more boring art."

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.319
Voiceover: This is repeated,
over and over again,

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.155
down the length of a sheet of paper,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.390
and originally down the length of a wall,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.727
in column after column.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.665
Voiceover: Clearly, this is
like a schoolroom punishment.

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.901
"I will remember to do my homework,"

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.168
written over, and over, and over again.

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:32.616
Voiceover: We're talking
about a work of art

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.975
that was made by an artist
whose name is John Baldessari.

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.118
that was made in 1971,

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:42.450
first in the Nova Scotia
College of Art &amp; Design.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.117
Voiceover: This is basically
a form we already know.

00:00:45.117 --> 00:00:47.085
We know it as a schoolroom punishment.

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:51.034
How is it transformed into art?

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:52.533
Voiceover: Well, I think
that the idea that it was

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.827
in a gallery, that context was
really important to the artist.

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:59.430
He actually has spoken about
how he takes his word images

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.235
and makes them on canvas to give
them that frame of reference.

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:08.075
Yeah, this is different than if it
was on a blackboard in a school.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.007
Voiceover: Let's think about
the words for a second,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.201
because it's not, "I will
not speak out in class."

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.867
It's, "I will not make
any more boring art."

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.449
It's self-punishing.

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.751
He's looking at his career and saying,

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.951
"I made some bad art, and in the future,

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.034
"I'm not going to make any more bad art."

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.756
Voiceover: He had apparently
originally written the sentence

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:27.559
in his own private notebook.

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:29.201
That was the genesis of this.

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:31.033
I think it's important to understand this

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.116
within the broader context
of his early career.

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:37.767
Baldessari had been taught, I
think like so many art students,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.171
to create, in a kind of
abstract expression, a style.

00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:43.673
Voiceover: We're talking
here about Mark Rothko,

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:46.977
about Jackson Pollock,
artists who were making

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.582
what I think of as very
serious art in the 1950s.

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:52.033
Voiceover: Well, what this artist did,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.087
was in 1970, to gather
up all of the canvases

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:57.823
that he owned of his own work.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:01:59.057
These were abstractions.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:02:00.118
There were landscapes.

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:03.996
Then, together with some friends,
and some art students of his,

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:06.231
he brought them to a crematorium,

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.667
and he had them burned
like we burn bodies.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:12.618
Then, he took the ashes,
and he put them in an urn.

00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:17.143
This was a way of creating, I
think, a really [stark erupture]

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:21.602
in his career between this
older style and his mature,

00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:23.995
much more conceptually oriented work.

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.476
Voiceover: There is a way in
which art was painting still,

00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:29.309
even in the 1960s.

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.660
To make art, you paint it.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.946
In "I will not make any more boring
art," is labeling that as boring,

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.176
and saying "I'm going to do
something different going forward."

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:39.877
Voiceover: But, even
using the word "boring"

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:41.657
is hilarious and off limits.

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:42.490
Voiceover: It's true (laughs)

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.574
Voiceover: Because in
the serious nomenclature

00:02:44.574 --> 00:02:47.722
of the art world, you don't
use words like "boring."

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:50.654
There's a kind of directness
and a kind of humor

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:53.201
that's incorporated in this deep irony.

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:54.923
Voiceover: You can see that as an artist

00:02:54.923 --> 00:02:58.709
the real challenge would
be, what is interesting art?

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.506
What does it mean to
make art that's sincere,

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:04.313
and engaging, and clever, and new?

00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:06.840
Voiceover: It was also about the qualities

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.007
of new conceptual art.

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:11.421
If you think about, for
instance, the work that people,

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:14.456
like Sol Lewitt, there's
a kind of cool clarity,

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:16.674
which is also at the same time boring,

00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:18.627
although you're not allowed to say that.

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:21.531
So, there's something wonderfully ironic,

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:23.699
but also irreverent about this.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.699
(lively piano music)
