00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
What is up guys?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.830
Shizno here.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
Welcome to the third episode of my Elder Scrolls
Lore series.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.310
Last time we learned about the Aedra and the
Daedra and, as I promised, today we are going

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.439
to take some of them and learn a bit more
about the more interesting ones in detail.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.800
We will start of with the Nine Divnes.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.120
The Nine Divines is basically a group of Aedra
commonly worshiped across Tamriel by many

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.550
people of various races.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.600
Their names are:
Akatosh

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.570
Arkay
Dibella

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.100
Julianos
Kynareth

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
Mara
Stendarr

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.120
Talos/Tiber Septim
Zenithar

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.060
We are going to learn about two of them: Akatosh
and Talos.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.069
Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, is the chief
god of the pantheon.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.360
He is one of the two gods found in every Tamrielic
religion.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.910
Akatosh is often shown with two heads.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.070
One human head and one dragon head.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.150
He is also considered to be the god of time
and therefor is often portrayed with an hourglass.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.970
When the Ayeleids, a race of now extinct,
Daedra-worshiping elves, were actively enslaving

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.890
other men, Akatosh has used blood from his
own heart to close the gates to Oblivion.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.780
He then made a pact with Alessia, a rebelious
female human, that as long as her generations

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.810
were true to the blood of the Dragon he would
keep the gates to Oblivion closed.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.440
He than gave her tha Amulet of kings and created
the Eternal Dragonfires, which when lighted,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.420
would prevent the Daedra from entering the
mortal world.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.420
The fires would go out after the death of
every emperor and would have to be re-lit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.920
by the next emperor, who has to be of dragon
blood.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.009
The amulet was lost between the second and
the third era, but was later found by a dragonborn

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.890
called Tiber Septim, who became the new leader
of Cyrodil.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.379
His ultimate goal, however, was to unify all
of Tamriel, in which he succeeded and crowned

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.739
himself the first emperor of Tamriel.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:29.310
Tiber Septim lived for 108 years and is tought
to be the longest living man in Tamriel.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.440
After his death he became Talos, the god of
War and Governance.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.450
He joined the pantheon of the eight divines
and became the 9th divine, but his worship

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.069
was banned after the great war with the aldmeri
dominion.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.989
Apart from the Aedra there are also Daedra.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.330
The strongest Daedra are called Daedric Princes
and there are 16 of them.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.969
Today we are going to learn about 3 of those,
which are: Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal and Sheogorath.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:05.359
Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of destruction,
change, revolution, energy and ambition.

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.109
He is famous for his many attempts to invade
the mortal world and destroy it.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.459
For example, During the First Era he managed
to destroy an entire city, called Mournhold,

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.709
and devour all of its population.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.549
He also managed to enter the mortal world
in TES IV: Oblivion, by having the Cultists

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.359
of Mythic Dawn assassinate the Septim emperor
and most his heirs, except for one.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.239
During this conflict you, the hero of Kvatch,
worked with the Blades, an elite guard that

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:47.889
is supposed to protect the emperor, and emperors
last living heir to stop Mehrunes Dagon.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:55.609
At the end of the game he was pushed back
into Oblivion and sealed there by Akatosh.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.769
Sheogorath is the daedric prince of madness.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.810
He rules over a realm called Madhouse by some
and Shivering Islands by others.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.579
He is unpredictable and obsessed with cheese.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.579
I have said that there are 16 daedric princes,
but there really are 17 and the reason for

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.570
this is that Sheogorath is in fact Jyggalag.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.640
Jyggalag was a daedric prince of order, who
grew so powerfull, that other daedric princess

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.810
cursed him from fear.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.480
The interesting thing is, that at the end
of each era Sheogorath turns back into Jyggalag

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.030
for a brief period.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.000
If he is defeated during this period he will
be released from his curse and remains Jyggalag

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.610
and the person who defeats him will become
Sheogorath.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.970
This happens at the end of the shivering islands
DLC in Oblivion.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.910
Because of this the Sheogorath in TES V: Skyrim
is tought to be your hero from Oblivion.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.560
Sheogorath himself makes some references to
Oblivion in Skyrim proving that he really

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.840
once was the hero of Kvatch.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.730
I originaly did not want to talk about Molag
Bal, but with the recent announcemnt of Elder

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.070
Scrolls Online I felt like I should, because
he is supposed to play a major role in that

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.070
game.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.380
Molag Bal is the daedric prince of slavery
and domination.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.260
His plane of Oblivion is called Coldharbour
and it supposedly is a copy of Nirn, but completely

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.510
destroyed and the sky is set on fire.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.600
He is represented as a large creature, that
is a cross between a monkey and a snake and

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.580
is armed with horns and sharp teeth.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.430
In the Elder Scrolls Online he is supposed
to be the main antagonist who is harvesting

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.030
the souls of mortals for some reason.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.290
I tried to keep this as brief and as informative
as possible, so I included only information

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.330
that seemed relevant or interesting to me.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.700
So, thank you for watching and join me next
time!

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.340
We will talk about the individual races finally.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.910
Bye!
