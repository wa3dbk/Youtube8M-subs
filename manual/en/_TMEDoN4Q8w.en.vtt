00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey Guys! We've all had those days when your hair looks crazy

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.000
There's really not much to work with and you don't want to wear it in a puff

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.000
Well don't go getting all frustrated now

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.000
Relax! 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll show you a really easy solution to get you out the door.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Start by creating a part where you like it.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.000
Spritz the front section with water and begin twisting it to create a smoother surface 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.000
If your bangs look neat already, wear them out!

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.000
Mine are pretty puffy, so I'm going to twist them back and secure with a bobby pin.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then do the same for the opposite side.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Hey, it looks better already!

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.400
Split the hair in the back into two sections.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.000
They should not be perfect sections, we don't want to see a part.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Then secure one side out of the way for now.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
Gather the free side into a ponytail, as low as you want on your head.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Wrap the ponytail holder around once to secure, 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.000
Then flip the hair upward, making sure the curls are pointed outwards

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And pull the hair through the ponytail holder, stoping halfway, to create a loose and messy bun.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.000
Then repeat the same thing to the opposite side.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Make sure the second ponytail is even with the first one

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and try to get the second bun close enough so it touches the first one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And that's it! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Quick and Messy Side Buns that will end your frustrations and get you out the door! 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I hope this helps guys! Bye!
