00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.410
Now we’ve finished knitting the length of
the foot, following the pattern, and we’re

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.770
ready to change color again to do the toe,
and um, then finish up the rest of the stocking.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.400
The toe is very much like what we did in the
gusset.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.180
There is a little difference, I’m going
to show you how to work that now.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.090
Actually, there are two little differences.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.940
So here we are, I need to knit one more, and
now I’m at the beginning of my row at the

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.940
back of my heel.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.410
I’ll slip that marker.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.330
And we knit very much like – whoops, I’m
not changing color. I’m supposed to be changing

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.330
color!

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.330
[laughs] Here we go.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.230
I put my needle in like I’m ready to knit,
leave myself about a six inch tail, wrap the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.680
needle and pull it through.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.610
And then just keep knitting with the cream
color yarn.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.900
The last row of the foot, I had you place
markers.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
And they’re in a slightly different spot
than they were when you were doing the heel

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.000
gusset decreases.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.690
So we’re going to knit to three stitches
before the marker.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.110
Knit two together, knit one, slip the marker,
knit one, and then ssk.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.000
Slip, slip, knit those two together.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.950
Then we knit to three stitches before the
next marker.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.110
Heel shaping, well toe shaping goes twice
as fast as heel shaping, because we are going

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.150
to have four decreases every round rather
than two.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.750
The toes always go really quickly.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.270
Okay.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.129
Here we are, three stitches before this marker,
knit two together, knit one, slip marker,

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.420
knit one, and ssk.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.720
Again we’re – whoops, I split that stitch.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.460
Again we’re doing mirror image decreases
around the markers.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.530
And then I’m going to knit to the end.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.840
That’s a decrease round.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.090
And after this one we’re going to do a plain
knit round and then another decrease round,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.230
and you’ll follow your pattern to see how
many decrease rounds to do, and how many plain

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.530
knit rounds to do.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.300
Okay, we’re back at the beginning of the
round.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.450
And I’m not quite there yet, but I’m going
to demonstrate to you how to switch to double

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.480
pointed needles.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.160
Eventually we’re going to keep decreasing,
and these circular needles are going to be

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.959
too long for how little the toe gets.

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.270
So, let me grab some double pointed needles.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.020
We can’t really use that marker anymore,
so we’ll just let it go.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.650
I’ll put my needle in.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.820
Some people think that you have to like transfer
the stitches over to the double pointed needles.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.380
We’re just going to start working with them.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.430
You put your needle in – the double pointed
needle.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.709
And just wrap it and pull it through like
you were knitting with the circular needles.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.370
And this is a plain knit round with no decreases,
so this is an easy one to work with.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:46.099
And I’m going to knit up to the next marker,
which is a great place to start my second

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.060
double pointed needle.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.740
Okay, can’t use that marker anymore. Don’t
need it.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:02.510
Just start knitting off the circular needle
with my second double pointed needle.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.700
Whoops.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.209
These double pointed needles are really sharp.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:16.840
I like them, but on worsted weight yarn like
this they can sometimes split the stitches.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.840
Okay.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.019
Anyway, I think you’re getting the idea.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.240
I’m knitting off the circular needle and
getting everything on to three double pointed

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240
needles.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.260
I’ll knit up to this next marker, take it
out, and put the last section of stitches,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.220
between the markers, on the third double pointed
needle.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.400
Now, since we don’t have stitch markers
anymore, I do want you to remember where the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.250
beginning of your round is, which is the back
of your heel right here.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:50.130
So, we’re going to take a little clippie
stitch marker and put it in like that, and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.810
um, this will substitute the ring markers
that we had when we were using the circular

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.810
needle.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.440
That will remind you where the beginning of
your round is.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.020
Between the two needles right here.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.500
So you’re going to continue decreasing and
following the pattern until you get down to

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.889
the number of stitches – it’s very few
stitches – that the pattern tells you.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.350
And then you can come back here and I’ll
show you how to graft the toe using the kitchener

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.350
stitch.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.630
