00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:09.200
I would like to discuss a few things I would
like to talk about and one of them is our

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.291
work station. This is our work station here.
There are some basic necessities that a tattoo

00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:23.220
artist is going to need before he is going
to be able to do any tattooing or anything

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.790
of the sort. First thing is a tattoo machine.
This is a tattoo machine from a company called

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.290
World Wide Tattoo. They are pretty local.
It is reasonably inexpensive and this is one

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.210
of the reasons I wanted to introduce this
machine. We are going to use this in our tattoo

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.420
work so that you can know that it works well.
This is another machine that we are going

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.200
to use. This is a higher end machine by a
company called Hucks Spalding Enterprises

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.420
out of New York and this is my personal preference
but that has been after a couple of years

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.939
of tattooing. This is a power supply here
and this is the power supply for this particular

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:16.079
machine which is called a Revolution II. This
is another power supply that we will be using

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:24.959
for our line work which is with our traditional
machine. We've got our colors which I prefer

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:37.240
to use Skin Candy. Their colors are bright.
They don't fade as far as in the beginning

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.359
they stay pretty true in regards to how they
look in the bottle and how they look on the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:48.130
skin. I personally use Skin Candy inks or
pigments; different people call them different

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.349
htings. They are of a high quality ink that
is used throughout the industry. They are

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:05.840
used by Miami Ink which is a television series
and Miami Ink uses them exclusively. That

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.820
is not why I use their ink. It works for me.
There are other brands that may interest you.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.840
It is worthwhile to check it out. Another
thing we are going to need is this item here

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.330
is an ultrasonic cleaner. This is used to
clean what we call needle tubes. That is this

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.360
item here that slides into the tattoo machine
itself in order to get all of the pigment

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.240
out. There is really no other way to do it
before you have the model clay. I will get

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.340
into that at a different point. We've got
green soap which comes in bottles like this.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.730
It is a surgical soap used to clean the skin
and it is really the best thing to use to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.221
keep the skin clean and sterile during the
application. This is called green soap which

00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:11.240
is what we use to prep the skin in addition
to alcohol. It is a surgical soap that as

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:22.180
far as I know can only be acquired through
the tattoo suppliers. The next thing I would

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.870
like to get into discussing is the set up
of the tattoo machine and tattoo machine parts.
