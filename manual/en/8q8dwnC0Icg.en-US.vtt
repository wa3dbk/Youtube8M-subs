00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:14.086
Start of a PT...

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:20.111
Billowy : Do you want to try it?
Dark : If you want to play it...
Billowy : I'll teach you. It's fun enough.

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:27.953
Billowy : Just lie down! Lying down is start of PT!

00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:37.076
Gentle child, and a noble child

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:45.193
DynaMite : Isn't it because you were in the car?
soO : No, his hair died.

00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:51.308
Classic : Isn' it always like that?
soO : Not everyday.
DynaMite : Your hair popped out.
Classic : Where is top of my head?
Dream : I don't have it, too.

00:00:51.308 --> 00:00:57.718
Billowy : If you lied down a lot when you were young, then it becomes like that.

00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:15.110
Everyone seemed as if they are surprised by Classic's backhead.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.647
Billowy : It might be because you lied down too much.
Dark : Can't you just lie down?

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:26.335
Billowy : If you lie face down, then your forehead will become flat.

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:31.913
Billowy : People with popped backhead means they were raised really carefully.

00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:37.144
Dark : How can you get raised carefully?
Billowy : Just moms hug them everyday.

00:01:37.144 --> 00:01:44.164
Billowy : So they were never on the floor.

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:49.000
Billowy : So, if you lie down for a long time, then your backhead becomes flat.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.099
Dark : How about your's?
Billowy : Mine's flat.

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:02.897
Dark : You really don't have a backhead.
Billowy : My mom said she was busy with work and had no time to take care of me.

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:08.281
Is Billowy's theory about baby correct?

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:12.909
Why?

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.241
T.Ca was recording Dark and Sorry, that were looking at their phones only.

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:21.147
Dark : Why?
T.Ca : To make you feel embarrassed.

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.347
Why did soO drink the bubble tea?

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:26.511
Why did soO drink the bubble tea?

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:34.201
T.Ca : Are you drinking a bubble tea because it's the 'bubble' final?

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.416
T.Ca : Are you?
soO : I guess.

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.398
Bubble group was named during the Season 2 draft day because of Classic and Dream. T.Ca reminds the day when 'bubble' was named after them.

00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:45.224
Why they were interviewed during the final.

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:49.907
M : They said they aren't going to do it.
Writer : Not going to?
Dream : Can you do it with team members?

00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:54.742
Dream : Not my friends.
Writer : Team members are bit... It's kind of weird to cheer one person only.

00:02:54.742 --> 00:03:01.051
Dream : You can pick one member for Classic and one for me.

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:07.807
M : Did INnoVation bet on Classic?
Dream : INnoVation bet on me.

00:03:07.807 --> 00:03:11.027
M : INnoVation bet on Dream, and Dark bet on Classic.

00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:20.139
Writer : Then, we will interview them.
M : INnoVation, you heard it, right?

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:34.139
That's why INnoVation and Dark interviewed for Classic vs Dream final!
