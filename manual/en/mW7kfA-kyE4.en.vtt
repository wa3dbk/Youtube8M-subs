00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.000
So... You want to experiment..

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.976
When you look for someone to kiss... 

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:18.463
you end up sucking face with anyone you can find...

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.160
So calm down. Your first kiss will come soon enough.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.320
I hope you won't have to kiss too many frogs 
to find your prince charming.

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:28.666
zoOtecnia, discovering your animal side. 

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.418
Today we'll take the first... 

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.629
Ah no! Today we present: 
The First Kiss.

Translated by Hannah Bee

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.540
Do you know how to kiss?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.394
No... ummm...
 What can I say... no... On the cheek... and on the hand...

00:01:31.993 --> 00:01:33.793
Do you want to learn?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.185
Mmm... uhhhh. If you want to teach me...

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:40.175
Gross! Get a room!

00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:42.170
Vitamina... leave me alone!

00:01:44.964 --> 00:01:48.479
What must it be like... Everyone's been kissed but me...

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.029
Hi Pavola... Why so lonely? 

00:01:51.247 --> 00:01:52.899
Do you know how to kiss? 

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.276
Whose cute little mouth is that? You naughty girl...

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:57.735
Ah, how cute...

00:01:57.934 --> 00:01:59.841
Cripes!  What are you doing here?

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:02.252
Catching you in the act!!! 

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:03.647
I thought that you had stopped yanking your own chain... 

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:05.416
It pains me, it pains me to see you like this...

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:07.912
But since you're my friend, listen...  

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.641
I just opened a great kissing academy.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:12.565
 Check it out...

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:17.272
No! My first kiss was with Vitamina...

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:25.273
Don't be mad at me forever, I beg you, ChanchÃ³n

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:31.553
How'd you get the classroom?

00:02:31.635 --> 00:02:33.255
Where did I leave my keys?

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:36.381
Welcome to the Theory of Kissing.

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:38.389
So kids, there are three types of kisses!

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:43.033
The one on the cheek, the other cheek, and on the forehead

00:02:43.432 --> 00:02:45.005
Ah, and on the mouth...

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:46.263
Everyone pay attention

00:02:46.263 --> 00:02:47.623
I'm going to explain the types of kisses

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.183
Question... question... question... 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.527
Do you have to be a couple to kiss? Or not...

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:54.407
Ah... Don't embarrass yourself in front of the class!

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:56.474
Question... question... question...

00:02:56.618 --> 00:03:01.716
Because... because I already have someone in mind...

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.864
Shhhhhhhhh, let me talk, eeehh

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.042
Question... question... question... ummm...  

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:07.466
What's it feel like?

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.538
Do you feel butterflies in your stomach?

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:12.182
Or or or buffalos?

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.275
Or does it feel like your belly-button is going to pop out... 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.650
Oh... crap...
They didn't draw me a belly-button... 

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:20.549
Uh, production, could you help me out here?

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.342
Let's start from the begining. Kissing...

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:27.569
Kissing: the action in which two individuals

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.504
regardless of their gender

00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.907
put their lips together to exchange sensations

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.281
feelings and/or fluids

00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:40.232
There used to be a difference between a kiss and a peck

00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:44.749
but nowadays...

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.488
This class will be both theoretical and practical...

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:49.143
Theoretical what? 

00:03:49.683 --> 00:03:51.137
Look, my sweet lizard

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.710
here we'll discuss and we'll practice

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.981
These classes will be useful for the rest of your life

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:58.064
I want you to leave this class having mastered the art

00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.391
and make me proud

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.245
To accomplish that

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:03.383
you'll have to practice in your houses with fruit

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.130
You know, if you have a little mouth

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:08.983
for a guy like you, get a canteloupe

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.542
and for ChanchÃ³n... A watermelon will work

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:18.087
The bird kiss: Beak to beak

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.866
The vault kiss: Two to the left, two to the right

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:27.199
How many did you say to the right and how many to the left?

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:29.394
What a bonehead... 

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:32.942
French kiss: Spit comes, spit goes, 
what the tongue does, nobody knows

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:36.298
Canadian kiss: For a game of tonsil hockey

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:39.090
Musical kiss: Play the magical trumpet

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:41.704
Swing set kiss: With a swaying, hanging line of spit

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.558
Popsicle kiss: Suck and lick until you get to the stick

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.089
Oh, I screwed up, this doesn't have a stick in the middle

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.883
After these lessons, you'll be a fierce kisser.

00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:57.132
Yeah, I'm fierce! 

00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:01.662
I'm ready now

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.334
Uhh... ummm... I... I just graduated from kissing school... 

00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:16.042
Do you want to see?

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:19.136
No thanks... I'm not ready yet

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:20.720
Oh... no...

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:25.089
Oh how sweet...
You know how much I like you, little pig

00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:27.855
You know how to kiss?

00:05:28.132 --> 00:05:28.978
No

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.055
Then learn, shrimp...

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:34.458
What? What do you mean you don't know 
how to kiss... Crook! Get him!

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:36.681
Grab him, grab him!

00:05:36.888 --> 00:05:38.120
How on earth could you think

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.360
that I'm going to go giving something as beautiful

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.380
as personal, as natural and fun as a kiss to just anyone?
