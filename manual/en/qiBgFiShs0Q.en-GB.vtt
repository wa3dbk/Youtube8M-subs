The Loxone speakers come individually packed in this box here. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It contains the speaker itself and 2 covers; a square one and a round one.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The speaker's suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Its rubberised membrane ensures that it's weather and rain-proof, so don't worry about external use at all... 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The speaker has two tweeters, which allows a single speaker to be used for Stereo sound in small areas. To use a single speaker in stereo mode, two sets of connectors are provided with a small switch to select the stereo mode. If the speakers are used in a pair in an area, then the switch should be set to Mono and only one of the connectors used. Simple!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The audio quality of the speaker really is superb. The components have been designed specifically to deliver brilliantly well-rounded audio from very low to very high frequencies. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The special mounts are for easy installation in any ceiling or wall. You simply begin to tighten the screw and the mounting clips will automatically rotate into place. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Once the speaker itself has been secured in the wall or ceiling, the cover can be put in place as a finishing touch. As I say, both square and round covers are supplied as standard and they magneticallty clip into place. The covers are white, but of course, you may paint these black or green, the choice is yours...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
With the Loxone Speaker you are really getting your money's worth and of course it perfectly complements the multi-room audio package that we offer too. Thanks for watching.
