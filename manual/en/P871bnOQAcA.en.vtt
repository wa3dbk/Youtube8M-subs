00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.000
Geeet dooowwn!!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.880
...Theee Fuuuck?

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.153
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Waaah!

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.620
Fokiu *SHOTGUN PUMP*
Fokiu *SHOTGUN PUMP*

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.400
HAAAAA!!

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:38.404
Oooh, I think I shit myself.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.246
And that's how you do a Fokiu Fokiu Ha.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.895
Come on! Not even a minute passed by and
they've already travelled around the world?

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:50.919
Yeah, actually after a while
they start to travel fast as fuck.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.680
Woah, and didn't they destroy lots of buildings
or killed lots of people?

00:01:55.699 --> 00:02:00.114
Aaah... nah, usually they get destroyed
if they ever hit something.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.180
Aaargh shut up already! Don't you see
I'm trying to tell you some important stuff!

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.840
But... I wasn't even talking.

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.889
Have you ever heard about Chupamons?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.382
Uh... uh-

00:02:14.382 --> 00:02:18.822
Pokyman? Pokyman! Where's the poky
and the little man and this little thing

00:02:18.846 --> 00:02:22.106
where a guy comes out and then
there's a fight and he likes to...

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.320
*babbling nonsense*

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:29.534
Yeah, something like that, Bill.
But I said Chupamons not Pokemons,

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.000
So get the fuck out of here!!

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:35.484
Ass-Kicker'nado!!

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:40.008
*babbling nonsense*

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:44.494
Anyway, Chupamons are
some endangered creatures...

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.560
that we viciously and inhumanly
summon during battle...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.980
so they can help us fight our rival
that is currently beating the shit out of us.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.380
Blablablablabla... C'mon Fok, don't fuck with me.

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.539
Bokey, don't trust me, little fuck.

00:02:57.563 --> 00:02:59.843
And why are they called Chupamons?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.020
Because... our Spanish ancestors didn't quite
use them for battling purposes.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.060
*Chupa is suck in Spanish*

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:13.972
Wuoahahahah... I want one!!

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.715
In order for you to catch them,
you'll need the...

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:22.801
The what?
The whaaat!?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.400
The millennuim sexual item!!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.140
Sexual item?

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:40.514
The milennium!!

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:46.074
Not annual! Not centurial!
The milennium!!

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:49.677
Wohohohokey
And what the fuck I do with it?

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:52.786
With this you can capture and summon Chupamons.

00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:57.402
And if you were a lady you could
use if for something else.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.280
Take it! From now on its yours.

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:04.615
Oooh thank you, Fokiubish sensei!

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.760
Alright, I'm gonna keep it over heeee...
I better wear it as a necklace.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.620
Kunashgi, I have something to tell you.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.840
Is time for you to leave.
You have to go to the Milennium...

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.860
Martial Arts, Ninjutsury and Chupamonery Tournament.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
Oh what a drag!
And why do I have to go?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.660
Because I signed you up
and that means you're screwed.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.730
OK, that makes sense.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.120
Heh, I have something to tell you too, Fokiu

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.300
I think I pee myself everytime I hear the word...

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.300
Which one?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280
The one you use instead of chakra or ki...

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.800
Oooh, could it possibly be?

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.759
Huh, don't say it if you know what's good for you!

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.880
Chi?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.900
Guuh uh... told ya, fok... *sigh*
Oh no, wait!... *sigh*

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.020
Son of a fucking biiitch!!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.500
You better get the fuck out of here before I...

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.200
Um OK, Fokiu...
Thank you for all of your unique and original lessons.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.858
Believe it!

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.880
You're welcome, son...

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.274
Uh... uh... but...
I'm not your son...

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.060
I know, but you were like one for me
Come here, son

00:05:35.507 --> 00:05:36.565
Ugh!

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.190
Hehehe, I couldn't stand the cheesiness.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:42.641
Hmm heh, goodbye Fokiubish Sensei.

00:05:42.665 --> 00:05:45.768
See ya Kunashgi-kun.

00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:50.435
Oh, it seems like it was only yesterday that I met him.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.560
Actually, we did meet yesterday. We saw each other
for like fifteen years, but yeah...

00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:57.500
We met yesterday.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.180
Hey, wait a minute. ArenÂ´t we in an island?
I mean, where do I go now?

00:06:04.955 --> 00:06:07.035
No, it's just a peninsula.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.600
What? All this time I thought it was an island...
But it's just a fucking peninsula.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:21.120
I mean, I could've uh... I could've uh...
ah... uh... I cou... uh... damn it.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.920
Don't be a pussy!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.460
Didn't you noticed when you went to the
Titipopo swamp and all that shit?

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:31.106
Alright, heh... I did notice when I was with the Great Dealer, I said to myself...

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.780
I mean... I think this is not an island... Huh

00:06:36.322 --> 00:06:39.410
Well, I've already answered your doubts.
Now, go through the Forbidden Forest,

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:42.856
follow the yellow brick road and
hopefully you'll get to the tournament.

00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:50.451
Goodbye, Fokiubish sensei! I promise I'll win the tournament, doesn't matter if it rains

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.880
or shines or I pee myself, I'll come back and I'll tell you...
I did it! I REALLY did it!

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.580
Goodbye, Kunashgi-kun...
and take care.
