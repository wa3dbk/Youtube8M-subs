Hi, today we’re going to review

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:09.974
two products cases for the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:12.417
by premium case manufacturer Jisoncase.

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:16.464
The Jisoncase Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Quilted Folio Case

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:18.483
and Executive Folio Case.

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:22.773
These cases come in a high quality package with a clear window

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:27.616
to allow you to see the color and size while keeping the case in mint condition.

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:31.685
It also includes a swatch of leather used in the cases’ exterior

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:36.168
so you can check the material quality and texture before buying it,

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:39.306
a very nice touch.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:44.219
The Executive Folio snaps onto the back of the Galaxy S4 mini

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.688
and covers most of the front, back and all four corners.

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:50.793
It fits quite snugly and the soft interior lining

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.088
protects your phone from scratches.

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:58.996
It should absorb some light shocks if the phone is dropped as well.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:03.412
Overall the sturdiness of the case and the quality of the leather feels pretty good.

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:07.960
This model is available in black, white and red color leather.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.636
The design allows you access to the buttons on the right side

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:16.150
and the ports on the top and bottom.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.543
On the back there’s are holes for the speaker as well as the camera and flash.

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:30.087
The front cover snaps shut with an embedded magnet

00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:32.414
so the case won’t flip open easily on its own.

00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:34.306
Another cool feature to this case is that the S4 can detect

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.310
when the cover is opened and wake up automatically.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.844
The front cover window allows you to see the time

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:43.405
as well as notifications without flipping open the cover.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:47.276
You can even answer the phone by swiping the screen through this window.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.550
It’s important to note two things about the case design -

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.461
when the case is closed the phone’s volume control buttons on the left side can still push them through the material

00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:04.480
if you flip the cover around the back of the phone it partially obscures the camera. Be careful.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.785
The Quilted Folio case has a similar design

00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:14.014
except without the window and with a quilted design on the front.

00:02:14.014 --> 00:02:14.986
Thanks for watching,
