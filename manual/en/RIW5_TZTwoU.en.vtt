00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.842
Gwenyth: We're inspired by women
who have restarted their lives

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.174
using health and fitness.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.744
We hope you are, too.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:14.025
(lively music)

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.155
Gwenyth: I'm Gwenyth Paltrow.

00:00:15.155 --> 00:00:17.661
Tracy: And I'm Tracy Anderson.

00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:20.080
Gwenyth: This is The Restart Project.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.373
(calm music)

00:00:26.373 --> 00:00:29.337
On the outside, Tara's story
is about restarting her life

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.545
after a traumatic physical injury,

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:34.810
but the truth is the
hardest part was overcoming

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.780
the emotional injury.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:42.648
Tara: I was your typical 22 year old girl.

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:46.460
I hung out with my friends
and went to parties.

00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:52.512
I was like Miss Social Butterfly
and I had a great time. (laughs)

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:56.228
Gwenyth: I was wondering
if you could tell me

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.297
what happened that day.

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:01.201
Tara: I will try without crying.

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.072
Gwenyth: Okay.

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:06.135
Tara: I was in a fender
bender on the freeway

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.842
and I got out of my car and usual stuff.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.127
You assess damage, you
talk to the other person.

00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:14.807
Everything was fine, no one was injured,

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:18.051
and then I was hit by a passing car.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.436
I don't remember it.

00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:23.376
I don't have any recollection of it.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:27.193
I woke up and was told the news.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.789
The car was going 72 miles an hour.

00:01:34.368 --> 00:01:40.260
He hit me head-on, so
my legs were crushed.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:44.108
My head went into his windshield

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.652
and I landed two lanes over
in the freeway on my back.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:53.000
From the impact of my head
going into the windshield,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.695
my head was severed from my
spine, C1 to C3 was severed

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:02.256
and they call it an internal decapitation,

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:05.249
but my left leg was the first
thing to be taken care of,

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.104
because I was losing so much blood.

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:11.955
It was a life or death matter, like
amputate it or she's going to die.

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.567
Cleaned me up, amputated my left leg,

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:19.127
put a titanium rod in my
right leg as my shinbone,

00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:22.871
and they did a 15 hour surgery on my neck.

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:29.945
The first thing I remember
was being really confused.

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:36.569
I remember my dad was with
me and I could feel his fear.

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:40.821
He was like, "Tara, you
look really pretty,"

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.008
and I could hear it in his
voice that he was really sad.

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:49.739
He walks me through everything,
"You were in an accident,

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.776
"everything's going to be okay."

00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:57.027
My mom couldn't even be
around me without crying.

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.798
She had a really hard time.

00:03:02.643 --> 00:03:05.627
Everything was kind of unknown.

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:09.311
With my neck injury, they said
it could've caused nerve damage

00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.276
in my limbs, arms, fingers.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.476
That would all have to come with time.

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:15.042
They didn't know.

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.616
They did think I would walk again.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:21.573
They weren't sure if I would
be able to run or be active,

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:25.087
but they knew I'd be able
to wear a prosthetic.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.003
Gwenyth: How old were you at the time?

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:30.231
Tara: I was 23.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.318
Gwenyth: To be that young of a woman

00:03:32.318 --> 00:03:37.412
and to have to face that
kind of physical change.

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:39.244
Tara: Yeah.

00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:42.010
Gwenyth: Were you worried
about the rest of your life,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.680
how it might be changed?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.382
Tara: I was, yes.

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:50.626
My main thought was that
no one would love me

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:53.662
and that I wasn't sexy.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.610
I was in the hospital for four weeks

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.164
and then I was in a rehab
hospital for two weeks.

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:02.666
You're kind of numb, at that point.

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:07.107
You're still highly medicated,
it's still kind of a blur.

00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:11.007
I'd say the emotions really started
to kick in when I went home.

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:16.171
I remember days of just
crying uncontrollably,

00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:19.743
because everything's setting
in, the medicine's wearing off,

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:23.535
and you're a different person.

00:04:24.604 --> 00:04:26.458
A few weeks after being home,

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.305
the Challenged Athletes
Foundation sent over

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:31.149
one of their athletes, JP.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:37.522
I was still in a wheelchair, no
prosthetic, cast on my right leg,

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:41.535
just kind of a mess, and
here comes JP walking in,

00:04:41.535 --> 00:04:45.132
carrying his running leg,
wearing shorts, super fit,

00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:48.345
athletic, handsome man
and he's like, "Hey.

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:49.608
"I'm JP, how are you doing?

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:50.793
"I've totally been where you're at.

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:53.149
"Let's talk about it."

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.114
I'm like, "What are you up to?

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:55.171
"What did you do today?" and he's like,

00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:56.937
"I just ran ten miles."

00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:58.902
I'm like, "You just ran ten miles?

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.660
"Okay."

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.077
I never ran before my accident.

00:05:02.077 --> 00:05:07.157
I always admired runners, but
I never pushed myself to do it.

00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:12.036
I started very slowly on the
treadmill and then on the driveway.

00:05:12.036 --> 00:05:14.781
I eventually signed up
for a 5K and finished it

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.551
and that was it, I was hooked.

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:21.229
(uplifting music)

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:28.229
Since my first 5K, I've accomplished
many, many half marathons,

00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:31.785
a few triathlons, a marathon.

00:05:31.785 --> 00:05:38.585
I've climbed Kilimanjaro, so
yeah, (laughs) I proved myself.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:52.460
(music continues)

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.594
Girl in Blue: I used to play
softball before I had cancer.

00:05:55.594 --> 00:05:56.646
Tara: Okay.

00:05:56.646 --> 00:06:00.238
I've had the opportunity
to mentor other people

00:06:00.238 --> 00:06:02.711
and it's been really special,
because I've been there

00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:04.908
and I can relate to them and guide them

00:06:04.908 --> 00:06:09.883
and just let them know
that it's going to be okay.

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:13.377
It sounds very tragic, but
good things have come of it

00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:16.248
and I've accomplished things
that I probably wouldn't have

00:06:16.248 --> 00:06:17.816
before the accident.

00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:21.735
Gwenyth: So, would you
go back and change it?

00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:23.651
Tara: No.

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.282
I wouldn't.

00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:28.170
Gwenyth: Wow.

00:06:29.477 --> 00:06:32.016
Tara: I've learned that it
doesn't matter if anyone loves me,

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.920
if I love myself.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.096
Gwenyth: That is really true,
but you're drop dead gorgeous.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.345
Tara: Thank you.

00:06:40.345 --> 00:06:42.860
Gwenyth: God, I can't
run a freaking marathon.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.920
Tara: (laughs) Yes you could.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.764
Gwenyth: No, I could not.

00:06:49.595 --> 23:59:59.999
(electric sound)
