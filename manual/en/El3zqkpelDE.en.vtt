00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:04.262
(electronic music)

2
00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:05.456
When you talk about health,

3
00:00:05.456 --> 00:00:08.119
it's different for everybody.

4
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.917
I think what's important when anybody's teaching

5
00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:14.300 line:15%
others on health, that they don't do it

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.126 line:15%
based on their own sole opinion.

7
00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:17.376 line:15%
Health coaches are having

8
00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:19.173 line:15%
a bigger and bigger impact now.

9
00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:22.791 line:15%
Graduates from IIN are being seen on tv,

10
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.249
they're making their own movies,

11
00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.175
they're writing books,

12
00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.350
they're having a huge global effect.

13
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.054 line:15%
This is the first generation in living history

14
00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:33.160 line:15%
where life expectancy of our children

15
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.505 line:15%
is likely to be less than our own life expectancy.

16
00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:37.934
And that's a travesty.

17
00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:39.962 line:15%
I think we know what needs to be done.

18
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.103 line:15%
People need to eat more

19
00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.288 line:15%
fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, seeds, and whole grains.

20
00:00:43.288 --> 00:00:44.121
We know that.

21
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:44.954
It's the doing it.

22
00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:46.959
It's how do we make this fun?

23
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:48.697
How do we make it easier?

24
00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:50.073
How do we make it more convenient?

25
00:00:50.073 --> 00:00:52.519
They're the challenges.

26
00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.611
I believe we need to meet people have way.

27
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.074
We need to teach people gradually.

28
00:00:57.074 --> 00:01:00.367
Educate them about how they need to change

29
00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:04.173
in a way that relates to them and a way that's doable.

30
00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:06.695
If you're living on a high processed diet,

31
00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:07.978
where all you're doing is putting in

32
00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:09.327
this exorbitant amount of sugar,

33
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:11.034
exorbitant amount of salt

34
00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:13.939
high fat, you can't feel how you're supposed to feel.

35
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.587
As a health coach, you need to really be honest

36
00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:20.090
and stand in your own truth about what works for you,

37
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.776
and how you can help people find their own truth.

38
00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:26.108
Coaches should be thinking about a long term

39
00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:27.989
relationship with their clients.

40
00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:29.914
It's almost being a friend.

41
00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:32.831
(electronic music)

42
00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.032
Anything is possible.

43
00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:37.963
I think its great to be passionate

44
00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:39.246
about what you do.

45
00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:42.735
And I never thought that I'd be sitting here,

46
00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.639
talking to so many individuals

47
00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.117
about my passion, about nutrition.

48
00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:50.857
So getting well isn't just about the food on the plate,

49
00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:52.227
it's really expanding your vision

50
00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:55.644
of your life and what's possible for you.
