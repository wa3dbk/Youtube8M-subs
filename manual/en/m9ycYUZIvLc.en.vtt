00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.930
It was interesting. What actually happened
was that all divisions spent a long time thinking

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.400
about where we were going in the touring segment.
What are we going to do? Sales said where

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.290
they saw certain possibilities, for example.
We have often had a good model on the market

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.170
and we would say: "How would we develop this
further? Is a predictable development enough

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.500
or do we have to do something different?"
All this comes together. So nobody simply

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.710
said: "We've only done 4-cylinders to date,
let's do a 6-cylinder now. That's a great

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.570
idea, don't you think?" That's not the way
things work. Of course there are people who

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.860
suggest a 5-cylinder or a 7-cylinder. This
type of fun and games does go on, but you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.530
have to ask: "What are we actually trying
to do here?" And that means there's a sense

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.879
that the time has come with sales, i.e. with
the customer representative, the rider, the

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.930
market, the design, the expression, in other
words how can I express this? Technology offers

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.600
possibilities of course. And of course we
have our aspirations, after all customers

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
have expectations of us. What does a flagship
motorcycle mean? In the boxer series we have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.420
the RT, of course, that really is this top-level
touring bike and then we had something similar

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.350
in the K series, so we see this development
in recent years where we said we want to adapt

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.530
to the values of the BMW Group, in other words
we want to show that we are very dynamic in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.820
the flagship area, too. Ultimately we came
to the conclusion that a GT was the right

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.749
top model. Developments in the past were perhaps
a little too luxury-oriented, somewhat at

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.810
the expense of dynamic performance. Where
we said to ourselves we want both. In other

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.829
words the GT aspiration was to be very agile
and have lots of power even in combination

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:04.340
with the luxury elements - both together.
And then of course the question arose: "How

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.190
do we do it?" The engineers said: "A 6-cylinder
would offer a lot more than a 4-cylinder".

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.209
Why? Because it is very low-vibration, the
power delivery of a 6-cylinder engine is simply

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:28.511
smooth. The balancing character of the engine
is legendary. Last week I was in Japan and

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:39.680
they have some very exciting advertising campaigns.
It seems that the 6-cylinder BMWs, I mean

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.849
the cars, were called "Silky Six" for a very
long time. At first I found this translation

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.940
quite amusing but it's actually right: a soft-as-silk
6-cylinder. That's really got something, you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.330
have to say "Wow. Power delivery and silky
smooth." What a statement. Wow. And I can

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.569
go really fast if I want to, but you don't
get a kick in the backside, it's really is

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:11.100
as it should be: "I'll take you with me and
we're going to take the next few bends together.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:22.150
Wow." And this powerful delivery and the confident
character is what creates this connection.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.849
"Ah, we want to offer a flagship, but a 6-cylinder
is just the right technological solution.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.230
And what kind of technical expression can
we give this 6-cylinder?" And that's how we

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.579
all come back together again. The customer
 - i.e. marketing, engineer and designer.

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:49.219
Where we say: "Yes, I think that's great.
We can do something with it." And that's how

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:56.670
it develops. Of course there are questions,
too. How much money do I have to invest, where

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.659
are we going to produce it and how much time
will it take us? That's the business case.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.730
And that's what makes it exciting. After all,
we have a vision, a hope that we can get customers

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.390
interested in us, but then you have to go
away and create it.
