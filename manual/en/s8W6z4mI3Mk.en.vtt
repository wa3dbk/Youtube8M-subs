Hi Holy thanks for calling us we thankful Sade we are good singers

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Holy it's story time we're here to listen to another wonderful story from the Bible

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
oh that's nice cuz I have picked on one just for you kids

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
hope you like it but you've got to listen carefully because at the end we got he question

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
even I promise to listen carefully today

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
all right kids gather around today's story is about the shipwreck

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
All the men who were on the ship with Paul had eaten food blessed by Paul

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I'm feeling assured and confident

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the dim light of the stormy morning they saw a small island

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the sailor throughout all the cargo from the ship  and cut away the anchors

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we then made preparations to dock the ship near ground on the beach

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
he ship had become light because they have thrown all the grain that was in the carbon

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
so it caught the wind and is pushed towards the shore

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but the sailors did not know that there were strong cross currents in the coastal water there

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
ship got caught in the currents, and got  carry towards a bunch of sharp rocks

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
as the waves pounded on its sights the ship crushed against the rocks

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The sailor said that is right to leave the ship

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the Roman soldiers on board wanted to kill all the prisoners they could not escape alive

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
thankfully Julius one of the Roman centurions on board

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
stopped them as he wanted to deliver Paul to Rome safely

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Julius told the passengers and crew to jump and swim towards the shore

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
all the passengers reach the shore safely just as Paul had promised

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they had reached the island of Malta between Sicily and South Africa

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
wow that was quiet and adventure just like a movie

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It was wasn't it ya may be I grow up and become a sailor

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Not me I would hate water

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
be whatever you want dear just believe in God always

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
now for my question which Island did the sailors and crew reach

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Malta isn't that right yes you are right tubby

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
