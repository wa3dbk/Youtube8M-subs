Hi! This is Elise McMahon for Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.619
house training your dog. If you would like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:16.299
visit my website at canineheadstart.com. So
we are going to be talking about the value

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.700
of frequent outings; getting your puppy out
very frequently. Again, we are talking in

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.430
this series about both house training an adult
dog and a puppy dog and when you are talking

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.780
about frequent outings for a puppy, we are
talking about a much shorter period of time

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.640
in between taking them out. With an adult
dog, you can probably leave it a little bit

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.510
longer but remember confinement is something
that you are going to be depending a lot on.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.630
So with a puppy, typical times are after they
have woken up, after they’ve eaten, drunk

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.750
something, after they have had a play session,
after they have been chewing vigorously on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.870
something and in addition to taking them out
immediately after all of these things, you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.999
want to take your dog out typically, I recommend
to my clients every 20 to 30 minutes. The

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:16.009
more frequently you get your puppy out the
fewer accidents you are going to have in your

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.899
house. So when you get ready to take your
puppy out you want to let them know they are

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.560
going out for a potty break and also just
to mention, you do want to distinguish a potty

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.609
break from a play break. So when we take the
puppy out we say we are going to go outside

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.420
or whatever your command is when you go outside
to pee, you can take them out on a leash,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.349
let them go pee, praise them and we will show
you how we go about doing this. Here Raven.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:53.070
That’s a good girl. Yes Raven says I just
want to sleep. Put the puppy on the leash,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.399
let’s go. Let’s go outside and pee. Let’s
go Raven. Let’s go. Good girl.
