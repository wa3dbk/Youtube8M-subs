00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
Hello, everyone

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.880
Today we're taking a look at the 'Maldal' Windows Worm.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.820
I got a few requests over the past several months

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.900
for a remake video of this.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.380
So, figured I'd oblige.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.460
So, first things first, take a look at the specifications we got on this virtual machine.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.340
As you can see, we got about 2GB total on the disk

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.340
and about 1.5GB free.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.420
But, Maldal will certainly change that.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.120
So, we'll go ahead and run it.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.780
It is supposed to be an email worm,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.040
but, I can't get the email spreading routine to work

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.220
So,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.500
So, we get this error message : "Runtime Error 71"

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.980
Object Required"

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.960
Alright.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.060
"Project 1", I'm assuming that means Visual Basic-

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.780
Oh shit, what's happening?

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.600
We got a bunch of "Sharoon.exe" files

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
and the computer is lagging like crazy-

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960
or, at least this message box is.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.000
What is happening?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.900
Why can't I do anything?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.760
Can we open folders?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760
Really slowly, we can.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.300
If we look in the Windows folder,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.060
I believe it drops, (There we go) "LucKey.exe"

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.220
Get it? Lucky, but not actually lucky because its a worm.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.240
So, about 80KB.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.320
If we take a look, these useless files are all copies of the worm.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.840
So.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.780
But, what you don't realize

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.780
Is that past your desktop, it is still filling them up.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.520
So, we got the original Maldal there executable here on your desktop

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.480
And we got Sharoon.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.800
And its just going on and on and on.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.480
Sharoon.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
let's see how many items we have.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.820
8,904! That's quite a few shortcuts.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
If we refresh,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.840
Now we got a bunch of Bush.exe's

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
'W has taken over your computer, I guess.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.440
Now we have over 10,000 items!

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.700
And, these aren't just shortcuts.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.500
If we take a look at the C: Drive...

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.700
Er- yeah.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.920
Our available space is rapidly diminishing!

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.000
We're down to just 400MB.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.760
And since that, we're down another 50MB,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.240
To 366.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780
So, as you can see, it is filling up your hard drive,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.100
Which is kinda bad.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.940
Eventually, we should be running out of space.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.020
Now, if you were aware of what was going on you should be able to...

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.180
Can you Control-Alt-Delete?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360
Maybe not...

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.440
OK, I guess Control-Alt-Delete is disabled.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.780
Task Manager...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.820
Oh, I can't do that in this version of Windows I guess..

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.000
Crap, we're almost down to 100MB!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760
Still reducing...

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.980
35MB...we have run out of disk space...Oh o!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.300
Disk Cleanup...What can we fix?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.020
We can get rid of...

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.400
0MB, alright!

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.380
Do it!

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160
Yes, delete all 0MB!

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.760
This "Project 1" file is still frozen.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.120
Can't do anything.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.880
Can't even move it...

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.560
And... we are completely out of space

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.040
on the C: drive.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.980
Zero bytes available.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.140
What if we wanted to create a new...text document? What would happen?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540
"The directory or file cannot be created"

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.100
Well, shit!

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.760
But, it is pretty easy to fix.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.640
Just open your favorite Command Prompt...

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.380
Do a dir /w...

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.880
Yeah, this is going to take awhile.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.700
To list all of these files.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.240
Maybe we should... stop?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.980
How do you break? Control-Shift-Break?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.140
Yeah, there we go.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.720
Assuming you don't have any executables on your desktop...

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.540
Star.exe,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.480
And... we're good to go!

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.460
Should see it disappear...

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.940
F5?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
"ZA-Union.exe"?

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.640
What is happening?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.920
Are we getting...replaced?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.580
1.18GB...

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.300
Oh, it is still going!

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580
I guess we gotta restart.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.920
But, uh there's not really a point of restarting,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.560
and just showing you.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.760
So, until you can stop the worm,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.780
and delete its file from the Windows folder...

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.280
Then you can clean up its mess of files.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.780
Until then, you'll have a real lack of disk space to work with.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.600
So, that's about it for the 'Maldal' Windows worm.
