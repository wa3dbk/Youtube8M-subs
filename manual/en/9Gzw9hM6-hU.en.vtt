00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.020
Sales tax, we all have to pay it. But how
do you calculate how much sales tax is? Hi,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.370
I'm jimmy Chang. I've been teaching college
mathematics for almost a decade. And we're

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.501
here to calculate sales tax. Now the one thing
that you definitely need of course, is. Is

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:21.570
you need to find out from your county or state.
How much the sales tax rate is? It can be

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.330
7%, 8%, eight and a quarter. Five and half,
it all depends on what the tax happens to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.960
be. But you definitely need that number. Because
you'll need it to figure out how much tax

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.699
you'll be paying on certain items. And it
will help you find out what the total is.

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.890
And it will give you more insight as to why
the final totals are what they are. Now here's

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.140
a brief example, now. Suppose you have a sales
tax of 7%. First thing that you definitely

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.879
need to do is take what ever percentage that
you are provided. And turn it into a decimal.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.719
That way, it will help you figure out how
much tax you're actually paying on a particular

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.559
item. Now because it is 7%. You take that
decimal and shift it to the left, two places.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.400
So 7% is actually another way of saying 0.07.
Now here's an example of how to calculate

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.770
how much sales tax you're paying. The much
sought after Nintendo Wii costs two hundred

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.250
and forty nine dollars and ninety nine cents,
retail. To figure how much tax you'll be paying

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.450
under the 7% sales tax. You simply take how
much the Wii is worth. 249.99 and multiply

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.040
by 0.07. A calculator is very, very handy
here. But because we are talking about dollars

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.840
and cents. You want to round to 2 decimal
places. So when you multiply those two numbers.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.940
You will get a grand total of a tax, a sales
tax of 17 dollars and 50 cents. But what if

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.580
you wanted to figure out how much you would
be paying ahead of time. With tax as well

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.550
as the total amount, with tax included. Well,
you're still doing the same thing that we

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.950
just did. But you always want to be sure that
instead of, in this case 0.07, put a 1as their

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.360
front number. In other words, 1.07. Whenever
you put a 1 in front of the decimal. It will

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.560
always give you the total. So if you want
to find out the total cost of the Wii including

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.690
tax. You take, 249.99 and multiply by 1.07.
Notice that 1. That's going to give you the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.890
total along with the tax. Now when you multiply,
you're going to get a grand total of 267 dollars

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.580
and 49 cents. And that's going to give you
the grand total, tax included. So, my name

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.080
is Jimmy Chang. And that's an example as to
how you calculate sales tax with and without

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.670
totals.
