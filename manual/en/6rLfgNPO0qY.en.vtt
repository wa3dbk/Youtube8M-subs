00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.129
This video will guide you through the
process of installing a 6291A

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.910
ratchet repair kit on a Dutton-Lainson hand winch.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.539
This kit includes these parts: a ratchet sleeve, cap screw, lever,

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.539
spacer, lock nut,

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.730
and a spring.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.640
Here is a list of the three winches that are
compatible with this kit, but please keep

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.960
in mind that there are two different
ways it can be installed

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.740
depending on the particular winch that you own.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.850
This video show both processes,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.710
so follow along only when you winch's
model number is displayed in the top

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.240
left corner of the screen.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.190
Regardless of which model you own,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.040
your first step is to remove the ratchet kit that is currently installed on your winch.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.000
Using two 7/16" wrenches or a combination of a wrench and a ratchet

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.590
as demonstrated here,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.690
loosen the lock nut,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.230
and completely remove it from the cap
screw.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.120
Pull the cap screw all the way out of
the ratchet sleeve,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.820
then simply remove the kit's interior
parts from the center of the winch.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.469
To install this kit on a DL1602ADD or a

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.140
DL1602A like the one you see here,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.790
hold the lever with its pointed tip on
the right and facing down,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.000
then slip it onto the tapered edge of the
ratchet sleeve.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.060
Insert one end of the spring in the hole above the lever's pointed tip,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.590
then place the spacer against the lever
on the sleeve's edge.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.880
Next, place the other end of the spring through the small hole on the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.500
gear side of the winch.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740
Press down on the kit's interior parts

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.549
until the ratchet sleeve's two ends are 
lined up with the large holes

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.860
on both sides of your winch.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.800
Insert the cap screw through the lined-up holes on the gear side of the winch,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.470
then push it all the way through the
ratchet sleeve until its end appears on

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.140
the opposite side of the winch.  Lastly,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.030
put the lock nut on this end of the cap
screw and firmly tighten it with your

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.250
tools to finish the installation process.  Now,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.819
here are the steps to follow if you own a DL1402A winch:

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.430
Place the lever on the ratchet sleeve's tapered edge with its pointed tip on the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.329
right and facing down.

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.219
Set the spacer against the lever, then
slide one end of the spring into the

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.919
lever's small hole that is NOT above its
pointed tip.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.420
Insert the other end of the spring into
the small hole

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.939
near the top of the gear side of the
winch,

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.049
then position the parts so they line up with
the large hole on this same side of the winch.

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.760
Push the cap screw all the way through
the winch,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.549
place the lock nut on the end of the
screw,

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.609
then use your tools to securely tighten the nut to complete the final step.

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.519
However, before operating your winch, please make sure that you correctly installed the kit.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.709
First, engage the gear with the lever's pointed tip and move the reel towards the gears.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.319
You should feel resistance and hear loud clicks as the lever passes through the gears.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.169
Now,

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.899
disengage the gear with the lever's pointed tip

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.199
and move the reel in either direction.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.039
You shouldn't feel any resistance or hear any clicking noises with the lever in this position.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.999
A word of warning:

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.519
When installing this kit, some people try
to force the spring over the spacer and

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.609
the ratchet sleeve's tapered edge at the
beginning of the installation process.

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.259
While the spring's opening is large enough to fit in this position, your winch will

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:29.819
NOT function properly or safely if you try to install the kit in this way.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.139
Thanks for watching!

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.150
