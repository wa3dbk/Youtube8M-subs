00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.570
Today we are going to talk about the different
tips for stopping biting your nails. One of

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.619
the main things that I find is helpful is
to keep the nails polished and when the nails

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.480
are polished you will often have a harder
time chewing on them because you will feel

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.529
badly especially if you pay someone to polish
them. It is really important to go into a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.390
salon, strike up a relationship with a nail
technician and have them do your nails on

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.439
a regular basis. If you make an appointment
for a weekly manicure and you know you have

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.840
an appointment coming up, not only did you
pay for the manicure but you are also going

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.340
to feel guilty about chewing on the nails
before you go back in and you see this person

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.640
that you have a relationship with. It is going
to make you feel a little bit embarrassed

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.711
if you do chew on them to go back in and actually
show her the results of your week so it is

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.590
important to do it once a week. So another
important thing that you can do is there are

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.830
products on the market that has a distasteful
oil put in the polish and it is like a clear

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.511
polish and you can use that as a base coat
and a top coat during the time that you are

00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:02.180
trying to create this habit of not biting
your nails. If you use that product on a regular

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.970
basis it will just be a gentle reminder to
you when you put the hand to the mouth that

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.130
oh yea this is something that I don't want
to do because normally biting your nails is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.850
a mindless effort that we do and psychologically
it is something that we are just not aware

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.430
of. It is subconscious and it is just habitual.
It is physically habitual. It often happens

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.740
when you are nervous so if you can do some
things that will kind of relieve your stress

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.370
when you know that something stressful is
coming up then hopefully the nervous feeling

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.210
and the nervous habit of pulling the hand
up to the mouth and biting will not be quite

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.490
as quick to happen if you tend to reduce that
stress. You know exercising, drinking a glass

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.070
of wine once in a while is good, just keeping
the stress level down and when you know that

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.590
a stressful event is going to be happening
if you can try to reduce stress before the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.090
event takes place then it is also good. Another
idea of not biting and something to help you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.600
not bite the nails is have people that are
around you on a regular basis remind you gently.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.090
Tell them how you want them to remind you
so you don't get mad at them and you don't

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.970
lash out at them but if you could just let
them know, jeez you know tell a co-worker

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.079
or loved one that you are with, you know a
large part of your day, you know if you notice

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.620
me biting my nails could you just maybe touch
my arm or just say hey you probably don't

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.349
want to do that, something nice just to remind
you because if you have some people looking

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.560
out after you it will help you reach your
goal more effectively. Good luck.
