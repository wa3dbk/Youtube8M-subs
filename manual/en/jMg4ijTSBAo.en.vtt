00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.469
Part of creating a healthy safe meal for
your family is making sure that your

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.789
food gets hot enough when you cook it to
kill bacteria that can make you or your

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.039
family sick. To do this you need a food
thermometer. Color and texture are not

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
guaranteed ways to know if your food is
done. There are two types of inexpensive

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.890
food thermometers for the home. Stem
thermometers and digital. I'll be using a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
stem thermometer today which is very
common. With a new thermometer and every

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.700
few months after you need to calibrate
it. This is simple to do by using an ice

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829
water bath and adjusting the thermometer
to 32 degrees after 30 seconds in the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.690
water. A good rule of thumb is to
calibrate quarterly or before big events

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.820
like holidays or other large family
gatherings. Before using the thermometer

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.500
make sure it is clean. If you check the
food and it's not the right temperature,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
always wash it before checking again,
otherwise you might be spreading

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.640
bacteria. Now that this thermometer is
calibrated I can use it to check the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
temperature of any food I'm cooking. With
this stem thermometer I need to insert

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.810
from the tip to the dimple on the stem
and allow 15 seconds for an accurate

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.790
read. When using a thermometer on a cut
of meat always insert it into the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.930
thickest part of the meat. When checking
the temperature of a casserole or soup

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.000
always insert it into the center of the
food. The temperature you need to reach

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.950
will vary depending on the type of food.
To prevent foodborne illness you need to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.950
keep your food out of the temperature
danger zone 40 to 140 degrees. By using

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.030
this simple kitchen tool you can help
make sure your family's food is safe.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.280
But you want to make sure to remove as
much air as possible for the best

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.290
quality. Be sure you use bags labeled for
freezing. These are heavier than food

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
storage bags. If you have something like
a soup or casserole you would like to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.100
save then some plastic or glass
containers or freezer bags work well. No

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.360
matter which method you use make sure
you label and date all your leftovers.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.580
and use them within three or four months
