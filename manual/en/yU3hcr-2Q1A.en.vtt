00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:03.941
For the pajarita

00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.455
a classic spanish model

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:09.455
fold the sheet diagonally

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:11.889
both ways

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.604
it's a ducolor model

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:19.654
the body will be bule, the head white

00:00:19.654 --> 00:00:23.220
so watch the color at the beginning

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:35.752
fold all corner to the centre

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:40.333
it'll be a windmill-base

00:01:03.135 --> 00:01:06.135
unfold everything

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:10.751
connect the diagonals through folds

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:17.017
like indicated by the picture

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:20.017
no need to fold all the way through

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:32.235
the crease will form a small square

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.867
to pull the 4 indicated pionts to the centre easier

00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:46.440
we will make Vallyfolds

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.659
along the diagonal creases 

00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:15.744
now it's easier to pull the middles of the sides to the centre

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:18.744
now we've got a form with 4 flaps 

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:22.134
pull 2 of them in one direction

00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:27.836
then fold the shape in half

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840
now the head

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.276
outside reverse fold

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:38.806
see picture for orientation

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100
flatten it

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.583
and there is the Pajarita!

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:51.216
have fun with it!
