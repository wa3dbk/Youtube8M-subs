00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:08.275
(♪♪♪)

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.415
I'd like to show you some basic
block printing techniques.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.718
We'll be using some
traditional linoleum block,

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:21.221
some Speedy-Cut,
and Speedy-Carve products

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:23.590
to create some
block printing images.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.425
We're going to start off by
transferring an image

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.094
to the linoleum block.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.830
Now you can simply draw your
own image right on the block,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.398
or you can take an image

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.001
that you've either
downloaded as clipart

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.436
or drawn yourself
as a separate sketch,

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.339
and using some graphite paper
you can transfer that image

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.641
onto the block.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.944
Simply lay the graphite paper
onto the block

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.346
and then the image
over the top of it,

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.915
and then with
a ballpoint pen,

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.351
trace around the image itself.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.320
Once you've finished
transferring your image,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.555
it's time to start cutting.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.990
When you begin
cutting your block,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.092
you need to
determine what images

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.827
you actually want to print.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.597
The material that you
cut away will not print,

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.232
and everything you
leave on the block

00:01:05.232 --> 00:01:07.901
will actually print onto
your printing paper.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.403
It's also important to
keep in mind

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.371
that if you're printing
letters or numbers

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.108
you'll want to transfer those
in reverse image.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:19.580
There are several cutters you
can use to do block carving,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.016
starting with the
traditional linoleum cutters.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.786
The linoleum cutters
are push-style cutters.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.988
You'll want to use
a bench hook for safety,

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.123
and you'll always want to
push away from you

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.892
when you begin carving.

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.727
With a traditional
linoleum carver,

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:38.065
you'll push into the block
and then try to glide smoothly

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:42.669
along your cut edge,
lifting the material out.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.072
Or you can use
our Lino-Zip Cutter.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.207
The Lino-Zip Cutter is
a safety cutter because

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:50.310
it has a sharpened edge
on the inside of the blade,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.579
so you cut as you're
pulling towards you,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.015
which makes it less likely to
catch a finger

00:01:55.015 --> 00:02:03.357
if the cutter happens to
pull away from the linoleum.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:04.825
Once you finish
carving your block,

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.094
it's time to start
inking up the block.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.163
You can use Speedball
Water-Based Block Printing Ink

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.132
or Oil-Based
Block Printing Ink.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.301
Water-Based Ink cleans up
with soap and water,

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.537
and Oil-Based Ink you'll need
solvents to clean up with.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.805
You can use
your bench hook

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.374
as an inking plate,

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:24.378
applying a liberal amount
of ink onto the plate,

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.813
and using a hard rubber roller

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.384
you want to
spread that ink around.

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:34.054
You want to coat
your brayer with ink

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:36.423
in a nice, even coating,

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.825
and you'll use the brayer
to transfer that ink

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:43.330
onto the linoleum block.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.133
Once you get
a nice even layer,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.936
you want to transfer that
ink in both directions,

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.406
and try to get a nice even
coating of ink

00:02:52.406 --> 00:03:01.882
onto your block.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.316
And now it's time to print.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:05.919
I'm using Speedball
Print Master Printing Paper

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.854
to transfer the image
from the block

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.990
onto the paper itself.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.260
You lay the paper right over
the inked up linoleum block,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.761
and I'm going to be
using a baren

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:16.863
but you can also use
a hard rubber roller

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.332
to create pressure
between the paper itself

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.534
and the block.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.770
You want to add a nice even
amount of pressure

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.406
all the way across the block

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:31.386
so that the ink transfers
as consistently as possible.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.091
And then simply lift your
print right off the block.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:47.227
In addition to traditional
linoleum block

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.228
there are other materials

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:51.598
that offer an easier
cutting surface.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.633
Here we have some
Speedy-Cut materials.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:56.269
Speedy-Cut material is
a medium density

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.004
printing material,

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.307
and then we have here
Speedy-Carve.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:02.876
Speedy-Carve is a very soft
printing material

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.046
which is terrific for beginners
to learn how to cut.

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:08.582
It offers a nice, smooth cut.

00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:12.018
The difference though is
there's a lack of density to it,

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:13.753
so when you want
a highly defined

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:14.721
block printing image

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.456
you'll want to start
with linoleum,

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.225
but if you're
learning the technique

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.960
and you want to do
some practice carving

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.262
or you want some
very simple images,

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.798
then some of the softer
materials like Speedy-Carve

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:29.703
and Speedy-Cut are
a terrific alternative.

00:04:29.703 --> 00:04:32.072
Speedball Art Products offers
a wide variety of

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.173
tools and materials

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.175
so that artists from
beginning to professional

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:36.943
can use our
block printing materials

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.411
to achieve wonderful results.

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:44.251
