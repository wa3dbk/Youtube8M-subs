00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.000
- WHEN DIVIDING
COMPLEX NUMBERS

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.833
OR WRITING COMPLEX NUMBERS
IN FRACTION FORM,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:09.067
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE "I"
IN THE DENOMINATOR.

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:12.300
REMEMBER "I" IS EQUAL
TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF -1,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.067
SO THIS RULE IS VERY SIMILAR
TO NOT HAVING A SQUARE ROOT

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:19.167
IN THE DENOMINATOR
OF A RADICAL EXPRESSION.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.067
SO WHEN THE DENOMINATOR
IS JUST AN IMAGINARY NUMBER,

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.133
WE COULD ELIMINATE THE "I"
FROM THE DENOMINATOR

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:28.233
BY USING THE FACT THAT "I"
SQUARED IS EQUAL TO -1.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.400
NOTICE IF WE MULTIPLY THIS
BY I/I,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.833
THE DENOMINATOR
WOULD BE 3I SQUARED

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.000
AND THEN WE COULD SUBSTITUTE
- 1 FOR "I" SQUARED,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.167
THIS WOULD SIMPLIFY TO -3.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:42.700
BUT WE DO PREFER THE
DENOMINATOR TO BE POSITIVE.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.333
SO INSTEAD OF MULTIPLYING
BY I/I,

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:51.533
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING
TO MULTIPLY BY -I/-I.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.867
AND NOW, WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND MULTIPLY.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:59.033
IN THE NUMERATOR,
WE'LL HAVE -6I,

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.940
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE + 7I
SQUARED,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.973
AND NOTICE THE DENOMINATOR
IS GOING TO BE -3I SQUARED.

00:01:08.973 --> 00:01:12.240
AND NOW, WE'RE GOING TO
SUBSTITUTE -1 FOR "I" SQUARED

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.507
BOTH IN THE DENOMINATOR
AND THE NUMERATOR.

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:25.140
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -6I + 7
x -1 ALL/-3 x -1.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.907
AND NOW, LET'S SIMPLIFY THIS
AGAIN.

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:29.607
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD
AND PUT THE REAL PART FIRST

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:32.540
AND THE IMAGINARY PART SECOND
IN THE NUMERATOR.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.407
SO NOTICE
HOW WE'D HAVE -7 - 6I,

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:41.840
AND WE CAN LEAVE THE QUOTIENT
IN THIS FORM,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.740
BUT SOMETIMES THIS IS ALSO
BROKE UP INTO 2 TERMS

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.973
WHERE WE HAVE THE REAL NUMBER
FIRST

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.840
AND IMAGINARY NUMBER SECOND.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.973
SO IF WE DID THAT, NOTICE
HOW WE'D HAVE -7/3 - 6/3I.

00:01:56.973 --> 00:02:04.447
BUT 6/3 SIMPLIFIES TO 2,
SO WE HAVE -7/3 - 2I.

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:07.613
IT CAN ALSO BE EXPRESSED
IN THIS FORM.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:11.313
NOW, LET'S LOOK
AT OUR SECOND EXAMPLE.

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:13.180
WHERE WE HAVE A COMPLEX NUMBER
A DENOMINATOR

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.547
THAT HAS BOTH A REAL PART
AND AN IMAGINARY PART,

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.947
WE'RE GOING TO MULTIPLY BOTH
THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:21.947
BY THE COMPLEX CONJUGATE
OF THE DENOMINATOR.

00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:25.380
SO BECAUSE THE DENOMINATOR
IS -3 + 4I,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:34.413
WE'RE GOING TO MULTIPLY
BY -3 - 4I/-3 - 4I.

00:02:34.413 --> 00:02:36.547
SO WE'LL HAVE 4 PRODUCTS
IN THE NUMERATOR

00:02:36.547 --> 00:02:41.347
AND 4 PRODUCTS
IN THE DENOMINATOR.

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:49.780
SO WE'LL HAVE -2 x -3
THAT'S 6, -2 x -4I THAT'S +8I,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.713
+5I x -3I THAT'S -15I,

00:02:54.713 --> 00:03:01.087
AND THEN +5I x -4I
THAT'S -20I SQUARED.

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:06.887
AND THEN THE DENOMINATOR
WILL HAVE -3 x -3 THAT'S 9,

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:12.220
AND THEN -3 x -4I THAT'S +12I,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.553
THEN WE HAVE +4I x -3I
THAT'S -12I,

00:03:17.553 --> 00:03:20.620
AND THE LAST PRODUCT
IS GOING TO BE 4I x -4I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.020
OR -16I SQUARED.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.353
SO NOW, WE'RE GOING TO COMBINE
THE MEASURING NUMBERS

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:33.387
AND SUBSTITUTE -1
FOR "I" SQUARED.

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:35.787
SO IN THE NUMERATOR,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 6,

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:39.387
AND THEN WE HAVE 8 - 15I
THAT'S -7I

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:46.620
OR - 7I - 20 x -1
FOR "I" SQUARED.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.620
NOTICE IN THE DENOMINATOR,

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.120
WE HAVE OPPOSITE MEASURING
NUMBERS HERE AND HERE,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.320
THAT'S 0, SO WE HAVE 9 - 16,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.353
AND THEN AGAIN "I" SQUARED
IS EQUAL TO -1.

00:03:59.353 --> 00:04:01.993
SO LOOKING AT THE NUMERATOR,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 6,

00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:08.893
SO THE +20, SO 26 - 7I, THE
DENOMINATOR IS GOING TO BE 9

00:04:08.893 --> 00:04:13.293
AND THIS WILL BE +16 OR 25.

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:16.227
SO WE CAN EXPRESS
THIS QUOTIENT IN THIS FORM

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:19.193
OR AGAIN, IF WE WANT TO,

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.160
WE CAN BREAK THIS UP
INTO 2 TERMS.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.327
THE REAL PART WOULD BE 26/25

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:29.193
AND THE MEASURING PART
WOULD BE -7/25I.

00:04:32.427 --> 00:04:33.793
OKAY. I HOPE YOU FOUND
THIS HELPFUL.
