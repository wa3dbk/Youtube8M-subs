00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.230
The chance of seeing wildlife in the
wild is one of the exciting things about

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.329
visiting Great Smoky Mountains
National Park.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.039
Some of the larger animals that may be
encountered while hiking in the park

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.830
are deer,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.330
wild hogs

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.670
black bears and even elk.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.690
It's important to be alert at all times
while hiking on park trails

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.830
to avoid surprising wildlife.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.520
Animals are naturally wary of humans
and generally choose to avoid us.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.560
If approached too closely or disturbed,
they may become aggressive.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.449
Ursus americanus, the american black
bear,

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.589
is a favorite among park visitors and a
symbol of the wild and natural Great

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.460
Smoky Mountains.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.649
Though they can be entertaining to watch,

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.530
and may appear docile,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.810
bears are large, wild animals and
their behavior is sometimes

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.570
unpredictable.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.439
Never feed or approach bears.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.080
We do have a regulation in place that
hopefully

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.940
helps people understand what a safe
distance may be between people and bears.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.080
I'm standing at a distance of
about fifty yards, and normally that's a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.640
safe distance between people and
bears.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.030
We tell people not to willfully approach

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.750
fifty yards or closer

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.719
or any distance that displaces or disturbs
a bear.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.229
Sometimes it's different in judging distance inside a wooded area versus out in an

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.170
open field, so a person needs to have a  
good grasp of what about fifty yards is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.360
whenever they walk into bear habitat.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.000
We have about 1,600 bears in the
park.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.600
We also have a lot of people and, as you
can imagine, we have a lot of garbage as well.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.610
So really, the fundamental way that we manage
bears for the most part is to keep

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.210
our food and or our garbage away from black bears.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.380
By doing so, it helps to maintain
that wild behavior that they have and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.299
they do relatively well. Mother bears teach their cubs to be afraid of people and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.440
also the smell of people, and when they
do that, they know that's the best for

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.959
them and also for their cubs for the future
too.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.349
Unfortunately, these animals loose their fear of people

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.329
by getting our food and garbage, too--
to be rewarded for tolerating our presence.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.219
Many people don't understand that nighttime garbage in a developed area along

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.189
a trail really gets this whole process
started where we have an animal change

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.299
from an animal with a good wild behavior
to an animal that

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.119
can cause problems or can cause some risk for our visitors.

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.849
You know, one of the most common
questions that we get from visitors,

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.299
and even a concern by some visitors, is

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.519
what do I do if I see a bear. Attacks on
humans are extremely rare but doing some

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.879
basic proper responses, you can greatly
minimize the chance of an attack on a

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:50.929
human being.

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.699
If you're hiking on a trail and you have the
opportunity to see a black bear, and you're

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.089
a good distance away,

00:02:56.089 --> 00:03:00.929
then it's OK to stand there and watch the bear and enjoy the bear too. Don't approach the bear any closer.

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:05.069
Two important behaviors that people need
to basically understand in black bears

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.699
is offensive versus defensive behavior.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.709
In the case of defensive behavior,

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.239
in a situation where the bear swats the
ground,

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.359
he vocalizes, such as blowing, popping his  jaws, slapping vegetation, lunges at you,

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.279
as what we call a "bluff charge".

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.929
really what the animal is saying is that you're too close. You're in that animal's space

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.989
and he wants you to back up and that's
what you should do. You should talk to the

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.049
bear in a low tone of voice. Slowly
backup and try to increase that space

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.869
to hopefully protect you and also the
bear. And hopefully the bear will do the same.

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.599
In the other case, though, where a bear approaches
someone, he does not vocalize, he does

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.799
not bluff charge, he does not swat vegetation, as in defensive behavior,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.820
and normally the bear will come very quickly and steadily

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.080
Some have described as the head of the animal is very low to the ground,

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.239
the ears tend to lay back.

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.169
In that regard, we term that as an offensive 
behavior.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.409
So that bear is coming to us for some
reason; it's probably after our food,

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.849
but in some extremely rare cases it may
be evaluating us as potential prey species.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.549
We advise people to try to give the bear the right of way if it wants to travel a certain direction,

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.009
try to let the animal do so.

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.329
Change your direction, see if that makes a
difference. 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.220
If that doesn't work and the bear continues to approach you,

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.290
we advise people if you are in a group
to get close together, wave your arms, yell.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.270
Try to get on higher ground or on a rock.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.770
Try to make yourself bigger.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.630
Pick up a rock or stick and throw it toward the animal.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.719
And try to make yourself more dominant

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:38.599
and more authoritative than the animal.
Try to reestablish your dominance over that bear.

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.859
If you do all those things and it still doesn't work, and the bear continues to approach you,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.580
If you think the bear's after your
food and it makes contact with you,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.569
you need to separate yourself from your food.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.829
Don't protect your food at all
cost, that's for sure. 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.500
However if the bear does not show interest to your food, and the bear continues to come towards you and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.360
basically jumps on you, we tell people to
fight back aggressively.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.840
Do not, absolutely, do not play dead in a case where you are attacked by a black bear.

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.410
Help protect others.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.580
Report all bear incidents to a park
ranger immediately.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.419
Bear pepper spray may be carried by
hikers within the park for protection

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.080
against bodily harm from aggressive
wildlife.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.019
It must be commercially manufactured and
labeled as bear pepper spray

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:25.169
and be registered with the
environmental protection agency and

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.860
individual states.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.909
Bearspray must contain between one
to two percent of the active ingredients

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.900
capsaicin and related capsaicinoids.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.120
Attacks on humans are rare and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.309
can be avoided by giving animals plenty of space

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.860
and by following park rules for food and
garbage storage and disposal.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.199
Remember to be aware of your
surroundings at all times, and be

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.210
watchful for all forms of wildlife while out
hiking.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.919
The opportunity to safely observe
wildlife in its natural habitat is one

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.159
of the privileges we gain by preserving this great and vital landscape.
