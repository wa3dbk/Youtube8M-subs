00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.350
Historically we've developed lens tints...

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.790
primarily contrasting one color to
another.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.599
We have a compromise there.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.110
As we've developed Prizm, one of the
primary drivers is a better understanding

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.810
what we want to see in the environment

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.240
and minimizing the compromises we make.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.660
The path started with gaining a
theoretical understanding how the eye works.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.760
There's some unique features in the way
your brain and your eyes are working.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.780
Those unique features are what enable us
to play with

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.620
tailoring light to increase contrast.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.680
In Prizm the practical followed the theory.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.580
The theory was developed, and then we found
the tools we needed

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.120
to build what we had envisioned on paper.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.720
Prizm technology is something
we've been working on for...

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.310
fifteen years.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.000
The new factors for us are better understanding the environment

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100
which we brought in the hyperspectral camera.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.640
They would go into these environments and
they would point it at

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.680
these certain conditions and measure the entire
spectrum...

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.379
and then they do it over and over and
over again and then bring it back to the lab

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.510
and we'd analyze this data look at it and we
would find these patterns in these

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.690
conditions, and we're like okay we're seeing
the same

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.980
spectral peaks in these places and we know
that we can filter the spectral peaks specifically.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.780
It was just a step of creating the ingredients

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.570
in order to copy what was on the
computer into a real lens,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.940
and that's what started it.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.620
The other tools are the actual dyes, or absorbers we put into the lens.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.120
The big win for us was to be able to find the dye

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.500
that had these really narrow absorption
peaks

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910
that were really similar to the
transmission piece we we're seeing in nature 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.860
and in these environments.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.510
The old dyes used to be this big bell curve and you would absorb everything underneath

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.840
this bell curve, now we have these small
peaks that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.050
we can build in the environment and
everything in between there would still

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.320
come to you and be let in...

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.540
and now we had this
lens that worked over greater amount of environments.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.240
So when you can take a picture and
really understand how colors

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.600
made in that image,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.370
then you can design a lens around those
real colors that you actually have data.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.590
Gaining that understanding of how it worked

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.400
enabled us to tailor these lenses to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.700
every light environments that our
athletes are working in.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.620
Through that interaction with the
athlete and understanding

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.960
what's important for them to see,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.330
once we understand the environment we'll
go in and we'll turn the knob and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.350
we'll accentuate their object of desire.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.080
We've done a bunch of color science and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.970
looking at the biology of the eye

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.660
and found that there's two specific colors where your eye is very sensitive to details.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.360
So there's a very specific blue and a very specific orange

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840
So in Prizm Snow we're going in and
adapting and boosting those colors

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.889
and filtering the other colors out.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.190
When we first tried it with Lindsey Vonn, one of the feedback that we got was that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.530
She didn't have to close her eyes when she goes
around the corner,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.840
which we didn't understand at first.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.040
She was starting out in the trees in kind of a lower light condition, so when she

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.480
came around a tree, suddenly you have
a bright sunny light in your eyes,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.800
So you kind of have to close your eyes  and let your eyes adapt.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.180
With Prizm, there's not that big of a change
in total light transmission,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.220
it's still blocking most of that light,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.980
so your eyes don't have to adjust
nearly as much.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240
In the case of snow, think about good
light and bad light...

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.730
Good light is what I would call the
colors that your eye is very sensitive to.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.110
Bad light is a color that maybe washes
out your color vision.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.950
We can let a huge amount of the good
light through,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.450
and we can take away almost all of the bad light.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.480
We've come to understand what those colors are and we can manage them very well now.
