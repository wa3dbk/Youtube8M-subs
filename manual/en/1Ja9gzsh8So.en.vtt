00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.300
Volvo is a unique car company.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.000
Everything starts with people.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.533
Since 1927 our heritage,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.267
our Swedish culture
and our focus on humanity,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.533
have all helped shape our philosophy:

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.100
To help people, to make their lives
easier and more enjoyable,

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.333
while also protecting them from harm.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.500
Our founders stated:
"Cars are driven by people."

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.067
"The guiding principle behind
everything we make at Volvo,"

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.933
"therefore is,
and must remain, safety."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.567
This emphasis
on safety, people and quality

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.533
has been a feature
of our cars ever since,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.700
as has our passion for pioneering
automotive and environmental innovation

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.267
and distinctive, Swedish design.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.300
This rich heritage continues
to inform what Volvo does today

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.833
and shapes its future.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.567
Volvo cars might never have happened

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.900
if it had not been for a chance meeting
between two friends

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:18.200
in a Stockholm restaurant
on an August evening in 1924.

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.167
Two friends who shared
a passion for cars

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.900
and a vision of starting
a Swedish car company.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.933
After that meeting our founders,
Assar Gabrielsson -

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.133
a well-travelled economist
and sales specialist -

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.867
and Gustaf Larson, a talented engineer
with a background in engine design,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:42.333
began working on plans to make
the finest Swedish car possible.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.300
Gabrielsson was also working for
the ball bearing manufacturer SKF,

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.400
who owned the brand name Volvo.

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.200
Fittingly,
for a maker of steel ball bearings,

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.433
the name means "I roll" in Latin.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.867
The initial design concepts

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.800
emerged from Gustaf Larson's apartment
in central Stockholm in mid-1925,

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:11.067
and in 1926 testing began
on the first ten prototypes,

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.867
personally funded by Assar Gabrielsson.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.300
On the 14th of April 1927

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:22.667
the first Volvo production car,
the 2 litre Ã–V4, nicknamed "Jakob",

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.800
rolled out of the factory
in Hisingen, Gothenburg,

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.567
bearing the iconic Iron Mark logo.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:33.433
The company
we now know as Volvo was born.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:39.367
Back in 1927 three factors contributed
to Volvo's early success.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.767
Sweden's growing
industrial capabilities,

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:45.067
the availability of premium quality
local steel

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.167
and a genuine need for strong,
high-quality cars

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.000
as imported vehicles didn't survive
long on weatherworn Swedish roads.

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:57.200
Since then, Sweden's distinctive
culture, respect for nature

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:00.667
and focus on social well-being
have contributed to

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:03.967
the evolution of Volvo
as a unique, human focused company.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.433
Nowhere else in the world
could have produced this company.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:11.800
Volvo has always had a uniquely
Swedish approach to car design,

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:16.467
setting out to satisfy human needs
and in the process driving desire.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:22.300
This approach can be traced from our
earliest luxury cars to the PV444.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:27.967
Launched in 1944, this family sports
saloon was Volvo's first big success

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.167
and our first major breakthrough
into the United States.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.567
From the beautiful Amazon
of the 50s and 60s

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:37.200
to the iconic P1800

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:41.700
and onto today's state-of-the-art XC90
and concept designs for the future

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:46.833
our aim has always been to design
premium cars that make life better.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.400
Volvo has also constantly
developed technical innovations

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:55.333
that have made driving not only
more enjoyable, but also safer.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.700
There can be few people on the planet
who have saved as many lives

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:02.500
as Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin.

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.967
His revolutionary
three-point safety belt design

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:11.767
made its debut
in the Volvo PV544 from 1959.

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:16.867
Since then it is estimated
to have saved over 1 million lives

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:20.600
because Volvo Cars
waived its patent rights

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:24.400
so that everybody could benefit,
whatever car they drive.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.933
In 1964 Volvo tested the world's first

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.700
rear-facing child seat prototype
in a PV544.

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.733
The first of many
child safety innovations.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.600
In 1976 Volvo launched the world's
first child booster cushion,

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:47.067
an invention now used across the world
that has saved countless young lives.

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:51.900
Also in 1976
Volvo gave the world the Lambda Sond.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:58.133
This oxygen sensing probe reduces
harmful exhaust emissions by 90%.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.300
The California Air Resources Board
called it

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.067
"The most significant
breakthrough ever made"

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:07.500
"in the control
of vehicle exhaust emissions."

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:09.967
Once again Volvo gave it to the world

00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:15.100
and today virtually every petrol
engine car in the world has one.

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.933
Volvo's international reputation
for environmental standards

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.200
and advanced safety
was confirmed in 1976

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:27.300
when the US government
used a Volvo 240 as the benchmark

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.767
to set safety standards
for all new cars,

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:34.800
and in 1978 when it was named
"the USA's cleanest car."

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:38.367
Since then, Volvo has strived
to lessen its impact on the environment

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:42.200
through innovation in every part
of the life cycle of our cars.

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:45.700
For instance, now all the electricity
in Volvo's Swedish factories

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:47.800
comes from hydro-electric power.

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:52.533
And in line with our vision of building
the safest, most energy efficient cars,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.933
Geely, our Chinese owner,
is committed to the development

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.767
of a new generation
of sustainable technologies.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:04.200
Volvo's mission is to make people's
lives better and less complicated.

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:07.167
Our goal is that by the year 2020

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:11.367
no-one shall be killed
or seriously injured in a new Volvo.

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:15.500
We are working to achieve this
by making our cars smarter than ever.

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:21.933
Now Intellisafe technology can
detect pedestrians even in the dark,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.533
plus cyclists, animals
and objects around the car,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.100
preventing accidents
before they happen.

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.767
And our Drive Me autonomous
driving program means that soon

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:37.700
Volvos will be able to look after some
of the less exciting driving aspects,

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:43.133
such as stop-and-go traffic, allowing
drivers more time to enjoy life.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.567
Of course, our self-driving cars

00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:49.533
will be safer, save fuel
and reduce emissions,

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.700
helping to improve
everyone's quality of life.

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.967
We think our founders
would have approved.
