00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.590
Daddy Clay: &nbsp;Today in the lab, we review
2012 Chevy Volt.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:16.099
[music]
Clay: &nbsp;After spending just over a week with

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.749
the Chevy Volt here, I am willing to say that
this may be the coolest car currently produced

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.749
in North America.

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.179
Why do I say that?

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.849
Well, partly from the feedback I got from
the fifth graders in my kids elementary school.

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.490
They kept asking me, "Hey, is that a Chevy
Volt?"

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.590
Also my old high school buddies, who gave
me lots of props for driving this thing to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.390
a recent reunion, this car turns heads.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.690
One of the things, that of course, attracts
attention about this car is the propulsion

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.690
system.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.260
It is an electric vehicle.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.140
It's driven by a 450 pound, five and a half
foot long Tâ€‘shaped lithium ion battery that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.390
sits right down the middle of the vehicle.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.920
That thing produces lots of power.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.420
But, unlike other electric vehicles this car
also features a 1.4 liter gas engine that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.750
serves as a generator and extends the range
of this car from the 30 or 40 miles that you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.819
might expect from an all electric vehicle
to over 350 miles.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:18.409
In case of emergencies that 1.4 liter gas
engine will actually drive the wheels.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.609
So, It's not an all electric vehicle but,
most of the time it is.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.430
The driving experience in the Chevy Volt is
really quite pleasant.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.030
First of all, listen, so quiet, that electric
motor is almost completely silent which is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.510
so pleasant.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.350
The steering feel weight is solid and good.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.009
You can tell the heavy battery keeps this
vehicle very firmly planted down on the ground.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.289
It's got a low center of gravity, so it doesn't
have very much body mean at all in the turns.

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.859
The highlight here of course is that electric
acceleration with almost no sound at all.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.029
This car launches itself very, very willingly,
particularly when you got in the sport mode.

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:59.549
The braking here, well it's not so great.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.819
That's to be expected because with all electric
vehicles you've got regenerative brakes.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.190
That is the energy captured by the brakes
is then funneled back into the battery.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.880
The response is well, brick like with no feedback.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.770
So sometimes you come close to rear ending
people.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.660
But, it's worth it to save the world.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.970
Listen to this, you know what that is?

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.220
That's your pedestrian warning horn.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.900
It's a quiet and non jarring horn that you
use to warn people that a silent car's approaching.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.030
I used it several times on Halloween to keep
from smooching to the trees.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.860
The interior, I like.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.880
I find this black leather to be very luxurious.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.530
The seats are extremely supportive both in
front and back, you've got these very nice

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.000
bucket seats.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.790
The Telematics, they're very compelling.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.050
While in some care you may be compelled to
drive fast and push the performance, almost

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.900
video game like aspects of these two seven
inch full color screens, make it almost like

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:07.600
a video game to try and save energy, conserve
your battery, be green.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.140
This beast of a lithium ion battery is mounted
transversely through the car, right under

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.250
here.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.880
The price of that however, only two backseats.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.730
They are latched enabled, but if you've got
three kids like me, this can be a deal killer.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.110
The overall driving impression, well, it's
little unlike anything you've ever driven

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.480
before because of the electric propulsion
system.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.180
The interior is what you'd expect from an
entry level luxury sedan and the telematics

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.900
and the color display, it's just downright
nerdy.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.710
The volt is cool but, is it better than the
competition?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.680
That depends on who you think the competition
is ?. Is it an all electric vehicle, like

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.740
the Nissan Leaf?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.569
Well, I think, it's clearly better from both
the standpoint of its looks which is more

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.740
dad friendly and the performance because of
the range extending gas engine.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.650
But, is that really the competition?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.069
It's clearly much more money than the Nissan
Leaf.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.430
As a matter of fact, at nearly $44,000, this
car prices more than a entry level BMW or

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.880
Mercedes.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.960
That's not the whole story because currently
the government is offering $7,500 tax rebate.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.310
That's not a credit, that's $7,500 dollars
off the top for the purchase of an electric

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.310
vehicle.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.090
Plus you have to take in the gas savings,
the government estimates you will save average

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.510
$7,500 over an average car in gas savings
alone.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.350
What does this vehicle really cost?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.639
And should it be compared to a $30,000 sedan.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.910
If so, I think this could be a fantastic choice.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.280
If you're a dad of two or if your kids' values
design and technology, then be green over

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.840
pure performance, the Chevy Volt maybe worth
having a look at.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.410
We want to thank our sponsors BabyBjorn, speaking
of technology and design, have you seen BabyBjorn

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.720
Travel Crib Light unfold.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.940
It's nothing short of electric.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.250
Thanks BabyBjorn, thanks Chevy and we'll see
you next time here in the Lab.
