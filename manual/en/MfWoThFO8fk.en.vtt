00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:11.719
Well, Strawberry Fields was one of Lennon's songs.  It just had a nice ring to it.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.223
We grow strawberries, we're out in the field.  My wife and I were never hippies.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:22.063
In fact, having been a soldier in Vietnam, I was kind of an anti-hippy kind of a guy.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:30.655
But, I liked the Beatles songs.  They had a nice ring.

00:00:30.656 --> 00:00:33.950
We've been running this greenhouse business since 1976.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:38.287
So, this is our 38th year of business here.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:42.166
My wife went to high school here.  We were just friends at the time...

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:48.422
She invited me to come to Kodiak and visit, and so I came.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.716
It was like love at first sight for the island for me.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:55.555
I was struck by the fact that there wasn't any landscaping going on.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:02.311
Everybody had crab pots in the front of their homes, and junk vehicles.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:06.023
There was no landscaping at all.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:10.987
People were mostly just interested in their house plants inside of their house.

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.197
We changed over from a house plant operation,

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:16.951
to growing bedding plants or local gardeners.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:22.748
It was a pioneer venture, growing things to make them available for people here locally.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.419
Because there were a few successful gardeners around,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.838
it seemed to me to be something that would work.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:33.634
It wasn't always rewarding in the beginning.  There weren't a lot of customers.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.386
There wasn't a lot of interest in it.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.805
That finally changed over time.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:44.228
My wife and I will probably work 12 hour days for at least 3 months.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.815
The farmers market the last two years has been quite a phenomenal hit.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:52.862
In the last two years, there are over 50 new greenhouses in the community.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:55.239
It's changed everything.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.619
You know, organic has always been a big drawing card for people,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.998
but, locally grown is even more important to a consumer.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.961
They want to have stuff that's locally grown. They want to know where the stuff came from.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:16.344
And it's a community thing.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:20.389
When you go to the farmer's market, you'll see a couple hundred people there.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.308
It's a neat little community event, actually.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.603
But, it is a challenge to grow here.

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:27.355
Last year was probably one of the toughest years we've went through.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:29.982
The snow was so high, it literally covered the whole greenhouse.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.152
My grandson walked from one side of the greenhouse to the other.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:38.074
Just walked right over it because there was so much snow.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:38.991
This year was just the opposite.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.911
There was no snow at all when I began the operation.

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.872
One year after the other, it's never the same.  It's always a challenge.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:51.337
I get a lot of satisfaction in seeing things grow.

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:53.881
I like starting the seeds and watching them germinate.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:56.133
It's always fascinated me.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:03:00.556
I don't think I'll ever lose my fascination with growing things.

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:14.027
It's raining out. (laughs).
