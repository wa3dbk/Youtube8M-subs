Mr. Gibbs:
You got it?

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:58.000
President Obama:
Yeah. That's for keeping his dad
away too many hours of the day.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.700
Mr. Gibbs:
Need more books than that.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.734
(laughter)

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:04.166

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.734

I'm just kidding.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.433

President Obama:
Thank you so much, guys. You
have a wonderful bookstore.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.834
Hopefully this will be a little
easier to make sure everybody

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.367
has health insurance
while we're working.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:33.133

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.400
(laughter)

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.700
It's not every day the
President stops by.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.734
See you guys.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:56.734

Take care.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:57.700

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.300
President Obama:
Thank you. Well, I bought a
couple of books for the girls.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.500
Let's see. Called
Journey to the Sea River.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.800
And the Secret of Zones,
based on recommendations.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.100
So we'll see, of course,
you know, the questions,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.600
how they take to them.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
But I think they're
going to like this.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.166
The Press:
Nothing for Mrs. Obama?

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.433

me into trouble.

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.100

This is Elijah.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.500
President Obama:
Hi, Elijah. How are you?

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:27.767

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:32.266
I remember. I'm liking
that. That was terrific.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:34.066
All right, guys. All right.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.000
