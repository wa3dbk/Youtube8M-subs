that balcony in the room mail so brought
him a surge protector which was really

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.260
helpful uh... because it's only couple
small clubs that you can use in the room

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.150
was able to also bryon to basel one
which is legally you can't do that they

drinks are all week long from the
alcohol that adding actually stuck on

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.890
you know you're not allowed to bring on
alcohol but i'd put it that some clear

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.470
up colonies propel uh... water bottles
and thus the fat out of that plastic

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.110
sleeve there sprint back and i was okay
with that put them a check back else

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.910
brought in awesome you know that's the
water flavoring because the water does

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.300
it is a great honor and on a cruise

that he was able to make some mixed race
within a year that makes that was the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.619
fruit from a car for the birthday

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.150

Cruise Advice For First Timers
this in the things that i brought on

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.289
board that made up my cruise blog
territorial now something else is that

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:17.010
i_d_ would highly suggest that if you
have an opportunity the funds to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.260
get a balcony allied with them
definitely suggest doing so this was the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.889
view from my balcony

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:30.889
this balcony was a very very back of the
boat which is great to see your sound

last pal

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:39.849
hammett

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.949
that uh... i strong-arm about it for the
nice snap out there

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.819
and something else that you might wanna
consider a good trip is that you really

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.669
make sure you pack

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.650
um... out what of stuffing carried on
that you're gonna get and these are a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.579
lot of stuff but

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.449
stuff that you need chiles maybe get
sheet to the first pork because wealthy

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.279

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:05.919
luggage comes from change check your
checkbook two bags at the

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.710
at the port

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.440
and then they will show up at your door
at a later time could be up to six hours

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.470
and i've seen many people come from
cold-weather climates with their pants

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.229
in this waiters are walking around the
cruise

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.769
uh... should for six hours while they're
waiting for their bags seat to get to

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.389
the room so they can change also if you
lose your vendor if your airline loses

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.499
