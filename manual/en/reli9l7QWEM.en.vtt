00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
What is this?

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:34.790
The border of the Russian empire!
No more Bonaparte in Russia!

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.707
That's it. Hurray!

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.118
This campaign is lost... But not the war.

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:52.608
Well, fellas, the war is over.
Take my word for it.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:55.655
Your Excellency,
but what about an offensive?

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:01.516
You are all too eager to catch Napoleon.

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:07.480
His tea, and his trail went cold long ago.
Methinks he is gathering a fresh army and,

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.092
believe me, he will.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:30.573
Count Kutuzov is worried
about the soldiers.

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:34.875
They are not so strong.
They have scarce provision.

00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.984
How so? How come we retreat?
We didn't even fight!

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.853
May God be my judge.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.437
Prepare the text of the Manifesto
and the Decree. We are moving out â€” now.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110
Squadron!

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.771
Alyosha, take command.
I'm through with fighting.

00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.807
Your sword.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:44.137
Where is Napoleon?

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:57.156
Here you go, Samoilov.
The hell you caught Napoleon.
