00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.260
Purdue University’s INhome conveys a perfect
blend of versatility, comfort, and innovation.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.010
The INhome is a family-style home with Midwest
inspiration in perfect harmony with its natural

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.240
environment year round. By adapting to climates
of all seasons, the INhome is able to provide

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.929
a safe, energy-efficient residence. The INhome
harnesses the sun’s power to generate electricity

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.770
from an array of 8 kilowatt photovoltaic panels.
This will enable the house to become net zero.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.390
The INhome also utilizes passive shading techniques
to optimize house performance. For example,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.829
the south facing windows allow sunlight to
enter the house during the winter, and the

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.170
roof overhang shades them in the summer.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.380
As you enter the house, the open floor design
sets a unique atmosphere that only the INhome

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.489
design can provide. Having the living room,
dining room, and kitchen openly designed allows

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.719
for easy conversation with family and friends.
The vaulted ceiling enhances the elegance

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.700
of the house by eliminating the compact feeling
often associated with smaller homes. The vaulted

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.880
ceiling empowers free and natural daylighting
from the clerestory windows, which open to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.540
provide natural ventilation throughout the
house when outdoor weather conditions are

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.930
desirable.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.530
Another keynote feature to the INhome is the
Biowall, which is integrated with the HVAC

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.909
system to filter out contaminants within the
air. This also reduces the need to mechanically

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.390
ventilate the house and allows for a better
union with nature.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.119
The bathroom is centrally located and convenient
to all areas.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.520
Fully equipped with the most cost-effective
and energy-efficient appliances on the market,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.509
the open kitchen design is efficient and allows
social interaction while preparing meals.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.420
During the day, the office can be used as
a quiet place for study, finances, and reading,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.719
as well as doubling as a guest bedroom or
a second bedroom if necessary to accommodate

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.350
a growing family.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.640
The washer and dryer are nestled together
in a separate utility room between the garage

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640
and kitchen.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.590
Finally, the master bedroom is a private get-a-way
from the rest of the house. It features direct

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.020
access into the bathroom.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.200
For the warmer months, a side porch is conveniently
located off of the master bedroom, allowing

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.950
residents a retreat from their day.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.160
The attached garage completes the INhome as
it is convenient and useful for homeowners

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.940
who have to deal with the extreme weather
conditions present in the Midwest. Purdue’s

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.650
INhome, efficient, practical, essential. From
INhome to YOUR home.
