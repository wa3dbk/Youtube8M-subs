00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.270
All right everyone.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.940
Right now we're going to talk about how to
do what's called lead belaying for indoor

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.580
sport climbing.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.449
So similar to the same principal that we used
earlier when top roping, the break end of

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.500
the rope is the end coming out from the bottom
of your belay device towards the ground.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.560
You're going to grab that with your right
hand, palm facing down and once you grab it,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.460
you're never going to let go of that break
end.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.200
Really important; never, never release the
break.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.800
So, as a climber's moving up the wall, one
critical thing that you're going to be doing

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.180
lead belaying is giving slack to the climber.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.500
Allowing rope to actually feed in both directions
so that the climber has more rope as they're

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.590
moving up.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.410
You're also going to be breaking that belay
device and prepare to catch any falls in case

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110
the climber comes off the wall.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.239
But you're still never going to be letting
go of that break end.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.880
Before the climber makes the first clip, you're
going to be spotting them similar to the way

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.140
you would if the climber was bouldering.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.399
Once Gaz makes his first clip, he'll be on
belay and I'll be ready to be belaying.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:13.310
So go ahead Gaz you can start climbing.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.789
Now that Gaz has made that clip, I'll put
him on belay, pulling out any extra slack

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.950
that he may have paid out at the beginning.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.490
As Gaz clips I'm sliding my right hand down
the rope and feeding rope into the belay device.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.890
As he moves up the wall, I'm just feeding
rope through that belay device allowing Gaz

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.439
to climb higher.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.270
When he's ready to make another clip, I'll
slide my right hand down and feed him about

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.210
an arm's length.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.659
Once he's made the clip, I can pull in any
extra slack and reset my hands and prepare

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.259
to give Gaz some more rope as he continues
up the wall.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:04.589
And that is the basics for how to lead belay.
