00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.852
- So let's talk
about how bone forms.

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:05.852
Like, where does your bone come
from in the first place?

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:08.727
And this is relevant,
because there are actually

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:13.685
two different processes
by which bone organs form.

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.310
And they don't
come out of nowhere.

00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:18.059
It's not like a random
mesenchymal

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.477
cell is going to say,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.975
"Oh, gee, I feel
like we need a bone here,

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.393
so let's build some bone."

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:29.143
In the process of development,
like fetal development,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.685
when you are just a little slime
inside your mama's belly,

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.975
you at a certain point,

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.226
about eight weeks along,
your body says,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.518
"We now have structures
in place to build bone."

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.894
And there's two ways
that that happens.

00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:48.810
The first one that we're going
to talk about is called

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:55.894
intramembranous ossification.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:01:03.685
Doesn't ossification
make you think of bone?

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.685
Yeah, we're making bone,
dog pound.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:10.477
So all bone formation,

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:15.685
you have to start with some sort
of connective tissue precursor.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:20.685
You can't make bone
out of a random cell,

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:24.143
or out of a muscle cell,
or out of epithelial tissue.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:29.018
Bone has to come
from an existing

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:32.975
connective tissue model almost.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.685
And in the case
of intramembranous ossification,

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.477
there is a dense,

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:42.268
irregular, connective tissue,
for like of a better word,

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:52.310
membrane where the bone
will form.

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.018
So visualize.

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:57.518
Intramembranous ossification
happens with flat bones,

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:00.685
so your skull bone,
like your frontal bone.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.560
There is a dense--
this is back in the day

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:06.894
when you're eight weeks
in your mama's belly.

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.894
There is a flat, dense,
irregular,

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:13.518
connective tissue structure
in your forehead.

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:14.935
And if you--

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.435
somebody went in and,
like, squished your head,

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.643
they'd squish it,
because it's just dense,

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:22.477
irregular, connective tissue.
It is not yet bone.

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:25.351
So the first thing
that happens is that this dense,

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:30.975
irregular, connective tissue
membrane has mesenchymal cells

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.685
in there.
Right?

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.435
It makes perfect sense.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.310
And the mesenchymal cells are
going to differentiate

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:46.435
ultimately into osteoblasts.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.935
And this happens in,
like,

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.185
an ossification center.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.975
Like, there are places
in the dense, irregular,

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.018
connective tissue membrane

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.727
where there's going
to be a thickening.

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:01.310
And the mesenchymal cells

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:04.435
there are going to differentiate
and become osteoblasts,

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.018
and the osteoblasts are going
to start doing their thing.

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:13.185
As they produce bone matrix,

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.310
or bone tissue,

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:18.727
of course they're going to get
trapped and become osteocytes,

00:03:18.751 --> 00:03:20.185
and of course they're going
to build

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.268
their little lacunas
around themselves,

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.975
surrounded by bone matrix.

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:31.351
And eventually they actually
are going to make spongy bone.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:33.351
This would be step three.

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:39.810
The osteoblasts
make spongy bone.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:43.310
And now you
have all this spongy bone,

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:47.143
and the osteoblasts-- oops.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:48.975
We don't go backwards
in our numbers.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:53.143
We go forward most of the time.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.602
The osteoblasts

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:57.975
in the spongy bone keep
building bone, and eventually,

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:01.975
can you visualize
how this spongy bone could,

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.975
if we kept building bone tissue
all around ourselves,

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.560
if we're the osteoblasts,
we could--

00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:13.975
eventually that spongy bone
could turn into compact bone.

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:16.185
And the end model
that you end up

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.018
with is a layer of compact bone.

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.435
So this is my compact bone.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:26.975
And then what's in-between
your compact bone?

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.810
Spongy bone.
A little bit of a mess.

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:31.975
You get what I'm
saying right there.

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.059
And that's like if you
chop a bone in half,

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:36.727
and you look on the inside,
and you look at the bone,

00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:38.975
like, the medullary cavity
in the middle of a bone,

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.810
the space
where the bone marrow is,

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:46.768
it, like, kind of looks spongy.

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:50.393
And that's because there is
spongy bone tissue in there.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:53.393
One thing that I did not
tell you about bone tissue,

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.685
and this is also true
about cartilage.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.435
Let's do it in--
oh, gosh, sure.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:05.975
Bone tissue is surrounded
by a dense, irregular,

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:15.976
connective tissue layer called
the periosteum.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.435
So the tissue that it's
made out of is dense,

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.226
irregular, connective tissue.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.435
The structure is called
the periosteum.

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.975
The periosteum houses
different cells

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.975
that are going to help maintain
and continue building

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.975
and growing this bone,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.101
which originally was formed
through the process

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:38.351
of intramembranous ossification.

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:41.101
How does that work for y'all?

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:44.935
Let's talk about the other
form of ossification,

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.560
which is endochondral
ossification,

00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:49.209
and that's how we end up
with our long bones.
