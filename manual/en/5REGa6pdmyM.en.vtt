00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I live in Luttago in Valle Aurina, placed in Altoadige.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I have been skiing since very little and I started alpine skiing when I was 10 years old. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Obviusly I liked it a lot, but after a while I got bored of the alpine skiing mentality. Serious training. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
After one year when I was 15 years old, I started freestyle skiing, 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We were more free. And we are still more free, so I guess I chose the right sport for me. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.500
Where are my sticks?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I met Markus in a competition in my home resort, Val Gardena, and since then It has always been a challenge of who is the best.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Markus is somebody who knows what he is doing when he skis. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
He thinks of the tricks, he wants to land, and doesn't make mistakes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I would say I'm quite precise, tricks must be quite perfect. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm not happy when I just learn a new trick, there is still work to do, you need to make it better to and land it perfectly.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
At the beginning of next year I will have the most important competition I have ever attended. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.500
So for now I'm skiing a lot and I have some tricks in my head I would like to learn.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
To end with a good result, I'll must keep the concentration, be calm, and keep the passion.
