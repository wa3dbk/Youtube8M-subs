CellTrust has partnered with Samsung to
bring you PULSE,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.730
a pager replacement solution for
critical healthcare messaging.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.559
PULSE uses the same level of security and
redundancy

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.679
used for critical communication by
government agencies across the world.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.950
Now available to healthcare
organizations like yours.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.740
health-care professional no longer have
to rely on multiple devices on their

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.380
belt because by installing the PULSE app

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.540
the Samsung device becomes a
critical communication device

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.449
for both data and voice communication in
addition

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.499
PULSE is designed to support HIPAA
requirements for secure communication

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:38.550
encryption.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.960
CellTrust is one of a few Gold level mobile
security partners with Samsung

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.670
which gives them access to Samsung
proprietary technology and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.969
customizable features. Doctor Dana is a
trauma surgeon

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.120
she's always on call. She sets her
Samsung phone to silent

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.969
as she settles in for a well-deserved
nights sleep. An hour later

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.329
the surgical team administrator send a
group message to doctor Dana's trauma

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.809
team

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.450
through the web based PULSE nursing
portal notifying them that there's

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.759
been a major accident,

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.829
requiring them to report to the trauma
center operating room.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.040
Doctor Dana is awakened by the
continuous beep

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.880
of the secure pager message. Her Samsung push notification

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.960
overrides her silent mode to ensure she receives the urgent message.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.810
The message appears on your mobile
device

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.659
in a secure designated area separate from
her personal messages.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.020
With CellTrust PULSE on their Samsung
mobile devices, Doctor Dana

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.880
and the entire trauma team received the
urgent message in less than 10 seconds

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.670
with their old technology it used to
take up to an average of seven minutes

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.310
and there was no proof that the message
was delivered

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
with PULSE they also have audit trails
and traceability

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
which helps them stay compliant with
HIPAA regulations. There's no need for

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.710
hospital staff to "Page and Pray" anymore.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.760
CellTrust's PULSE acknowledges receipt
and enables the trauma team to respond

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.560
to the hospital

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.920
that their on their way. On route to the
hospital

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.860
Doctor Dana requests additional patient
information through her wearable Samsung

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.600
Gear. Back at the hospital

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.800
trauma nurse Justin also receives the
urgent message

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.460
on his ruggedized Samsung device and he
immediately begins to prepare the trama

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.130
operating room for surgery.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.840
Upon arrival to the hospital, Doctor
Dana changes her PULSE status to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.270
unavailable and her away message to in
surgery,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.510
so her colleagues know she on site but
unavailable.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.160
These precious minutes saved by CellTrust
PULSE

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.000
Technology can make all the difference. How safe is your data when using PULSE?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.980
Very Safe. Data travels through the CellTrust

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.819
server with military-grade encryption.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.140

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.410
as well as the actual user of the device. In addition,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.580

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.690
