00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.600
Not all the activities on Kauai need to get
your adrenaline racing.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.150
Visiting the National Tropical Botanical Gardens
in Poipu is a nice relaxing way to spend your

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:22.550
day.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.510
So Walt, tell me about the gardens.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.369
Darian, weÕre smack dab in the middle of
the National Tropical Botanical Garden south

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.570
shore garden.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.280
At the south shore we have the Allerton garden.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.750
This is a world famous garden, created by
two gentlemen a long time ago.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.469
Our organization, the National Tropical Botanical
Garden oversees it and we take care of it.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:55.129
The garden itself is 85 acres of totally manicured
work of landscape architecture.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.929
And thatÕs just this one garden?

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.539
We are right now in the Allerton, we also
have the McBryde garden which is our garden

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.250
of science and research and is home to our
living collections and our conservation efforts.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.310
Actually over 4000 different species of plants
and trees that have collected and are on display

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.820
in the McBryde Garden.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.810
Wow, 4000 different plants, and you know every
single one of them I hope?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.130
Yeah, I have them all committed to memory.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.130
Not.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.640
Tell me about the tours, are you open all
day every day?

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.990
8 oÕclock to 5, seven days a week.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.619
We offer several different tour packages to
do both of the gardens.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.420
The Allerton tour is a 2.5 hour guided tour
that starts at the visitor center, and we

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.829
take a beautiful tram ride down into this
magnificent valley.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.619
So youÕre not walking for 2.5 hours?

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.329
No, be basically walk about 3/4 of a mile
to a mile during the tour.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.979
We take it in at a nice easy pace.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.859
So if people want to get into that tour theyÕll
have to make a reservation?

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.430
Gotta do a reservation for all of the guided
tours.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.380
We do have self-guided tours of the McBryde
garden, and that goes 7 days a week as well.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.800
WeÕre standing right now under some pretty
famous trees.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.840
These are the Moreton Bay figs, theyÕre native
to southern Australia, and theyÕre very famous,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.420
they were used in Jurassic Park.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.570
This tree right here behind us, this is where
the eggs of the dinosaurs were discovered.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.170
How easily are you found?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.600
WeÕre on the South Shore directly across
from Spouting Horn.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.910
So itÕs really easy to find us, weÕre the
only righthand driveway right at the end of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.910
the road.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:03:07.760
We invite folks to swing in and check out
our visitor center.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.910
Keep in mind that the national tropical botanical
gardens have two different locations.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.470

or go online to NTBG.org.
