Fishtanktv.com on a beautiful Sunday. I don't know how many more Sunday's like this we are going to have left. Frankly I want it to snow cause I want to go snowboarding but that's a whole other story.
It's Sunday. It's species Sunday.  I'm fired up. I'm starting off species Sunday off with something special. I'm outside because it's a good day and my daughter's inside sleeping.
So the lead off hitter, the number one plant for today's species Sunday, how it started off today, species Sunday. Dwarf Sag. This stuff is the shit. Let me show you why. Ok so I have dwarf Sag here. Dwarf Sagittaria. Grows probably 4-5 inches. Stays short. You can trim it. You can cut it. This plant is incredible. There is many different species of sagittarius. I have this variety. I also have some wider variety in my tank. My 90 neon tank that I have to do a water change on.
Great, great beginner plant. Gives you success early and often. Grows well and it is very hardy. Here's how hardy it is. If I had Bryan's camera I would go under water and show you. Oh, that's cold. This is also dwarf sag out of my pond. So you're getting it here. You understand it's cold, it's freezing, this stuff survives the winter. I don't know where it's from, I need to look that up. Same exact species right here. Like boom.
Grows great, love it.
I mean, if you want to do an easy tank, do dirt, do dwarf sag and do Jungle Val, and forget about it. I mean it will look as cool as hell. So big, big fan of sagittarius in general. I don't have too many different varieties of it personally, but I should probably look up how many there are. If anyone else has other varieties, please post a pic or video.
Lead off hitter today, just grabbed some out of my pond. If anyone wants some of this just have a shit load of it. Obviously I can grow it in my pond so... Let me know. I've also got a...well I'll talk about the sword later. Yea, Dwarf Sag. Done first today. There's a reason for it. It's a great, great, great plant. Get yourself some dwarf sag people. You won't be disappointed. The only beef I have with it is that it can take over plants like crypts and stuff like that. But it's a good beginner plant and it will give you a lot of success out of the shoot.
There you go. Species Sunday,  lead off hitter, dwarf sagittarias.
