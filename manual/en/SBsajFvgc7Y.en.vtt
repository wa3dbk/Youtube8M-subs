00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.680
The HIVE School for Extraordinary Youngsters

00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:10.664
Training the finest in evil minions for over thirty years.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.424
Let's take a look at this year's top three graduates!

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.422
First we have Gizmo, a dwarf with a magic backpack

00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.739
that violates the conservation of mass!

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.945
Jinx! With the power of PINK!

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.660
And Mammoth, who looks like the bastard offspring

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.360
of Sabretooth and The Juggernaut.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.460
In order to hide their forbidden love the banished him to a different comic book universe

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.340
and just think, this ideal team can be yours for as little

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.900
as four payments of $99.95!

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.520
(static)

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.560
So, Slade, what do you think?

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:55.374
Are you offering to sell me your students as slaves?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.300
Headmistress: Yes.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.234
Slade: Excellent. I'd like to take delivery right away.

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:03.375
I can use them to destroy my greatest enemies

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.312
The INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.020
Headmistress: They're not allowed to fight the IRS. It's a union thing.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.520
Crap.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.674
Then just have them go

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:15.674
kill the Teen Titans or something.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.240
T - E - E - N

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.420
T - I -T - A - N - S

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.500
Teen Titans, Let's Go!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580
Cyborg: I can't believe you lost the remote!

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.860
Beast Boy: Like you never lost anything.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.900
Aside of arms and legs? Nope.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640
Oh, Nietzsche.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
If I were a necromancer, I'd make you my bride.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.353
(indistinct arguing)

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
And so, that is the story of the one time at the band camp.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.086
Hey, what are you idiots doing?

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:52.622
Child Services are on their way to pick up Beast Boy.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.960
Our friends are having a pointless argument at the start

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.980
of the episode, so that we can make up and learn

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.742
a lesson about The Teamwork.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.558
We shall feast on leftovers to repair the friendship!

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.400
(thinking) That is it my pet

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.340
continue growing and soon we shall rule

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.280
this pathetic dirt-ball together!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.320
Slime: Who needs you?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.160
Eek!

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.660
(Robin thinking) New rule: world domination doesn't happen in the kitchen.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.409
Let's just go get a pizza.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:28.254
Well I'm a manly man, I like meat. We need to eat meat.

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:31.390
Well I'm a little green man who's a Vegan so I say we eat Tofu.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.460
Oh yeah, this won't get repetitive.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.560
Gizmo: Gizmo to Jinx. Begin stage one of my overly-

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.827
-complicated plan.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.460
Jinx: You know, I could just kill them all from here if I had a rifle.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.420
Gizmo: Just push the damn bus already!

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.680
Pink sugar hearts!

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.740
(horns honking)

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.540
(gasp)

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.040
(honking horn)

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.593
Incoming bus! Save yourselves!

00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:01.742
Watch out!

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.720
(crashing)

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.420
Nice work, Titans. Now let's steal this teddy bear

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.467
while we're at it.

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:08.658
Gizmo Through Bear: And they call US the bad guys.

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:09.552
(laser zap)

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.356
Beast Boy: Why do they get heat vision?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.880
Cyborg: So the bear's behind this!

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.382
Raven (thinking, sarcastic): Yes, Cyborg

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.566
that evil bear is a mastermind.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.500
(crash)

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:22.115
Well that was surpisingly easy.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.080
It looks like playing dead worked.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.560
They're leaving us alone now.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.800
Announcer: Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.096
Beast Boy: We're the worst superheroes ever.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.588
Raven: Yes. Yes, you guys are.

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:37.828
Now let me irradiate your crotch so that you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.620
can never breed.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.480
Beast Boy: What was that?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.133
Raven: Nothing

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.280
(door creaks open)

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.446
The way I ran away from that one just call me FLYBORG!

00:03:46.446 --> 00:03:49.006
So where's Robin? After a beating that bad we could

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:49.939
use a little pep-talk.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.440
We searched for a couple of minutes until I got bored.

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:54.503
We found this.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.520
What, you gave up?

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.582
Do you know how hard it is to find a rich guy

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:00.893
who is not turned off by orange skin?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.860
There there, Star. I'm sure you'll find another colorblind heir to Bruce Wayne's fortune.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.820
(knocking at the door)

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:06.577
I bet that's him now.

00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:08.661
Robin!

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.300
Mammoth (poorly imitating Robin): Hey guys

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.560
it's me, Robin!

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:17.816
you should totally come over here in the range of Gizmo's plasma cannon.

00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:18.763
Starfire: Okay!

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:20.143
(boom)

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.900
(imitating Cobra Commander) Titans, retreat!

00:04:23.948 --> 00:04:25.548
Nice retreat everyone.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.930
"Nice retreat?" Nice retreat?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
They stole my freaking arm while we were off-camera!

00:04:32.395 --> 00:04:35.755
That's better than what they did to me off-camera.

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:37.635
Tee Em Eye, Starfire.

00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.434
So what are we supposed to do now?

00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:42.383
That runt is supposed to be the brains of this here outfit

00:04:42.644 --> 00:04:43.764
Robin OS: Wow...

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.400
You guys completely fall apart

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.120
without me around.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.074
Cyborg OS: Hey man where were you?

00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:53.529
Hey, I don't have super powers. Once there's heat vision and flying busses, I'm out of there.

00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:55.093
But now I have a plan.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.020
Announcer: Meanwhile at the Hall of Doom

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.767
Gizmo: Oh yeah. I'm the world's greatest interior decorator.

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.318
Hey, does this utility belt make me look fat?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.920
Nah, you're a stick as it is. You need to eat more, like me.

00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:09.772
Mmm. Blue.

00:05:10.452 --> 00:05:11.252
Jinx: Ewww!

00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:14.318
Oh would you just look at this music collection!

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:17.335
Paris Hilton, Wolfmother? Garbage.

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:21.478
Cyborg: Man I'm glad my machines can do anything the plot calls for.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.360
(the Artist formerly known as Prince)

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.127
Cyborg: Haha, I'm givin' everyone the finger.

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:27.556
(typing)

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.760
(sirens begin)

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.789
Bright lights and sirens? It must be a rave!

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.948
And me without my crystal meth...

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.880
Aaaaahhhh!

00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:41.821
What do Iook like, a Japanese school girl?

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.300
(sirens continue)

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200
Jinx: Aaagh! It's the hand of God!

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.680
Raven: You wish!

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.110
Starfire: Sneak attack!

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.560
(sounds of a struggle)

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.406
Robin: That's my belt!

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.700
Now everyone get in for a dramatic pose.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.980
DRAMATIC POSE!

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.440
This is the worst rave ever.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.200
Ha!

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.160
I'm the Mammoth, bitch!

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.025
Gizmo: I want a piggy back ride.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.320
Get off me. Get OFF me!

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.140
(EMP)

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.816
EAUUUGHHHH!!!!

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.440
(muffled ranting and profanity)

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.120
Jinx: I finally got that monkey off my back.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.520
Beast Boy: Gravity trumps pink, bitch.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.180
(thinking) But NOTHING trumps Pink!

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.080
(crashing)

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.900
(steam hissing)

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.820
(crashing)

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.880
Starfire: Masenko---HA!

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.880
Mammoth: Woahwoahwoahwoah!!

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.420
Beast Boy: I thought you didn't have superpowers

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.620
Robin: I lied!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.400
(thwack)

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.500
(crash)

00:06:54.024 --> 00:06:56.584
Oh, Mister Slade isn't gonna be happy.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.560
he paid top dollar for us.

00:06:59.028 --> 00:06:59.908
Who is Slade?

00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:02.520
Oh he's some one-eyed old man who bought us

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.460
as slaves.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.541
Lying won't help you.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.940
What's your refund policy?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.880
I'm sorry but all sales are final.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.820
Curses.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.820
Ah well. At least now I have some close-up footage of Robin

00:07:15.896 --> 00:07:17.976
Now go away, it's my alone time.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.700
Headmistress: Ewwwwwww.

00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:22.351
Boy, teamwork sure does rock.

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:25.189
No, outnumbering the enemy 3 to 5 rocks.

00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:28.573
Teamwork just gets in the way. Let's watch TV.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.573
Awright, as long as it's none of that

00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:31.171
wannabe-anime crap.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.709
That stuff is ruining Cartoon Network.

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:34.209
(tv switches off)

00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:44.475
(Porky Pig Voice) Abethebethebethe... That's all, folks!
