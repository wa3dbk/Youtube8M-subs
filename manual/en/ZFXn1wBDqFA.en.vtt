00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.790
Poker is a game of skill. All forms of poker
is a game of skill there are two things that

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.860
make poker gambling. One is the shuffle the
random shuffling of cards, the other is incomplete

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.752
information. I know what my hand is ace, king,
suited that's a pretty good hand most of the

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:27.930
time in Texas hold ?em. What I don't know
is what this hand is or this hand? In the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:39.010
scenario I set up I have ace, king of spades
and the flop came 9 10 6 different suites,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:48.480
what we call a rainbow. I decided that even
though I had raised preflop I was going to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.489
check. Here I?m trying to I don't know if
I think ace will be good but I don't know

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.339
what my opponents have and I?m trying to get
some information. This guy has ace 6 but I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:18.530
can't know that for sure he bet about half
of the pot. This person has this hand it looks

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.009
like they are on the draw. But I?m not going
to know that for sure. In complete information

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:34.090
in Texas hold ?em can only be mastered with
experience but here is something key to look

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.920
at. This person bet after I checked now I
gave him unfortunately the information that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.030
I didn't like the flop. He bet he's putting
out the information that he liked the flop.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:59.770
Suppose this person just calls puts out the
same amount of chips with the player on my

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.910
left. I am going to know from the fact that
he just called he's on a draw. As a matter

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:20.070
of fact I?m right, he's drawing to a straight.
With this information incomplete as it is

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.790
I know that my two high cards are not good
and I should fold.
