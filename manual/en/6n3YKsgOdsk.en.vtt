Hi, my name is Michael Burton with MichaelBurtonfilms.org
located in Salt Lake City, Utah. We're here

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.010
talking about how to use Microsoft Windows.
Now I want to talk to you about how to move

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.270
a file from one spot to another folder. There's
a couple ways to do this, it's fairly simple

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.240
but I'm going to show you as many methods
as I can to do this. Let me start up by saying

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.980
that Windows XP is a registered trademark
of Microsoft and I am in no way affiliated

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.559
with Microsoft. So now I'm going to show you
how to move a file to another folder. Probably

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.489
the easiest way to do this would be to first
pick your folder, figure out where you want

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.679
or you know, pick your folder, know which
file you want to move. For example right here

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.510
on the desktop I have this file called video
ten. We're going to move this video file into

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.269
the my videos folder in my, my documents.
So we're going to scroll down here to this

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.069
start menu. We're going to bring up the menu
and I'm going to scroll up here to the my

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.350
documents folder, open this folder. We want
to bring it into this my videos folder here.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.499
Now, there's a couple of ways we can do this.
We can either double click on this folder

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.010
and which opens up the my videos folder and
you can see my contents. Then we can come

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.960
over here and take this videos ten and drag
it on over into the my videos and drop it,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.601
there we go, we just added it to the folder.
Let's go ahead and take that back out and

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.921
put it right back on the desktop and as you
can see I'm just clicking and dragging it

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:25.609
to the desktop and we're done. That's how
you can move that file around. If we click

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.560
the back button here and come back to our
original my documents folder. Instead of actually

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.159
going into the my videos folder, we can actually
just take this video ten, drag it on over,

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.079
highlight the my videos folder and let go
of our left button on our mouse and it automatically

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.719
drops it into the folder. Now when we double
click on the my videos folder, you can see

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.190
that videos ten was automatically inserted
into the my videos folder. Now let's go ahead

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.469
an drag and click. Actually for example, let
me show you this example. Now if we want to

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.539
get videos ten back to the desktop, there's
a couple of ways we can do this. What I would

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.939
normally do is right click on video ten, you
can actually scroll down here to where it

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.530
says send to and we can create a shortcut
on the desktop. It won't actually send the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.459
file but it will send the shortcut. So now
that we have the videos ten file located under

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.180
my documents and in the my videos folder.
We have a shortcut created over here for us

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.629
on the desktop so if we ever need to play
that video we can double click on the shortcut

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.189
on the desktop and it will automatically play
the video but it's playing it from the my

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.870
videos folder. That's our shortcut. So let's
right click and delete this, okay, delete

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.290
that shortcut. Then we're going to drag the
video ten back over to the desktop so I can

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:51.610
show you another example. You want to be careful
when moving files, dragging and dropping,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.370
for example, if you were to drag and drop
this video ten or you brought it over here

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.650
to highlight the my videos but you accidentally
highlighted my music, but you didn't notice

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.810
right before you let go of the left button.
It's going to insert it into my music instead

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.879
of my videos and then your files are going
to get messed up. I've had that happen to

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.620
me a couple of times when I wasn't really
paying attention. The other issue is if you

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.390
were to open the my videos folder and there
happen to be other folders in there. You want

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.180
to be careful when dragging and dropping as
to not highlight one of those folders when

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.140
you drop it in here because if there is a
folder on this page it will hide it. Let's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.969
highlight it, let's see if I can show you
an example. If we create a new folder, let's

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.700
just call it new folder. Now I bring the videos
ten over this page, you see if I'm not careful,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.860
it'll highlight that new folder and we don't
want to drop it into that new folder. Because

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:49.360
if you do, then you're going to have to go
in and retrieve it out of that folder.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.959
Another way to move files from one place to
another is to right click on the file. So

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.530
we have this video ten file right here on
the desktop. If you were to right click on

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.670
this file and we click, you can either click
cut or copy. Cut will completely remove it

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.409
from the desktop. Copy will just create an
exact duplicate copy. So let's just try copy.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.769
We're then going to come here to the my videos,
we can either right click and click paste

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.730
which would automatically insert the video
into the folder. Or to make sure that it's

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.000
done right we can double click on the my videos
folder, open it up and inside this folder

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.570
we can right click on the folder and click
paste. Now it is creating a copy of our video

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.350
ten avi files. So it's actually going to take
two minutes to create this. So I'm going to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.690
cancel this because we don't have two minutes.
But as you can see right down here it's creating

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.960
a copy of the video ten video file into this
folder. Now if we just wanted to cut this

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.260
video ten, we could right click on it, go
to cut and then we paste it right over here

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.500
into this folder by right clicking and clicking
paste. You see how it automatically brought

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.580
the video ten from the desktop over to the
folder. That's a number of ways to move things

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.850
around on your computer to create different
folders and to store the different files into

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.200
different folders by cutting or copying or
click and dragging. There are many different

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.020
ways and these are only a few that I've showed
you.
