00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:03.804
What cheer, m'ladies.

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.373
I return with libations
as promised.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.941
Thanks, Liam.
Hey, text me later.

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:09.076
I've been saving up some things

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:11.345
I've been meaning
to tell you all day.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.982
Is that your boyfriend?
(bleep) you, no.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.917
Liam's from HelloM'lady.com.

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.018 line:0%
 
Is that a dating site?

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.419 line:0%
 
No, it's an app for your
smart phone

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.455 line:0%
 
that helps you manage
those clingy,

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:23.023 line:0%
 
fragile guys
who think they're dating you.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:24.925 line:0%
 
Wait, are they stalkers?

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.393 line:0%
 
God, no, stalkers have balls.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.529 line:0%
 
Hello m'lady's just
make you feel guilty.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.797 line:0%
 
They do that thing where
they put you on a pedestal

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:31.965 line:0%
 
and they dote on you,

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.101 line:0%
 
even though you've never
expressed any interest.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.502 line:0%
 
But why would I wanna
sign up for that?

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.070 line:0%
 
Just think of it
like Turbo Tax.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.839 line:0%
 
No one wants to do taxes

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.475 line:0%
 
but it is nice to have help
with that inevitable chore.

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.876 line:0%
 
Hmm.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.977 line:0%
 
Hello m'lady notifies you

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.413 line:0%
 
of the whereabouts
of m'ladies in your area.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:47.748 line:0%
 
The app alerts you when
you've been selected

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.283 line:0%
 
by one of these human hobbits.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.318 line:0%
 
You'll receive
Cliff Notes versions

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.619 line:0%
 
of his thesis linked emails

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.956 line:0%
 
listing the things he sees
in you that no one else sees.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.293 line:0%
 
This sad-eyed weasel helped
my boyfriend move into my place.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.429 line:0%
 
This doughy munchkin flat out
gave me an iPhone.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.530 line:0%
 
He said he had a hook-up,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.866 line:0%
 
but I'm pretty sure
he just paid for it.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.900 line:0%
 
(text alert sounding)

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:07.935 line:0%
 
It's a text from Liam.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:12.139 line:0%
 
"I wish I kissed you just now."

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.540 line:0%
 
(text alert sounding)

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.876 line:0%
 
Oh, gross, I was just chosen.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.077 line:0%
 
I don't wanna
lead this guy on,

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.812 line:0%
 
but I don't wanna hurt
his feelings either.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.214 line:0%
 
Oh, you can't win.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.082 line:0%
 
But the app does send you
a warning text

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.116 line:0%
 
when he's about
to angrily turn on you.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.151 line:0%
 
(text alert)

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.919 line:0%
 
<i>Warning, m'lady.</i>

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.454 line:0%
 
Can we talk outside, please?

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.556 line:0%
 
I think you owe me that much.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.226 line:0%
 
It's fine, he's just
gonna call me ungrateful

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.527 line:0%
 
and then ask if he can
hold my hand.

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.929 line:0%
 
Oh.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:40.000 line:0%
 
It seems you've been abandoned
and I just wanna say...

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.101 line:0%
 
...hello, m'lady.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.103 line:0%
 
Oh.

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.439 line:0%
 
Hello m'lady.

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:49.176 line:0%
 
(bleep) it.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:50.210 line:0%
 
Hey.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.979 line:0%
