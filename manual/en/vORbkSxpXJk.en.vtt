ROGER SCHULTZ: The College of Arts and Sciences
include programs in history, English, modern

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.390
languages, philosophy, mathematics and family
and consumer sciences.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.340
The programs provide excellent preparation
for graduate school, for law school, for seminary.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240
KAREN SWALLOW: In the English and Modern Languages
Department we offer not only English, but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.960
several modern languages including French,
Spanish, Chinese, German and a newly developed

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.550
program in American sign language.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.210
MATTHEW TOWLES: Only in the United States
do people ask, what are you going do with

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.240
an English major?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.440
Everywhere else, they want to know English,
and we have students all of the time going

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.980
to other countries teaching that.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.430
&gt;&gt; KEVIN STRUBLE: Liberty University Abroad
is very unique to any other program an institution

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.590
offers.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.980
We involve service-learning components into
everything that we do.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.130
We send students overseas, not just to gain
an education but to be a light to make a difference.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.640
Liberty's mission is to train champions for
Christ and that doesn't just happen here on

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.510
campus, it happens overseas as well.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.090
DAVID TOWLES: Dr. Falwell Sr. used to talk
about an action oriented curriculum, and we

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.380
like to get people out on the field and learning
the language in the culture where the language

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
was developed.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.320
&gt;&gt; MARY SIMPSON-ALFORDE: The College of Arts
and Sciences has a number of programs that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
are applied.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.479
The Family and Consumer Sciences program has
a number of opportunities where students work

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.930
in labs.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.830
We have a culinary lab; we have a textile
lab, and a sewing lab.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.450
&gt;&gt; MATALIE HOWARD: I've been privileged to
be able to provide opportunities for our students

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.720
to travel here in the United States to the
fashion capitol of the world, New York City.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.580
We spend a week going to various workshops
provided by designers.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.580

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.740
ROGER SCHULTZ: Our faculty are committed Christians,
and they not only emphasize the faith in Christ,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.630
but they also emphasize an integration of
their discipline with the faith so that they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.400
look at how they approach history or English
or philosophy from a Biblical and Christ centered

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
perspective.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.560
&gt;&gt; COOPER PASQUE: I think the teachers at
Liberty are definitely one of the unique assets

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.170
that the school has.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.910
I've been remarkably blessed by the teachers
because, first of all, they are genuine believers.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.970
I feel like I've been trained as a scholar,
and I have also been enriched in my faith.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.680
&gt;&gt; ERIN CUMBIA: In my experience, the professors
have been wonderful.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.090
They're really concerned about us, and our
success, and they want to see us succeed in

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
everything.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.090
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.310
MATTHEW TOWLES: It's not necessarily what
you can do, but who you can be at Liberty

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.590
that's the most important thing.
