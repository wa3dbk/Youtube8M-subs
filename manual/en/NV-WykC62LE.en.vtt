00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.010
ELMO: Well, Elmo's
not sure, Mr. Cube.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.760
ICE CUBE: Why not?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.940
ELMO: Well, because Elmo doesn't
know what astounding means.

ICE CUBE: Ah.

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.830

this coin disappear.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.940
ELMO: OK.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.603

ICE CUBE: OK.

00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.110
OK.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.394
For my next trick, I'm going to
pull something out of this hat.

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:51.894
Oh, right.

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:52.878
Elmo knows.

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:55.830
Mr. Cube is going to pull
a rabbit out of his hat.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.650
ICE CUBE: A rabbit?

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.287
ELMO: Uh huh!

00:00:57.287 --> 00:00:57.870
ICE CUBE: Nah.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.350
Anybody can do that.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.260
But if you want
something astounding--

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.830
ELMO: Yeah?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.008
ICE CUBE: How about this?

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:06.212
A baby dinosaur!

00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:07.420
BABY DINOSAUR: Goo goo ga ga.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.050

ELMO: [LAUGH] Wow.

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:13.242
That took Elmo by surprise.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:15.610
That was astounding.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.910
ICE CUBE: And now,
for my last trick,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.766
I'm going to change
myself into an ice cube.

00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.620
ELMO: Wow!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.150

[LAUGH] That is
totally astounding.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.189

00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:43.360
Oh.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.990
