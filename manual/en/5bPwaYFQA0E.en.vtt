MC: Kevin Kropinyeri!

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.800
Oh Melbourne!! Gee whiz! Wow Kevin Kropinyeri.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.060
Yes, I'm an Aboriginal comedian. Ooooh! I love the intro.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.340
I love the intro, but if my family wants to introduce me onstage, this is how they'd introduce me.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.520
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage, father of 7 from 3 different mothers.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.330
*crowd laughs*

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.250
But I made the move to Victoria. Met a beautiful Aboriginal lady in Swanhill, Victoria.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.610
And I've been over here for a while now and I asked her to marry me.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.250
And I married into the Kirby family. Biggest bloody mob.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.660
Now my wife was the youngest of eight. Only girl.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.199
Now she's a very staunch Aboriginal woman. When I asked her to marry me.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.399
She goes yeah, yeah, I'll marry you. I'll marry you. But you're taking my surname.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.899
*crowd laughs*

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.020
I can be Kevin Kirby but I said sweetheart let's hyphenate the name.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.790
Kevin Kropinyeri-Kirby that way it's all inclusive.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.130
Everybody's happy except for me.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.960
*crowd laughs*

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.260
Because now I'm the only Aboriginal in Australia with the intials KKK.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.980
*crowd laughs*

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.680
And I'm always being challenged about my Aboriginality because I'm a fair brother.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
You know you're not really Aboriginal are you?

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.840
Because what a lot of people don't realise is that us Aboriginals,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.200
we come in all different shades and colours. You can kind of like compare us like coffees.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.520
My mum literally is a short black.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.560
*crowd laughs*

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.600
My next-door neighbor we like to call him a fat I mean a flat white.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.280
But I like to think of myself as a hot chocolate.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.080
*crowd laughs*

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.420
But the truth is I'm a mocha-chino.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.120
They always try to tell me, you must be a half-caste or a one-quarter or a one-sixteenth.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.520
And I always tell them, no matter how much milk you put in coffee it's still coffee.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.020
*crowd laughs*

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.540
But I feel sorry for my cousin Christopher Kropinyeri, right?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.710
Our father's are brothers, right.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.370
He's got a white mother, black father.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.770
He turned out blonde hair blue eyes white as.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.130
And when he doesn't shave he's got a red beard. True story - Har har mee hearties.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.950
And he's always trying to prove his Aboriginiality all the time to both black and white.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.050
And see he's a very good footballer and we played in the South Australian Aboriginal football carnival.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.780
And when he come off the field coz he's a very good footballer.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.430
When he comes off the field, Aboriginals had a go at him.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.120
What are you doing playing in this carnival for? It's for black fellas only.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.459
Now Chris really hates it, he gets very arced up.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.579
Hey! I'm sick of you guys telling me that I'm not Aboriginal.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.360
I'm Aboriginal and I can prove it.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.930
And real wild-like he pulls out the phone and he goes here:

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.070
you dial this number on my phone it'll prove I'm Aboriginal.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.570
He pass it to the other black fella. Other black fella grabbed the phone.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.450
Dialled the number - you have insufficient credit.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.080
*crowd laughs*

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.340
to make a call.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.180
He reckon ahh now see who's back in the club now man.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.650
Ladies and gentleman you've been a great crowd. Enjoy the night! My name's Kevin Kropinyeri. Thank you.
