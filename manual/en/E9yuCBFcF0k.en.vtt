00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.870
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
was signed into law on February 17, 2009,

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.960
allocating $787 billion to spur economic activity.
The first contract awards under the Act were

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.780
made the very same day. A number of steps
are required to move the Recovery funds through

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.800
the government to the recipients. In writing
the Recovery Act, Congress appropriated funds

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.550
for specific Recovery programs administered
by the 28 federal agencies designated to distribute

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.109
Recovery money. Funds were also appropriated
to these federal agencies in lump sums to

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:54.109
be applied to the agencies’ other programs.
The federal agencies then distribute Recovery

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.139
money either to state and local governments
for contract, grant, and loan awards or directly

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:07.330
to academia, businesses, and organizations.
Recovery funds are also provided to individuals

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:16.900
through entitlements and tax credits. The
$787 billion is disbursed in three ways: $288

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:25.290
billion in tax benefits; $224 billion in entitlements,
which are direct payments to individuals,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.640
such as Social Security, and $275 billion
in federal contract, grant, and loan awards.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.740
For our purposes, we are going to focus only
on the $275 billion in contract, grant, and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.580
loan awards to recipients. For the majority
of federal contracts, businesses, organizations,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.880
individuals and other entities participate
in a competitive bidding process. From the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.470
Opportunities tab on Recovery.gov, go to Contracts
and scroll through Recovery contracts up for

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.700
bid, or go to FedBizOpps to see all federal
contracts up for bid. Recovery contracts on

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:19.850
FedBizOpps are designated by the Recovery
logo. Recipients of federal contracts are

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.120
paid as they invoice. For example, Company
A bids and wins a $10 million contract for

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.120
a road construction project. As the project
progresses, the company invoices and is reimbursed.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.160
On completion of the project, the company
invoices for the final outstanding amount.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.920
Federal agencies also distribute funds through
grants. From the Opportunities tab on Recovery.gov,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.530
go to Grants, and then to Grants.gov to see
and apply for federal grants. Grants are awarded

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.930
only after an application has been approved
by the federal agency. Grantees are paid through

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.770
the following process: The Grantee provides
financial information to the awarding agency,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.400
which then determines whether to pay the recipient
by draw-down, which is essentially an advance

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.740
payment to cover expenses provided under the
grant, or to pay after the grantee has invoiced

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.900
for expenses Federal agencies also distribute
Recovery funds to the states for contracts

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.260
and grants that are awarded by the states
to academia, businesses, and other organizations.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.030
When a state receives notification from a
federal agency about the amount of funds it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.830
is to receive, the state selects projects
to finance with that funding. Once projects

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.480
are selected, the state issues a call for
bids from contractors to carry out the projects.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.170
The winning contractor, now a recipient of
Recovery funds, is paid only after invoicing

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.239
for work done or materials purchased. States
may also issue grants. Recipients receive

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.690
grant awards as the result of an application
process – overseen by the state, which decides

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:23.250
how to disburse the money to recipients. Each
state has its own process for disbursing funds.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.060
In addition to contracts and grants, Recovery
loans are distributed to recipients. There

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.130
are two types of loans: The Guaranteed Loan
 – Banks apply to the appropriate federal

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.610
agency for these loans which are managed directly
by the bank. Applying for a loan is the same

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.060
for a recipient as for any other loan applicant.
In the case of a guaranteed loan, if the borrower

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.210
defaults, the federal government repays the
bank. Direct Loans – Usually available from

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.350
a federal agency, most likely the USDA, the
Small Business Administration, and the Departments

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.720
of Education and Energy. Information about
these loans and application forms can be found

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.150
at the agencies’ websites. When prime recipients
receive Recovery awards, they may award part

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.240
of a project to another company or purchase
goods and materials for the project. These

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.190
sub-recipients may perform the work in or
outside of the prime’s state. There are

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.010
two scenarios for Recovery funds moving from
a prime recipient with a contract to a sub-recipient.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:38.990
A prime recipient receives an award to perform
work in a state and hires subcontractors and

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:47.490
buys materials in that same state. The Recovery
funds stay in the one state. Or, a prime recipient

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.669
receives an award to perform work in a state
and hires subcontractors and buys materials

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.199
in several other states. The Recovery funds
are now distributed throughout one or more

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:06.449
states. The methods described here are, in
general, the way most contract, grant, and

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.220
loan awards are distributed to recipients.
