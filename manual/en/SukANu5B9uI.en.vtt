00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:19.710
Ben: All right, Amber!

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.480
You have gone and you have made three really
exceptional images here.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.999
I think, like so much of the work here, anyone
who looks at this is going to say "that's

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.970
a high school student?"

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.439
These are just fantastic.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.800
I took your images as you gave them to me
and I did these prints.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.820
So we have got this lovely shot of these hands
on this wooden door.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.160
We have got Haley--is this just?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.120
Amber: She is behind the window and then she
is looking out.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
I am on the other side of the window.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.680
It's a reflection of the scenery behind me.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.040
Ben: Okay, so there is not compositing here.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.090
Ben: You actually shot that.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.190
Amber: That's all on camera.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
Ben: Okay.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.630
And then Haley is still stalking you, breaking
into the abandoned house you had of Haley.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.998
Amber: Well, I'm the one with the camera,
so I think I am stalking her, but yeah that's--.

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:03.998
Ben: Okay, good point, all right!

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:04.998
So what do you think of these prints?

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.490
Amber: I love them.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.409
I mean, that's why I sent them to the print.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.750
Ben: Okay, I had given you some thing to fix
before and you did a great job of fixing them.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.740
And asking what you think about them is obviously
a loaded question because I brought you over

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.319
here to do something with them.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.859
So I would offer to you, let's talk about
this hands picture.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.789
Black-and-white prints of course are all about
brightness.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.270
They are all about light and shadow, and we
want them to have all this nice luminance

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.229
gray, and then you have got a lot of that
here.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.630
This particular image, it's great, the light
that you have put on here, and you have plainly

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.590
done a lot of work with some vignetting and
dodging and burning.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.020
We have got a lot of nice texture in here.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.700
the hands themselves are great.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.789
Whose hands are those?

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.770
Amber: Those are Lucy's hands.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.649
They are originally Ashley's, but she had
sparkly nail polish on.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.279
Ben: Okay, that's good.

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.999
Louis wears a completely different nail polish
I think.

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.999
All Right!

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.039
They look great, but you are about 10% short
of where you need to be, in terms of the tonal

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.789
adjustment that you make, and I would ask
you to look right here.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.289
His fingernail right here is really, really
white.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.080
There is no ink there.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.490
That's just paper.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.240
That's what white should look like in this
image.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.750
And it's not what we have in all of these
other white bits.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.970
Amber: Yeah.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.000
Ben: We don't need this to go to complete
white, but if white is all the way over here,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.410
these other secular highlights should be at
least that bright, and if they are that bright,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.120
Ben: it's going to brighten up some of these
tones.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120
Amber: Right.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.000
Ben: That's going to allow us to get more
texture on here.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.440
It's going to just give the image a little
more punch.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.680
As good as this looks, it looks a little muddy
and blah to me.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.490
And it's an easy thing to miss when the image
first comes out of the printer, because your

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.290
eye will look at it and make sense of it and
so on and so forth.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.810
But once you realize there is actually more
to be had there, there is a very different

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.810
image you can get.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.210
So let's go in here and look at what you did.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.730
Let's analyze this image by the numbers.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.740
Looking at it onscreen obviously doesn't tell
us very much, so I am going to go in here

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.300
and add a levels adjustment layer.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.040
So as we look at the histogram right over
here, what are you seeing?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
Amber: There is a very sharp spike out there,
which is probably that little spot on his

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.750
nail.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.750
Ben: It's probably this right here.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.750
Amber: Oh, yeah, the window too.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.170
Amber: And there is just so flat line.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.710
It's not a lot of white until the middle,
around the grays.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.670
Ben: Yeah, so thinking of it that way, do
you have an idea of a different white point

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.670
adjustment?

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.670
Now, technically, you are okay.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.140
You are saying, well, I have got my white
over at the right edge of my data.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.790
Well, the right edge of your data is this
thing.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.400
The bulk of your data, all of this stuff,
really doesn't start till in here.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.680
So make another adjustment.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.660
See if you can get something else going.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.790
Yeah, coming into there is making a difference.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.550
Are you thinking a midpoint adjustment?

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.550
Amber: Maybe.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.550
Ben: Okay.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.350
Amber: Kind of bring some of it back.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.180
Ben: Good because as you move the white point
over, you are running the risk of brightening

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.940
up the blacks and washing those out.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.541
And I think it's smart to do that.

00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:57.541
You did that right.

00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.880
You did that with the midpoint adjustment
because if you had done the blacks, then everything

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.430
is going to plunge back down.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.430
All right!

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.430
So what are we getting now?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.370
We are getting--turn off the eyeball.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.350
Let's see a before and after.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.610
So there is before.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.610
There is after.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.650
And it's very slight and it's very subtle,
but I think it's a huge change that's going

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.340
to make a big difference.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.380
We could now start looking for how do you
introduce any overexposure, has this gone

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.070
out, have these gone out.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.070
Turn it off again.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.000
I want to look at this pinky right here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.170
Yeah, we have lost some detail there.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.090
Ben: So, we are not going to be able to get
around this with a single global adjustment.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.090
We are going to need to do some localized
adjustments.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.290
We will look at those in a little bit.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.970
Let's move on to some of these other images
and see where they stand.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.970
This picture of Haley reflected in the window,
why don't you pull that out?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.970
So same thing.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.330
Make a Levels Adjustment layer.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.400
Okay, this one is a little trickier.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.600
This is where you had it set, and again, you
did the right thing.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.840
You found the right edge of your data.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.900
But there is this little area along here that's
all roughly the same amount of data, and that's

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.410
probably all of these tones in her hand, these
bright tones over here, maybe a little bit

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.710
in here.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.830
As far as the rest of the image goes, the
bulk of the image, most of it, the data doesn't

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.570
start until right in here.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.440
So let's see what happens if you move the
white point over to there.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.070
Yeah, right into there.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.020
Now, obviously, we have lost her hand.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.070
This is gone.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.440
But turn that adjustment layer off: before,
after.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.730
If you notice in there, there is not a lot
of differentiation between these tones and

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.730
these tones.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.590
Overall it's a lot of middle-gray tones.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.500
With this Levels Adjustment layer on, this
has gone brighter.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.390
Again, we are going to have to do some localized
things to fix all that.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.650
We will come back to that.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.060
Let's move on to the next image.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.030
And let's just do the same thing here.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.030
Pull up the levels.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.030
And again --

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.030
Amber: About the sharp spike right there.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.199
Ben: Right, and that's going to be, very good.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.520
So where do you think we ought to go with
this one?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.160
Amber: Probably about there, because that's
all plateaued.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.870
Ben: I think you are right.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.310
Ben: Exactly and that's exactly the word.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.310
Thank you!

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.310
I was looking for that word.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.320
Where you see those plateaus, you are looking
at a bunch of little tones that aren't as

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.430
significant as these big piles of tones.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.230
And let's see a before and after again.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.230
Okay.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:26.010
Again real, real subtle, but we have just
picked up some extra stuff in there that's

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.020
going to give it a little more punch.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.370
So even if these highlights get brighter,
it just means there is more highlights from

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.419
here coming into her, and that may or may
not be a problem.

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.639
So you were real close on all of these edits.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:41.270
Again, you were just like 10% off, and it's
an easy mistake to make.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.889
You were--it's kind of heartbreaking to have
to tell you, because you were doing exactly

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:46.889
the right thing.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:47.960
You were going over to the edge of the histogram.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.241
It just turns out that the edge of the histogram
is not actually right for the bulk of the

00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:53.241
image data.

00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.150
We need to define the significant data and
move white and black to there.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.080
And as you pointed out, there is a plateau
of insignificant data that you needed to go

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080
away from.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.360
So now the next thing is to get some masks
in place to ensure that we haven't introduced

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:17.629
new problems into the things that you just
fixed.
