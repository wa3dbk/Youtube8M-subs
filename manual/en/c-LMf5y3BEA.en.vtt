00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.750
Earlier we reviewed Prismapix, a puzzle game
where the player uses minesweeper-like clues

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.080
to know what tiles are safe to uncover a picture
on and which are not.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.080
That game was based on a simpler kind of logic
puzzle, and that's exactly what we have here

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.650
with Fill-a-pix.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.150
There's a grid full of numbers.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.800
Some are black spaces, others are not, and
it's up to your ingenuity to use the clues

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.590
given to you to find out which are which (and
at the end you get a picture).

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.610
On starting, the control for this game seems
quite cumbersome.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.660
You have to drag the red icon over to each
individual square and tap to either turn it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.820
black or put a cross through it.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.070
There is a smart-fill cursor that makes everything
a little easier and soon you'll wonder how

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.570
you did without it.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.130
When you see a number on the board, it corresponds
to how many black squares are in the three

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.339
by three grid it's in the center of.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.210
What the smart-fill cursor does is if there
is only one possible answer for filling the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.190
grid either with black or crosses, one touch
will do the job for you.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.930
This is especially handy for the zeros and
nines which should be your first port of call

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.050
when tackling a puzzle (although you can turn
on an option to auto-fill these at the start

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.320
of a level).

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.479
Why would you want to auto-fill anything you
may ask.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.130
Well some of these puzzles are huge.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.390
The first few start off small but before long
you're traversing monumental canvases of numbers

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060
and white squares.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.829
The auto-fill takes some of the pressure off
and also gives some good starting points when

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.890
approaching these behemoths.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.770
Each stage has one solution and one way to
uncover it.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.770
Especially until the game clicks, this can
lead to a lot of staring at the numbers on

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.659
screen wondering what could be the next move
(and of course in most cases when this happens,

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.350
it's something simple).

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.460
With this mind and the bare bones approach
to these puzzles, this is really not for casual

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.930
puzzle fans.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.380
These grids require dedication, and this will
appeal to a certain kind of puzzle lover.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.090
Still, the first two packs of the game are
free so it might be worth your while to give

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:04.799
it a go and see if uncovering these pixelated
images becomes engaging and addictive.
