00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.200
here is the 1st guest for the post race

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.400
I'd like him to join us, Max!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Please come, we'd like to start from race 2
instead of 1

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.400
We've seen you starting well and fast and then...
What happened?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.300
Well... you saw it... there was an an accident

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.100
and I was... well .... pushed out of the race

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.800
of course we never had a good pace
during the weekend

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.400
we never found a satisfying set up but...

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.300
I've had problems here right away,
also on the wet

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400
but being excluded from the race at the 3rd /4th curve...

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
leaves a bitter aftertaste

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
Ok lets see the images from that slide

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
Well, yes, the images are clear, aren't they?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.400
I'm only sorry for...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.400
yeah, C'mon, it is obvious that...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100
he was on the inside...
he wanted to pass from the inside...

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
...too fast and he hit me while I was closing the line

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.600
then there's SOMEONE who says images are not clear

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.200
and he's a rider, AOH! there you are! he was right there!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.800
this is really absurd (ridiculous)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.500
...absurd, I'm sorry because he's been a rider and should
be able to see these things... these images are so clear

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
it's like blowing smoke in people's eyes, it makes me sad

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
I'm here to speak out, not to speak about the result

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900
The images are so clear...

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.100
if YOU get it wrong it's ok (coz you're a journalist)  but he!

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.700
he spent 20 years on a bike and he doesn't see it!
it looks to me that there is no doubt

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500
You are going there, where I really didn't want to go,
because...

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.300
You never want to go anywhere, that's the problem!
when you speak about Fabrizio you never take a stand, it's unfortunate

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.800
If you look at the 2nd race Fabrizio passed everyone in the same spot...
(Biaggi incomprehensible)

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.300
Chili: "therefore Chill out!"
Biaggi: "get out of here!"

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.700
Oh look dude! you are an opinionist!

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.000
lets all try to behave and talk about 2009

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.900
you'll wear a new gear that brought you
in the past a lot of prestige

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.500
just a couple of words because the air is gettin hot here...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
Chili wants to become a boxer...

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.400
I'm sorry but he's an opinionist,
he's entitled to his opinion but... it ends there

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.800
Things are different, full stop

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:46.400
2009 will be different .... bla bla bla, not interesting anymore... :)
