Keeping floors and carpets clean is already
a big job... But if you have a pet that sheds

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.650
a lot of hair like I do, you have an even
bigger challenge on your hands. Before we

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.369
get started, if you find the information in
this video to be helpful, please do me a big

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.370
doing what I love. And that is making videos
that provide a reliable source of information

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.530
for consumers to distinguish good products
from bad ones. Ok, let's get started. Pet

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.370
owners want to know 3 things about a vacuum
cleaner. How much pet hair does it pick up?

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.410
How much of that hair actually gets into the
vacuum rather than getting stuck on the brush?

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.130
And how much does it cost? Recently there
was an independent test done on the top 100

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.410
models to decide which vacuum cleaners were
best for picking up pet hair. The amount of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.850
work and comparison done in these tests was
very impressive. Exactly 5 grams of pet hair

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.679
was rolled onto a carpet for each of the 100
vacuum cleaners. Each was run across the carpet

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:18.020
the same exact number of times. The vacuum
was weighed before and after to determine

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.749
exactly how much pet hair was picked up. They
also weighed and factored in the amount of

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:28.310
pet hair that became stuck on the brush. Each
of these steps was performed with 100 of the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.959
best vacuum cleaners on the market. And to
take it 1 step further, the results were cross

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.999
checked with other tests they performed for
general vacuum cleaner duties such as picking

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.219
up debris on carpets and hardwood floors.
The goal here is to get the all-around best

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.539
product for your money. We don't want to
pay a lot of cash for a one trick pony. So,

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.880
in addition to finding the best vacuum for
pet hair, you can rest assure that these models

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.560
are also great for all around use. The biggest
takeaway from my research was that Pet hair

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.099
is a game changer. There were vacuum cleaners
under $150 dollars that outperformed many

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:10.099
500 dollar units. In the end, I decided to
purchase a Meile twist upright vacuum cleaner.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.000
In my opinion, this was the best vacuum for
pet hair. I've actually wanted one of these

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.239
for a really long time so once I saw how well
it did on the test, I placed ordered one right

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.829
away. The Meile that I bought retails for
about $500 dollars. But if you don't want

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.489
to spend this much money, don't worry. There
were quite a few vacuum cleaners that retail

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.489
for under $150 dollars that scored excellent
marks on all three tests. So I listed each

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.049
of the top vacuum cleaners on my blog along
with information on where to get each one

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.860
at the cheapest price. So you can do your
own research there and find a price range

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.329
that works best for your situation. Any way
you cut it, if you buy one of these vacuum

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.650
cleaners, you are making a smart decision.
There is no sense in trusting manufacturer

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.870
claims when we have hard core proof from an
independent lab. For more information on the
