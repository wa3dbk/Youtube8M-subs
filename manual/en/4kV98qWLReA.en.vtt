00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.600
Beggar's Chicken.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.370
You see, in China, in the old days

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.999
we have a lot of poor people

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.609
everybody knows that

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.139
so they cannot afford that...to buy a chicken.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.099
So they steal the chicken from somebody's backyard

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.619
and they don't have a stove

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.689
they don't have any anything to
cook with

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.309
so they just kill the chicken

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.320
and then

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.600
get some mud and clay, put it on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.780
and they start the wild fire outdoors

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.570
and they bake it. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.590
So this is called, Beggar's Chicken.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.720
This is the original...the name of this.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.460
So now we're modernized, right?

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880
So we wrap it with the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.330
lotus leaf

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.910
and also the chicken inside

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.879
is stuffed

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.650
with chinese mushroom and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.200
[??]

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.260
Anyway...

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.409
Now this chicken is nice and tender and juicy.

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.160
So whom you'll ask to crack it?... You crack it Ruth!

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.000
Ruth Reichl: You crack the first one, I'll crack the next one.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.000
Oh you have two? Yuan Yuan, come here! Yuan Yuan, come on!

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.999
Ruth: It is her favorite dish!

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.950
You are the youngest one you know! [Chinese] Because you're the youngest one...the youngest kid here. 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.770
Any which way.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.049
One in each corner.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.000
Harder! Harder!

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.999
OK! OH! [Cheering]

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.870
Chef Ong: You know this dish came about when Cecilia did her book, 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.369
The Seventh Daughter.

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.049
We were tasked with

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:25.839
doing the research for it. We went through many...we probably did about sixty chickens 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.619
before we finally decided to use this particular
clay.

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.489
We worked with this store in Berkeley called....

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.529
I think right now, probably...

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.859
If I say something wrong, you correct me...

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.139
I think right now probably it's the only

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.680
place...you know Betelnut serves this, right?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
Yes, We are the only restaurant.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.979
We do about six of these

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.450
on a weeknight...

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.289
and two every hour. 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.619
See when you open it, see the heat come off?

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.419
Crowd: So is this recipe in Seventh Daughter? Chefs: Yes, Right.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.009
Beggar's Chicken.
