00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.850
Genetic Underpinnings of Alopecia 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.080
Areata Alopecia areata is considered an autoimmune  disease. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.480
The immune system is designed to protect the body from foreign invaders such as 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.850
viruses and bacteria, but in alopecia areata, the immune system mistakenly attacks the 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.400
hair follicles, the tiny cup-shaped structures from which hairs grow. 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.380
This can lead to hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.530
In most cases, hair falls out in small, round patches about the size of a quarter. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.570
In many cases, the disease does not extend beyond a few bare patches. 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.980
In some people, however, hair loss is more extensive. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.670
Although uncommon, the disease can progress, and can cause total loss 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.830
of hair on the head. 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.790
This is referred to as alopecia areata totalis. 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.000
Complete loss of hair on the head, face, and body is known 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.800
as alopecia areata universalis. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.040
 In alopecia areata, immune system cells attack the rapidly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.610
growing cells in hair follicles. 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.130
The affected hair follicles become small, and hair production slows drastically. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.530
Fortunately, the stem cells that supply the follicle with new cells 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.780
do not seem to be targeted. 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.670
 Therefore, the follicle always has the potential to regrow hair. 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.680
Scientists do not know exactly why the hair follicles undergo these changes, but they 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.700
suspect that a combination of gene variants may predispose some people to the disease. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.830
In these people, some type of trigger --- perhaps a microbe (or pathogen) or something in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.950
the person's environment --- brings on the attack against the hair follicles. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.700
In an effort to gather the large amount of information needed to locate the gene or 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.340
genes associated with alopecia areata, the National Institute of Arthritis and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.460
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) supported the establishment of a 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.550
National Alopecia Areata Registry --- a network of five academic medical centers 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.020
charged with registering, identifying, and collecting information and blood samples 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360
from people with alopecia areata and their family members. 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.790
The registry provides a central information source where researchers can obtain data 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.440
associated with the disease. 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.570
The registry also serves as a liaison between affected families and investigators who 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.560
study the disorder. 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.740
 In recent years, investigators funded by the NIAMS have made huge strides toward 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.370
understanding the genetic underpinnings of alopecia areata. 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.120
For example, Angela M. Christiano, Ph.D., and her research team at Columbia University 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.520
used genetic material from the National Alopecia Areata Registry and uncovered 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.790
several genes that are linked to the disease. 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.540
In a genome-wide association study, the first of its kind for alopecia areata, the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.200
scientists compared genetic material from 1,054 people with alopecia areata to that of 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.940
3,278 people without the disease, looking for genomic regions where people with the 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280
disease differed from controls. 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.050
Of the 450,000 genetic markers studied, the comparison turned up about 150 that were 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.560
different in the people with alopecia areata. 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.900
Knowing the genes involved in the disease, scientists can now begin to develop mouse 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.410
models and human translational studies to help them better understand the pathology 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.200
and to test new therapies in pre-clinical studies that may pave the way to innovative 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.210
clinical trials for a disease which has had very limited effective therapies up to now.
