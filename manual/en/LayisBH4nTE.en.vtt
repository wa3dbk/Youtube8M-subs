00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.150
Fire away.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.420
Good one.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.420
Stumps a lot of people.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.670
Yeah, this is a stumper.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.019
Now this is going to be a hard question to
answer.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.660
I feel like I should have more experience
in this than you, but I don't.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.440
What really makes a boy a man?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.130
You assume that they do become a man, right?

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.140
I imagine science can fine it.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.300
I mean, at certain age I guess at that point,
but

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.769
When I was five years old, I think it was
about ten.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.420
When I was ten, it was about thirteen, I was
a man.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.469
I guess you could say puberty but that's not
necessarily true.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.850
When you drive a car?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.389
When you stop living with your parents?

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:55.879
I don't think it has to do much with age.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:05.800
I think you can be a man at 15 years old or
you can not be a man at 40 years old.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.610
I don't know if they ever really do.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.280
We have a lot of grown boys acting out the
part of men.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.740
I thought like I become a man after the army,
that's what I thought.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.320
When he gain responsibility of self.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.050
Probably when he experiences sex for the first
time.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.050
When he has to take care of someone.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.230
When he probably loses something really important
to him.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:56.710
I think a boy becomes a man when he takes
the step of putting other people before himself.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.740
When he understands what family truly means.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.270
A boy is someone who want things for himself,
presents, gifts, stuff like that.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:15.889
And a man's someone who wants the best for
his family and children and things like that.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.930
Doesn't rely on others to do for him what
he should do for himself as a man.
