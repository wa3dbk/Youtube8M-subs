Hey guys,I am =Caroline and I am Alejandra
and today we are making Peanut Butter and

00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:12.600
Jam Thumb print cookies..

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.430
So this is a really simple cookie, its kind
of a shortbread cookie, we are gonna start

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.940
of by creaming some butter and sugar and peanut
butter, If you wanna combine these dry ingredients,..

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:36.420
we have flour, baking powder and baking soda
here..And a good amount of this Bee's Knees

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:48.030
peanut butter..I like the honey touch..Some
white sugar and brown sugar and just cream

00:00:48.030 --> 00:01:02.149
this together..So I am 
actually gonna lower the speed and add the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.149
flour..

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:17.550
And then just go ahead and stir that vanilla..Keep
adding the flour just until its combined..A

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:26.440
pretty small batch of cookies,..Its good for
a little late night craving..

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:47.920
It is coming together here into a nice dough..So
perfect it is actually a little crumbly dough,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.110
so perfect..So what I am gonna do is pass
you this sugar and I am going to roll it into

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:03.280
a ball, you can roll it into sugar and that
would be great..So I am gonna toss it into

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.519
a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, we
are gonna partially cook them so that after

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.909
10 minutes we can take them out and press
into them for the thumbprint part and then

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.920
fill them with jam..

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:33.950
I just got these out of the oven..We are going
to push them using a measuring 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:45.959
spoon..Now 
I am going to put these back in the oven..for

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.439
a couple more minutes..So these were in the
oven just to get a little bit of golden brown..

00:02:51.439 --> 00:03:06.840
So we are gonna fill them with some jam..I
have Raspberry jam here..The heat of the cookie

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:29.599
is melting this jam a little bit..It is like
the best peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich ever..well

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.749
there you have it Peanut Butter &amp; Raspberry
jam Thumbprint cookies..
