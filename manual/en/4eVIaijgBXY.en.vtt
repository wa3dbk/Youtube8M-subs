bjbjLULU Parmesan Pumpkin Risotto Serves 4-6
How is the pumpkin prepared? Peeled and chopped

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.280
How is the pumpkin cooked? A quick saut then
(primarily) using the heat of the risotto,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.730
as it all cooks together Where and how often
is Flora used? Twice: Melted in a pan in order

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.690
to saut onion, pumpkin and garlic. Then a
large knob at the end to add buttery flavour.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.710
(Potentially used a third time to crisp up
some sage leaves in a small pan will suggest

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.359
verbally and have used as a tip in the recipe
copy below). How long does this dish take

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.770
to cook? Prep time: 10-15 minutes Cook time:
25 - 30 minutes Total: 35-45 minutes What

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.670
can be pre-prepared for Fiona? The pumpkin,
garlic, onion, cheese plus everything measured

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.210
out I could demo the prep of the pumpkin on
another pumpkin Ingredients 200g peeled and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.481
cubed pumpkin (approx 2cm in size) 25g Flora
Buttery x2 (i.e. 50g in total) 2 cloves garlic

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:56.219
crushed 1 onion finely diced 350g risotto
rice (ensure it s not the pre-flavoured stuff.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:04.370
I tend to use Arborio rice) Approx 1 litre
hot vegetable stock (I tend to dissolve 3

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:14.680
tsp Knorr Vegetable granules in 1 litre of
just boiled water and then I ve got as much

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:32.330
as I need) 2 good handfuls grated parmesan
cheese (or to taste) Seasoning Method Melt

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.430
the first 25g Flora Buttery in a large non-stick
frying pan (have a wooden spoon ready). Once

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.530
the Flora has melted, add the onion, garlic
and pumpkin and saut for about 3 minutes on

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.190
a medium heat (don t be tempted to turn the
heat up too high with risotto!). Add the rice

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.030
and stirring, cook for another 2 minutes.
For the next 20-25 minutes or so you ll need

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.000
to patiently stay with the risotto, adding
small amounts of stock (staying on that medium

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.289
heat) and stirring it through till dissolved
then adding another bit and so on . Keep stirring

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.111
and gradually adding that stock. Feel free
to break up the pumpkin a bit as you go. The

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:19.170
risotto is cooked when the rice is mainly
soft but with a bit of texture (or bite ) too.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.409
When you re happy that it s cooked, take it
off the heat and stir through the parmesan.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.200
Taste it. Does it need a little bit of seasoning?
Serve either immediately or let it rest off

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.989
the heat for 10 minutes or so. Flora Mum Tips:
You could also use a different cheese try

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.209
goats cheese, gorgonzola, or feta You could
stir through some pine nuts (for added crunch

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:45.079
and healthy omegas!) Try melting 2 tsp Flora
Buttery in a small pan and adding a handful

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:52.329
of sage leaves. Gently fry them for 5 minutes
or so then let them drain (and become crispy!)

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.200
on some paper towel. Serve on top of the risotto
for a posh restaurant effect (and brilliant

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.810
flavour!). You can buy sage in the fresh herb
section of any major supermarket or try your

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.749
