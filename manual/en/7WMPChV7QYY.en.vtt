00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.009
Your average skateboarder started and got
hooked on skateboarding because it was different.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.160
Because it was different than the team sports
and it allowed a lot of creative freedom.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.420
And so your general population of skateboarders
are really creative individuals that think

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.689
a bit outside the box.

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.901
So when that happens you have their music
tastes and their clothing tastes and, they

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:34.690
make up words for different things like slang
terms.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.170
And it becomes really – it becomes a trendsetter.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.760
It really drives something new into the media
and it drives something new that people start

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.490
noticing different musical tastes and music
artists.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.340
It’s very evident how skateboarding has
changed fashion and what people are wearing.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.219
Skate shoes have become the norm and, you
know, people that are walking around that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.380
don’t skate aren’t really – they just
don’t know that the paneling on their shoe

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.750
is made for skating.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.690
It’s made because we need support in these
certain spots but now that just becomes the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.549
look of a shoe.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:27.330
With the outside of the box thinking these
skaters they have an attention to detail whereas

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.720
it might not have come out in school or it
might not have come out in a lot of different

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.140
ways that people may have thought that, you
know, they weren’t bright.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.770
When you can break down skateboarding and
you can break down these little movements

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.549
and what would look good and, you know, certain
ways they turn in like a line, they’ll turn

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.640
one way and then turn back the other way because
they like the way that that looks.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.960
Or the skate filmer will film things so that
the skater begins in the left side of the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.250
frame, leaves on like the opposite side of
the frame and in the next clip in his video

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.340
part will start the opposite way so that your
eyes move during the video.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.470
It’s really creative and with that and that
attention to detail it goes into every other

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.020
part of their life that they start to tweak
things a little bit and so they start to talk

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.420
different and they make up slang terms with
their friends.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.080
But those slang terms end up making it into
popular culture and they end up making it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.250
into like hip hop songs and things like that.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.040
And then they’re also great at designing.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.739
A lot of skateboarders are artists and one
of their outlets is a skateboard and the other

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.319
one is doing art.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.930
And then they become popular artists that
people don’t know that they actually started

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.150
in skateboarding and they’ve had like their
graphics on boards for a long time.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.020
They start to design shoes and they start
to design clothing and doing things just differently.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.810
It ends up being really refreshing for, you
know, the rest of popular culture.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.830
Without these creative individuals we’d
all be wearing like a uniform in a way.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:35.519
A skateboarder’s way of thought is so different
that I feel if somebody had some sort of dilemma

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.349
in their life you could ask a skateboarder
for an outside opinion, an outside of the

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.450
box.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.920
You may be getting into a double edged sword
because depending on which skateboarder and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.250
what you’re asking.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.880
You may get something that is absolutely ridiculous
or you could get something that’s absolutely

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.200
brilliant.
