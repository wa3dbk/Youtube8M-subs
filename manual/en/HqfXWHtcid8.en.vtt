00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:01.920
In this tutorial

00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:04.437
we are going to explore different methods 

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:07.227
to draw objects in Synfig

00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:10.130
First, we are going to use the rectangle tool

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.522
to create the sky.

00:00:12.034 --> 00:00:14.102
Let's choose the rectangle tool.

00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:16.312
In the tool's parameters

00:00:16.562 --> 00:00:17.983
we check that the region check box

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.335
is selected

00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:22.238
Now we can draw the rectangle.

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:25.244
We choose a color

00:00:27.971 --> 00:00:29.096
and fill it.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.494
We are going to create a road now.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.716
For that, we are using the polygon tool.

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:41.415
let's choose it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.216
check the parameters

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.835
and create the road.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:55.722
With this tool

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:58.608
we can create objects with many sides.

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.972
The minimum is three sides.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.625
Choose the color

00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:13.875
and fill the polygon.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.307
It's a good practice to change the name of the layers.

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:22.864
Let's call this layer: road

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.609
Finally

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:31.711
we are going to create some mountains

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:34.910
The mountains should be placed

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.200
on top of the sky

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:38.143
but bellow the road.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.455
So we select the sky layer

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.643
before drawing the mountains.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.757
We are going to use the drawing tool

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:47.632
because it allow us to create objects

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.188
with more complex shapes.

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:51.103
We choose the tool,

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:53.348
check the parameters,

00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:54.990
choose a color,

00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:57.598
and we draw the mountain.

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:10.598
I'm joining the extreme points

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:11.763
of the line

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.274
than define the mountain.

00:02:14.757 --> 00:02:16.939
This step is not really necessary.

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:19.672
Let's call these layers

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.910
mountains.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.081
We called the first one mountains outline

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:25.558
and the other one

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:27.552
we called mountains Region.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.507
This is going to be the background

00:02:36.607 --> 00:02:38.303
for our animation,

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:41.377
so we are going to select all the layers

00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:42.706
and we are going to group them,

00:02:43.172 --> 00:02:45.587
Finally, we change the name of the group

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:47.019
to "background".

00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.439
Thanks for watching the video.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:51.451
In the next video

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.036
we are going to create an airplane.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.382
See you next time.
