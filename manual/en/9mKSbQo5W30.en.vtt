00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.700
Rather than the river extending across the plain

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860
come over this way instead

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.240
as I call out for the drifters

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.780
Back when I ate my heart and withered up

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.800
sick with malady, I wore a fever

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.620
Drifting away, streaming away

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.420
nothing but going with the flow

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.660
Waterfalls of rain, the sky cried down rain

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.740
chipping away at my polluted body

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.360
The nights cleave up anger, like hell I’ll be healed

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.300
in this clan of wishers, as a Kobito

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.880
“When you hide the sequel to the paper picture story

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.280
far off in time, what about the people in the portrait?”

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.980
If that question is asked, “I don’t know” is the response

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.900
Don’t worry about it, come now, that there is you

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.660
The rain that closed, that stopped pouring

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.400
grows again to the point where I’m soaked

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.620
The rusted rain, the moldy rain

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.780
beat down against the hill’s colours

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.420
The moon’s dance is a party up until dawn

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.660
I’m confined to the ground’s rumbles

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.620
Did I pack it with me?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.420
The lost property of that oni

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.720
It’ll become a place of rushing wind

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.580
if I cross into the next world

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.800
It’ll turn to dancing razor wind

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.680
if I were to wish it so

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.360
Was the voice I found really there?

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.020
In that purification needle

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.320
The light piercing nights, the fruit of their reward is

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.380
begging for that day, as a prayer
