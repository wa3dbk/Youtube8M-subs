00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.850
DADDY BRAD: Today’s episode goes out to
those Due Dads, those expecting and first

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.280
time fathers.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.721
DADDY CLAY: We’ve had a lot of these guys
on DadLabs.com asking about what car seat

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:12.349
to choose, so we thought we would do a little
car seat 411.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.400
DADDY CLAY: You know Brad today’s episode
has me thinking about the Sphinx’s riddle

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.060
to Oedipus. What walks on four feet in the
morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.810
DADDY BRAD: That’s tough. Man.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.740
DADDY CLAY: Right. And like that, car seats
change according to age and size.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.789
DADDY BRAD: Can you say Oedipus on the internet?

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.890
DADDY CLAY: Welcome to DadLabs.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:57.210
DADDY BRAD: This is a classic, rear facing
infant seat. This model is from Chicco. The

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.269
rear facing baby seat is usually good from
birth up to over age one, this particular

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:10.439
seat is rated for up to 30 pounds. These are
two-piece units with a base that goes into

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:24.390
car and then what we called the baby bucket.
With this setup, you just pop the baby carrier

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.080
out, if the baby is sleeping, take it into
a restaurant, some will transition to a stroller.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.680
You can go house, car, stroller without waking
the baby. Hopefully.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.200
DADDY CLAY: So this is what is called a convertible
seat. Convertible because it can be a rear

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.310
facing infant seat and convert to a forward
facing toddler seat. With this particular

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.360
unit from Britax, rear facing, from newborn
all the way to 33 pounds. Then it swings around

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.450
to front facing and is good until the kiddo
is 65 lbs or 49”. So if this one seat works

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:16.800
from the time the kid is born until she’s
4 feet tall, why would you get the infant

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:29.520
seat. This style doesn’t have a detachable
baby bucket. This thing gets in there solid.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.810
Now, one thing with both the rear facing infant
or convertible - I think there is a temptation,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.120
to get the baby turned around as soon as possible
– the earliest is 1 year AND 20 lbs. You

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.940
want to see the little guy. But resist that.
Keeping the baby rear facing to the max your

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.840
seat is rated is the safest.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.060
And there are gizmos to help you see the baby,
but none of them are approved by the seat

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.850
makers, so we can’t get behind them either.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.220
DADDY BRAD: When the kid outgrows the forward
facing car seat, then he graduates to a booster.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.650
The booster raises the child up, so that the
cars seatbelts will fit them properly. This

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.750
Nautilus unit from Graco, actually converts
from being a forward facing child seat with

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.540
a five-point harness, then it becomes a full
back booster.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.450
DADDY CLAY: Finally, when the child is about
4’9”, between 8 and 12, they can sit in

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.720
the back seat without any help.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.920
The AAP says they shouldn’t ride shotgun
until age 13, some parents think the kids

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.200
think that kids shouldn’t sit in the front
sea until they drive. Good luck with that.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.990
DADDY BRAD: All 50 states have laws regarding
child safety seats, but these should be seen

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.680
as bare minimums. You can do better.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.920
DADDY CLAY: To review:

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.690
DADDY BRAD: Rear facing infant seat of convertible
from birth until the maximum allowed weight

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.800
on you seat -- you have to wait at least until
the baby is one and twenty pounds.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.200
DADDY CLAY: Then things turn around with a
convertible or toddler forward facing seat.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.830
There they stay until they outgrow the limits
of the seat. On this Britax Boulevard -- that’s

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.340
four feet or 65 lbs. Age six to eight.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:32.100
DADDY BRAD: Then they graduate to the booster
that uses the seatbelts -- good up to 4’9”,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:44.440
then they’re good with just the belts in
the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:54.280
back seat.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:16.150
DADDY BRAD: That’s all for us this week,
in the Lab.
