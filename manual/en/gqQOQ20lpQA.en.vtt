Hi I'm Kev Harland from

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.950
Newcastle upon Tyne in the UK

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.310
and I'm gonna show you the

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.830
signal flow my home studio which is
based around

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.650
using an iPad. This assignment is for
week 1

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.779
of the Introduction to Music Production at
Coursera.org.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.630
So without further ado let's get
started.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.730
Sound starts as longitudinal
pressure variations in the air.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.760
Those pressure variations

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.390
strike the MXL 990 condenser microphone

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.930
and are then converted by the
microphone

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.110
into voltage variations that travel
along

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.430
a balanced 3 pin XLR cable to the mic
input

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.309
of my Fast Track Pro audio interface. The
first part of the interface

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.269
is the microphone preamp; I need to
turn up the gain control

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.000
to get a good signal. My interface has a
48v

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Phantom Power Switch around the back and
iPad switch on the front

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.450
since this is a condenser mic I need to
have

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.330
Phantom Power switched on and because
I'm recording the voice

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.750
I won't need to engage the Pad which
would make the signal to low.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.390
the signal is brought up to line level

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.100
by adjusting the gain control where it's
then converted

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.110
into a digital signal by the analog to
digital converter

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.640
inside the interface once converted

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.060
the signal is digital basically just
remove ones and zeros

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.740
and it's able to leave the interface
fire USB cable

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.810
on its way to the iPad however the Fast
Track Pro is designed to be powered via

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.000
the USB

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.300
the computer it's attached to and
unfortunately and iPad just doesn't have

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.040
enough power

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.950
to run it so I use a Belkin powered USB
hub

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.070
to provide the power to the Fast Track
Pro the USB signal passes through the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.440
hope

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.570
on its way to my iPad where are you some

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.750
converters to convert from USB to Apple

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.690
lightning connector the way I've done
this is by plugging the USB lead

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.769
into an Apple Camera Connection Kit and
then

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.780
into an Apple 30-pin adapter to Apple
lightning cable

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.610
there may be other adapters that take
the USB signal strength into the iPad

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.040
however this works okay for me from
there the signal

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.600
enters my digital audio workstation
gordy 8w

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.420
which is key basis for iPad in Cubase is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.920
I need to select the correct audio input
and usually leave the fader

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.940
at 0db while checking my levels on the
audio interface

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.080
and setting my microphone preamp very
carefully

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.020
when I play the trackback the digital
audio goes from the audio track

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.270
to the main output fifty basis and then
exits the computer

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.959
for the iPad rather back along the USB
cable

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.959
and goes by the USB hope to the Fast
Track Pro

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.010
interface and finally reaches my years

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.970
through my a kg headphones and that's a
signal flow

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.310
my studio just one thing before it go
there is another benefit to using a USB

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.060
hub

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.190
other than supplying power and that is
the you can

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.310
add any USB MIDI keyboard or the
controller

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.840
to the setup by plugging into the herb
okay

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.319
so that's my iPad signal flow please let
me know if I've missed anything

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.959
or you have any questions and thank you
for taking the time to check it out

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:38.530
but I
