00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's talk about how to move and maneuver
the accordion while you're playing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.519
First of all, you want to make sure that you've
got the straps unhooked on the bottom of the

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:23.080
instrument, and, again, on the top.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:32.640
Next, you want to place your hand inside the
leather strap which should have a connector

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.980
on top that allows you to tighten it or loosen
it.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.380
There should be just enough room in there
for you to be able to slide your hand up and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.840
down so that you can pass easily over the
bass notes.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.830
Second of all, I always want to think of holding
the accordion underneath the base of it.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.260
I never want to hold the accordion with the
keys.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.430
They're just for playing, yes.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.810
Also, another notable part of the instrument,
on the left hand side, is the air release

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.060
valve.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.690
This is a really important part of the instrument.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.189
It allows you to open and close the bellows
without making any noise.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.400
So, if you've been playing and you're stuck
in an open position like this, you can use

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.659
the air release valve to quietly close the
instrument without making any noise.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.500
Once again, when you're playing as you press
a note you push and pull with the bellows

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.050
in order to make the sound occur.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:43.190
Again, to move without making any noise, press
the air release valve, and you can close the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.120
accordion.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.450
Most all of the emotion of the accordion comes
from the bellows.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.950
It's one of the most important parts in playing,
so how you choose to breathe with the instrument

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.899
really affects your playing.
