00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.299
with that

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.069
the court here in california was uh...
very clear on three to nothing rolling

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:25.740
and um... of sorts out the california
supreme court action the clear on this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.260
now you're being very clear left
district court of appeals for several

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.750
years and burn it you know california
lows yet again

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.870
at some point five

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.430
and i agree with a fourth district uh...
y

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.590
it's a religious what did they send yet
so here's what happened to girls uh...

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.349
apparently lesbians in the school
principal

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:48.769
advice and officers any have you guys
been you know in some of those issue

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:49.949
nine sin

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.889
the different is accurate that uh... and
needs an anomaly the intervention is a

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.180
broke

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.040
and he said prop any specifically at
somebody there's a lot with each other

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.729
and they said always will be bubble tea
we are we are religion is a lot

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.070
and he said great that your suspended
from school

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.789
because if it was the as at uh... this

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.200
uh... california youth russell soldiers

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.110
this one up through the course is the
mid-seventies support district and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260
having with freedom of the school bus

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.750
reside route than theirs

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.420
uh... their bases for the decision is

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.830
this institution is religious

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.480
and its main point is to be religious so
if it's a public high school obviously

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.820
they can't do right and if it's
something that's even cause he publicly

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.550
the voice yes

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.360
yet you use public spaces a lot of times
should be open everybody and your main

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.840
point isn't to be religious

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.060
they know you got a include everybody or
the rotary club or whatever it might be

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.970
but if you're all playing is the
religious persecution of ironing

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.360
and you have these rules within your
religion

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.719
well that i had alleged to have those
remains and i'm linda one further

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.720
liability

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.030
you give no tax break you get no help
from the government ever to do anything

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.310
at all

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.850
your money will credit your because we
have to go through that process to help

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.669
these kids get the college later

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.109
but that's it and school get big tax
breaks and i'm sure they get a big tax

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.279
break

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.699
no idea of the survivors ok suspect
would stop i'm willing to get you did

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.590
except for the other although i agree
with you it is you're right

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.609
it dig they're getting all the facts
racism colleges

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.190
charities foundations schools etcetera

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.640
g_o_p_ lekha and it's not fair has
suffered especially when you get

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.400
discriminated and i feel i really don't
mind you discriminate no i i i i had a i

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.580
guess you're coming at you don't do this
discrimination you view it as an editor

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.500
centers or whatever it is but we can't
have it if you want to set up ah...

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.310
scientology school or a school of
martians

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.630
ancillary marches rollout it's america
you can do it right

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.890
but ben's right you don't get a tax
break for school margins or for the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.930
lutheran school it doesn't make sense
that's not

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.169
the rules that we want to make it as a
society and if you wanna go outside of

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.860
those it's a free country but you don't
get to profit often i wasn't you know

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.069
title wasn't

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.429
you know we were talking with us so

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.279
forgive me if my memory is a little bit
longer but during the reagan

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.679
administration that was basically the
issue with bob jones university and all

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.419
reagan wanted to make sure a mistress
wanna make sure we gave bob johnson

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.679
there's significant tax breaks that

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.469
the university's death in the upper
left-hand elaboration bleeding hit there

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:31.059
is no tax rates no one ever said you
can't

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:32.329
impurities

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.870
in essentially the eventually bob jones
had relented otherwise

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.810
and frankly what was going to happen
which is their release any assistance

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.119
whatsoever

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.189
that didn't go back and if that's cool
just a little bit more is excluding tax

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.829
report which is uh... obviously a very
good one uh... made by then

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.360
look because if we say that the f_a_a_
it

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.430
except a gay and lesbians and
transgender froze

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.939
into school then we can really make take
all the different parts the religion you

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:59.609
know

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.479
and then get into a no you can't do this
you do that r_u_ you know

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.239
and the station be allowed to do that
nontraditional relationships are with

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.129
the religion and religion

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.719
can interfere with stress

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.939
there you go is a deal
