00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.300
 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.390
Everybody talks about mega pixels, they all say megapixels are important, they're not

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.230
it's a big fantasy, this supposedly has 47 i think it is, or 41 megapixels

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.470
well that's more than a camera you use to do borders on the side of what a building would have,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.130
so

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.300
if it has got many megapixels that's
phenomenal

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.330
but to be honest with you as long as you've got 5

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.780
you've got plenty its much more important that its got a fairly good lens on it than

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.360
a good sensor. I've even managed

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.740
to break the camera and knock the micro phone off, never mind, little comedy moment for you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.030
there.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.180
If i have a photograph of you holding it,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.390
this is bill with his tea bag

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.700
bids out and we'll put the money to a charity organisation or something.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.170
wheat do you reckon? if it's all for charity,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.229
there you go, and we will be needing money

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.050
show off the tea bags,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.340
two identical, two identical, a matching pair

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.490
we're going to do this for real, bill can you go back into the light just a tiny bit

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.610
there we go that's cool.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.620
John quickly hold my hand, why?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.720
we're just talking about one of your cameras, this is John Owen from fujii,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.480
do you like it? nice sexy as hell isn't it. How did you get that

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.990
we stole it. Actually what i want to ask is what it's all about.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780
Did you have some kind of trauma when you were little or something?

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.980
with that particular image I think it it
is sad, um it is. it's putting a lump

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.620
in my throat now actually thinking about it.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.580
It really is. I don't know if you heard that but

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.540
he's not well and he always had health problems and he's got a hole in his heart.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.220
I can't imagine what it must be like, and how you cope you know,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.250
well sometimes you don't.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.770
Oh wow

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.820
look at that,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.990
she's just kind of corressing

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.770
it is one of those amazing moments. I can tell from the nip in the air

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.650
that autumn is just around the corner

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.270
and somewhere a farmer must be plowing the field because  i can smell the new turned earth.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.160
And on top of all that I get to ride one of the best roads in England.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.330
really is an incredible world we live in
where something as beautiful as that can go on

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.170
i just love it, don't you want to capture it.
