00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.070
Lucky were those who owned a games console
in the 90s - luckier still were those who

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.350
had access to multiple consoles.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.300
However, at least growing up, it was rare
indeed to find someone with a decked out Genesis

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.360
complete with CD drive.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.950
As such Sonic CD was only ever enjoyed in
bursts at retail stores and despite ports

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.529
to other platforms, it was never quite a complete
experience.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.470
Enter one Christian Whitehead, a proof of
concept on the iPhone and after two years

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.450
we now have access to the penultimate version
of this game.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.530
Except there's still one tiny problem - the
touch screen.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.780
Rebuilt almost entirely from the ground up,
Sonic CD for iOS is a complete marvel, with

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.690
levels blitzing their way past at lightning
speeds featuring no slowdown in the process

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.470
despite the frantic and complex 2D visuals.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.060
It's a visual feast made all the more amazing
thanks to the game's time-traveling premise.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.470
After deciding to visit a strange land that
appears only once a year, Sonic comes across

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.200
Dr. Eggman's (Robotnik) plan to steal all
of the time crystals it contains.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.289
And so the usual premise of collecting gems
and defeating Eggman is once again justified,

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.469
however there's a new twist - upon collecting
'Past' or 'Future' tokens, Sonic can shift

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.499
through time (should he build up speed and
hold it for long enough) reaching past, present

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.179
and future incarnations of the zone.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.869
In order to gain the 'good' ending, Sonic
needs to travel to the past to destroy a hidden

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.299
robot manufacturing machine in every zone
- collecting all 7 time zones by opening portals

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.979
at the end of a level with 50 rings does much
the same thing automatically.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.310
The reason this is so amazing is in how it
affects the game's level directly, with future

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.799
versions of the area becoming more robotic,
dangerous and trap filled if left untouched,

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.310
or reaching a 'utopian' alternative with relatively
few enemies or traps if you clear Eggman's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.540
machines.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.940
The visuals and background soundtrack change
to reflect shifts in the era, making for a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.069
dense aesthetic feast.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.500
And yes, for those wondering both the US and
the Japanese soundtracks have been included

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.380
and can be switched via the options.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.480
The only weak link in the chain is the controls.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.190
Despite the responsive virtual pad and very
generously sized jump button, it's all too

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.170
easy to have Sonic jive away uselessly while
you attempt to spin - familiarity makes things

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.660
easier, but it can't replace the certainty
of physical controls and is a flaw in Sonic

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.350
CD's otherwise perfect recreation.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.220
If you're a Sonic fan who has been craving
a serious platforming title, you'd do well

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.099
to dive in to this spectacular feast; however
if you're one of those who demands utter perfection

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.250
from their controls, you may want to wait
for the Live Arcade or Playstation Network

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.590
release.
