00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.290
What is the Paleo Diet

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
The Paleo diet has actually been around since
the 1970s.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.220
However, it has only recently gained popularity
and was actually the top searched for diet

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.560
in
Google in 2013.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
This diet is actually designed after people
who

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.440
lived in the Paleolithic era of Earth's history.
It's also called the Caveman diet by some

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.880
people.
The general idea is that to be your healthiest,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.850
you should eat the way our earliest ancestors
did.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.929
Before we had agriculture to plant crops and
care for animals, people were hunter-gatherers.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.180
They ate meat that they could catch and kill
and

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.710
they gathered whatever vegetation they could
safely eat.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.520
Their diet didn't consist of any grains, dairy,
or

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.070
processed foods.
The modern Paleo diet tries to mimic this

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.960
type
of diet. You'll be eating organically grown

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.690
or
raised produce and meat.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.480
But you won't consume dairy, grains, or any
food that's processed.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.670
Processed foods include those that contain
sugar, grains, artificial flavors, artificial

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.609
sweeteners, or preservatives.
If you eat the typical Western diet this probably

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.030
sounds like quite a challenge. Many people
rely on processed foods for the majority of

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.790
their
calories.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.890
Unfortunately, those processed foods cause
a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.100
world of problems including weight gain and
disease.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.959
There are many benefits to switching to a
new

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.220
way of eating and you'll also find that once
you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.300
get used to it, this diet is fairly easy to
follow.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.850
With the Paleo diet, you'll be eating foods
like:

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.630
Vegetables, Fruits (especially those low in
sugar), Fresh and dried herbs, Poultry, Beef,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.980
Pork, Lamb, Fish and other seafood, Eggs,
Nuts and Seeds or Healthy oils.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.489
For all of these you'll want to choose organic
foods. When it comes to meat and poultry you

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.079
want to look for free range, grass fed, organic
meats. For seafood, it's best to stick to

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.630
wild
caught.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.550
The Paleo diet also eliminates foods like
these:

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.209
Grains (including wheat, oats, corn, rice),
Legumes (beans, peanuts etc.), Dairy, Refined

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:43.380
sugar, Salt, Vegetable oils that are refined,
Potatoes, Alcohol or Anything processed

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.720
These foods are ones that may cause weight
gain and health problems. Cavemen didn't

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.130
have access to this type of food! Remember
that soy (or soya) products actually come

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.950
from
soy beans.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.760
These aren't part of the paleo plan.
