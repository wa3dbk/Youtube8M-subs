Hi this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:09.860
On today's episode let's take a close look
at iCloud Drive.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.970
Now previously you may have stored all of
your files in the Documents folder.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.619
In your User folder and the Documents folder
you can create any kind of hierarchy of different

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.800
folders with project names and put any type
of file you want in there.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.050
That's kind of where your documents lived.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.489
That is still there and still available.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.259
But another option is to use iCloud Drive
now for the same sort of thing.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.280
If you have already been using iCloud Drive,
say with iOS 8, then you will probably notice

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.900
folders here for things like Pages, Numbers,
and Keynote.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.760
These are the classic iCloud applications
that have been using iCloud documents for

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.270
a long time.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.550
What we haven't seen up until now is the ability
to look in the Finder to see what is inside

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.640
these folders.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.140
So I can see here what is in my Pages folder.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.140
This is equivalent to what I would see if
I was looking in Pages in iOS 8 and just going

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.190
to open a document there.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.650
I would see those same files there.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.350
So this is the Pages document's area for iCloud.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.210
Now we can see it with iCloud Drive and the
same for any other iCloud documents application

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.580
whether it is Numbers, Keynote, or some third
party app.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.390
You are also going to see apps like TextEdit
that use iCloud but there is no iOS 8 equivalent.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.620
There is no TextEdit app on iOS 8.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.210
So this is only really for sharing between
Macs.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.330
If I were to use TextEdit to open a document
in another Mac, say my laptop, then I would

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.300
be able to see the same files that are in
here in the TextEdit space.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.409
But in addition to that with iCloud Drive
I can also create my own folders like I have

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.860
here or just put files here at the main level.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.049
So really use it just like the Documents folder
and put my own set of folders here and put

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.850
any file I want into them.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.990
I can put images into them.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.800
I can put files that don't have a supporting
iCloud app like some design documents or things

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.880
like that where they don't fit Pages, Numbers,
or Keynote.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.800
I can put Microsoft word documents in here
if I wanted to.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.560
Your iCloud Drive documents stay in sync with
your other Macs.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.170
So, for instance, here I'm looking at my desktop
Mac and I've got the iCloud Drive folder open.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.090
I've got Screen Share here showing my laptop,
my MacBook Air which is sitting next to it.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.230
You can see I've got that open also to show
iCloud Drive.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.750
On my desktop here, my local drive, I've got
this Testing.txt file.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.020
So I'm going to drop this test file into iCloud
Drive and it will appear here in iCloud Drive

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.410
and then if I give it just a few seconds it
will also sync over and appear here on the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.410
MacBook Air.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.720
You can see there it is and you can even see
a progress bar as it adds it.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.130
So I've got that now added automatically and
you can see these two folders, these two iCloud

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.042
Drive folders, which are the same folder but
this one exists on my local drive and this

00:02:58.042 --> 00:02:59.629
one is on another Mac.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.760
They will stay in sync.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.680
All the files are really in three places here.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.490
They are on my local desktop drive, they automatically
sync to the iCloud Drive server at Apple,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.130
and then they sync over to any other Macs
that I've got that are using the same Apple

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.709
ID that does have the same shared iCloud Drive.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.310
Now here you can see my iCloud Drive folder
on my Mac.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.080
I'm looking inside the Pages folder here to
see what is there.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.050
I've got three files and a subfolder.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.100
Then on the other side of the screen you can
see my iPad and I've got Pages open and I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.379
can see the same documents in there just on
the Documents screen.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.440
If I were to add a new one you would see it
appear, copied from one to the other.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.940
So let's add one here on the iPad.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:53.519
I'll just create a blank one, put test, and
then I will just name it test2.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:01.290
Then I'll go back to the Documents screen
and you can see test2 is there and if I wait

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.200
I'll see that test2 will now go over here.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.700
It says updating one document and it's sending
it to the iCloud server and then once it is

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.519
in the iCloud server my Mac will recognize
that there is a new file there and will update

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.519
it here.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.519
You can see it is here.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.100
There is a little symbol there saying it is
not yet downloaded but if I just wait a few

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.180
more seconds the symbol will disappear as
it syncs to the Mac.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.350
Now I've got this file in both places.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.880
Now what about outside of the Pages folder.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.470
Say I've stored something else on iCloud Drive
but not in the Pages folder.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.690
I've put it in this folder I created called
Project A and its a Pages document.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.080
Well, I can open that by going and hitting
the plus button at the upper left in Pages

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.460
there, hitting iCloud and now I can see the
entire iCloud Drive including the Project

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.710
A folder.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.979
Select that, select that document there, and
it will open up that document but not only

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.580
that it is going to put a link to it here
in the Pages folder here, and you can see

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.590
it adds In iCloud Drive after it.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.900
So now when I go back to document you can
see that my doc is now listed there.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.360
It has got a different color to the name but
it kind of makes it easy to find Pages documents

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.300
that aren't stored inside the Pages folder.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.310
You can almost ignore the Pages folder, if
you want, and just create your own subfolders

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.949
and then get these documents as you need them.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.500
Now another way you can access your files
in iCloud Drive is using iCloud.com.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.000
You go to iCloud.com, log in with your Apple
ID and there is an iCloud Drive icon there.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.919
You can go in there and you can see not only
your Pages, Numbers, and Keynote and other

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:55.920
app's folders there but you can also go into
your custom made folders and see those files

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
there.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.660
You can even open up these files here in the
actual app's in the web side of things.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.570
So I can use the Pages web version to open
up that Pages document there.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.630
Now another thing you can use iCloud Drive
for is for supporting documents.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.919
So, for instance, say I put an image here
in my Project A folder on my iCloud Drive.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.050
Then on my iPad I want to import an image
into a document.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.190
So let's go to the test2 document here and
put the cursor right there.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.190
I'm going to then hit the plus symbol.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.060
I can see my photo albums here where I can
insert an image and that is as before.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.360
But I've got Insert From now.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.490
Tap Insert From and I can see my iCloud files.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.470
I can go to Project A. Sure enough there is
the image there.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.919
I can select that one and it will import in.

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.580
There you go.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.319
So without adding an image to my Camera Roll
or bringing it into Photos at all I can actually

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.460
bring it in here to Pages just using iCloud
Drive.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.210
Kind of like you would do it on a Mac if you
were using Pages.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.080
You can just bring the file in very easily.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.980
You can also use iCloud Drive to export files.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.910
So, for instance, say I'm in this Pages document
here and I want to share it.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.520
I'm going to say Send a Copy.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.479
It is going to ask me to choose a Format.

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.729
So say I want to send it in pdf format.

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.580
I can now choose how to send.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.199
You can see I have the Send to little folder
with an arrow there.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:32.789
I can select a folder in iCloud Drive and
hit Export to this location.

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:39.860
Now it will send it out and I will see it
actually appear on my Mac after a few seconds.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.279
There it is.
