00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.650
...The S4 I thought it would probably be smaller
here and it would just kinda throw off this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:15.850
whole purpose but it actually does it really
smart...

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.340
Hello everyone Michael here with the daily
note 2 and 3 YouTube channel as he could see

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.930
of the galaxy S4 and the galaxy note 3 next
to each other something interesting happened

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.730
to my galaxy S4 yesterday I got the android
4.3 update officially and one of the data

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.210
came with was the update to group play so
let's start this app

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.640
I'm going to create a group here and I will
to join a group here now what this is doing

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.790
is when you create a group on one of the devices
it opens up ad hoc Wi-Fi connection and the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.050
other device that your joining with it'll
search for the work group play on the Wi-Fi

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.809
connection and just join it automatically
maybe if it sees more than one it'll probably

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.149
ask you to choose one so I'm going to show
you the coolest feature first which is called

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.750
share video and I think this actually a useful
feature when you're traveling with a companion

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.470
and they have the galaxy note 3 or the galaxy
S4 and I think this feature this update is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.350
coming on the galaxy note 2 and possibly the
S3 as well

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.659
so I'm just going to start a video from this
end

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.200
and I will start that video here we go and
you could see that the one icon it's saying

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:36.840
user 1 is sharing a video so I'm going to
join this video stream and you could see that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.700
the video is totally in sync you could rotate
enjoy the movie experience together while

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.970
watching a different screen and I think that's
a powerful thing to be doing so that's one

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.299
thing you could do
you could skip to different parts of the video

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.689
and out it'll sync up and there's no problems
with syncing it just works really well you

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:03.700
can actually join these videos together
it's making one large-screen here and I thought

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.030
this wouldn't work with the galaxy S4 too
well because note this is a different screen

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.410
size but it's doing a really smart I tried
it with two note 3's and you know worked well

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.620
with the S4 I thought it would probably be
smaller here and it was kind of just throw

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.450
off this whole purpose but it actually does
a really smart

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.810
now here's something interesting when you
change the volume on the master device ok

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.200
you could control the master volume and you
could control the volume on the other devices

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.150
as well now you might be thinking who really
wants to do this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.940
maybe it's just a cool feature to show people
but just watching this together I think he

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.650
could actually have a pleasant experience
watching a video on slightly larger screen

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.430
than your smartphone imagine you had three
phones he could definitely take up most of

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.900
the real estate on three phones so let's try
share music this time I'm going to share on

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.800
the galaxy S4 and I'm just going to choose
one of these files here you could I could

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.239
join it here and I'm getting weird pop up
saying that I could use the NFC features on

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:18.459
these devices to position the speakers
so this something interesting there's a play

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.330
button and a settings button
instead of using NFC you could use this to

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.190
just choose the device that you want to place
in different locations for surround sound

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.120
when I get my galaxy note 2 updated maybe
I'll try to see if I'm really getting that

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:51.290
surround sound let's try share pictures

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.400
I can flip to the next picture
on the other device

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.170
but is this 
some kind of storyboard thing

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.220
this shows them all at once
that's interesting and I can draw on here

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.779
that's cool, erase
okay that's it for the picture feature

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:34.490
let's go to play games and more
go to download now I didn't see much here

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.360
so I believe you have to have it installed
on both devices

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.379
so anyway that's a quick look at the group
play feature

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.759
I definitely think the share video is a great
feature

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.039
Can't use it all the time but maybe once in
a while when you're traveling with a friend

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.770
it'll be a really great feature to have
as for other features I think the play games

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.349
and more seems like there's not any apps that
I could use that with unfortunately

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.009
and one last thing I know I'm going to get
this question a lot for this video but when

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.990
is the galaxy note 2 getting the android 4.3
update

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.270
I personally don't know myself
I've read all the Internet websites saying

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.539
that it's coming sometime in November that
might be true for some carriers that push

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.050
out updates early especially the ones in Korea
if you're in the US it takes a little bit

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.719
longer than that I think they tend to get
that same build that Samsung gives all the

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.580
carriers and some carriers take a little longer
than others to add their apps to it and push

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.319
it out to their users now if you have a galaxy
S4 and you're waiting for the android 4.3

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.039
update I do have a sub channel called the
daily S4

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.800
I haven't any videos recently but I am planning
to do a video that's going to show you all

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.360
the updates that you get for android 4.3 on
the galaxy S4 so please check out my YouTube

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.740
channel for more videos on the galaxy note
2 and 3 and there should be a link to the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.039
daily S4 YouTube channel as well and make
sure you subscribe for more upcoming videos

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:03.509
