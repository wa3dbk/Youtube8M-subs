00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.855
MATT FURNISS: There's eight
games today, so there's one

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:04.580
early game kicking off in
15 minutes, QPR-Norwich.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.620
Then six games at 3 o'clock,
and then one late

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.930
game at half 5:00.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.060
So yeah, it'll get busy
around 3 o'clock.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.630
We are the content and customer
service team, so we

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.000
will provide all the stats
for our Twitter

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640
feeds, for our clients.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.120
Editorially, we'll be doing
features, packs for TV

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.130
companies, sending everything
out to the newspapers.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.270
Whereas the guys in the other
room in the operation's team,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.500
they'll b recording all the
data, and they will be, sort

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490
of handling everything that
goes on behind the scenes.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.290
We can't plan what's
going to happen.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.210
We have a set routine of
things we need to do.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.280
We have a list of everything
we need to do, but, I mean,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.900
football is unpredictable.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.150
You can never tell what's
going to happen.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.740
So this is our analysis room.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.319
At the moment, they're analyzing
the game live.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.760
We have a guy for each
team and a checker.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.700
So if anyone has any questions
about the dates they're

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.170
putting in, they'll flag it up,
and then the checker can

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.910
check by just going back,
replaying the footage, and

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.440
then re-inputting the data.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
On certain games, we record
about 1,800 actions a game,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.900
so, I mean around 900 a team.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.240
Obviously it's going to be a lot
more if you're analyzing

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.760
Barcelona than you are Stoke
or QPR or Norwich.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.040
We have about 200 applications
every summer

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.950
for operations guys.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.690
Maybe four or five will get
through to the final section

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.765
where they'll be trained up.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.220
I mean, hand-eye coordination
has to be amazing.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.070
I couldn't do this myself.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.670
I'm too slow.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.590
But these guys, I mean, a
few of them have been

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.280
here for a few years.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.360
So they build up a great skill
set to be able to do this.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.940
SAM GREEN: I definitely
could not do it.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.630
And I know the hand-eye
coordination they have, so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.280
it's a pretty intense--

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.290
you've got to be doing it.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.160
It's live.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.060
You're 45 minutes late.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.950
They've got a little bit of
time to go back and check

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.350
errors during the breaks, and we
obviously go through every

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.620
match after it's happened.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.500
But while they're doing it, it's
a pretty intense 45, 50

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.300
minutes at a time where you
don't have much let-up, and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.420
it's a pretty impressive
demonstration of skills.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm not sure what skills, and
how they've built them up, but

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.230
it is more than I can
do, certainly.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.560
MATT FURNISS: It takes a
unique kind of person.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.520
I mean, if you're good at
computer games, it helps.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.855
And you have to have a really,
really good knowledge of

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:30.500
football as well.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.290
So the speed at which everything
happens, you have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.610
to be able to tell which player
is which, at least in a

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.410
blink of an eye.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.380
So if someone is wearing yellow
boots, you might be

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.180
able to say that means
that's that player.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.650
And sometimes, I mean, you might
have Rafael and Fabio,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.720
two twins on the team.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.630
So you've got to know the
characteristics of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.640
each player as well.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.570
Despite they're both from
different wings, if something

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.915
was to come into the box, you
might need to know if one

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:57.720
wears white boots, one has
tape around his socks or

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.160
something like that.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.590
So yeah, you can pick that up.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.550
A lot of it is communication.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.440
If one of them has a question,
he might say

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.060
can you double check.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.970
A defender may have made a
clearance, but it might have

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.190
been a long ball instead.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.510
So they'd ask to check it to
just check that replay, and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.450
then if it needs correcting,
correct it straight away.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.610
They'll say, here we can replay
the data, and they can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.180
double check and
pause and see.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.670
So quite often, if there's a
deflection on a goal, and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.270
we're not sure if it's a known
goal, we can then slow it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.690
down, replay it, pause it, so
we can take different angles

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.960
and have a look at whether it
is a known goal or not.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.280
Luckily, the early game today
is a dull affair between QPR

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.220
and Norwich.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.570
I say that now, and when you
film again at nine minutes,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.320
it'll be 4-0.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.210
But yeah, I mean, there's not
much going on at the moment

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.240
until something big
happens, maybe a

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.710
goal, red card, penalty.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.080
We're liaising.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.000
We have commentators for the
game across the world

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.850
providing them with
facts and data.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.550
So yeah, just waiting for
something big to happen, and

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.610
then we can get down
and do our job.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.470
BRADY HARAN: How common is it
that you will pull together

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.910
some fact or amazing piece of
trivia, send it off from your

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.376
computer, and then you hear it
come across on the TV a minute

00:04:07.376 --> 00:04:08.400
or two later?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.030
MATT FURNISS: Yeah,
quite often.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.600
I mean, there was a famous one
in the World Cup a few years

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.540
ago when Rob Green disastrously
let Clint

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.720
Dempsey's shot through his
hands against the USA.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.540
And straightaway, our team
were on to it, and we

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.630
remembered that he'd actually
made the most mistakes leading

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.930
to goals in the Premier League
that season as well.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.600
ITV mentioned it, and we were
being told on [INAUDIBLE] that

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.750
across the world, commentators
were mentioning our fact that

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.580
it was an [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.570
So that was a really
nice moment for us.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.580
And then, yeah, you
quite often--

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.370
I see Mark's doing
the commentator

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.630
support at the moment.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.480
You'll hear something that he's
just put across to them

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360
within 30 seconds.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.640
So that's as quick as
is it can happen.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.450
So say if now there's a red
card, we could research a fact

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.270
about that red card.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.380
Say it might be the player's
eighth red card.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.740
I need two players.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.870
I've got more.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.000
Or they're the team with the
most red cards this season.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.160
We could put that straight to
the commentator, and then they

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.580
can have it out and mention it
on screen within a minute.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.000
So, I mean, while the action is
fresh and while the stat is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.140
fresh, they'll have
it out there.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.725
BRADY HARAN: The commentators
sound so knowledgeable when

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:12.360
they do that.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.000
Does that frustrate you and
make you think, you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.720
didn't do know that.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.170
That was because of
me or is that--

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.000
MATT FURNISS: In fairness, the
commentators do a lot of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.050
research before the game.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.160
We're helping them out.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.210
That's our job.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.860
QPR just won a penalty.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.470
Norwich had given it away.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.230
So I can have a quick look now
to see how many penalties have

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.060
been given this season for each
side using our database.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.270
Right.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.330
So we can have a quick look now
to see Norwich's record

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.200
this season running a report.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.910
This season, QPR have
won two penalties.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.320
Both of them have been against
Norwich, home and away, and

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.430
they've had both
of them saved.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.965
SAM GREEN: QPR has now
had the last three

00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.520
penalties in a row saved.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.691
So I'll put that straight
through now to this guy who's

00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:02.941
doing the commentary.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.150
The decision to retain a player
or sign a player is, I

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.260
mean, it's literally a
multimillion pound or euro or

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.440
dollar or whatever, it's a
multi-million something

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.120
investment.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.450
I can't imagine many other
walks of life, many other

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.210
businesses where you would
just take that based upon

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.810
someone's feel and intuition,
and you'd have someone sitting

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.180
there watching them
do their job.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.340
It doesn't make sense.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.750
You'd normally have numbers in
some way of quantifying that.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.570
MATT FURNISS: The game ended in
a board draw, not the best

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.660
for our analysis.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.040
There's not too much
to talk about.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.050
So we're trying to
put together some

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.180
page-matched facts now.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.630
QPR, now five unbeaten in the
Premier League, which is the

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.000
best run in the Premier League
since March '95.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.840
And obviously, want to to know
about how Harry Redknapp has

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.310
drawn more games nil-nil than
any other manager in the

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.250
Premier League, 62nd that was.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.310
What we do now is we just put
together the page-matched

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.120
facts, save all the stats for
the game, send them out to the

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.540
media, and then just wait for
the 3 o'clock games and the

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.790
fun to start.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.730
I'd say it's been an
above-average day for action.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.620
There's quite a lot going on.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.200
There's six games
at the moment.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.220
Lukas Podolski just scored for
Arsenal, but it seems to be

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.175
disallowed.

00:07:33.175 --> 00:07:36.150
But, yeah, I mean, it's
been pretty hectic.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.500
I mean, there's a flurry of
goals around the midway point

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.910
of the first half, so yeah,
there's been right plenty of

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.869
stuff coming out today,
so yeah, it's good.
