00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Alright, I’m going to make another video
here

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.370
I just decided I’d do this while I’m servicing
my truck

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.730
I’m cleaning my K&amp;N air filter

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.700
And doing an oil change

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.189
I’ll pan under here

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.990
And I’m just letting it drip drain

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.160
Get all that crud out of there

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.640
And we’ll put some new

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.980
Some fresh motor oil in there

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560
Anyway, I’ve had to do this before

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.769
Clean my throttle body

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.289
I’ve got an error code

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.269
And I looked online and it said to

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.000
The best advice was to clean the throttle
body

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.260
And that did fix it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.050
So this is a video on how to clean

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.850
The throttle body on a new body style

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.750
Let me back up here

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.260
There you can see mine’s a 2007

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.690
So it’s the first year of the new body style

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.829
It’s not a “classic”

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.680
They do have the Silverado and Sierra “classic”

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.070
Models that are 2007

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.579
But this is not a “classic” obviously

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.969
So, I’m going to do a quick video demo

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.539
On how to clean the throttle body

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:07.460
Which is back in there

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.520
And I’ve left everything on just so

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490
I can show you step by step

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.630
So let me get started

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.080
Alright, well obviously the first thing you
want to do

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.220
Is at least remove the airbox cover

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.390
I’ve already done that

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.200
I’ve taken the whole thing out

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
And I’m cleaning the whole

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600
The top cover, the bottom

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.220
And my K&amp;N air filter

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.650
The cover is just held in by 4 screws

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960
They’re a Torx bit screw

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.220
And there are 4 of these

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.530
And so there’s 4, there’s one that would
be down here

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.960
One that would be over here

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.119
On the side of the air filter box

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.970
Up here, and up here

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.970
These down here, especially this one

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.340
It’s not really difficult to get to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.090
Use an extension, but just be

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.450
Careful when you get that screw out of there

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.310
Because I’ve dropped it a few times

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.640
And, most of the time it lands on the ground

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.590
But a couple of times its kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.780
Fallen down into this area

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.649
And it’s kind of hard to get to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.759
So just watch out for that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.080
So, of course then get your

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.320
Intake tube disconnected from your airbox

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.810
Just use a flat bladed screwdriver on this
band clamp

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.700
Twist that out

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.180
Next thing, remove the plug from your mass
airflow sensor

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.610
You just push down on this little tab right
there

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.030
And it just pops right off

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.000
So, next thing we’ve got to do

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.610
Is get this top cover off

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.280
Ok, there’s really no trick to this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.090
It’s just kind of held in place by these
little

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.040
Kind of little plugs

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.090
These little rubber plugs

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.569
So it’s not screwed down or anything like
that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.290
You just kind of grab it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.790
And lift up

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.180
And then kind of grab it

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.830
And pop it in the back

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.370
And lift up

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.580
And that’s it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.150
Whole thing just comes off like that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.620
Alright, next you want to come in here

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.129
And remove your PCV tube

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.090
The little fitting

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720
Let me zoom in a little bit there

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.310
And it’s real easy

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.890
It just pops right out

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.490
Just grab it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.459
Give it a little bit of a wiggle

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.379
Not too much

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.409
And it just pops right out

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.209
You can kind of see the little barbs

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.670
On there that hold it in place

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.750
So you get that popped out

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.849
And then we’ll come over here

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.319
And we’re ready to remove the tube

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.180
Ok, so like I said, now we just got to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.580
Come in here and take our

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.519
Big air tube assembly off

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.580
So let me zoom in here

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.620
And there’s the little band clamp

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.409
Just take a flat bladed screwdriver

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.520
And twist this off

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.500
Set the screwdriver down

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.799
And then, you’ve kind of got to lift up

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.920
Let me zoom in up here a little bit more

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.300
It’s a little hard to see

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.420
This nub right here is one of the little

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.190
Little studs that holds the, that black cover
on

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.170
And right behind it

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.830
Right in here, there’s a little stud

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.189
That the air filter (tube) kind of held on
to

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.970
So you’ve kind of got to pop that up

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.330
And then pull your assembly

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.909
Pull your air filter (tube) assembly kind
of forward

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.309
So let me show you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.110
Pop it up

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.960
And then you just kind of work it forward
like that

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.159
Alright, so we’re still hooked up

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.100
I forgot to mention this

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.580
We’re still hooked up here

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.970
This is the radiator tube

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120
Upper radiator hose right there

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.710
So we’re still kind of attached right there

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.270
So we’ll just kind of grab it

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.520
And pull it up

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.729
Like that

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.849
So there we go

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.840
Pan out

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.780
Now we’ve got our whole intake tube assembly
removed

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.560
That’s it

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.919
So now

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:58.810
As you can see there

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.930
Ready to get in there and get the throttle
body off

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.500
I just wanted to give you a quick shot

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.729
Of this factory air intake tube

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.440
It’s kind of a mess of a thing

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.310
I would assume some of this stuff

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.389
Like this little canister here

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.630
And this is for sound deadening

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.710
Or something like that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.009
But this end right here

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.199
Comes in from the air filter

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.610
This end goes into your throttle body

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.639
Yeah, I’m not real sure what all this junk
is for

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.070
But I think I’m going to get some

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.550
Like some 4” exhaust tubing

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.690
And I’ll fabricate

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.259
My own little intake tube here

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:35.870
Save me some money

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.910
Instead of having to buy one

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.400
But yeah, this is kind of a big mess of a
thing

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.150
And I think the next thing on my list of

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.699
List to do is to fabricate a new intake assembly

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:47.229
So anyway

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.910
That’s what this thing looks like

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.789
When you get it all out
