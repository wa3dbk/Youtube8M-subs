00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:04.167
My name is Paora Winitana.
I’m 34, and I play basketball.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.440
I grew up playing rugby. That’s
the normal thing in New Zealand.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.305
My new group of friends
always play basketball,

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.160
so that’s how I learned how
to play basketball.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:16.620
My first season on the 
high school A team,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.120
I got 96 points in the 
first game. All of a sudden,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.829
people got interested in my
ability to play.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.833
I’ve been lucky to play against
lots of the NBA guys:

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.708
LeBron James, Tim Duncan,
Allen Iverson,

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.417
Shawn Marion, 
Amar’e Stoudemire.

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.500
We played the USA team
before the Olympics in 2004.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.833
I had the mark up against
LeBron James.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:37.733
It takes work and effort.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.406
You can’t get that by comin’ in
casually now and then.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.040
Whatever I do, I put 100%
into it.

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.792
My sport is basketball, 
so that’s what I do.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:50.833
I’m very passionate. I love it.
I put in the time,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.708
and I work hard. It’s one of
my top priorities.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.588
But it’s not my highest
priority, you know?

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.200
Where’s your muscles, man?
Where’s your muscles, man?

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.240
Family is first for me. 
It always has been.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.750
I have a wife and sons. I love
them with all my heart.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.417
They’re the greatest thing
for me.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.200
It’s unfortunate because
a lot of your life,

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.440
you give your best to 
everyone else,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.740
and you go home and give
your family the leftovers

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.160
because you’re tired, you’re
exhausted and all that.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.420
Not with me. They get 
the best from me.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.391
I get to do things in the 
morning that matter most,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.800
and that’s being there for my
sons, for my wife—

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.620
help at home, make lunches,
breakfasts.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:38.083
I’ve been doing that for
awhile now. I’m not perfect.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.167
Sometimes they complain about
the sandwiches I make. 

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:46.750
It can be interesting. 
Three young boys, you know?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.083
Very energetic. You’ve got to
see it firsthand.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860
Tia is my Miss New Zealand.
She’s also my rock.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.320
What did you really tell them?

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:05.667
As soon as I saw you, it was 
like a scene from a movie.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.240
She comes up, hair blowing
in the wind in slow motion.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.698
Just knew straight away—“Wow, 
she’s something special.”

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:17.667
The mother’s role is so
important here.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.100
To be there with them and
help them,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.900
not only as provider, but to
assist in the nurturing—

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.520
I think that’s important for
the husbands, for fathers.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.280
This is our favorite team, and
he’s our favorite player.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.917
I don’t want to come in second.
I want to win everything I do.

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:39.917
That’s just the competitive 
nature in me.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:42.417
That’s me striving for my 
personal best in everything—

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.340
basketball, family, beliefs, 
anything.

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.500
I’m a professional 
basketball player,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.667
but more important, I’m a 
husband. I’m a father.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.007
My name is Paora Winitana.
And I’m a Mormon.
