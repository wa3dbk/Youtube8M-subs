00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
How’s it going?

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.750
Good.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.300
We all answer this question in one of two ways.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700
Good or bad.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.100
And we usually just say “good” out of convenience.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.600
Maybe it’s a social norm, or maybe we just want to avoid going into 
 detail about our personal life with the first person at the supermarket.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.100
But how are you doing?

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650
Have you ever thought about how you really live?

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.300
Of course you have.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Last night at the bar,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
lying in bed before going to sleep,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
we think about it every day.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700
What about the rest of the world?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Have you ever wondered how the rest of Earth’s almost seven billion people live?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.800
How do people with the same occupation as you live 
 their life on the other side of the globe?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.400
What are the worries and joys of those, who share the 
 same hobbies as you, but are thousands of miles away?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.800
Have you ever wondered what you have in common with 
 someone who lives so far away from your home?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.600
Maybe nothing or maybe a whole lot.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.800
Your work, your interests, your origins, attitudes and traits.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.200
This site is for those who don’t want to sit 
 at their desk and watch the paint dry.

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:11.887
This is a medium for the inhabitants of Earth, who have the 
 passion and curiosity to learn more about the world around them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What’s the difference between this site and other social networks?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900
It’s simple.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.150
We’ll be creating together,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.200
not simply reading,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.600
clicking and surfing.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
You have to get up and do something for yourself and for others.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.300
You have to venture out to the real world 
 - you have to capture your life.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280
One week of it to be precise.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.000
Nine photos every day for a whole seven days.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.800
By doing so, you’ll contribute to the largest 
 documentary project the world has ever seen.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.550
You’ll be the co-author of the largest archive the human family has ever created.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.900
You say it’s too much work?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
You’re not a photographer?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.200
You say it’s too complicated and your life is not interesting? 

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:55.390
Or are you wondering what you need to do, so you can start immediately?

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.320
I’ll answer all of these questions.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.030
First of all, you can use any camera, a compact camera being the best.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.550
You don’t need  fancy expansive SLR, even 
 a quality mobile phone camera would work.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.650
Basically, any camera you can find. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.300
Easy, right? 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.050
Then decide on what day you would like to 
 begin the first of your seven day project.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.350
Monday would be the best, but you can pick any day you like. 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.550
Always keep in mind one rule,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.880
that the nine photos you take daily should reflect your day,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
ordinary or extra-ordinary, 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.220
be it joyful, sad or boring. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.800
Simply life as it comes to you. 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.350
Each of the nine photos should express a specific activity or non-activity,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.400
which gives you meaning and is an aspect of that specific day. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We all have several things in common,

00:02:46.017 --> 00:02:47.020
such as waking up, 

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:48.220
dealing with hygiene,

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.650
eating and going to sleep. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.200
Morning, day and night,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.400
these are periods of our connection. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.000
The rest is up to you!

00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:01.010
How should I organize all this, you ask? 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.450
Again, it’s simple. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.300
We recommend making a folder 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.900
titled Week of Life on your home or work computer

00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:13.410
and add another folder for each day, Monday to Sunday, within it. 

00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:19.880
Place the nine photos that best represent each 
 given day into its respective folder. 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.500
And don’t forget to look into the “about” section,

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:28.420
where you’ll find tips on how to shoot the best set 
 and how to deal with the technical aspects of photography.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.110
It’s pretty simple. 

00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:33.940
After you’re done shooting and you’re satisfied with your photos, 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.500
go to the “upload” section and follow the instructions to upload your set.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.230
This will be your first step into the family of WEEK OF LIFE.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.950
The first and only step you’ll need to take. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.850
After this, it’s up to you how you will 
 contribute to the content of our portal. 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.450
Use this site to better your understanding of people from around 
 the world, an uncensored access to the lives of others.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.050
From the whole WEEK OF LIFE team, I wish 
 you much light and a celebrated life!
