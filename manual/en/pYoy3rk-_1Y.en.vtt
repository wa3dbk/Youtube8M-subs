00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.269
In this Alchemy Gold Making Guide, I'll be
focusing on the Elixir Spec side of Alchemy.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.609
To get started you'll need to have Alchemy
leveled up decently and if you need help with

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.579
that, I have all 1-525 leveling guides on
my website at tarouwowguides.com. It will

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.821
also teach you how to get the Elixir Spec
if you're unsure. A good profession to go

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.899
with Alchemy Elixir Spec is Herbalism.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.899
Alright, now that the initial prep is out
of the way, you can start banking with Elixir

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.260
Alchemy. I like to start the day off getting
mats for whichever CD I plan to do. Today,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.969
I'm going with Living Elements but you could
also do Truegold or sell your cooldown in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.609
trade. As for which is better, take the sale
price minus the mats and do the one with the

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.749
highest profit.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:59.179
Next, I start buying up mats for making flasks.
The best time to get mats is early morning

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.559
to afternoon or on the weekends. This is usually
when they are the cheapest but monitor your

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.310
server's Auction House to find out the best
time for you. It's also a good idea to watch

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.280
trade chat for bulk sellers and to setup some
sort of CoD or direct trade deal with farmers

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.049
if you can. Of course, if you already have
Herbalism, farm the mats yourself.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.759
Now that you've got some mats, you can start
making flasks and elixirs. The current proc

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.560
rate is semi-low and the max is four extra
flasks or elixirs which will look like x5

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.649
but you're already making one so it's really
four extra.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.250
The key to selling flasks and elixirs is timing.
6-8pm is peak time and as you can see here,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.110
sales started at around 5:30pm and were fairly
slow but by 6:50pm things started to pick

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.770
up fast. By 7:22pm I started to run out of
flasks and looks like I also pissed someone

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.880
off. Called a nerd by someone with the name,
"Knowledge", rofl. Oh noes.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.759
Alright, so it's been it's been a day and
time to see what sold, what didn't, and what

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.619
the total profit was.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.160
Grand total for Flasks of:
+ 30,231g in net sales

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.690
- 26,365.56g in mats
----------------------------

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.870
= 3,865.44g in net profit for the day

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.870
____________________________________

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.390
Grand total for Elixirs of:
+ 900g in net sales

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.610
- 418.8g in mats
----------------------------

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.630
= 481.2g in net profit for the day

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.810
Add Flasks and Elixirs together and the grand
total is:

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.570
+ 31,131g in net sales
- 26,784.36g in mats

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.760
----------------------------
= 4,346.64g in net profit for the day

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.720
For the full break down of what sold, for
how much, and what it cost to make, check

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.960
this guide on my website at tarouwowguides.com

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.920
4,346.64g in profit isn't bad but when you
see it took over 31k gold it'll make you rethink

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.500
if the risk is worth it or not. Elixirs are
good for players without a lot of gold to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.720
sink into Flasks. Just be careful as you saw
some didn't net a profit at all and were a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.470
waste of time as well as some Flasks were
too. To make sure you don't make these mistakes.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.620
Try getting mats for the same price or cheaper
than you can sell the item for and don't count

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.070
procs. That way you should always net a profit.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.650
Finally, Elixir spec so far in Cataclysm is
harder to have success with than it was in

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.780
Wrath so tread lightly and be careful you
aren't wasting your time and losing gold.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.180
If you have any questions at all, write them
in the comments on my website or below and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.380
I'll go over them in a follow up FAQ video
for Alchemy elixir spec.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.320
