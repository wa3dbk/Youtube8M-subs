00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:17.380
How to Mow Your Lawn Like a Pro.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.650
Get the neighborhood association off your
back—or just do yourself proud—by learning

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.929
to mow like a pro.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:30.259
You will need An edger or trimmer A lawn mower
in good condition Sharp mowing blades Dry

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.320
grass and hand-operated shears.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320
Clear away any debris before mowing, and always
wear ear and eye protection, plus sturdy closed-toe

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320
shoes.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
Do not allow children to operate or ride on
mowers.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.320
Step 1.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.860
Cut the edges of your lawn with a special
edger or a regular trimmer before you begin

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
mowing.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.629
If your lawn is very small, hand-operated
shears will do.

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:45.699
Step 2.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.440
If you can’t remember the last time you
had your lawn mower serviced, take it in for

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.390
a checkup and blade sharpening.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.149
It may be time to replace the oil, air filter,
and spark plugs.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.199
Consult your owner’s manual to schedule
future maintenance.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.830
A dull blade shreds your lawn, instead of
cutting it, leaving it open to disease; it

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.110
also makes your mower use more fuel&amp;#8212;and
a gas-powered push mower pollutes as much

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.040
as 11 cars!

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.220
Step 3.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.970
Find out your grass’s optimum cutting height,
which depends on what type of grass you have.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.550
If you don’t know, bag up a few blades and
bring them to your local garden center.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.630
Step 4.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.130
Make sure the grass is completely dry and
between three and four inches tall before

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.159
mowing.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.479
Step 5.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.630
Set the cutting height on your mower for the
correct height for your grass.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.950
Plan to finish mowing by 6 p.m., because dew
begins to settle as the sun sets.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.219
Step 6.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.490
Cut your lawn up and down, as opposed to round
and round.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.560
When you begin each new row, have the mower
overlap half the row you just cut.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.430
If you’re pushing a manual mower, keep your
back straight and your elbows bent, and walk

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.619
at a steady pace.

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.619
Step 7.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.020
If you come to a slope, mow from side to side,
rather than up and down.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.020
Step 8.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.270
Leave the grass clippings on the lawn.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.100
Raking them up taxes your lawn and, besides,
they return nutrients to the soil.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Step 9.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.510
Change directions the next time you mow.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.900
In the meantime, enjoy your manicured lawn!

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.780
Did you know Thirty-one percent of gardeners
said that the sorry state of their neighbor’s

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.950
lawn makes them angry.
