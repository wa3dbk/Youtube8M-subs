00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:35.460
You know, there aren’t many things Deadpool
can’t make awesome.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.830
Microsoft Paint is one of those things.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.380
Holy sh*t, how does this happen?

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.030
It’s Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.950
How does this happen?

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.720
It’s not very often I play a video game
so bad that it actually surprises me.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.820
I’ve reviewed so many terrible video games…it’s
like I’ve become numb to it.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.960
And I’ve come to expect it, to be honest.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960
I know there are terrible movies, and books,
and TV shows…but seriously, there’s nothing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.140
that does awful, more awful, than video games.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.800
When video games are awful, they’re f*cking
soul draining.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.950
‘Cause they’re not a passive experience,
you know?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.700
In a video game, you have to do stuff.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.540
And when that sucks, it’s a whole different
thing.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.830
It’s not like you’re just watching a movie
that sucks, and it’s actually kinda funny.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.590
No, doing something that sucks…sucks.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.729
This version, of this game, goes so far beyond
that, it’s in a different area code.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
Dial 6-6-6, f*ck you, Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.320
5-9-7.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.520
I mean, I don’t even know what to say about
this.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.480
Other than it’s so bad, it’s shocking.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.680
This is f*cking…shocking, this game.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.650
It’s so bad, it really makes you wonder,
like…how does this even get released, you

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.650
know?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.170
Like, was there no one to step in and say,
“Jesus Christ, this game is f*cking shocking.”

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.880
I mean, I realize video games are more about
profit than quality…

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.050
But can we at least pretend to hide that?

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.480
I mean, this is like the guy who robs a bank
and leaves the getaway car in his driveway.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
You want to rob the bank, fine.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.379
But park the car in a garage, man.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.400
A warehouse.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.430
A river.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.430
Anywhere but your driveway.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.609
At least pretend that you care about being
caught.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.540
There are police offers who, their entire
job is catch you.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.069
At least play along…

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.409
You asshole.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.569
So Marvel Ultimate Alliance was released on
consoles, where it sort of just existed.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.010
It wasn’t a bad game, wasn’t a great game…just
an okay game for Marvel fans, and that’s

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.010
fine.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.159
But as you know, you have to have a handheld
version.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.519
Even if it doesn’t seem to make sense to
have a handheld version.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.590
As long as it makes cents, it makes sense…to
the gaming industry.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.829
So here we are.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.730
We’re playing…what is one of the worst
beat ‘em ups of the last ten years, legitimately.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.219
A game so awful, it has literally no redeeming
qualities to justify its existence.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.219
Not even Deadpool.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.989
I mean, do you have any idea how bad something
has to be?

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.360
That not even Deadpool can redeem it?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.540
Deadpool redeems everything.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.700
He’s like a coupon for tacos that never
expires.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.870
Now, I could tell you what’s wrong with
this game…or you could look at the footage.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.459
‘Cause there’s not much I have to tell
you.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.420
There are about five enemies in the entire
game, and they’re all named after the verb

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.620
that they do.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.620
So Brawler.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.620
Grabber.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Runner.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.731
I’m surprised there’s not an enemy called
Depresser, ‘cause now I’m just depressed.

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.731
Hey, how’s the gameplay, though?

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:42.159
Well, here’s a boss.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.440
How’s it look to you?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:55.689
And let me tell you another thing about this
game.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.819
In this game…when you get hit, or when pretty
much anything happens…the d-pad becomes

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.819
unresponsive.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:03.909
Like it resets.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.900
Which means you’ll be fighting, holding
the d-pad left, trying to walk…and you stop

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900
moving.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.510
And you have to let go, and then re-press
the d-pad…just to walk.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.930
Boy, that’s great.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.290
Sounds like it controls like a dream.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.290
Yeah, it does.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.790
If you’re a construction worker, and you
dream about driving that crane at the job

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.630
site…the one that doesn’t work.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.500
This doesn’t f*cking work.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.710
Alright, so it plays like broken construction
equipment…how’s the level design?

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.940
Well, that’s a tricky question.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.440
‘Cause you’re asking about something that
isn’t even here.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.380
I guess I c_ould talk about the empty hallways
filled with two enemies.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.570
Or the grass that you can’t walk on.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.110
Wolverine can heal himself internally…oh,
but the sod, he won’t touch.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.070
Actually, to be fair, that’s a good thing.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.040
Sod needs time to take root.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.310
And footsteps placed, is time you waste.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.400
Okay, quick recap.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.600
Terrible gameplay, awful design, hideous graphics
and music…this game isn’t very good.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.900
And hey, guess what?

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.030
On top of that, you also have to find keys.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.010
Like, how does this even happen?

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.890
Like, at that point, someone’s doing this
on purpose, right?

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.820
Like, “Well, guys, how can we make this
thing even worse?

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.120
Oh, I have an idea.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.620
Let’s add keys.”

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.620
And you know what?

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.120
I can’t even be mad about it.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.450
‘Cause I’d do the same thing.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.170
I’d make anyone foolish enough to play this…genuinely
suffer for that decision.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.730
You want to play?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.789
You’re gonna pay.

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.400
Now find the goddamn key.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.610
It’s Marvel Ultimate Alliance for the Game
Boy Advance, and it never should’ve happened.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.680
This thing was sent to us by our good pal
Doug, from Lomita, California.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.130
If sending me bad games to play has become
a contest…Doug, I think you’ve won.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030
Everyone else…we’ve all lost.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.030
Even Deadpool.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.530
And he never loses.
