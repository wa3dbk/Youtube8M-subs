Hi guys! This is Linda Hallberg, 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.720
Today I will do a video on concealers 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.980
and different techniques on how to conceal, to make it look natural

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.560
and not like you have a ton of make up on

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.600
I begin by using.. Well, you know that there are so many different kinds of concealers so this video in particular is not sponsored by any brand

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.860
The purpose of the video is only to make it easy for you and to show you how to use concealer

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.220
I am going to use Make up store's Cover All Mix, 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.020
Because this one is very easy to use, and instead of covering up everything, 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.960
it neutralizes the colors of your face and blends in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.440
So, If I want to cover these red spots here, 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.240
I will use the color which is a yellow/greenish tone

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.980
to cover them up

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.840
Depending on the color of your skin tone, 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.940
in this product you have one lighter color which you can use to blend the colors

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:13.154
If you feel that the color is too yellow or so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120
There are a darker colors as well, 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.600
Mac has a great palette, for people who have darker skin tones 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060
There is something for everyone

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.880
I will begin by using the yellow color

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.462
I add the concealer by using a brush by real techniques, 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.060
which is really good for when you are working with concealer

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.180
I use this yellow color since it neutralizes red tones 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.180
and it neutralizes the red tone without covering too much

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.560
 Some concealers, 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.980
or sticks doesn't contain any color or pigments, 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.420
they are more like your natural 'skin tone'

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.200
And they don't neutralize in the same manner as a neutralizing concealer

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.400
my personal favorite is the one which neutralize, since they don't cover your skin and make you feel as if you have tons of make up on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
As you can see, my red dots have disappeared 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.720
when I use this one

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980
I managed to scrub my forehead a bit too harsh, 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.740
my skin felt a bit dry and so I grabbed a towel, 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.180
and I rubbed it really hard, something I won't recommend since it hurt so much!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.620
What makes it even worse is that it is so difficult to put on make up.. 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.960
So, don't use a towel to scrub your face with, it's not worth it!

00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:12.318
I will try to cover it up at least

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.300
Okey, now I have covered pretty much everything

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.640
I know that some feels as if though they have much redness on their eyelids, 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.180
and I do too, so I will use some of this color here as well

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.020
Some, on the other hand, tend to be a bit blueish

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.480
And then you need to use a different color, I will show you in a second

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.840
But due to my redness, I will use the yellow color

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.360
Beneath your eyes where you tend to have a blueish, or darker color,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.620
you should use a color which has pink tones, 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.420
since this pink or reddish pigment neutralizes the blue colors

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.880
So I will use this one, which is pink, sort of, and if you feel that it's too pink or red, you can always

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.340
blend it with the lighter color, 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.080
or you can use your eye cream to blend the colors, since this texture is a bit thick 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.900
so you can blend it with something else to make it lighter

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.540
My eyelids are very dry as well, but that's for another video

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960
So, that's basically it

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.900
These are the two most important things to remember

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.240
when applying concealer, and that is to

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.580
If you want to cover something up without having to use a lot of heavy make up, 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.680
use a neutralizing concealer which has yellow or greenish tones

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.540
on redness, to neutralize the red tones on your face

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.740
yes, green or yellow to neutralize red, and red or pink colors to neutralize blue

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.300
to get a "normal looking" skin tone

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.200
Try to adapt to your own skin tone, 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.380
since this product is of course not suitable for everyone

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.980
maybe you need to use a darker tone, 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.200
or olive, and so on

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.120
But, that's the way you do it

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.120
and I prefer to work with a brush, 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.420
you should never stick your fingers into this product since you will get a lot of bacteria and such in the product

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.500
especially since this is a creamy concealer! 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.140
If it is zits you want to cover up, this might result in you getting even more zits from using your concealer 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.380
since you want to poke around with dirty fingers in the product

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.720
what you can do is, use the end of your brush to make a cavern in the concealer and put the product on your hand instead

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:15.255
And then you are rid of the problem

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.760
Always wash your brush after you have used it, to avoid unwelcome bacterias here as well

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.020
I hope you enjoyed this clip,
