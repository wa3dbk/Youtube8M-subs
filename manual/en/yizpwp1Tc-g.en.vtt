00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.339
Hey guys,
today we gonna jungle Skarner

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.729
We will use 0/21/9 masteries

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.999
and our runes will be

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:22.999
attack speed marks, flat armor seals, per-level magic resist glyphs

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.009
and movement speed quints

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.009
we gonna start with machete and 5 potions

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.520
and of course we gonna start

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.210
from blue buff

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.110
because we will use our abilities

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.290
frequently

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.100
and we will need cooldown reduction and mana regeneration

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.690
from blue buff

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.310
Back in season 2 Skarner was the one of the best junglers

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.510
and was

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.600
very popular

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.190
can't say he's

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.200
one of the bests

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.200
in season 3, but he's still viable

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.380
We are starting from wolves

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.799
because they spawn

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.750
15 seconds earlier than the blue buff does

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.290
You have to use your

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.750
pots frequently on level one

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.580
because you will

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.580
loose too much HP

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.270
Select the golem with left click and watch on his HP

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.270
Try to kill him with smite

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.579
I used the smite

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.659
a little bit earlier.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.899
And write down in the chat the time when blue buff will respawn again

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:27.759
You can calculate that time by adding 5 minutes to the time you have cleared the camp

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:38.249
I wrote OB, which means Our Blue

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.379
Now e gonna get

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.399
the Red Buff

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:22.659
And again we select the lizard with left click and watch on his HP

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:29.659
Smite now deals 550 damage

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.579
and of course we have to write down in the chat the time for next Red Buff - 8:43

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.599
We have cleared the jungle in 3:55

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:54.279
I will write down the time

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:59.279
for Red Buff

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.639
We have about 50%

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.509
 of our HP remaining

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.019
That's not too high, but 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.099
because we have also

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.769
the shield

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.179
we can try to go for ganks on top lane

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:20.189
or mid lane

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:23.120
It's kind of situation.
You should 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.029
look on the map and see if 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:32.419
enemies are pushing or they are low on HP, when going for ganking

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.370
If you see, you can't gank them, you can simply take

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030
 another camp of wolves and 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.770
and go back to buy boots

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.880
and pots and return to jungling or go for ganking

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.139
That's it for skarner

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.909
if you'll have any questions

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.729
regarding jungle Skarner, feel free to write

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.679
your questions in your comments and I will answer them

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.629
Thanks for watching

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.460
Till next time!
Bye!
