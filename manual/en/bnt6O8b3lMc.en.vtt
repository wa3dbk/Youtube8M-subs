00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.190
So now I'll show you how to set up the parental
controls on your Wii. You want to go to your

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:15.539
Wii options on the bottom left hand corner,
Wii settings, we'll just go over one page

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.131
and then it's up here at the top: parental
controls, so I'll click on that and you'll

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:25.570
get a little warning here. It?s important
to note that parental controls only work on

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.340
Wii games, so the Wii will also play old Nintendo
GameCube games but the parental controls you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.840
set up don't work on those GameCube games.
So you want to, if you're setting up parental

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.920
controls for your child you want to make sure
there are no GameCube games you don't want

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.470
him or her playing, so I'll agree, I'll just
hit yes. Now I need to choose a pin, a secret

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.530
pin so I will be the only person that will
have access to the parental controls and your

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.440
children won't be able to change it. So I'll
just choose an easy pin, hit o.k., I'll enter

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.780
it one more time just to confirm it, hit o.k.
one more time and then you have a little secret

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.210
question in case you forget your pin. You
can choose some different options here. Let's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.350
see, favorite movie, o.k. I'll choose that
one and bring up the keyboard again. I really

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.150
like the Goonies so I'll put that in, a little
bit nerdy but great movies. Hit o.k. and now

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.610
it says your pin and secret question have
been set but you still need to choose the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.030
parental controls. So I'll just go to game
settings and pin and my pin is all set in

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.060
there. So you are on this screen and you see
the highest game rating allowed, right now

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.770
it's set to any, so click on that and basically
there are no parental controls set up, any

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.229
game can be played but if you click on this
little down arrow, we'll be able to choose

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.450
the highest rating that can be played. So
this is a mature setting so you probably don't

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.000
want that, then there's the Teen rating, we'll
just say this is for an eleven year old. So

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.230
I'll go down to this, everyone 10 and I click
on the little rating here and now I'm set

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.860
to this and that means that the only games
that can be played on this Wii are ones rated

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.010
everyone 10 , everyone, and then the early
childhood games. So I hit o.k., and now you'll

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.580
see that it is set up like this. So I'll confirm
that.
