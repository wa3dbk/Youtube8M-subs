00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.899
Today on our 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 well be test
fitting the Glacier V-Bar Snow Tire Chains

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.060
with cam tighteners for light trucks, part
number pwh2828sc.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.620
Well be test fitting these tire chains on
tire size 265/70-17.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.700
Now this vehicle is primarily rear wheel drive
so well be installing the tire chains on the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.980
rear tires.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.119
Now to begin our test fit well lay the chains
flat out on the ground to undo any kinks or

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.119
tangles.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.210
This will insure that the tire chain fits
correctly around the tire.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.950
Well then drape the tire chains over the tire
making sure that the hooks are facing out

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.630
and the V-bars are facing up so that we dont
damage our tire.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.790
Well then move to the inside of the tire where
we will connect the hook and link and then

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.980
move to the outside of the tire where we will
insert the link through the chain tensioner

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.820
and secure it.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.469
Now it is important to make sure that the
tire chains are centered onto the tire to

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.250
insure a good fit.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:20.400
Well then use the included cam tensioner tool
to tighten down the cam tighteners.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:34.600
The manufacturer does recommend a cable tensioner,
part number pw99 for an extra sense of security.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.880
Now you may want to drive a little bit and
get out and check your chains to make sure

00:01:38.880 --> 00:02:04.130
that the chains are still fitting correctly
onto the tire and to reduce any slack if necessary.
