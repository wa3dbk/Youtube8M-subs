00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.330
My name is Nathan Dehnke and I'm a 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.930
political science graduate student at

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.210
the University of Kansas. 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.730
I was in the United States Army from 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.350
September of 2004 until October of 2008. 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.100
I was wounded in action in Iraq near Baghdad 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.820
in June of 2007 and it was an improvised 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.260
explosive device that resulted in my injuries,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.130
that caused my injuries. 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.550
(Professor lecturing)

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.640
I'm significantly older than everybody else 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.280
and getting back used to the college lifestyle,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.620
it took some time for adjustment. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.490
Finding myself, 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.210
having to organize my own time again. 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.400
But, overall, it wasn't as bad a transition

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.580
because the students that were in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.730
my classes, the teachers, the advisors, 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.660
other administration officials here at KU 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.750
made it very easy. 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.790
They were open-minded to things. 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.530
Sometimes in the military people like to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.360
think "oh man you're going back to a college 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.380
campus, it's going to be people who are just 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.430
going to hate you because you were in the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.850
military" and so on and so forth and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.180
it's not necessarily that way,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.460
at all, in my experience. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.620
Whether or not they agree 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.580
with what's going on in Iraq or Afghanistan

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.580
or whether or not they agree

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.130
with the policies of the army or 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450
anything like that, they've taken a very 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.390
open-minded perspective, at least,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.630
with regards to veterans. 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.760
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.170
My name is Kortney Clemons. 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.850
I'm a grad student in the School of Education.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.740
I was in the army from 2001 to 2006. 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.910
I was injured February 2005 in Baghdad

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.340
and I was injured while carrying a

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.610
injured service member to the Blackhawk. 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.980
An IED exploded next to me and in result I 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.670
lost my right leg above the knee and we lost 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.880
three service members on that day. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.740
(Professor lecturing)

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.170
My teachers have been really good. 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.660
One of them that stands out is Miss Suzanne Rice.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.530
She's been, you know, 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.880
just real enthusiastic every day in class. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.330
She's always like, "look, if you have a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.010
problem with anything, you know, don't 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.760
hesitate to call or come by." 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.980
The learning environment in class is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.350
real good, you know, no one is afraid

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.600
to ask the wrong question. 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.780
You know, it's helped me deal with school 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.710
here on another level because I've never, 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.070
you know, been in a masters program before 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.110
so I had a lot of anxiety coming into this. 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100
I really enjoy learning. 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.260
I really feel like when I'm not learning

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.590
I'm kind of like falling behind. 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.280
I'm currently training with the KU track 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.970
team for the Paralympic World Championships 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.730
in January 2011 in New Zealand. 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.170
In my events I will be doing the 100 meters, 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.180
200 meters, and the long jump. 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.860
It's been awesome getting a chance to get 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.230
back to the team environment. 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.680
A lot of times about my injury being so 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.860
physical, you can see it, it inspires people 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.430
without even saying a word. 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.330
And therefore, the people that do have the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.230
nerve to say something or ask, you know, 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.130
okay what happened? 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.330
At that time I get a chance

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.530
to share a story with them. 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.930
Some of my life, I kind of try to use it as 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.280
a tool to help others and if I'm able to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.460
do that, it would be awesome. 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.080
 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.750
There is a very strong network set up 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.400
through Fort Leavenworth, set up through KU, 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.960
on a kind of professional basis. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.800
Just being around people who understand, 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.910
being around other folks who you can just, 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.130
if you want to share, great;

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.260
if not, not a big deal. 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.930
 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.840
Nathan and Kortney are two of our

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.860
Wounded Warriors out here at KU. 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.730
They are here to get an MA degree, masters 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.060
degree, the intent is to take individuals 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.760
who have lost a career as a function of 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.100
being wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.350
retrain them, give them new skills, and then 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.660
give them back to the army and then they can 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.830
still have a full career.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:04:04.210
