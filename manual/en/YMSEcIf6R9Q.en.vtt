00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.140
Moog:  Me he hew how!

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.700
Moog:  [Uninteligable] Martin, it's so exciting.  
Marty:  So exciting to play with the short shifter, and it will actually lift it up. 
Moog:  And allow it to scream.  Lets do it.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.500
Unknown:  Moog drops out, so then the car drops out.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.380
Today we're gonna show you how, by installing a short shifter.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.800
Moog:  30 cm.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.700
Get a tool box.  Get lots of tools, and you can do anything you want in the world.  Yes!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.500
These are the tools you're gonna need.  You need screwdrivers, pliers to get the trim out.  You need a socket set, and you need a short shifter.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.460
Ok so the main thing you need obviously to do this install, is a short shifter kit.  We got this one from Ozsome.com.au.  Osome (sic) osome (sic)

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.080
Ah, in here you'll have your shorter shifting shifter ah uh and, all the other bits you'll need to put it in.  Marty is gonna show you how to do it.  It's gonna be MADD!

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.240
Which reminds me of the first time I put in a short shifter.  I spent half a day putting it in my old Subaru Legacy.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:32.000
Only to discover that the one that I took out was shorter than the one I put in.  So when I got back in the car, I was pulling the gear shifter a meter each way.  Should have just left it alone.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.140
Can we shoot this now dude?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.540
[Unintelligible]

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.000
Marty:  So much rubber in there.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.120
Moog:  And there's Martin.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Moog:  He's been pumping his shifter for about an hour now, and he's almost got it out.
Marty:  Yeah, I don't know 'bout this whole 15 minute install thing.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.720
Marty:  I think that's, that's a little bit optimistic.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.820
Moog:  No I read it on the internet man, it's true.
Marty:  Ah it's gotta be true then.  On a forum, yeah.
Moog:  Yeah it was on [censored beep] forum.
Marty:  Sure.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.940
Marty:  If there would be a voice ever saying, that's the uh, that's the snap ring that's a total bitch to get out.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.620
Marty:  I'm not gonna be able to get it out without getting more tools in there, but that's the idea.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.780
Marty:  Umm, it prematurely ejected itself

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.400
Marty:  She's out.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:40.140
And that changes the pivot point.  Which makes you throw different, and that's how you get the super short speedy shifts that you'd expect at your local KFC drive thru.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.220
Marty:  Ahhh bluup!
