Hi, my name is Liesbet and my Urban Craft is cooking with insects.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.980
Together with my boyfriend, we cook bugs and we started a restaurant.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.040
We went to Asia on holidays, and there, we ate bugs that were cooked in very basic ways.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.240
So we thought: "why don’t we try this at home, in a more culinary way, with an eye for the visual aspect?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.580
It could be interesting."

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.640
And it all started from there.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.500
We experimented in the kitchen and tasted many different things to see what the possibilities were.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.560
That way, we developed some really nice dishes.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.940
I think bugs have a nice aspect, some people find them disgusting

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.700
but you can actually make some very nice dishes with those little bugs.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.700
Some of the bugs taste like nuts, for example pistachio.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.320
Others taste more terraneous, so the challenge is to look for combinations, for example with beetroot,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.880
or things with the same kind of taste,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.960
to showcase them in the dish.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.180
In my opinion, we work in an ecological way, and that's something we want to emphasise.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.440
There are so many people on earth, and it keeps increasing,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.460
so sooner or later, we'll have to look for alternatives to meat.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.980
It would be nice to have one day in the week where we would eat bugs, then one day fish, and one day meat.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.400
It doesn’t need to be a direct replacement for meat, that's not what we want,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.534
our idea is to open people's minds about it,

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:49.774
especially because it’s full of proteins and very healty.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:59.394
Insects provide all the nutrients that we need.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.020
For now there are 10 bugs approved for human consumption

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.100
and we hope that this will evolve in the future, just like in Asia.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.360
It would provide us with more opportunities to experiment in our kitchen, we're very limited now:

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.280
we can use grasshoppers, mealworms, crickets, buffalo worms,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.200
morioworms and wax moth caterpillars but we would like to see more

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.520
bugs get approved to get even more creative with the dishes.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.077
So we are waiting for that.
