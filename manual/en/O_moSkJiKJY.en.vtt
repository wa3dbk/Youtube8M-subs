00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm going to show you a dish this recipe
was sent from Chirala in Andhra Pradesh

and they add lot of ingredients to make
a nice curry which is little bit sour

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.340
gongura and thotakura these two leaves you know are used and they make a sour

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.750
dish so for this first i'm going to add
oil and when the oil is hot

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.000
we're going to add a tempering of mustard seeds and when the mustard seeds

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.840

own juices for around three to four

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.409
