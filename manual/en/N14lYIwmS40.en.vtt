[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.350
Hi I'm Jonathon.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.256
And I'm Jeff and we're with
latemodelrestoration.com.

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:11.630
Today we're going
to show you how

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.110
to replace those broken outer
door handles on your '79 to '93

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.502
Fox Mustang.

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:18.085
This is actually a
very common problem

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.380
on these year models because
of the factory plastic

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.330
handles that were on
the outside of the car.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.350
Now Jonathan, tell
them a little bit more

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.670
about the 5.0 Resto
replacement handle kit.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.005
Absolutely Jeff.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.494
Our 5.0 Resto handles
are made out of metal

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:32.910
so you don't ever have to worry
about them breaking again.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.312
We have them coated in both
trim black and in chrome.

00:00:35.312 --> 00:00:36.770
And that way we've
got you covered,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.580
no matter what
your car requires.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.099
And we always include
the attaching rivets.

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.890
All right Jonathan.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.810
Also it looks like you've
brought your tools.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.780
Tell them a little bit more
about the specialty ones that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.129
are required for the install.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.670
Tools you'll need
to put on your door

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.253
handle-- take off
and put on your door

00:00:50.253 --> 00:00:52.620
handle-- hammer and
a drift and get out

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.770
the original mandrels
from the existing rivets,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.710
drill and 3H drill bit to
drill out the existing rivet

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560
heads, and then
a large rivet gun

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.730
to install your new
door handle and rivets.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.330
All right.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.680
Looks like we've
got all the tools.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.096
Let's get back here Jonathan
and get this install started.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:07.800
Sounds good.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.652
While Jeff was
removing the door panel

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:12.110
I went ahead and taped off the
area around the door handle.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.572
That way we wouldn't
damage the paint.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:15.334
All right guys.

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:17.750
Now if you have any questions
on removing your door panel,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.541
make sure you check
out our YouTube channel

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.590
for a how to video on
removing your door panel.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.700
To get started with
removing your door handle,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.100
grab your hammer and your drift.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.420
And you're going to have
these little hardened steel

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.520
mandrels that are left
in the original rivets.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.353
Just go ahead and knock
those into the door.

00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:34.890
And Jeff, if you
would pull those

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.800
out whenever they come in.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.728
All right.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:42.745
 

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:46.060
Then you can go ahead and
take your drill [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.435
And you don't want to completely
drill through the rivet.

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:51.240
Just drill through the head and
whenever the head pops loose,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.020
stop drilling.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.380
 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.130
Now that you have the
rivet heads removed,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.560
you can go ahead and push
down on the inside rod

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.210
and remove the
handle from the door.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.889
 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.290
Go back on with your new handle.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.920
Slide it in and engage
it with the rod.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.500
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.590
As you can see, I've already
got one rivet in place.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.660
Go ahead and grab
your large rivet gun.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.840
Insert the rivet.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.850
And you can engage the door.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:43.538
 

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.840
All right Jonathan, looks
like you're finishing up.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.730
Now I know sometimes
people use bolts

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.260
to install these door
handles but we used rivets.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.120
Can you tell me a
little bit more on why?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.229
Sure thing Jeff.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:55.520
A lot of people will tell
you that using carriage bolts

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.900
with some nylon lock nuts
is an easier and cheaper way

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570
to install your door handles.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930
That's simply not the case
because those lock nuts will

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.100
loosen over time and you
end up with a loose door

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.140
handle which is just
like having a broken one.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.010
We use the OE type rivets.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.720
That way you end up with
a permanent installation.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720
All right appreciate
it Jonathan.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.950
Looks great.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.780
