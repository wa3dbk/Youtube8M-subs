00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.110
 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.700
I'm excited to test this

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.080
cause there's not a lot of people that are
offering the 250 sport miles they are

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.469
bringing in the 150

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.240
you know a lot of smaller ones are

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.300
overall this has little bit
different it's got

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.300
metal

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.040
clutch is easy to use

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.250
got pretty good power front brakes work
well

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.250
panels actually good

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.830
you can see it handles pretty good it's
got good pickup top speed says it's 45

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.790
miles per hour

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.990
and uhh horse power says 16

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.780
this is first

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.810
see what the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.970
speed is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.030
It's got good it's got wide uhh wheelbase you can see

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.030
I can get it  pretty sideways

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.970
 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.850
you can see

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.159
that's pretty good test on it you know
about being on the track I feel this

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.159
this has pretty good suspension umm that
sinking into the corner pretty well

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.570
so all in all I mean

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.890
you can definitely have some fun on this I
like the style of it  it's got it seems

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.260
like its tune while the carburetor fits
so well

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.270
I'm just on getting all the gas it's not
foggy

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.420
so that tells me this is tuned really
well

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.400
