00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:06.956
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to raise
chickens in a backyard

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:12.626
in an urban setting that is good
for the human, the flock owner,

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:16.066
for the chickens themselves as
well as for the environment?

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.306
And I think we can
find win/win situations

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:21.086
that protect one
health, animal health,

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:24.346
environmental health
and human health.

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:26.986
&gt;&gt; I wanted the kids to see
where their food comes from

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:29.636
and to have some animal
husbandry experience.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:31.646
I don't want them thinking
that their food comes

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:33.446
from a cellophane pouch
at the grocery store.

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:37.996
&gt;&gt; As I saw that a couple of
my kids' consistent source

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:39.836
of protein would be
eggs, I wanted them

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.396
to be the best possible
they could possibly be.

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.746
&gt;&gt; I like the idea
of understanding food

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.076
and getting connected to it,
and I think you learn a lot

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.366
from animals, from
livestock and pets.

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:53.026
&gt;&gt; A lot of what I do is
education and outreach,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.496
with the goal of
preventing disease.

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:57.386
So specifically for
this project,

00:00:57.726 --> 00:00:59.636
reducing the risk
of salmonellosis.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:01.776
For each visit we would go out

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:04.186
and we would conduct an
environmental assessment.

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:07.036
So we take environmental swabs,
we did an exposure assessment

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:11.976
to see how often people for
instance, touched their face

00:01:12.016 --> 00:01:14.676
or touched the coop surface
and touched themselves,

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:18.186
and then we had a survey
which got at animal health

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:20.896
and husbandry, so
just reminding people

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.586
that there is never a zero risk

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.236
but this is how you
protect yourself

00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:25.906
with this particular species.

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:27.656
The positives, I
definitely think,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.646
are having people reconnect
with animal agriculture,

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:32.426
not to mention that
human animal bond.

00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:34.046
Though these are
production animals,

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:37.096
if you raise them right, you
socialize them really early,

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.466
they're practically Chihuahuas.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:42.346
&gt;&gt; They're just really
fun, and when you walk

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.236
out of the door they come
running towards me, "Oh,

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.546
you're going to bring
me a snack."

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:48.316
So the benefits,
especially for the boys

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:55.646
and us having fresh eggs,
far outweigh the risks.
