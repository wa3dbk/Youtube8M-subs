What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou Aka Tarou bringing

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.750
you this week's WoW Report Episode 43! For
more FREE WoW guides, check out my website

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.150
at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.000
In this Tarou Weekly WoW Report, I'll cover
ingame news, Patch 4.1, Auction House chaos,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
an Auction House tip, as well as a Q&amp;A session
so let's get started.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.590
In Cataclysm news, probably the most interesting
thing to happen this week is Mione's solo

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.200
kill of the faction champs and Twin Val'kyr's
in ToC. I probably mispronounced their name

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.179
but Me One as in me being solo makes more
sense even if I'm wrong. Anyways, the videos

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.219
for each are up and should be enough info
for most to try solo'ing these bosses on their

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.940
own. Thanks Mione and grats again on these
latest kills although I still think Yogg-Saron

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.210
is your best yet.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.420
In other Cata news, we had some additional
hotfixes roll out on March 16th and here is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.910
the complete the list dating back to March
2nd since some didn't make it right away on

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.860
to all servers. Looks like some raid bosses
got mostly nerfed and Engineering in PvP along

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.900
with some other misc stuff. The funniest hotfixes
out of all of these though has to be the Shandris

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.140
Feathermoon no longer being able to be pulled
to Orgrimmar. If you remember, a few weekly

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.310
episodes back I showed a video of the sheer
havoc and massarce she caused to Orgrimmar

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.300
after a group kited her there. Now I know
it probably was annoying for some but these

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.720
sorts of things are pretty fun in my opinion.
It makes the peacefulness of town a bit more

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.660
lively and come on, it's just a simple walk
back from the graveyard. Remember this is

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.350
just a game and there is no need to freak
out over stuff like this.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.540
Patch 4.1 is still on the PTR and has some
changes from the original launch that got

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.560
posted last week. The comments are pretty
much the same throughout. Stop making Rogues

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.210
&amp; Mages better since they're already mostly
OP, why do you keep nerfing Warriors did they

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.110
do something to your family or something;
is one dating your daughter, and nerf healing

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.229
in Arena; 40 minute games aren't fun. I'll
once again add these new changes to my website

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.950
and put them in red inside the patch notes.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.400
The interesting find this week however has
to be mmo-champion discovering an early version

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.939
of a lion with wings. While I think it looks
pretty awesome, I hope that wouldn't mean

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.010
Horde get a scorpion with wings. Can you imagine
how dumb that would look. Just kidding, the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.140
mount is actually will be available in the
Blizzard Store soon. Let me know if what you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.659
think and if you'd buy it in the comments
below.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.859
In PvP news, I found a rather interesting
post where Bash lays down some insight of

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:45.689
his on how to make World PvP once again viable.
It's a funny post where he plays dumb and

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.329
I'm surprised none of the following posts
even caught what he was saying. Basically,

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.319
his solution is something that is already
ingame and funny that noone could pick up

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.889
on that. See if you can find out what I and
him mean. Let me know what you come up with

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:00.889
in the comments.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.599
Ok, now on to Auction House chaos. Prices
were quite interesting this past week as a

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.150
wave of bans went out targeting gathering
botters. Throughout the week it seemed like

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.760
people were scared and they just tried to
dump everything they could as fast as possible

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.799
before they get banned. The market continues
to be flooded with excess ore, herbs, and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.779
volatiles. I expect this to continue for a
week or so at which point, if the mass bans

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:31.219
are effective, prices will go back to normal
and increase slightly when Patch 4.1 releases.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.180
Alright, moving on to this week's Auction
House tip. Don't let the market phase you,

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.599
phase the market instead. What I mean by this
is when things are too low to sell or too

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:47.889
high to buy, find alternatives as work arounds.
If Elementium Bars are too expensive, check

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.639
ore instead to see if it's cheaper. If you
can't sell your Volatile Earth for enough,

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:58.489
try making it something that will give a better
profit. Many times armor loses value much

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.059
slower than mats.

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.499
In Blizzard news, they continue to celebrate
their 20th year anniversary and now have a

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:09.779
video contest to go with it. They are basically
looking for you to capture your favorite Blizzard

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:17.600
game-related memories on video. The contest
ends April 19th, 2011 at 12:00pm PST. The

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.250
grand prize winner will be awarded some pretty
sick loot including a Blizzcon prize package

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.590
that consists of air travel, a two night hotel
stay, ground tranportation, and tons of other

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.960
goodies.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.530
Finally, I'd like to end this Tarou Weekly
WoW Report answering a few questions you guys

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.210
and girls have asked me over the last week.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.600
Q1. What do you think about all the hotfixes
always going out?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.000
A1. I think Blizzard isn't using the PTR as
the testing ground and now is using the live

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.180
servers which is messing a lot of people up.
Players start to learn their new setups and

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.050
abilities only to find a week later in a hotfix
they were changed, removed, or nerfed to a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.720
point you wouldn't want to use them anyway.
Hotfixes work great for somethings but at

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.440
this point it seems like they are really getting
out of control. The Daily Blink seems to agree.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.060
Q2. How do I deal with botters while farming?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.210
A2. The best thing you can do is out-play
them and report them. Blizzard has also announced

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.490
they are actively working on a system to ban
them and have been doing mass bans this past

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.310
week that included AFK PvP botters as well.
All mmo games are plagued with this and it

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.870
seems it's a hard thing to stomp out completely.
Kinda sad really since it ruins the game in

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.300
my opinion but at the same time, I could see
why some people would think, "If you can't

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.380
beat them, join them." Although, I don't agree
with this, I do understand it.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.120
Q3. Have you been playing Rift?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.710
A3. One of my nice subscribers hooked it up
with a beta key awhile back, thanks again

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.240
by the way, and while I did mess around with
it, I didn't find it fun enough to buy. I

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.710
think it has huge potential and I don't think
I gave it enough time to decide if it sucked

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.360
or not but at this time, I don't play it and
probably won't have enough time to really

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.330
test it out anytime soon. That could be a
good thing though since it will give them

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.330
time to polish it up.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.240
Oh and before I forget, here is a list of
my latest releases if you missed them. Please

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.470
check them out and don't forget to comment
and rate them so I know where I'm succeeding

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.720
and failing.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.710
Lastly, I want to thank all the people who
made videos for my intro/outro contest and

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.450
all the people who voted. I was a little dissappointed
with only getting four entries when I know

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.180
a lot of you out there can make some pretty
pro stuff. Either way, the winners for the

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.030
contest are as follows:

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.060
The Grand Prize goes to TauriMovies with his
intro. He'll have a choice of these prizes.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:45.180
First Runner-Up also goes to TauriMovies with
his outro. The Second Runner-Up goes to Mitraljez.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.590
Runner-Ups get to choose one these pets. Grats
again to the winners and thank you very much

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.610
for entering. Expect to see TauriMovies' intro
and outro in future videos. If you want to

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.000
make one for the heck of it, send me a link
and if it's good enough, I'll be sure to put

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.140
it in a future video.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.900
That's it for this week of Tarou's Weekly
WoW Report and I hope you liked it.
