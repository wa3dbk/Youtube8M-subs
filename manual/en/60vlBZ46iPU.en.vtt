00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.591
Okay, we have already applied the acrylic
to the tip. Now what we are going to do we

00:00:03.591 --> 00:00:09.350
are going to go into filing. Starting with
my artificial finger. What we are going to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.540
do we are going to start with a 100-180 grid
and the reason you want to start with this

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.220
is because it's a little rougher nail. So
what we're gonna do we're just gonna go straight

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.410
onto the nail and kinda get that edge smoothed
down. And now whenever you do this you go

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.899
right on top of the nail, smooth it down.
And whenever you are going around the nail

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:43.089
here with this since this is a rougher file
be very careful and do not hit that cuticle.

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:51.579
Cause it can cause damage and it can cut the
cuticle. So just go straight over that where

00:00:51.579 --> 00:01:03.950
you have applied that acrylic. Smooth that
down. Just using downward motions and you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:13.790
just kind of go around that nail just like
that. Smoothing the nail. Just little short

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.320
strokes. Kind of just every once and a while
get your finger on it and just smooth your

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:31.050
finger and just make sure it is smooth. Just
little short motions. We've completed the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.000
100-180 grid. And the way you can tell to
move on to the next grid of your file is kind

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200
of take your finger and smooth over it and
make sure it's smooth. You don't have any

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.670
type of humps or imperfections in there. And
once it feels smooth and you've smoothed it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:56.190
down with a more rough file, then we are ready
to move on over to the 240 grid file which

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:05.530
is not quite as coarse. So we want to go ahead
and smooth it down. Smooth out that free edge.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.079
Take your finger feeling it again. It's starting
to feel a lot smoother. Make sure you are

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:17.099
always careful when you are going around that
cuticle. Just using small little strokes.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:25.459
Smooth that around. And also too on your clients
you want to make sure you push on the corners

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.829
that you do loosen anything that is tight
around those edges. Cause sometimes glue will

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.181
get right up there in those edges. We finished
with the 240 grit. Then I want you to take

00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:42.860
your nail brush and then you just take it
and you just kind of get that dust off. And

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.019
then you just take your finger and smooth
it over. Make sure that the nail is smooth

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.849
and no imperfections. And that is how you
file an acrylic with an artificial tip. The

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.079
next step that we are going to be moving onto
is buffing with cuticle oil and pushing the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:01.619
cuticle back.
