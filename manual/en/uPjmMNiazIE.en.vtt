00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.140
Welcome to ETSIS -  your destination for
escaping the sun in style.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.380
Today we're going to demonstrate the many
fashionable, functional and versatile ways

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.410
for you to wear your ETSIS hat, year-round.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.830
The first look, we are all familiar with,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.150
is the basic hat.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.780
Now to take your hat to the ETSIS level,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.830
attach your Signature SunEscape protection panels

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.030
into the snaps located along the crown of your hat.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.400
The ETSIS hat has snaps located all along

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.360
the inside of the hat for easy adjustments,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.340
but we recommend snapping from the back of your hat forward.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.690
The first ETSIS look is our most popular -

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.090
THE SIGNATURE WRAP

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.909
To accomplish this look,

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.830
take your panels and 
wrap them around each cheek,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.870
behind your neck,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.130
and then tie a classy knot in front, like this.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.060
The signature wrap offers protection from
harsh envioronmental conditions, including:

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.810
the sun, snow, and wind;

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.190
insuring your hat stays put in a sophisticated way

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.689
and sure to have everyone wondering,
"Who's that girl?"

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.729
The next look

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.400
is called The Clinical Wrap.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.690
Which is extremely important for
protecting your face from receiving

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.860
maximum

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.590
UV-A and UV-B exposure throughout the day.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.030
For example,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.570
while your driving in your car,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.690
walking the dog,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.350
sailing, or enjoying water or land sport

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.580
activities.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.580
The clinical wrap also protects you from
airborne bacteria and harmful pollutants.

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.279
The next look is our very stylish Audrey look.

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.949
To create The Tie Back,

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:24.139
take your panels and pull them back,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.489
covering your ears and under your hair.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.209
Now, tie the panels in a regular knot

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.819
or give them a personal touch to make a fashion statement

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.019
or to keep you cool on a hot day.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.869
The final ETSIS look is extremely popular among the ladies

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.499
and is referred to as OFF THE SHOULDER.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.779
To create this look,

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:53.419
take your hat and let it fall behind you
and rest against your back.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.400
Then wrap your panels securely around your shoulders.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.329
Now you are hands free

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.729
and conveniently able to shop or do other activities

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.709
without misplacing or having to hold on to your hat.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.329
Thank you for allowing us to demonstrate the ETSIS hat.

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.419
We hope you enjoy Escaping the Sun in Style.
