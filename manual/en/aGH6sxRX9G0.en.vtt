Hi! This is Matt with Creative Cooking Corner.
What I have is a nice prime rib. It's three

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.450
bones in it. One, two, three and I took
it out of the package slavered it rubbed it,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.520
I mean, with kosher salt. And then put it
on a rack in the refrigerator and it's been

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.620
in there for about two or three days. And
you can see it's dried up nice. And what

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.220
that'll do is when I go to brown this, it'll
aide in the searing and give it a nice exterior

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.990
crust. I've already started. All I'm doing
is cutting a little bit across the fat cap

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:54.290
in a cross hatch pattern. It'll aide in releasing
some of the oils in there. So we'll come

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.390
back the other way.
Yeah, I kind of took this recipe from Cook's

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.900
Illustrated online, but I've changed it a
little bit but I should give them the credit

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.360
for the recipe. So all I'm going to do now
is cut the meat off the bones. You'll see

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.360
why here in a minute. We're actually going
to use our bones as our roasting rack. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.920
See this. You just kind of take your knife and
a sharp narrow bladed knife and just follow

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.750
it along the bones. Once you get it started,
pop it open a little bit. And follow the bone

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.800
like I said around. When you get done toward
this end, you have to work your way around

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
a little bit there's a little chime that
sticks out in there. There you go!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.110
There's the bones are removed from the rib.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.650
brown both sides and the fat cap in a hot
skillet. And then I'll put it back on the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.110
bone and I'll tie it on. I'll show you that
stuff when we get there.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.390
What I have here is just an all class stainless
steel pan and I put a little bit of oil in

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.509
there to get it started. And it's on pretty
high, so I'm just going to brown this a little

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.340
bit on all sides, except the bone side. Don't
brown the bone side. I'm just going to get

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.129
it a little smoky, so if you can open up your
windows or turn your fan on. Now you can see

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.810
it is browning nicely. Just keep rotating
it around. You can see it's getting a little

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:30.310
smoky. It's going to happen. I'd say that's
good enough for the fat cap. Now we'll just

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.349
put one side in and let that go for a minute
or two and get a nice char on there.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.870
This is the hardest part of this whole job
really taking it off the bones and browning

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.310
it, because the rest of the recipe is really
pretty easy. Just put it in the oven at 200

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.459
degrees for about four or five hours and let
it cook.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.799
You can see it's got a nice char on that
surface, so we'll do the same thing on the

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.999
other side and then I'll tie it back on the
bones. See I've browned it on all sides.

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.959
So what I'm going to do is put a little fresh
ground pepper on my bones. Not a lot. Just

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.450
a little bit. And I'm going to take the roast
and put it right back on top of the bones.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.450
I've got some cotton kitchen twine. Just
tie it on. If you have a bigger okay. Tie

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.489
it up in a couple of pieces of twine. Take
those and trim them off. Sprinkle the outside

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.239
with some black pepper and then we'll put
it on a sheet pan on an elevated roasting

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.349
rack. And in the oven it goes! So this is
all prepped and ready for the oven. When we're

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.689
ready to put it in, we'll turn the oven to
200 degrees preheated and let it go for four

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.900
or five hours.
Let me show you how I put it on a cooking

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:53.000
rack on a sheet pan. Just like that and cooked
it at 200 degrees. Took the internal temperature

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.959
and it's absolutely perfectly about a
130, 135 to 140. I like my meat a little rare,

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.909
but if you want it cooked a little more, you
can cook it more.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:05.829
What I'm going to I do is take my cooking
shears and snipe off the twine okay? Take

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.159
the twine off. Take this off the bones. Remember
the bones earlier we trimmed off? You want

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.120
to cut it about three quarters of an inch.
That's a good serving size. Aw, look at

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.280
that? Beautiful! Look at the blood coming
out. Let me cut another piece and you guys

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.720
can see what it looks like. You want to get
it about three quarters of an inch thick.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.699
Oh! It is beautiful roast beef. I pick it
up and you can see that the juice is just

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.289
running out of it. I didn't need to char
the outside underneath the boiler, which sometimes

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.229
you might need to do. But my wife had cooked
some cookies, so she had turned the temperature

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.650
up and then it charred it very nicely.
