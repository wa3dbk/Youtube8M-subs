00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.400
- Nice car.
- Thanks.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.680
- How did you afford it?
- I took out a loan.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.240
It looks really awesome.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720
Thanks.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.040
You gonna take me home?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.880
Oh.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.200
All my pay goes on the repayments,
so I can’t afford petrol.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080
So we’re riding again?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.080
Yeah.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.560
Need a car?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.520
One you can afford?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.360
So, now you’ve got your licence
and you’re revving to go.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.120
But do you really know how to avoid
all those rookie errors

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.160
that come with buying
and running a car?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480
I had a Holden Barina ’94.
It was brilliant.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
I loved having a car.
That, for me, was freedom.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.840
’87 Magna.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.800
Mitsubishi Magna.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.280
Called her Old Faithful
’cause she was old and faithful.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.040
For some people, a car is
just about getting from A to B.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280
For others, it can be a serious
statement about themselves.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
I guess your car says
a lot about you.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.880
I think my car is quite practical.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.040
Uh, it can go anywhere.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.240
It’s flexible.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.440
I reckon it just says

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.040
that I’m someone
who just needs to get somewhere.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.320

(GLASS SHATTERS)

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.240
Having your own car
does come with responsibilities.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.800
It’s probably one of the first big
purchases you make,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.040
so you want to make sure
you get it right,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.680
because as Peter found, there are
many potential rookie errors.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.320
I used to drive this old
bomb by uncle gave me

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.520
but it died a week before I started
my apprenticeship.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.880
There weren’t any trains
or buses in my area,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.360
and way too many hills
for a pushbike.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.400
And I wanted a nice car.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.160
I told myself,
“I work hard and I deserve it.”

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.640
I thought that a nice car would
make me feel good about myself

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.560
and that when people saw it,
they would think I’d made it.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.480
In reality, I was an apprentice

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800
struggling to pay off
a car I couldn’t afford.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.320
So why would I want to impress
people I didn’t even know?

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.680
All up I borrowed $25,000

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.680
but over the term of the loan,
with interest,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.200
I’ll end up paying close to $50,000.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.080
If you’re like Peter
and don’t have the cash up front,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.520
you can get a car loan.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.120
But only borrow what you can afford.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.960
If you buy a car from a car yard,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.640
the car dealer can arrange
a loan for you.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.160
Interest rates can vary
a lot between different places,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.640
so do your homework first.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400
You can always check out
the MoneySmart website,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.840
and use one of their calculators

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720
to work out exactly
what you’ll be paying back.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.880
You don’t have to get the loan
through the car dealer,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.480
and it’s often cheaper to get
a loan from a bank or a credit union.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.000
Interest rates and related fees
and charges for personal loans

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.440
can vary a lot, so shop around.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.960
If I stick to the repayment plan,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.920
it’ll take me 10 years
to pay off a car

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.040
that I can’t even sell now
for $10,000.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.320
And then there’s the insurance.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.680
I discovered that
if a car is financed,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.600
the insurance has to be
fully comprehensive.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.320
So here I was at 23, driving
a brand-new fully optioned ute...

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.400
..but the insurance was costing me
nearly 2 grand a year.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.480
When you’re choosing car insurance,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.640
it’s important to understand the
different types of policies available

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.560
and know what sort of cover
you want.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.240
Always take the time
to read the policy,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.440
and get help to understand
what’s covered and what isn’t.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.760
The costs in getting a car are more
than you’d expect because...

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.400
Yeah, so, there’s the registration,
then there’s...

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.880
You’ve got to fuel it all the time.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.960
You’re always constantly
watching fuel prices.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.520
And then if you want a car that’s
going to last a long time,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.840
you’ve always got to get it serviced.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.960
So it all adds up.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.680
On top of my car loan,
I took out a $5,000 personal loan

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.160
and maxed out all my credit cards.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.520
I was paying close to...

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.680
..$800 a month on repayments,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760
which was a big chunk
of my income,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.280
especially since I’d just moved out
and was paying rent.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.120
Things got pretty desperate,
so I spoke to a financial counsellor

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.640
who helped me with
the repayment plan.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.680
The service was free,
which was really good.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.440
But it’s still going to take
a long time

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.200
for me to fix up my credit history.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.880
If you don’t repay the loan,
your car can be repossessed

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.960
and sold for less
than what you owe on it.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.640
Then you end up owing and paying
money on a car you no longer have.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.880
If you’re having trouble
paying back the loan,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.800
it’s important that you talk to
your lender as soon as possible

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.080
to work something out.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.040
Or contact a free financial
counsellor.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.200
The longer you leave it,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.920
the harder it will be to get
back on top of your finances.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.160
If I could do it all again, well...

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.680
I guess I wouldn’t buy the most
expensive car I could find.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.840
I mean, I love the freedom having
a car gives you,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.160
but I just didn’t realise how
much it could cost.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.880
And don’t forget those other costs
with running a car.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.240
You’ll need money for petrol,
insurance, rego, service and repairs,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.480
and even parking,
which can get pricy.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.280
It’s estimated that running a car can
cost around $7,000 per year.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.000
A good idea is to set aside
a car allowance every month.
