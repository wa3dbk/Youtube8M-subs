00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.960
Who is your pick
to be in the finals?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.920
That was the question
put to spectators at Karapiro

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.400
on the 5th day
of Waka Ama Nationals.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.320
Pere Wihongi has more.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.520
The club that has been
at top form since day one

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.960
hails from the Waikato region.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.400
Of all the 54 clubs to have
graced the waters of Lake Karapiro,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.600
Turangawaewae has been the one
to beat on 116 points.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.360
We've been holding around
two practices a day,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.720
for the last three days.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.320
This is a great club
for young people of all ages

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.960
and for the wider Waikato.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.680
They have more than 100 kids
in the Midgets division.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.760
Their expression of gratitude,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.080
acknowledging the power
of their ancestral river.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.680
The finals are on tomorrow.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.200
Taipoturu, one of the announcers
since the start of the competition,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
is taking a keen interest
in the team.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.120
Despite the obstacles and challenges
presented by the weather,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.640
as we can see, it's been a fine day.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.600
So for me, it's been a good
and worthwhile competition.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.600
And he has his own predictions
on the finals.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.440
Maybe tomorrow will see
some of the big clubs

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.200
from Wellington and the East Coast.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.440
No doubt, both Te Toki
and Turangawaewae

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.480
will be somewhere in the mix.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.680
The finals start at 8am.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.080
Only time will tell
which club will win.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.920
Pere Wihongi, Te Karere.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.080
Yesterday we spoke with 73-year-old
expert paddler Frank Herbert

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.360
before his Gold Class race.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.280
Our film crew were there to catch
the action as it happened.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.720
Here's Frank crossing the line.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.000
Out of the three Gold Class
competitors, Frank came third.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.440
But he was still a winner
in the eyes of his club,

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.800
Nga Hoe Horo o Pawarenga.
