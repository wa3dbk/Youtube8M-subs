00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.130
The best thing abut being
a dad is that I can relive my childhood again,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.860
and the thing is, I can get
to play and I play

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.950
with my kids and the weekend is all
devoted to my kids so, I think, for me, the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.540
best thing about being a dad is being
able to be there for my kids, a hundred per cent.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.270
I get involved in a lot of his interests,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.560
and we try getting him involved in other
things as well so he learns about things out

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.060
there, we do a lot of outdoor
activities. At the moment we've got the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.890
brilliant internet, which is a really,
really good source of information.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.620
I didn't really, kind of, know, 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.629
sort of, where to look and where to go.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.209
There's lady that comes here, she just emails all
the mums and tells us what's going

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:55.940
on, whether there's this new park that's
been built there or Tiny Times doing a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.710
picnic in the park or something like that.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.580
I'm quite lucky 'cause I'm a grandparent
quite young so I can really enjoy my grandchildren.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.440
What I really like about the
centre here is that there is no

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.220
feeling of you're old, you're young,
you're a parent, you're a grandparent.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.240
Maddie is my second grandchild.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.040
If I was at home with her, would I get out all 
these different parts of dirty, messy play?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.240
I wouldn't.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870
It's great to be able to come
somewhere like here and do it.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.200
My youngest absolutely loves the messy play,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.580
the thing he loves most is actually
making an absolute mess and in our

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.440
house, with me around you can
make a mess, but with my partner around we

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.860
can't make a mess 'cause she's a
clean freak.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.810
It not only gives them space away

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.110
from home, but it also gives me time
because I'm not at home, I'm not distracted,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.320
therefore, I spend the whole hour and a
half playing with them and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.920
I'm not distracted with anything
and they get quality time with me as well.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.050
They both love their daddy a lot,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.150
and he's very good, very interactive,
plays with them a lot, takes this one to the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.010
park a lot doesn't he?

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.379
As a parent, you know play is really good
for children but, you just tend

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.970
to think I'll leave it for 5 minutes, I'll
just go on to do something else but I've

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.620
learnt so much, with them actually
teaching me as well.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.870
The midwives were really helpful to my

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.330
daughter when Maddie was being
born, so it's almost like an extension just

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.770
to come in here and visit the centre
'cause you can see it's such a friendly place.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.165
Everybody in this nursery is really helpful

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:40.020
and I always receive information,
you know, what I need, you know, for my kids.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.210
What would be nice would be, maybe just

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.110
one website that you go to with all
the information, you get it from

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.820
different sources so I suppose that 
would be helpful.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.219
If they've got a really good start

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.119
they're going to grow up to be good people.
