00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Communication is pretty much all I do.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.500
It enables us to communicate our thoughts and our wants and our needs and our feelings.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.600
When you think about it, in your average day,the number of times you communicate with somebody is just huge.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.800
I can't actually imagine not being able to
communicate. It's why I'm here.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.800
#iGaze is a small camera that can fit on the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.450
bottom of a computer which will pick up where
a person is looking.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.690
So, where've they look, the camera will communicate
that to the computer.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.800
For example if we can put a keyboard up on
a screen the person can look at the letters

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200
on the keyboard then spell out a word.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.329
I use iGaze every day for work and talking to others.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
With my iGaze I am a functioning person again.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.260
I posted to Facebook using iGaze - I mean
that's just, awesome.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.329
And I only had 5 minutes playing with it so
my control wasn't excellent.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500
Where's hashtag (#)? [laughs]

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.390
Oh, the best thing was definitely trying to tweet

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.909
using iGaze, and getting it wrong!
It's been posted! [laughs]

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.479
Steve - who I spoke to - at one point used
the word: "querulous"...

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.790
Which sounds a bit, querulous, okay?
Querulous, what a great word that is.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.490
That makes me think of The Smiths.
...and I thought my challenge is how long will

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.450
I have to use #iGaze before I can type out
"querulous". It took a while.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.829
I was told it wasn't all my fault.
We'd like to make it clear this is not the

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.460
technology that's doing this.
This is, in fact, it's the cameraman who moved

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.460
the lights round and have changed my pupils!
Being here today just highlights how much

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.100
our brain does and how we take it for granted.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
It's a horrible thing to say, but you're one second away from it being you.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.100
A small accident, a small moment of damage

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.950
to the brain, and you may well lose the power
of speech.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
Brain inures are difficult to work with and
it takes a special person to do that,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.250
and there is only a handful of brain hospitals
in this country that can do what they can

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.140
here at the RHN.
Donations are really vital to give people

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.879
the freedom that they deserve.
So, anything that you can spare, will genuinely

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.280
make a huge difference to somebody else's
lives.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.410
From the 10th to the 16th of March it's Brain
Awareness Week.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.349
If you donate £20 online that will be doubled
by Gormet Pizza so that means your donation

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.560
will be £40.
You worked that out yourself, well done!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.010
Please give £20 today and help others like
Richard and Steve discover the joy of communication

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.090
again.
Thank you so much!
