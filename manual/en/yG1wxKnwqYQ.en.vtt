00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.480
Welcome to the Season � Overview (Part 1):
FLL WORLD CLASS(SM)

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.300
Michelle: I�m your host, Michelle Long,
reporting to you from FIRST� headquarters

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.970
in
Manchester, NH, USA.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.340
With me today are FIRST� LEGO� League
Project Manager Jinnel Choiniere and Scott

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.890
Evans,
FIRST LEGO League Engineer and Game Designer.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
Our top story today is the FLL WORLD CLASS(SM)
Global Challenge release!

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.310
We know you have all been waiting patiently
to hear the details of this year�s Challenge.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.880
Jinnel: And we will get to that in just a
minute.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.150
But first, we want to give you a few keys
to success for this season and every season.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.890
Scott: As you meet with your team, keep in
mind the FIRST LEGO League Core Values.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.260
You can find them at our website and they
should guide you through your work this season.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.250
Jinnel: Coaches, that goes for you, too. There
are 8 Core Values in all, but we�ll start

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.320
with the
most important.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.680
Michelle: We are a team. When missions don�t
go as planned or members disagree on a solution,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
remember this:

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.200
Win or lose, you, your coaches and fellow
team members are all in this together.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.190
Jinnel: That brings us to the second Core
Value we want to highlight:

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.010
What we discover is more important than what
we win.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.750
Every single one of you is going to learn
something this season, whether it's about

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.880
robotics or
algebra or innovations in education or just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090
the best way to divide an 8-piece pizza among
10

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940
hungry team members.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.970
Trophies are nice, but they will never give
you as much as the lessons you learned.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.110
Scott: And the last Core Value we want to
remind you about is this: We have fun.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.509
We know there is a lot to do in a short time,
but this is one of the most important parts

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.700
of FIRST
LEGO League:

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.630
It might be hard, but it�s hard fun. When
meetings get a little rough, take a step back

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.040
and try to
figure out how to make the work more fun.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.130
Michelle: All of the Core Values are important,
so take some time to look over all 8 and keep

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.500
them
in mind this season.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.310
Also, don�t be surprised if they start to
spill over into the rest of your life.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.080
We turn now to our top story: The FIRST LEGO
League Global Challenge release.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
We are proud to bring you the exclusive debut
of FLL WORLD CLASS.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.460
The work for this season began over a year
ago, when we brought together some of the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.900
top minds
in education.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.549
Jinnel: They had a lot to say about learning.

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.059
And a lot of hope for what you might come
up with as you work on your Project and plan

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.650
your
strategy for the Robot Game.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.569
Scott: Now you may be wondering why we selected
FLL WORLD CLASS.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.540
On the surface, it may sound a little different
from themes we have done in the past.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.290
Jinnel: However, every single person on the
planet can relate to this Challenge.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.109
That�s because everyone learns. You, your
parents, your teachers, your coaches, Scott,

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.889
Michelle,
me � you never stop learning.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.370
It�s a topic that often affects kids most,
but ultimately everyone will need or want

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.709
to learn
something new.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.780
Scott: And that brings up another good point:

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.530
This season is about learning, not just classroom
education.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.549
Learning can happen almost anywhere and in
lots of different ways.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.340
Michelle: The first step is learning the details
of the FLL WORLD CLASS Project and Robot

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.790
Game.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.790
Because we all learn in different ways, we
are supplementing our Challenge document with

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.219
this
video and 2 others � 1 on the Project and

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.219
1 on the Game.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.709
Jinnel: But remember! These videos are a supplement
to the Challenge document, which

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.680
contains the full text of the Project and
the Robot Game.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.199
You can download the challenge from our website.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.079
Make sure you read it so you don�t miss
anything important.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.629
Michelle: Also on the website, be sure to
check out the Robot Game and Project Updates,

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.069
which we will keep current throughout the
season with any corrections, clarifications

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.349
or frequently
asked questions about the Challenge.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.829
Scott: If you have Robot Game questions, you
can email me directly at fllrobotgame@usfirst.org.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:44.189
Jinnel: And if you have Project questions,
send them my way at fllprojects@usfirst.org.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:50.480
Michelle: Next up, we�ll tackle the highlights
of the FLL Project in Part 2 of this broadcast,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.129
followed by a Robot Game overview in Part
3.
