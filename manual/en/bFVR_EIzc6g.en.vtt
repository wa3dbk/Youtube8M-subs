00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Football is to me…

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
the passion of my life.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.920
Being a team player is…

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.340
very important and feels great.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.660
In order to be successful at sports, you have to be…

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.280
a team player.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000
If I hadn’t become a professional football player…

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.400
I would have gone to college and still wouldn't know what to do with my life.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.060
My best moment as a Bayern player was…

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.640
well…now I’m supposed to say the Champions League final

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.180
but the best moments are actually the ones with the teammates during our day to day work. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.700
My saddest moment as a Bayern player was…

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.440
okay, yeah that was the Champions League final of 2012.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.235
I would describe my playing style as…

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:57.275
creatively committed.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.360
A trait that would help me improve as a football player…

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.020
being able to dribble. 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.460
I never give up, because…

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.620
I want to win. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.300
My most valued swap jersey belonged to…

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.780
Giovane Élber. I got that when I was a ball boy. 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.220
My idol is…

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.420
my dad. Ha ha. No! You’ll have to scratch that. He’ll get too excited about it. 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.220
Interviews are to me…

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:32.300
work and fun. If they’re not too long they’re more fun. If it gets too long, I’ll just break it off. 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.920
My favorite song is…

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.980
Stern des Südens (the Bayern hymn)

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.000
With my first pay-check as a professional player…

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.640
I balanced my account.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.440
I live in the countryside because…

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.900
the air is amazing there.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.320
I laugh about…

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.760
my wife, myself and my team-mates.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.480
Under the shower I sing…

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.580
Stern des Südens.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.640
What move would you have liked to be a part of?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160
Mr. Bean.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.560
When I have a day off, I…

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
try to relax and have fun with my family and friends.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.060
Who would you like to trade lives with for a day?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.180
Since golfing is one of my big passions, I’d really like to play a professional tournament one day.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.240
But of course I’d also need the other person’s skills. Otherwise it wouldn’t make much sense.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.860
Which question have you been asked most throughout your career?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.760
At what percentage do you see the team at the moment?
