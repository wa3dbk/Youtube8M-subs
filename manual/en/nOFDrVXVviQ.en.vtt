00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.520
We are on the highway A4 in direction to Metz.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:41.514
We left Paris 30 minutes ago and already drove 100 kilometers with the car.

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:44.054
It feels good.

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:45.394
It's a bit loud.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.220
You cannot compare the noise and driving feeling with today's cars.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.380
But it's comfortable though.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.640
The suspension is soft but tight enough.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.320
The large steering wheel feels good.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.120
The automatic gearbox operates well so far.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.160
We need to refuel. The fuel indicator is very unsteady. Difficult to see how much fuel is in the tank.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.220
Look, 37 liters...

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.680
...37 liters, so I must fill until 30...approximately that much into this reservoir.

00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.818
Yes, the car has become very rare now.

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:10.650
Yes, yes.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.460
For quite a long time these cars have been owned by young men in France and...

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.460
..they crashed many of them unfortunately.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.240
Yes, and the rust is also a big problem...

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.740
Yes, they do rust.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.875
If you don't pay attention...

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.600
We are now in Lorraine, shortly before Verdun.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.300
You get used to the noise very quick.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.640
It's definitely louder than today's cars,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.380
but it's not uncomfortable.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.720
The electric windows are very welcome as they is no air conditioning.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.920
You can open und shut the windows quickly at least.
