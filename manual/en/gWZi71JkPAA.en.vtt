00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey Phil, you're looking so serious, why don't
you lighten up?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.990
It's easy to mod your sneakers to light up
when you walk.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.560
Today we'll show you how to add NeoPixel strip
and a simple sensor to detect your steps,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:22.130
with FLORA, Adafruit's wearable electronics
platform.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:32.820
For this project we'll be using Velostat.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.350
What is that?

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.660
Velostat is a material that becomes less resistive
when it's pinched, so we made a basic sensor

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.394
from it to detect each time your weight comes
down on the heel of the shoe.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.960
Just tape one piece of conductive thread to
each side of a small piece of velostat, forming

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.949
a loop under the tape.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.879
Then pick up the tails with a needle and stitch
them up the side of the shoe, connecting one

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.780
to ground and the other to an analog input
on the FLORA board.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.960
Each time FLORA sees the resistance of the
velostat drop, it knows you've stepped on

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.140
the heel sensor, and it triggers the LEDs
around the sole to animate, lighting up your

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
stride.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
We prototyped the circuit with alligator clips
before attaching everything to the shoes.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.060
Put your shoes on and bend your foot as though
you're standing on your tip toes.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.110
Mark off the parts of the shoe that bend the
most, and skip these spots when it's time

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.140
to glue.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.439
This will reduce the likelihood of cracking
the flexible circuit board when the shoes

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.570
bend.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.460
Now we need to glue the strips to the shoes.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.820
We recommend Permatex 66B silicone adhesive
because it sticks to the sheathing of the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.229
NeoPixel strip, but test any adhesive first
to make sure it also sticks to the rubber

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.820
of your shoes.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.300
This triple A battery holder lives in the
shoe's laces, and you can follow along with

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.470

System to build your own firewalker LED sneakers.
