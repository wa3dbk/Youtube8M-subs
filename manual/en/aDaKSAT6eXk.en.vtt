00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.480
You just got a higher than usual water bill and you have

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.380
questions. Is it a leak or did you just consume

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.460
more water. If it is a leak is it inside the home

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.100
or outside the home? Is it something that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.940
you can fix yourself or do you need to call a plumber? Can JEA help you?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.740
I'm Brian Pippin. Conservation and Efficiency Specialist with JEA and this How to in Two is all about Diagnosing a water leak.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.260
So how do you determine if you even have a leak?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.220
This is where JEA can help.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.940
Out by the curb is the water meter box

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.560
and on the face of the meter is the leak detection dial.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.260
It will help you determine if you even have the smallest water leak.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.380
First, make sure you turn off all the inside faucets

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.280
and outside hose bibs to your home.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.240
Next, you will need to gain access to the water meter

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.140
box using a crowbar or long screw driver to pry open the lid.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.580
You may need a rag to clean off the face of the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660
water meter so you can read it.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.732
If the leak detection dial is moving,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.140
you may have a leak.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.600
Now that we know we have a leak,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.360
we need to figure out where it is.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.080
The most common place for an indoor water leak

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.060
is the toilet flapper valve.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240
You should perform the toilet leak test

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.720
as described in a previous How to In Two

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.640
to see if a leak is present.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.972
Now check all outside and inside fixtures

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.580
for water leaks.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.200
If you have an irrigation system check

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.600
every spray head and rotor you have to make sure nothing is leaking.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.060
Take special note to look for wet soppy

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.420
areas in the yard as it may be an indication of a leak in the buried pipes.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.060
Most homeowners can change out a flapper valve

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.260
or change out an irrigation spray head, but

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.000
if it gets more complicated than that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.640
you're gonna want to call a plumber.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.620
