00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.880
Hi, I'm Tim. The author of stretchy.org,
a website about making catsuits.
Here's how to make a catsuit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.259
You need two tape measures

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:16.789
and the person who's going to wear the catsuit.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.199
That would be me in this case.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:21.199
While measuring you should wear
what you'll be wearing under the suit.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.859
I'm wearing cycle shorts and this shirt
because they're thin enough to ignore

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.780
and YouTube doesn't like nakedness. I'm keeping
one end of the tape measure fixed by treading

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.660
on it so I can pull it taut while reading and
I'll be using the other measure for the various

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.240
circumferences on the way up.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.960
Now I like cat suits with built-in socks and
making your lowest leg measurement from your

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.220
ankle bone... where I'm pointing

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.990
makes it obvious how to join
the foot measurements on later

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.830
so here's the first measurement being taken
the distance up from my heel and the distance

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.790
around my ankle.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.020
if you have a friend to copy the measurements
as you call them out that's really helpful

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.020
but if you're too shy or don't have any friends

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.900
it's much faster to record your voice than
breaking each time to write the numbers down

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.740
I was reading my measurement out to the camera

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.300
but you're not really interested in hearing those
so I've dubbed this commentary on top

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.870
Now I have fairly well-developed calfs because
I cycle too much

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
so I take enough measurements to
describe the curves

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.480
so there... below my knee

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.280
above my knee, and along my thigh.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.440
you might notice not all my measurements are perfectly
horizontal or vertical

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.400
that's ok as long as they're mostly right because
measuring from the heel each time prevents

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.110
errors accumulating, because lycra's pretty
forgiving, and because we'll be scaling the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.390
measurements down a bit anyway.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.950
Once I've measured around the very top of
my leg... there...

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.940
Move the camera?

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.260
Very good(!)

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.860
I wrap the take around both legs at exactly the
same height and that's the first body measurement

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.370
I then slide it up to measure my bum's
widest point because that's a curve I need to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.320
fit well

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.990
and then continue upwards along my body
to my underarms. If I had a bust, I'd need to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.680
take more measurements for that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.700
but I wasn't a lady last time I checked.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
during this measurement takes longer than
the video. You can see I'm cutting because

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.680
I didn't want you to get bored but the good news
is you only need to take your measurements once

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.680
unless you gain or lose lots of weight
or make a catsuit-making video.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:24.539
You can take them more often, of course, if it
gives you the jollies,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.890
but please keep your taylor-related roleplay
fetishes between yourself and your partner

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.219
because I'm not interested!

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.929
So to measure my over-the-shoulder distance, I held
the white measure around me from when it was

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:39.239
right up around my under-arms

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:41.659
and then tugged the yellow one up so its end was just
tucked in at the front

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.219
and then reached behind to grab where the two
measures meet again... There we go.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:52.499
Now, around my neck

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:56.519
and read that carefully off the measure

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.319
very good(!)

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.569
Just a reminder:

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.549
don't measure yourself with baggy jeans or jacket on:
only what you'd be wearing underneath,

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.589
or something thin enough not to make a
difference

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:09.999
So this is measuring from my knuckles to the side of my neck
with my arm up, and then down, to capture

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.679
the difference in length over my shoulder

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.159
in the two positions. It's a couple of inches.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.109
And now I'm measuring my arm

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.319
circumferences and distances from my knuckles

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.919
first to the wrist

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.339
then half way to the elbow

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.489
elbow

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.989
halfway up bicep

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.449
and at the shoulder

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.099
told you it was boring...

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:39.099
(sung) Polyphony...

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.099
(sung) Polyphony...

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.099
(sung) Polyphony...

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.099
(sung) Polyphony...

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:47.800
You could get your friend to measure you as well
that would be even more fun

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.800
especially the inside leg.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:54.869
Here I am measuring my foot from my ankle bone

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.029
you remember the first leg measurement was
just above the bone... stop that!

00:03:55.029 --> 00:04:00.699
to my big toe.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.659
If I were picky I'd worry that the ankle
bone is higher than the inner one

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.629
but I like to make the sock a little loose 
so my toes aren't squished

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
and now measure the width of heel that I stand
on.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.269
That's called a T-square

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.739
and you get them in art shops for technical drawing.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.599
This is a weird measurement

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.309
I'm measuring both my chest's apparent width which
is the width of my shadow's chest on a sunny day

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:26.329
and also the width where I can't wedge my finger
between my chest and the T-square

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:31.309
for convenience I only measure half-widths

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.719
and for me it's eighteen centimetres half
shadow width

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.540
and nine centimetres half wedge width

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.000
I threatened to tell you about scaling

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.000
so here we go

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:44.239
you have to make the cat suit
a bit smaller than your real body size

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.870
so it doesn't look wrinkly on you.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.060
ninety percent is a good starter scaling
for most stretch fabric

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.060
so use that for now.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.000
These are the measurements for my leg

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.029
to scale them by ninety percent multiply all
the numbers by nought point nine

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.649
if we were scaling by eighty five percent
it will be nought point eight five

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:05.439
when you're more experienced you might decide
to make the body length shorter or the thighs

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.330
looser or something

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
Here is the first circumference at ninety percent

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.989
and here is the first distance to heel at ninety
percent

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:16.239
Do that for all of them

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.149
Now I find it useful to divide all leg
and arm circumferences in two,

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:25.830
and all the body circumference in four, for
reasons that will become clear in the next video

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.889
I don't scale the foot measurements because
I don't like my toes squished

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.430
I also find it useful to work out the
distances between the circumferences:

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.319
just subtract the distance to heel associated
with each circumference from the one above it

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:47.319
because all this maths is a nuisance I've
created a web page that will calculate it

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:51.909
and the URL is given in green above.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.830
You want about halfway down that webpage

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:54.509
the red column here is the scaled
half circumferences

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.069
half because of the 'DIV equals two' above
the word 'heel' on the left

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.319
if it's said 'DIV equals four' the red column would
be scaled quarter circumferences.

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.650
The yellow column is the distances between the circumferences.
And of course the word 'heel' on the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.129
left should actually read 'ankle'.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.280
But I'm not gonna go back and edit that!
