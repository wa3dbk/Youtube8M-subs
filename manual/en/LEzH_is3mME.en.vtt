Gabe: Hi Niners! My name is Gabe Davis. 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.140
Ariel: And I'm Ariel Martin. We're here to guide you through the world of dining at UNC Charlotte!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.520
Gabe: That's right Ariel! Dining is a huge part of campus life. 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.460
Ariel: As a student you're going to have many demands. Much to do and people to meet!   

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.660
Gabe: Mmhmm...and you need to eat! You have to eat in order to get things done. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.860
Ariel: That's so true! You need fuel in your tank to get anywhere...and up all those hills. 

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.233
Gabe: Oohhh...yeah, you need to eat breakfast. 

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.233
Ariel: The most important meal of the day! 

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.353
Gabe: Then lunch! 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.980
Ariel: The second most important meal of the day! 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.980
Gabe: And of course, dinner! 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
Ariel: Crucial to have before taking on...

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:35.453
Ariel: The homework...

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:36.233
(Ghostly Voice Off-Camera) Homework...

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880
Gabe: Ariel...are you alright? 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.900

Gabe: Then there's dessert with my main man, Norm! 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.660
Ariel: Ahh yes! Dessert! Your reward for doing all of that home-wait. You eat with Norm? 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.560
Gabe: Yes, of course we're BFFs...duh! 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.640
Ariel: Ah huh, sure! Gabe: Yes!  Ariel: BFFs!                       Gabe: Yeah! We go way back...like Myspace accounts! (Laughs)  

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.520
Ariel: Anyway...there's a lot to take in at UNCC! Not just homework, but food! 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.240
Gabe: You know what? How about I show you? 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.880
Gabe: Yes! You on Instagram not paying attention. Pay attention!    

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820
Gabe: I'll show you where to eat on campus. 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.820
Ariel: And I'll show you how to use your meal plans. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360
Gabe: Let's get to it..

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.540
Gabe: I'm really involved here on campus. Which means i'm here constantly. Since I have a meal plan, I don't have to go home to get a great meal. 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.540
Gabe: Cause let's be honest... (Dramatic Music Begins) 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.940
Gabe: You think i'm giving up my parking space? 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.660
Gabe (Deep Voice): NO...WAY!

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.020
(Cheerful Music Returns) Gabe: I don't have to! There are 27 places to eat on campus, here's some of my personal favorites. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.720
Gabe: There are food courts in Prospector, the Student Union, and the Cone Center. 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.480
Gabe: There's even retail stores like Outtakes. These are just a few of the places you can dine! 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.420
Ariel: Thanks Gabe, but don't forget about the dining halls! 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:04.060
Ariel: Crown Commons and the brand new SoVi at South Village Crossing offer modern facilities with action stations and are a great place to eat with friends. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.940
Ariel: Seeing all that food made me really hungry! Good thing I have a meal plan. Here's how it works.  

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.940
Ariel (Voice Off Screen): Meal plans are comprised of two parts: Meal Swipes and Declining Balance.  

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.340
Ariel (Voice Off Screen): Meal Swipes are used at the dining halls, Crown Commons and SoVi. Plans have either unlimited swipes or a set number depending on the plan.     

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.600
Ariel (Voice Off Screen): The second part of a meal plan is a dollar amount of Declining Balance. DB can be used in all kinds of places across campus. 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.020
Ariel (Voice Off Screen): Dining halls, food courts, retail stores, athletic events, the Movie Theater...the works! 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:46.980
Ariel: I live on campus and love using my unlimited meal swipes for snacks and small meals throughout the day. I can eat what I want, when I want! 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.340
(Clank Noise) 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.100
(Clank Noise) 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.880
Ariel: Say what? (Slide Noise)

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.500
Gabe: Meal plans are the best way to dine at UNC Charlotte. They make it easy to get food! 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.520
Ariel: And you don't have to worry about where, when, or how to get that food with all of the places to eat right here. 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.380
Gabe: Mmmhmm, well Ariel its been fun but Norms...

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.380

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.340
Gabe: Hey Norm, buddy! Whatcha doing? Mining? Man! We haven't done that in forty-nine years. See what I did? No, you're a clown! No you, you!

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.300
