00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi everyone, today I am making slow cooked pork belly

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's have a look at the ingredients

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.200
Pork belly 900 grams

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.920
1.5 teaspoon of salt

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.440
2 tablespoon of yellow cane sugar

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.436
Soy sauce 2 tablespoon

00:00:25.436 --> 00:00:27.400
Dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.020
we also have wine

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.640
3 tablespoon of shaoxing wine

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.640
1 tablespoon of Chinese rose wine

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.120
We can substitute the Chinese wine with white wine

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.780
Ginger 4 slices

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.300
4 cubes of shallots

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.840
Garlic 4 pieces, that half a bulb

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
4 star anise

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.120
ground pepper

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.700
sesame seed oil

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.620
1 tablespoon of cooking oil

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.300
First of all, we need to slice the belly pork into 3 large strips

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.740
Now cut them into large cubes

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.927
This size

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.980
then we need to blanch them

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.520
Now the water is starting to bubble, we can place the pork belly into the pan

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.780
We blanch the pork for another two minutes after the water starts boiling

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.360
Now the water is boiled, we pour away the water

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.328
Pour away the water

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.920
This process is to wash away the blood from the pork, and to remove the pungent smell 

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.706
Leave the pork aside for later

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.980
First of all, we heat up the wok, and place 1 tablespoon of oil into the wok

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.413
We now stir fry ginger, shallots, star anise

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:12.340
Garlic

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:15.873
Smells great

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.098
Now they are ready and place them onto a plate for later

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.500
Now with medium heat, we need to heat up the yellow cane sugar

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.000
We need to melt the sugar

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960
before we put the pork in

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.960
The sugar coats the pork and gives it a shine

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:48.724
Now the pork is browned

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.280
we can sprinkle some ground pepper

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.191
Salt

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.720
Ginger, shallots, garlic and star anise

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.020
1 tablespoon of dark soy sauce and 2 tablespoon of soy sauce

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280
4 tablespoon of wine

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
Some water

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.860
Cover the pork with water

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.320
Use medium heat

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.800
We cook the pork for 1hour 15 minutes

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.040
Now, we cover the lid and slow cook it for 1 hour and 15 minutes

00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:30.840
Let's have a look

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.700
wow, beautiful

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.360
We need to bring the heat to high

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:35.436
To thicken the sauce

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020
Let the water evaporate

00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:40.453
Look

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.020
Very pretty

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300
Slow cooked belly pork is ready to serve

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.740

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.740
