00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.780
 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.160
 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.849
Binax is the next generation

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.550
of Siemens Best Sound technology. To
create it, our engineers drew inspiration

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.460
from the healthy

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.720
auditory system to develop a solution
that emulates natural

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.190
binaural hearing.  When they came out
with micon a few years ago I was

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.199
impressed with that,

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.250
and this sets the bar at a whole other
level.  I've never found a hearing aid that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.370
really does what is says it does as far
as noise reduction

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.330
and getting rid of background sounds.  This
actually did a pretty good job with that.  I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.350
was impressed.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.050
So the foundation of binax is our e2e
Wireless 3.0

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.899
and with this technology, we are able
to not only transmit data,

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
but also audio signals. And with that, we
have our high definition sound

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.040
resolution

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.979
where we're incorporating a virtual 8 microphone network.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.149
So with binax, we have three pillars
that we're introducing:

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.380
binaxSound, binaxFocus, and binaxGuide.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.350
Within each of these pillars, there are
features that benefit those patients in

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.860
those demanding environments and allow

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.130
for a customized fit for each

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.550
patient.  So we all know that

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.509
wind is very challenging for hearing
aid wearers.  

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.550
What eWindscreen binaural allows us to
do

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.490
is if there is wind coming from
one side of the head more than the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.770
other, we are going to take the clean
signal from the opposite ear

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.710
and send the clean signal to the side
that's being affected by wind.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.729
That's gonna be a very nice feature,
because I know a lot of people do take

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.470
their hearing aids out just to go for a walk
because of the wind.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.849
With binaxFocus, we have two

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.599
new features that we're introducing.  With
narrow directionality,

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.300
this is the feature that allows us to
have better than normal hearing

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.599
in demanding environments. Spatial speech
focus

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.129
works automatically in the car so as
soon as the hearing aid detects that the

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.510
patient is in a car,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.450
this feature is engaged. The way this
feature works

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.790
is it's looking for the loudest speech
source

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.290
in that environment

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.440
so that the patient doesn't have to turn
their head and try to look at the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.910
passenger or look at the person behind
them.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.930
But we do know that there are situations
where some wearers want a little bit more

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.069
control.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.459
So for example, let's say the patient is
not

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.500
in a car, but they would want to focus on
the person either to the right or to the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.440
left of them.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.799
Through the easyTek app, the patient can

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.879
control who they want to listen to in

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.099
any environment. So they can pull out
their app and they can choose

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.319
the direction of focus for that
particular situation,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.640
and also with the spatial configurator,
they can decide how wide they would want

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.239
the beam.  So if the beam is
automatically

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.290
in a much narrow focus and they wanted to
listen to more of the conversation, they can 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.299
use that app or their rocker switch to
change the focus of the beam.  

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.150
Clinical studies at the University of
Northern Colorado

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.410
and Oldenburg Horzentrum showed that
binax wearers can achieve

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.160
better speech recognition than people
with normal hearing

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.010
in the same cocktail party situation. This is

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.579
truly a world's first. Hearing technology

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.850
that outperforms normal hearing.
