00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:30.209
Now we're going to fish with 
a spinning rod.

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:33.042
Spinning rod. How fun!

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:38.834
You can use this one. 
I'll use the Special Wobbler.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:42.751
Oh. The Special Wobbler.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:49.334
Pull back and cast!

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:55.751
Pull back and cast!

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:05.918
You have to do it harder!

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:08.292
Watch me.

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:10.959
And cast!

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.125
And cast!

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:19.834
Oh dear.

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:01.417
But, Harax. You lost the 
Special Wobbler.

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.751
My best lure!

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:09.042
But, but, it was...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.501
Now we'll head back home.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.542
Just one more time.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.209
No! Now we'll pack our things.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.042
Gosh!

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.918
Harax? Where are you?

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:32.167
Harax! we're going home.

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.375
It went quite well.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:46.167
Yes, Harax. Quite well.

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.334
Tasty rolls?

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.459
Tasty rolls.
