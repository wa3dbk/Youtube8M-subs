00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:20.116
&gt;&gt; When you install a system of livestock
watering facilities, your animals will drink

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.526
from a tank, a trough, or a ball water.

00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:25.706
You can choose a setup that's
best for your land.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:30.076
Let's take a closer at what's available
and what might work best for you.

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:35.976
I'm here with Eddie Martin, a field engineer
with the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.216
Eddie, farmers have several
choices when it comes to the type

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.956
of livestock watering facility
they choose to install.

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:43.096
&gt;&gt; Eddie Martin: They do.

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:48.476
They can -- they have the choice to use
concrete tank which is a big round or square.

00:00:49.326 --> 00:00:51.416
They can have heavy duty plastic tanks.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.946
They also can use equipment tires
and if freezing is a concern,

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.836
they can use ball waterers
or freeze proof waterers.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.176
&gt;&gt; What does a farmer need to
think about when he decides

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:06.396
where to locate livestock
watering facilities on his land?

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:10.226
&gt;&gt; Eddie Martin: There might be a place that
he thinks he wants the watering facility

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:13.466
but he also has to consider
can he get water to it?

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.976
Can he get power to his water source?

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:20.206
And is it really going to fit in
with his livestock grazing pattern?

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:24.406
It's better not to locate your
watering facilities in a shady area

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:30.366
because the dominant animals in the herd will
keep the younger animals or the smaller animals

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:32.066
from drinking during hot weather.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:40.116
You really don't want to locate your mineral
feeder near the water tank because the cows will

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:42.966
over eat the mineral and
eat more than they need.

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:46.986
Your cattle should never have
to walk more than 800 feet

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:48.836
to get water from any part of the pasture.

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:54.036
If we follow that rule, they'll have
better use of the entire pasture rather

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.056
than just eating there close to the water tank.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.866
&gt;&gt; Eddie, how big do the tanks need to be?

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:05.376
&gt;&gt; Eddie Martin: The size of the tanks depend
on the species using them, the number of animals

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.996
in the herd, and the capacity of both
the water source and the pipeline.

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:16.796
The height of the tank depends on the age of the
animals using the tank as well as the species

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:18.276
of animals that you're planning for.

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:22.876
Lightweight tanks need protection
from animal damage.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:28.586
So they need to be guarded by wooden
or a large steel pipe guard post.

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:33.426
There are two types of valves
we use in watering troughs.

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.736
The automatic valve works of a float system.

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:43.756
The manual valve requires the operator to be
there to put water in as the animals need water.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:48.366
All watering facilities should
have a means to drain the tank

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:53.406
to remove contaminants and
sediment from time to time.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:57.816
You need to know the type of trough you'll be
using so that when you install your plumbing,

00:02:58.326 --> 00:03:03.806
the plumbing will be easy to
access for maintenance purposes.

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.686
Algae will grow in the water trough.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.866
So occasionally you will need
to clean out the water trough

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:10.946
by draining the trough and removing the algae.

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:16.466
Also after a [music] freezing event, you need
to go back and out check to make sure the trough

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:21.836
and the float valve have
not been damaged by the ice.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.546
&gt;&gt; It's easy to get all the
information you need to install a system

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:28.226
of livestock watering facilities
for your animals.

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:33.766
You can stop by any NRCS field office and
pickup copies of the conservation standards.

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:40.736
Or you can go to sc.nrcs.usda.gov,
click on EFODG.

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:46.176
For watering facilities, select
NRCS standard number 6 one 4.
