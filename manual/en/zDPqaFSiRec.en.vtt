00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
STACEY TOOKEY: Two winners and
two extraordinary winners.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.440
I mean, I'm thrilled to have two
classical ballet dancers

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.650
and both who I was fortunate
enough to work with.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.610
TYCE DIORIO: All four could have
won, and everyone would

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.520
have been like, wow, awesome.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.070
I would have been completely
thrilled for Cyrus.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.370
And I think everyone
would have been.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.990
ALLISON HOLKER: I love Cyrus and
I would have loved for him

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470
to win, but I understand
why Chehon won.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.790
And I think it's great that he
did because he has so many new

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.920
places he'll be able to go.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.130
Cyrus is already so strong in
what he does, he's going to be

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.210
hired to do those things.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.369
He's gonna go places with it.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.220
People are going to
want to see more.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.140
With Chehon, it really gave
him more of a light to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.700
showcase that he has more
ability to bring to the table.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.600
You know what I mean?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.660
So he's gonna be really pushing
the avenues that he

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.820
didn't know he could go to.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.870
TIFFANY MAHER: We've
all worked so hard.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.600
And it was anybody's game.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.170
It was who picked up the phone
that week, you know?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.810
So everybody in the top
20 is a winner.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.970
We have all been through
this together.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.260
Vegas week is one of the hardest
weeks of your life.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.856
And so to be standing here,
no matter what, I

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:05.970
was gonna be so happy.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.560
Because if it wasn't me, it
was my friends winning.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.930
CYRUS SPENCER: Literally Tiffany
is the toughest girl.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.740
I can not stress that
enough, guys.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.330
Tiffany is probably the rock
in the entire season.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.790
She's the rock.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.845
You can drop her or hit her or
try to do anything you want to

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:23.920
her, and you can't break her.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.290
She's the diamond.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.460
You can't destroy her.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.170
She's amazing.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.130
And Eliana, oh my gosh.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.210
Are you kidding me?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450
Literally, literally,
she's almost

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.510
flawless when she's dancing.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.080
ELIANA GIRARD: I'm
so ecstatic.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.020
Honestly, I'm a little
sad though, because

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.480
it's so much fun.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.310
The crew here, you guys
don't get to meet

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.820
them, but they're amazing.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.300
They made this experience
so much fun.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.510
And of course, the cast.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.720
Everyone's so amazing.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.950
It's like being in summer camp
that you never want to end.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.550
CHEHON WESPI-TSCHOPP: It's great
to see that So You Think

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.140
has found a spot for
ballet dancers.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.690
And that we've had such a
big voice is incredible.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.710
And I remember our first routine
that we did-- me,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.690
Daniel, and Eliana on our
opening top 20 show.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.770
We were like, how far
do you think this

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.800
journey will take us?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.580
And they were just like,
yeah, ballet's great.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.344
And we weren't sure.

00:02:09.344 --> 00:02:11.260
And now we made it to the end.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.860
It's just like, wow.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.500
This is Chehon, So You Think
You Can Dance champ, and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.750
you're watching DanceOn.
