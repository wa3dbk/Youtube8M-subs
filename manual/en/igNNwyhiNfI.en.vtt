00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.080
How, how would you go about solving a clue,
let's say solving an anagram? For, for example,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.879
a friend showed me this clue 'beaten World
Cup Team dressing after shower'. The clue

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.220
as a whole is very nicely worded, it seems
as if it's telling you something in itself,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.680
into its component parts. Now when I first
look at this, I see the word 'beaten'. That's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.530
a very strong clue that there's going to be
an anagram in this clue. I see that 'World

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.280
Cup Team' has twelve letters, and we see from
the length indication that the answer is two

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.670
words of 6 letters each. So now what I think
is that this World Cup Team, is what we know

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.600
as anagram fodder, these are the letters that
are going to be mixed up to find the answer,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.809
and dressing after shower is going to be the
definition of the resulting phrase. So, how

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.999
do I start working on that? Well, what I usually
do is take the letters and mix them up a little

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:23.469
bit on the piece of paper, so I've got World,
Cup, Team, and these are all of those letters,

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.491
and I've mixed them up so I'm not looking
at them as words any more, but just as letters

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:33.649
on their own. Now, one, once I've got these
letters sort of jumbled up here I start looking

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.730
through them for words. I know I've got two
six letter words. Now what six letter words

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:51.240
can I see in there? I take a look and I see,
well, I've got the word couple, c-o-u-p-l-e,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.569
but if i use the word couple, what does that
leave me? That would leave me with a W, an

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:14.830
A, an R, a D, a T, and one other letter, c-o-u-p-l-e,
and M. And we see here there's only one vowel

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.890
for six letters, which is very unusual in
a word, so I think the word couple is not

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:29.700
going to be right. So let's discard that.
I look for another six letter word, eventually

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:40.560
I came up with the word with a p-o-w-d-e-r.
So, if we have powder, what does that, what

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:55.900
letters does that leave? That leaves a C,
an L, a T, a U, an A, and an M. Now what can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.600
I do with those letters? And after looking
at it again, again I would put them into a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:15.220
jumble and I'd say, 'Ah! What do we have?'
We have t-a-l-c-u-m. So the answer to this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.310
is talcum powder.
