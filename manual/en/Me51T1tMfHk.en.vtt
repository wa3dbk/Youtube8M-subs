Hi! I'm Pete Bellessis and I'm an art teacher.
Today I am representing expertvillage.com.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.519
Our lesson today is drawing; more specifically
still life's. Even more specifically, shading

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.429
still life's. Let's take a look. Let me show
you how to bring out some life to this drawing.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.990
It's rather flat and two dimensional. So I
am really pushing down on it now. I am also

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.789
going to take my finger and blend a little
bit; soften things up, move some of this graphite

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.490
around on the paper. I am really kind of focusing
on this porcelain tray that the candle sits

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.229
on right now. I'm giving it a more defined
edge, harder line there. I'm finding the shadows.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:45.390
Shadows are what? Well quick review, they
are what occurs where the light hits on an

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.760
object and where the light is then not really
making its way all the way through; a solid

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.569
or opaque object. We are going to concentrate
on our lines here. The darkness and lightness

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.789
of them. We are also going to blend them.
We can do that with just our finger tips or

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.170
we can inadvertently do it with our whole
hand and ruin a drawing. A lot of this stuff

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.609
that smudges will occur. You can come back
to that later and erase them out. In fact,

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.609
that is a necessary part of showing some of
your light areas. You are going to want to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.109
go in with the proper eraser and really just
a eraser like this will work. It actually

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.219
gives you a fine enough tip to get in there
and like detail or erase. Erasing can be a

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.469
very important part of drawing. Right here
is a good example; so we have a shadow on

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:41.930
it. Try and lighten it up a little bit. Maybe
give a little hint of shading here, some shadows

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.749
on the actual table, very light, maybe blend.
Probably have enough graphite on my finger

00:01:49.749 --> 00:02:06.859
to blend that. Come back to the turtle and
give him a little bit more

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:15.970
and a little shading on what is actually a
beak looking part of his head. As you can

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.650
see which is a few areas that I decided to
pick out and they weren't random. These are

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.720
what my eyes see based on the light that hits
my objects.
