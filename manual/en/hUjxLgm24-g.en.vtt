00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.120
So now we have gone through and read our whole
melody for our tune. We played our chords

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.920
underneath it and again you can always reference
to these different chords. I know we did not

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.562
teach you how to play all of them in this
lesson plan but that would be throwing a little

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:17.850
bit to much at you. You can go and reference
in your own time, spend some time to really

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.130
get these chords under your fingers. But we
are going to play through the melody with

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:59.379
the chords so you can hear how it sounds.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:53.790
(playing piano) 3,4,3,4,3,4. That is our tune
we have played through it twice, you have

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.020
the melody down in deep in your memory. So
go through and really get those chords down

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.009
and start playing to this nice simple tune.
