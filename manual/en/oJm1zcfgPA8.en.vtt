00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.809
I've been working with a local animal rescue,
and I think a PowerPoint presentation is just

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.300
what we need to showcase some pictures and
information about the pets available for adoption.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.500
But how do we get to this from a slide that
started out like this? The key is understanding

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.160
how slides, layouts, and placeholders work.
Let's take a look.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.660
Placeholders are the areas on the slide enclosed
by little dotted lines. Placeholders can contain

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.660
text; some of them can even contain things
like tables and pictures. Just hover over

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.149
the commands in the placeholder to see what
you can do.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.010
The way these placeholders are arranged on
the slide has to do with the slide layout.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.570
This layout happens to include a placeholder
for the title and two placeholders for content.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.450
You can choose the layout when you first insert
a slide, or change it later depending on the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.119
type of information you decide to include.
That's what I'd like to do with this slide,

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.110
which is supposed to be more of a section
header.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
To open a menu of all the different slide
layouts, all we have to do is click the Layout

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.430
command in the Slides group. Here, we can
see that this slide is using the Two Content

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.590
layout, but based on the thumbnail for Section
Header, I think this one would be a better

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.030
fit. Just click to change, and - this is perfect.
PowerPoint immediately takes the contents

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.479
of my placeholders, applies the new layout,
and even modifies the formatting to better

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.600
fit the purpose of the slide.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.700
Very quickly, I'd like to show you what to
do when a layout is almost perfect but needs

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.850
a little reworking. This looks great, for
example, but the layout includes a placeholder

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.270
I'm not planning to use. To delete any unwanted
placeholders, all you have to do is position

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.509
your mouse on the dotted border (notice how
the cursor changes) and click to select it.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.259
Now press Backspace or Delete on your keyboard.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.290
On the other hand, if you wanted to add to
your current layout, you can include text

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.810
wherever you like by inserting a text box.
We're going to go over them in detail in a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.200
later lesson, but while we're here, I thought
I'd show you how to use the command. Just

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.200
go to the Insert tab, and click Text Box.
Text boxes are especially useful if you ever

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.590
decide to use a blank slide that doesn't have
placeholders.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Speaking of slides, I think I'd like to insert
a couple more to finish building my presentation.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.569
Where should we start? Let's go back to the
Home tab. How about another section header

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.000
for the part of the presentation where we
feature cats and other small pets? We can

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.430
click the top half of the New Slide command
to quickly add a slide with the same layout

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.180
as the one I have selected. That's not really
what I want, so I'm just going to delete this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.220
slide by pressing Backspace or Delete on my
keyboard. To insert a slide with a different

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.599
layout, I'm going to click the bottom half
of the command. This opens the menu, where

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.709
I can choose the layout I want - in this case,
Section Header.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.560
Now I need to move this slide up a couple
places - right before slide 7, where the section

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.760
on cats and other small pets begins. To move
a slide, all you have to do is click and hold

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.980
it in the left pane, then drag where you want
the slide to go. See that horizontal insertion

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.730
point? That marks where it's going to be moved
when I release my mouse.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.709
To quickly add slides for the rest of the
pets we want to include, I'd like to try the

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.150
Copy &amp; Paste method. This can really save
you time when the slides you already have

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.909
are so similar to what you need. To copy and
paste, select the slide you want to copy,

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.519
then click the Copy command. Now click in
between or below the slide where you want

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.530
the copy to appear (another insertion point
marks the spot) and go back to the Ribbon

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.879
to click Paste.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.909
Creating presentations is easy once you know
the secret to using placeholders, layouts,

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:02.909
and working with PowerPoint slides.
