00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.530
Good day.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.370
The free to play genre is pretty much found
only on the PC.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.950
I imagine some free to play games must exist
on consoles, but I would imagine that they

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.430
are fairly rare.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.440
Now the games found in this genre are either
of middling or average quality but then you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.450
get some true greats like League of Legends
or Blacklight Retribution.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.720
And now we come to Wareframe, a free to play
game released in March of this year, and it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.440
is definitely one of the greats.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.340
The game is a third person shooter that can
either be played cooperatively or solo, and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.120
in addition to the shooting it also has some
hack and slash elements.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.160
And as of the latest update, you may actually
be doing just as much hacking and slashing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.860
as you will be doing shooting, as the sword's
power has been greatly increased.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.171
Graphically, the game looks great, and the
levels and characters and enemies are all

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:18.600
highly detailed, and the animations for the
characters are really quite impressive, especially

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.360
for a free to play game.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.069
You can find yourself doing back flips and
rolls and one thing I find really cool is

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.110
the fact that your character can actually
climb.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.110
The sheer number of animations your character
has is nothing short of amazing.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.099
Most games you actually pay for don't have
these kinds of animations.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:02:00.520
The story for the game is pretty basic: you
are a Tenno, otherwise known as a space ninja,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.220
and you have to fight forces of vaguely defined
evil.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.430
Really, story is not important; you go forth
and kill things.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.950
The missions are good, but basic ï¿½ you collect
artifacts, you kill leaders, you blow up mining

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.030
equipment, general stuff, but at least it
gives your missions purpose.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.480
You can carry two weapons with you at any
given time and they, and you, level up as

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.170
you complete missions.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.810
You can get more missions by leveling up and
through micro transactions.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
The game has a wide variety of levels to play
through but they are kind of like the Model

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.290
T in that you can have any color you want
so long as it's black.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
Essentially, many of the levels look alike;
this is due to the fact that the game uses

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.720
procedural level generation.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:50.320
In all reality, though, the levels don't get
boring despite this.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:01.140
In the end, this is a great coop shooter,
and one I would definitely recommend checking

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.190
out, especially since it's free.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.300
And so, this is Jon, wishing you good Dead
Space, good Dead Space 2, or whatever makes

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.780
you happy.
