00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.690
Hi, this is Teresa Chambers, Chief of the
United States Park Police.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:16.119
You're watching This Week at Interior.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.119
THIS WEEK...

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.230
AT INTERIOR...

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.430
No words are greater than those spoken here
by a simple man, born in a log cabin, who

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.460
not only saved the American union but also
came to symbolize its greatest virtues of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.949
humility, honesty, and decency.

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.079
SECRETARY JEWELL WAS AMONG THE THOUSANDS WHO
TRAVELED TO GETTYSBURG PENNSYLVANIA THIS WEEK,

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.940
TO MARK THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S
GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.280
THAT SPEECH, A MERE 272 WORDS AND DELIVERED
IN JUST OVER TWO MINUTES, WAS PART OF THE

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.690
NOVEMBER 1863 CEREMONY DEDICATING THE SOLDIERS
NATIONAL CEMETERY FOR THOSE WHO HAD FALLEN

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.910
IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG SOME FOUR AND
HALF MONTHS EARLIER.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.309
We are reminded of the sacrifice of so many
for freedom.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.820
We are likewise reminded of our long journey,
still on-going, to fulfill the fundamental

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.610
proposition that indeed all men and women
are created equal and deserve the full benefit

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.980
of this freedom that has been purchased at
such great price.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.940
SALLY JEWELL JOINED NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
DIRECTOR JONATHAN JARVIS, PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.540
TOM CORBETT, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTONIN
SCALIA AND OTHER DIGNITARIES TO CONDUCT A

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.410
NATURALIZATION CEREMONY.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.000
SIXTEEN NEW AMERICAN CITIZENS TOOK THEIR OATH
OF ALLEGIANCE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ANNIVERSARY

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
CEREMONY.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.340
FROM THE FIELDS OF PENNSYLVANIA TO THE SHORES
OF SOUTH CAROLINA...

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.530
SECRETARY JEWELL THIS WEEK VISITED THE CAPE
ROMAIN NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE...

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.850
THAT'S WHERE SHE MET WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS
WHO ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO CONSERVE

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.720
NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES OF LONGLEAF PINE
HABITAT IN THE REGION.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.930
SHE CALLED THE EFFORT A MODEL OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE
PARTNERSHIPS, AND CALLED ON CONGRESS TO PASS

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
FULL FUNDING FOR THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION
FUND TO BOLSTER THIS AND OTHER CONSERVATION

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.730
EFFORTS ACROSS THE NATION.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.660
SECRETARY JEWELL THEN GOT A FIRST HAND LOOK
AT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON A 7-MILE

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.140
PATCH OF RAPIDLY ERODING SOUTH CAROLINA COAST
KNOWN AS THE BONEYARD BEACH, ON BULLS ISLAND....A

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.420
ONCE HEALTHY SHORE WITH A NEARBY MARITIME
FOREST, THE IMPACTS OF STRONGER STORMS AND

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.250
RISING OCEAN LEVELS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE TREES,
LITERALLY PULLING THEM OUT TO SEA.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.140
JEWELL SAID THIS REMOTE BEACH IS A STUNNING
EXAMPLE OF HOW RISING SEAS AND CHANGING CLIMATE

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.060
ARE HAVING REAL IMPACTS IN OUR LIFETIME.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.830
THE PRESIDENT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY
IS PAYING BIG DIVIDENDS WHEN IT COMES TO REVENUE...

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.900
THE SECRETARY THIS WEEK ANNOUNCED INTERIOR
HAS DISBURSED 14-POINT-TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.990
TO BENEFIT FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND TRIBAL
GOVERNMENTS IN 2013, THE *SECOND* HIGHEST

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.060
YEAR ON RECORD.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.400
THE REVENUE IS GENERATED BY ENERGY PRODUCTION
ON PUBLIC LANDS AND OFFSHORE WATERS...

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.480
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THE FUNDS TO MEET A
HOST OF NEEDS, ANYTHING FROM SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
TO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, TO WATER CONSERVATION.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.260
AND WHERE IS THE OLDEST SEAWATER ON EARTH?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.320
FROZEN UNDER THE SNOWS OF ANTARCTICA?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.400
LYING DEEP IN A DARK PACIFIC TRENCH?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.599
USGS SCIENTISTS HAVE THE ANSWER.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.010
THE OLDEST SEAWATER THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED
AND DATED SO FAR...

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.130
LIES *BENEATH* THE CHESAPEAKE BAY.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.220
THE ANCIENT SALTY GROUNDWATER, SOME 100 TO
145 MILLION YEARS OLD, WAS TRAPPED HALF A

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.130
MILE DEEP UNDERGROUND AFTER A COSMIC COLLISION
WITH A COMET OR ASTEROID ABOUT 35 MILLION

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.569
YEARS AGO, IN WHAT WAS *THEN* THE NORTH ATLANTIC
SEA...

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.930
THAT IMPACT BLASTED A HOLE IN THE EARTH'S
CRUST 56-MILES WIDE, AND HELPED FORM WHAT

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.930
IS NOW THE CHESAPEAKE.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.180
THE USGS STUDY APPEARS IN THE NOVEMBER 14TH
ISSUE OF NATURE MAGAZINE.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.840
WE'RE OFF NEXT WEEK FOR THE HOLIDAY...AND
WE WISH YOU THE HAPPIEST OF THANKSGIVINGS...THAT'S

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.590
THIS WEEK, AT INTERIOR.
