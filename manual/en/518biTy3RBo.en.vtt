00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.920
Smaller, lighter, and twice as powerful, GoPro's
Wi-Fi enabled, HERO3 cameras are the world's

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.349
most versatile cameras yet.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.770
With three different models to choose from,
including the feature loaded HERO3 Black Edition,

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.109
the GoPro HERO3 is ready to deliver the best
action footage and photos around.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.530
All three HERO3 cameras, white, silver, and
black editions have built-in Wi-Fi, enabling

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.800
compatibility with our Wi-Fi Remote and free
GoPro App and come with basic mounting hardware

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.660
so you can use your camera right out of the
box.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.100
The built-in ProTune mode enables a flatter
color profile and higher bit rate to match

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.190
your post production workflow.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.559
The HERO3 Black Edition comes with the Wi-Fi
remote, letting you control your GoPro camera

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.010
and its settings from up to 600 feet away.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.150
The rugged, waterproof housing comes with
two different door options.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.240
The Standard Backdoor is perfect for general
use, but most important when using underwater

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.770
or in wet environments, allowing the housing
to be water tight in depths of up to 180 feet.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.550
The Skeleton Backdoor offers better sound
quality, by allowing more audio to reach the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.330
camera's microphone.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:31.110
Use this backdoor only when damage from sand,
excessive dirt, or water is not a risk.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.700
To start using your GoPro HERO3 camera, you'll
need a Class 10 or higher micro SD card.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.770
To get the best performance from your HERO3
cameras, make sure you are using the most

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200
current camera software.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.700
Download the latest version from gopro.com/update.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.640
The HERO3 camera housing latch can be opened,
closed, and locked easily.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.170
To open, grip the housing with your left hand.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.110
Using your right hand, pinch your fingers
together and pull upward.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.119
Make sure the inside of the housing is clean,
especially around the lens and seal area and

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.240
place the camera in the housing.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:20.060
To close properly, be sure the groove sections
of the latch arm and the Backdoor are hooked.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.120
To install the battery, slide the indentation
button away from the battery cover by gently

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.560
applying pressure.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.290
This will allow the door to pop out, exposing
the battery bay.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.790
Insert the battery by aligning the connections
on the battery and the camera.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.500
Use your thumbs to apply gentle pressure until
the battery is seated firmly in place.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.490
To remove the battery, just use the pull tab.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.610
Your HERO3's battery is partially charged
right out of the box, and it's okay to use

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.360
it right away.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.460
To fully charge the battery, use the included
cable to connect the camera to a computer

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.510
or USB power supply.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.440
When charging, the GoPro's LED lights will
remain on.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.380
When the LEDs turn off, your camera battery
is fully charged.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.550
There are three buttons to know on HERO3 cameras.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.180
The power/mode button on the front turns the
camera on and off and allows the user to cycle

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.550
through camera modes or menus.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.980
The button on the top is the shutter/select
button.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.430
It starts and stops recording, takes photos,
or makes selections in the menus.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.310
The button on the side of the camera is the
Wi-Fi on/off button.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.100
This button is used to turn the Wi-Fi signal
on or off by pressing and holding the button

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.820
for three seconds.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.430
To quickly enter the Wi-Fi settings menu,
to connect to the Wi-Fi remote or to smartphones

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.440
and tablets via the GoPro App, simply press
the Wi-Fi button one time when Wi-Fi is on.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.470
The HERO3 has five LED indicator lights.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.390
There are two on the front.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.440
The top one blinks blue indicating that Wi-Fi
is activated.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.890
The bottom LED blinks red indicating video
recording and photo capture.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.000
The other three LEDs on the top, bottom, and
back of the camera, will blink both red and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.340
blue to signal recording and Wi-Fi status.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.389
To power on the HERO3, press and release the
power/mode button.

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.220
The red indicator lights will flash three
times and you'll hear three beeps.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.030
To power off, press and hold the power/mode
button for two seconds.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.130
A series of flashes and seven beeps indicate
the camera is turned off.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.990
To access camera modes, press the power/mode
to cycle through modes and the shutter select

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.350
to begin recording in the mode you want to
use.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.410
In video mode, the HERO3 Black Edition captures
video in stunning 1080p at 60 frames per second,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:07.440
1440p at 48 frames per second, and even offers
4K and 2.7K resolutions for true cinema quality.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.050
In photo mode, the HERO3 Black Edition takes
5, 7, and 12 megapixel photos with optional

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.470
photo modes like 30 photos per second burst,
and continuous photo.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:29.690
Timelapse captures single photos at user selected
intervals up to one every half second.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.180
For playback with the HDMI connection, you

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.360

playback.
