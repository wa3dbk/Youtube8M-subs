00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.140
Hi I'm Shaun Schaefer on behalf of Expert
Village. And today we're going to learn the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.170
basics in Rock drumming. I like to call it
Rock drumming 101 the basics. So now that

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.830
we've been playing our Eighth notes on the
Hi Hat. One and two and three and four and.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.690
Let's make some noise. Have some fun. Let's
add the Snare drum in on beats two and four

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.740
while we're playing along with the Hi Hat.
O.k.? So let's do a bar of eight notes on

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.220
the Hi Hat and then we'll on the second bar
we'll throw in the Snare drum on two and four.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:47.149
O.k.? Here we go. One and two and three and
four and. One and two and three and four and.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:01:02.760
One and two and three and four and. One and
two and three and four and. One and two and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:14.320
three and four and. One and two and three
and four and. Now if that's too fast like

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.530
I said before. You can always bring it back
down. No sense in playing it too fast when

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.720
you can't play it because you really can't
play it. It's not helping you out. Let's slow

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.790
it down. Let see what it would sound like
a lot slower. One and two and three and four

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:47.560
and. One and two and three and four and. O.k.?
So, that's what it's like slower. Keep practicing.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.840
Keep going through the motions and keep getting
used to playing the eight notes on the Hi

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.790
Hat and the Snare drum on two and four. O.k.?
It's going to take more than just running

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.540
through it a couple times. O.k.? Keep practicing,
keep going and let's take a look at what we've

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.050
got next.
