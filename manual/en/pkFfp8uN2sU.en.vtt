00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.340
How do we feed our boa constrictor, and what
do we feed our boa

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.880
constrictor?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.790
From the time they are born to the time that
they're old

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.160
senior citizens, boa constrictors are carnivorous.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.990
Because these guys are
carnivorous and because we need to be able

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.210
to find a common food source,
the best thing to do is we all will feed them

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.580
mice.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.119
A well-fed mouse is
fully nutritional for these guys.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.800
They eat the whole mouse.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250
When they're
smaller, you can feed what's called Pinkies,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.269
which is a newborn mouse.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.380
The
way you figure out how much you should feed,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.000
or what you should feed, is
dependent on the size of the snake.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.440
You should never feed anything larger
than the largest diameter of the snake.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.020
That's a good rule.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.610
How do we feed them?

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.270
Most of the time, these guys will take care
of it on

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.750
their own, but when you get your new snake,
you have to remember that he's

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.920
nervous.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.030
Let him enjoy his terrarium and get comfortable
with his

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.770
environment for several days before you try
to feed him.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.810
Be very conscious
of where you feed him, because if you have

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.200
sand or a substrate, woodchips,
which you really should never use, anything

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.020
that can stick to the bait;
when he eats it, he'll also eat that substrate

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.829
and it can cause
obstructions, and that is very, very serious.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.011
Sometimes, if the substrate in your terrarium
is such that it sticks, you

00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:35.829
can do one of several things: You can either
put the bait in a small cup

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.750
and bury it down to the level of the terrarium,
and the snake will come and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.750
get it.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.950
Or move the snake out of the terrarium and
feed it in another spot.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.399
Sometimes, especially as they get larger,
that's a good thing.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.750
Because a
snake learns when it's going to eat, and sometimes

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.729
its energy level can get
up.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.549
When you're reaching into the terrarium, it's
thinking it's time to eat

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.210
and there's a greater chance that you may
get nipped.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.960
How do we feed them?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.670
Snakes like this; they really hunt more from
smell,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.630
touch, and heat sensation than they do vision.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.500
Their tongues, as they come
out, will actually take little particles,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.980
and when it comes back into the
mouth, will contact what's called the vomeronasal

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.599
apparatus or Jacobson's
organ.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.940
That helps them get a sensation of, or olfactoin
of, what's out

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.450
there.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.690
Then they have these small little pores called
pit glands around

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.540
their lips.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.470
What they do is they actually sense infrared
heat.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.420
It's a
thermal regulatory thing to where they actually

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420
can see heat.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.740
It's almost
like the Predator in the movies, where he

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.360
saw the little red thing.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.040
That's
exactly what they're doing; they're picking

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.450
up the heat and they'll strike
at it.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.239
You never want to hold your mouse.

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.860
Sometimes it needs to move a little bit.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.129
What you do is get longer tongs.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.790
For your smaller snakes, about 10 to 12
inches is fine.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.510
For your bigger ones; about 16 inches.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.950
You'll put the mouse
in the tongs, present it headfirst to this

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.730
guy.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.200
Sometimes wiggling it is
good.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.720
Sometimes when you present it to them, they'll
know immediately what

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.250
to do and they'll eat.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.170
Sometimes you'll get a snake that is used
to eating

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.329
one thing, and here you are trying to feed
another.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.970
It's a good idea, say
if this guy was used to eating anything else,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.780
a bird, or something of that
nature, what you do is actually rub the scent

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.709
of the bait that they're used
to eating onto the mouse, and then present

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.709
it to them.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.530
Through that little
tongue and the Jacobson's organ, they will

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.590
sense the scent of their older
bait and they'll take the mouse.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.849
That's how you feed your boa constrictor.
