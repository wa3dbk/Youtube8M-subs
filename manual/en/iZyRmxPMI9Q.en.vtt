00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Recording your work is a really important thing to do.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.000
Once you've sold it, you'll never see it again so it's good for you to have a record of it

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.000
so you remember what you did and your finished outcome.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.000
So I'm going to talk to Mark who has some advice for us on photographing artwork.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.000
Most people use digital cameras to photograph their work these days.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:37.000
One of the most important things to remember is take your photographs outside on a sunny day.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.000
You might think it's better to have a big studio set up with lighting and tripods and flashes

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.000
but digital cameras work best when they have natural sunlight on a nice, fine, sunny day.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.000
So try and find a good day, which is fairly rare in Wellington, when it's not too windy

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.000
especially if you're working with paper artworks.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.000
Set it up outside with a nice, white backdrop

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:08.060
E.g. put a large piece of white paper on the fence and set your artwork up against that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
nice and straight either in direct sunlight or just out of direct sunlight.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.060
Make sure there are no trees shading it or blades of grass over the front of it causing shadows.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.060
You can take your photographs in those conditions. Thats one of the most important tips to start with.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's good to know that you don't always need to have access to a studio.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.000
That's right. Secondly if you're using a digital camera make sure the settings are changed accordingly.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.000
When you're taking photographs of everyday things you'll probably have your settings adjusted for average sized photographs.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.000
You want to set it so the pictures are the largest available quality

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
the biggest pictures possible that your camera can take.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Often a digital camera will have an "L" for large or a high quality setting

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.060
so make sure the quality is the best and the size is the largest.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You can also adjust the lighting settings.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.000
Some cameras have automatic functions and that's fine.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.060
So make sure you change it to automatic, or change it to cloudy.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Even on a sunny day the cloudy setting is pretty good.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.000
Good advice.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.000
Once you've got your picture set up on the wall or the fence or wherever,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.000
make sure you're standing absolutely, directly in front of it.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.000
You don't want to be standing to the side, or have your camera pointing down at it.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.000
The camera should be directly in line with the centre of the picture

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.000
so your painting is not tilted compared to where you are.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060
Angles are very important.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
When you're ready to take the shot, it's common for people to stand as close as they can

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.000
and have the camera zoomed out so it tends to create a bowing effect on the edges of the picture.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.000
So when you're ready take 1 step back and zoom in a little bit with your camera to square the picture up.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.000
Make sure on your viewfinder that the painting is nice and square, if it's a painting of course.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.000
So make sure it's square and filling as much of the screen as possible.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
When you're ready to shoot, take a couple of shots.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.060
With digital cameras you're not paying for the film anymore so you can take as many photos as possible.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So take a couple of shots and review it, check it's in focus and you've got it nice and square.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.000
Make any adjustments you want to make at the time.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.060
That's right, and when you're ready to shoot take 10 - 15 shots.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Then you can choose the best out of 10 - 15.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.000
It's quite surprising, 1 or 2 might be a little bit off.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.000
A couple might be out of focus because you're moving your hand a bit.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.060
But you can choose the best out of 10 - 15.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Sounds like my photography.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.000
They're the main tips. As long as you've got your camera set up nicely

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.000
your picture's nice and straight, and in good lighting conditions

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.000
you should be able to get a pretty good shot.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.000
You work with the conditions and the tools you have available to you.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.060
So if you have a tripod you can use it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you can't take photographs on a fine sunny day and you're forced to take it inside then so be it.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.000
But make sure you adjust your camera settings to suit

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.000
and make sure that if it is inside, you have as much natural light as possible.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.000
I would strongly advise not using a flash on a digital camera.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.060
It's much better to set your camera up on a tripod

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.000
or to set it up sitting on a desk or even lean a broomstick against the camera and hold it still.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.000
That's much, much better than using the flash on a camera.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.000
I never had much luck using a flash. It tends to wash the colour out.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.000
They're great for parties but that's about it.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.060
If you want to frame your work make sure you take photos of it before it gets glass in front of it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Thanks Mark for your really good advice.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060
You're welcome.
