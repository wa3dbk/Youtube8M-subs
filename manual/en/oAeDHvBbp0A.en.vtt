Stylist Profile
David Benrud 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.859
Hi, I am David Benrud, and this is my home in Minneapolis.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:16.859
I'm a stylist and I've always focused on 
homes and interiors, furniture,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.379
my home is kind of like my lab for the work 
that I do.

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:26.379
My own personal aesthetic and the aesthetic 
of Pottery Barn are very similar,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:32.379
and that's made my work really enjoyable, 
and the line between

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.379
work and fun is often blurred.  

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:42.379
My partner Greg and I wanted to design a house 
that really maximized natural light, 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.379
in the living room you have morning light, 
in the dining room afternoon light,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.379
and in the evening in the kitchen, 
um, you get the last, the sunset. 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.379
One of my favorite things in the springtime 
is just opening everything up,

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.379
We chose kind of a neutral color palette, 
and kind of a simple

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:15.379
approach in the interior. The neutrals 
and the white and the plaster walls help

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:21.379
to expand the space and create a flow 
in a smaller home. 

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:29.379
We tried to put our most money into the 
broad, large surfaces, 

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:34.379
we chose materials that would 
show wear and get better with time,

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:41.379
like the floor is a recycled red and white oak 
from a warehouse in Georgia,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:45.379
and I think it added kind of instant character to 
the home.

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:53.379
In the kitchen I wanted to have no upper cabinets, 
and open shelving,

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.379
so that when we have guests over they can 

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.379
participate with setting the table 
or putting the dishes away or, 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:04.379
if they just need a glass f water, it's kind 
of at hand,

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:11.379
Being a stylist, I love objects, and decoration, 
and  

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.379
living in a smaller home, I've had to limit that and

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.379
be more edited. In the living room, we've solved that by 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.379
doing built in shelves, and it gives me a place to 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.379
display collections and experiment with 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.379
decorating and the objects that I love.
