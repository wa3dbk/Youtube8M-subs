00:00:03.662 --> 00:00:05.662
Don't worry, this'll be worth it.

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:22.193
Yeah~

00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:31.763
Ok, yeah, before we begin presentation, um, I just want to explain my policy.

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:34.227
It's very simple.

00:00:31.896 --> 00:00:33.168
It's very simple.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:35.393
Be respectful. Ok?

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:43.658
Please listen and don't be disrespectful. Talking while someone's presenting is disrespectful, ok?

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.003
It takes a lot a-it takes a lot for some people to 
 get up and speak in front of a group. OK?

00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:57.434
Now, let's say Suzy Q in class here keeps talking while Greg's trying 
 to present, every time Suzy Q's disrespectful she loses a point.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.871
Ok, I take that point deduction from her presentation.

00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:01.871
Well what if I had a question?

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:05.064
No, there's a difference between interacting and being disturbing.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.269
So, you know, if you have something really neat you'd like to 
 ask Greg, I encourage interacting. I just don't want distracting.

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:13.859
OK?

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:14.918
We good?

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.296
OK.

00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:20.640
Whatta you wanna me to do advance the slides?

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:21.593
-Ah-a, I'll run it for ya.

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:23.395
Just tell me when you wanna turn the page.

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:25.620
Now you drew that correct, Greg?

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:28.587
Yeah, that's, uh, that was actually drawn and worked on in GIMP.

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:29.753
OK.

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.673
Now, my name does not need said.

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:37.488
Mostly because you just read the title screen so it'd be kinda redundant.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.380
Common kn- common known or unknown fact, I was 
 not born in actually Columbus but in-

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:45.120
WARREN

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.200
a small, I don't know wh- the proper word to 
 call it. Uh, I wanna say white trash.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.110
Hahahawww...

00:01:51.794 --> 00:01:55.720
I don't know but it's just a very small town like north-east.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:57.520
-Eh, of Ohio. Near Pennsylvania.

00:01:59.317 --> 00:01:59.640
Uh-

00:02:00.377 --> 00:02:00.910
Let's see...

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.930
Oh yes, as I said white trash, moved over to Columbus 'cause...

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.640
cause... I wanna be white, heh... Not trash, heh.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.400
So, before I move over to the next, I-

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.790
Wh- wh- Hey, white trash means poor?

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:16.060
Yes, we were poor.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:21.570
No, let's hang on. Let's stop and refrain from 
 nasty words about people less better off.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.740
Yeah, so...

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.400
Before, Tolles, I went to Dublin Coffman, now-

00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:29.730
Say what you want, say what you want,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.680
I will agree with you.

00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:32.910
There is a REASON I'm here.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.600
A very good reason

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.190
A little off- off topic.

00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:36.940
Yeah...

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:43.610
Wait, something's not going through there, and I apparently 
 screwed up somehow, how did that happen?

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:45.410
You want me go back to the title?

00:02:44.883 --> 00:02:47.740
I don't know, I, uh, I did read everything-already went over all of that.

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:48.380
OK.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:57.070
Now, I'm outta the beginning slide and everything else I've done is either E-legal or uninteresting, 
 I mean when I'm showing (the fuck???) so that's not gonna work. Heh! 

00:02:57.387 --> 00:02:59.510
So, I decided to go with actually hobbies.

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:07.350
Now, well yeah, writing is nice. Let's say there's a person, you don't like.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.860
Now, you have two options: You could... beat him with a whacking stick!

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:13.920
Ah,ah,ahh-!

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:14.240
Heh, I know~

00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:20.590
ORRRRR! You turn him into an antagonist have him, 
 been, have your protagonist beat him up! Huh!

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:22.400
Very ruude...

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:26.320
Better way of expression without actually doing anything illegal...

00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:30.870
Now, as for the writing style which I have pick, 

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:35.000
It's got, I sorta got a whimsically serious kinda thing...

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.240
I don't know anything to compare to that anyone 
 here will get (the fuck???) and so...

00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:45.280
Yeah, I mean it would be creepy like dark fantasy, or science fiction.

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:52.490
And, wu-yeah, whimsical seriousness is contradictory, possibly can't 
 work, but if you can execute it:

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.020
Works Great!

00:03:55.774 --> 00:04:03.830
And, the story type I've been working on so far, just, 
 I ah-know the concepts are... doing pretty well so far.

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:08.070
I've got allegories, which I think is basically a big, horrible metaphor, heh!

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:14.000
Insane what-if scenarios of, like, fu, future, our future, like, aliens and stuff

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:24.170
And, there are situations that you actually don't expect to happen, but could, 
 (the fuck???), and violence, people stabbing each other for example, heh.

00:04:24.703 --> 00:04:28.300
Now, (the fuck???), I, I'm, I don't even 
 know if I'm doing this right, heh!

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:30.110
I'm restarting it right there?

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:31.800
No, that was the big green thing there.

00:04:33.922 --> 00:04:35.920
How am I doing? Heh! (the fuck???) Heh.

00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:38.050
Ok. Moving along, here we go--

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:42.500
Now, unfortunately my drawings don't always turn out so 
 well. Looks like something outta a children's cartoon.

00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:51.190
Which really, I mean now, yes, it's nice to be able to 
 draw something you wanna hug, pet, cuddle with... or whatever.

00:04:52.148 --> 00:04:57.230
But, sometimes, you sometimes, you wanna draw somebody killing another.

00:04:58.188 --> 00:04:58.720
Sometimes!

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.780
Just when you're mad, heh! 

00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:01.680
Now,

00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.560
I al-- drawing is like a big hobby, 
 I kinda do a lot at home.

00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:08.780
And som- and some it gets done in class.

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:11.330
Done, hopefully, which I do less often.

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.110
And, everything I draw tend to be a little whimsical, I'm not 
 really a big fan of drawing humans because we've got:

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.060
arms,

00:05:19.064 --> 00:05:20.120
legs,

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:20.650
a head;

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.350
really nothing to us, heh!

00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:29.020
So, it's more fun to draw dragons and birds 
 and 'Gatosaurs' which, that is... Not mine.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.260
Ah, that is-that come from another like a manga book or something like that?

00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:34.640
Ah uh no, it's a friend of mine's.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.640
Ah! OK.

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:40.890
And, you know yep, I tried drawing a visual 
 representation of mankind, I got this! Heh!

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:41.850
How did that happen?!

00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:44.390
Ah, ok. Interesting, My Little Pony...

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:52.970
Now, the present drawings are productive so consequently, not relaxing...not fun...heh...

00:05:53.714 --> 00:05:56.040
It-it's just more interesting alternative...

00:05:56.575 --> 00:06:01.980
Now, television is relaxing, you've got TV shows of all kinds.

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:11.090
All kinds which I like. Leverage, Walking Dead, Falling Skies, Burn Notice, 
 Doctor Who-big one big one-. The only show one you've got:

00:06:12.152 --> 00:06:15.220
A nurse, punching Adolf Hitler!

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:17.030
Where else you get that?!

00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:19.040
WHERE ELSE do you get that?!

00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:23.170
Careful, don't poke me now.

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:25.400
Also, video games are relaxing.

00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:35.250
Jumping on Goombas, beating dead wise dragons, collecting 
 rings, eating (the fuck???), uh, shooting, russians...

00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:44.790
going to... the ruined city of rapture, massacring the most 
 horrific monsters I've ever seen, click button, NECROMORPHS, heh.

00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:51.570
That's all very re-that's all relaxing, it eases the nerves.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:59.100
And then we have, the Internet, which no actually I already say 
 it just pretty much covered the previous paragraph, so that's everything.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.580
And now to wrap this up.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.780
Now you have learned hobbies, where I'm from..., and, all that.

00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:21.670
But if you weren't paying attention, I was born in Warren, I moved to Columbus, I make stories, there, 
 is you, they must be more interesting than the real world. Come on reality and television? Really? Heh.

00:07:21.878 --> 00:07:36.180
I like drawing as well, usually what comes to mind: Birds, dragons, maybe human ones, like I, I drew 
 Famine the, horseman of, yeah, no, Famine the Horseman, Black Horseman-based off the book I was reading.

00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:41.270
And violent video games, violent television, and the Glorious Violently Internet. Heh!
