00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.010
As far as housing goes for your leopard gecko,
when purchasing your leopard gecko's vivarium

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.510
you're going to want to get probably a standard
ten gallon aquarium. If you're housing just

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.939
one leopard gecko. The aquariums work very
well for this species of lizard. I've found

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.949
it to be much more convenient than any type
of wire cage. You'll never find anything wired

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.010
that is small enough to house a hatchling.
Now a standard ten gallon is the right size

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.640
for one leopard gecko but if you plan on getting
a pair or even three, you're probably going

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.930
to want to go with a twenty long, which is
a twenty gallon aquarium, it's just elongated

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.170
rather than tall. So this is something that
you can find at your local pet store. Also,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.880
these are desert animals, so the substrate
you use, you're going to probably want to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.199
use a sand. This is something I really like.
It's a calcium substrate. This calcium substrate

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.579
is one of my favorite products to use because
it is made from a calcium base. It's easily

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.590
digestible. Not always in the smaller hatchlings,
when you're having a very new born leopard

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.260
gecko you may want to try to use newspaper
or paper towels, at least till they get a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.920
little bigger. The calcium substrate can sometimes
cause impaction from ingesting it, and it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.420
can also build up on the toes too. So that's
something you might want to watch for. You

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.610
can also use a sand-soil mix. Some people
like to mix it together in one. I like to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.951
have it separated a little bit. What I've
done here, is I've put the sand over here

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:44.450
on this side so we have the dry desert area
over here, and then over here I have the soil-bark

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.590
mix, and this holds moisture really well.
So I'm able to mist this and give him a little

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.700
bit of humidity every now and then. As far
as shelters go, you're going to want to provide

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.200
him a dry shelter and an area where they can
go to get some humidity. Which is this shelter

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.230
I have over here. So I've got two different
shelters going, and this is something that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.480
she can move in and out of as she feels necessary.
A lot of people like to use orchid bark, which

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.709
is also something that you can find at your
local pet store. Orchid bark is a very fine

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.989
soil. This is something that mixes very well
with the sand and also holds moisture really

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.189
well. So its a good option if you do want
to use the soil-sand mixture. Just remember,

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.140
if you do use the orchid bark you're going
to want to rinse it with some cool water first,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.680
because it is very dusty. This will eliminate
the dust. Then you're going to want to spread

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.640
it out and let it air dry, and then it will
be ready to go into your terrarium. Now I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.280
also have the plants in here and the background.
This terrarium I created to create more of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.609
a naturalistic design. A naturalistic design
will provide for a lot of different behaviors.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:10.889
If you have a simple set up in your terrarium,
it's going to be more of a simple behavior.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.940
Your leopard gecko is not going to display
very many different types of behavior if it

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.719
doesn't have many things in its environment
to interact with. In here I've created a little

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.280
bit of an elevated site, with those flat rocks.
Not only does it provide shelter but it also

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.560
provides the elevated site there. This stick
I have in here is actually not real. It's

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.549
made from a rubbery material with a wire inside.
I picked that up at my local pet store, and

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.829
I like it because you can bend it to shape
however you would like. I've put it to where

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.970
the leopard gecko is able to climb up on it,
and is able to climb up to here if she feels

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.930
like doing so. I've also got decorations in
here, like the skull. That's more for my appreciation,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.090
I like that way it looks, but it also provides
a sort of hiding spot for my gecko. Over here

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.049
I keep her water dish, and I also have a thermometer
in the back there so I can monitor the temperature

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.980
of her cage to make sure that she is able
to thermo-regulate. Now you want to make sure

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.400
that your terrarium is well ventilated. You
don't want excessive moisture, even though

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.730
it is suggested that you mist a small area,
you're going to want to make sure that you

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.200
don't have excessive moisture. Leopard gecko's
feces have a lot of uric acid in them, and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.700
when the uric acid mixes with water it forms
ammonia, which can cause almost like burns

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.500
on their skin. It can irritate their eyes
and can cause respiratory infections as well.
