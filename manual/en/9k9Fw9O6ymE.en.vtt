00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.300
this is an interesting study from the
University College in London

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.129
7 or more portions of fruit and
vegetables a day

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.920
supposedly reduce your risk of death at
any particular point in time

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.250
by 42 percent this is the first study

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.609
that links fruit and vegetable
consumption with

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.699
all-cause cancer and heart releases

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.760
a heart disease related deaths in

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.199
a a nationally represented population

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.590
so researchers use the Health Survey for
England to study the eating habits have

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.690
over 65,000 people

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.540
that were representative of the English
population between 2001

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
and 2013 and they found that the more
fruits and vegetables they ate the less

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.600
likely they were to die

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.510
at whatever age they were at the time

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.230
eating seven or more portions reduces
the specific risks I've death by cancer

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.160
and heart disease

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.019
by 25 and 31 percent respectively the
research also showed that vegetables

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.530
have significantly higher health
benefits and then

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
route we have to approach all of these
individual studies that claim

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.820
these very specific benefits with
skepticism

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.659
are we looking at that date let's look
at this to a couple love ones is number

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.020
one

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.180
are we looking at causation a
correlation here is it because if the

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.290
consumption of fruits and vegetables

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.060
that those who have more fruits and
vegetables in their diet seem to have a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.170
lower risk of death

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.240
or is it that people who in other ways

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.630
lead healthier lives also tended to be
consuming more fruits and vegetables

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.030
one person making an effort

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.570
to eat more fruits and vegetables is
likely to be a person who number one

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.350
may be more educated who number two may
have the financial means to be consuming

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.479
more fruits and vegetables

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.470
and those things correlate with being
healthier in general

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.000
so I don't know that we can say
definitively based on this one study

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.509
that if you start eating a bag over

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.880
persimmons every day you're going to
live longer

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.310
now I you're right white I like to think
that act considering to studying

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.150
over 65,000 people yeah I but there's
some validity to this and of course I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.739
don't think either of us would argue

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.730
eating more fruits and vegetables are as
part of your daily diet will have a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.570
a huge health benefit will I think that
we don't know that necessarily from this

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.530
study the other

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.090
the other question I have with the study
is what is the baseline right all these

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.790
numbers

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.340
talk about your risk of death relative
to having less than one serving of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.690
fruits and vegetables

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.959
each day and that relative said that

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.030
increases in fruit and vegetable
consumption reduce your risk death but

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.400
thats the question we have to ask are
most people

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.549
eating less than one serving have both
fruits and vegetables combined per day

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.989
I know we all probably know people who
don't like vegetables and probably don't

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:55.940
eat too many fruits

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.620
but is it really true that the baseline
here should be compared to eating none

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.630
of those things

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.780
people who were eating no fruits or
vegetables

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.660
each day probably are in very specific
situations where they're unhealthy for

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.620
other reasons

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.220
maybe we should also be looking at one
or two servings as a baseline which

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.910
would radically change the numbers

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.199
that's true I guess what is what is the
average what do most people consume

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.989
on any given day I don't really know and
remember the last thing we also should

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.109
be considering is even if we were able
to establish causation beyond a

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.139
reasonable doubt

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.139
at what point does adding more fruits
and vegetables to your diet

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
not provide any additional benefit if
you're already having

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.669
15 servings will having an additional
three

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.680
continue to reduce your risk of death we
we get to a point of diminishing

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.359
marginal utility

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:52.620
and that also needs to be considered so
an interesting study

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.660
but many questions that we need to ask
about it
