00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.170
Today I’m going to show you the basics of
installing a light bar on your Impreza WRX.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.930
I will link this particular light bar and
all the tools you’ll need in the video description

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.590
below so check that out.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.090
Let’s get started.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.990
So installing the light is pretty straightforward.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.070
It comes with some mounting hardware that
just bolts into the side of the lamp.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.720
And then we have a screw going through the
plastic of the bumper.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.140
And then I also put a metal plate on the other
side of the bumper that the bolt goes through.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.530
So that’s not ever going to pull through
the bumper on the back side.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.160
And the light is light enough that it’s
not going to cause the bumper to sag or anything

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.190
which is nice.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.550
On the other side of this nut is another washer
and a locking washer and then a wing nut on

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.060
the top and that’s what keeps the light
on both sides attached to this bumper.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.750
It’s pretty secure.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.950
So the wiring harness is actually pretty simple.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.230
We’re going to start with this end right
here that connects to the battery.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.301
We have the red cable that goes to the positive
terminal of the battery, the black cable that

00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.920
goes to the negative terminal.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.220
Then this is the relay.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.420
This will just bolt next to the battery on
any bolt that you can find.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.840
And this is where the fuse is.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.340
You want to take out the fuse while you are
working and installing all the lights and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.490
stuff so that the fuse doesn’t trip itself
on accident.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.690
You can just flip up that little latch and
the fuse comes out.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.630
Now the rest of the wiring harness, it kind
of splits off into a “Y” and goes two

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
directions.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.530
We’re going to start with the black side
first.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.130
This particular wiring harness can be used
for two LED lights.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.380
So you have a black and a red here which connects
to one LED light, and a black and a red there

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.640
that connect to another LED light.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.509
But since we’re only installing one light
we’re only going to use one connection and

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.320
then we’ll just electrical tape the other
one to keep water off of it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.990
Now the other side of the wiring harness,
which is this white cable, goes towards the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.290
switch.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.720
So it can disconnect here which makes it easier
when we go through the firewall, and I’ll

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.860
show you that in just a second.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.289
And then we have the switch itself.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.870
The switch is what goes through the firewall
inside of the car and that will turn the LED

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.480
light on and off.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.900
These other cables that connect to the switch
as well; this one is just going to screw onto

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.590
any old bolt underneath the hood.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.580
This is a ground.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.150
And then the red cable does need to go to
the positive terminal of the battery.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.140
So I just did a test wire really quick; I
took the red from the switch and plugged it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.051
in to the red terminal of the battery, and
the red from the, you know, right next to

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:43.050
the relay…put the black from the relay onto
the negative right there.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.660
And then from the switch side, just because
we’re testing it out and I haven’t put

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.890
it into the firewall yet, I took the negative
and just grounded it onto any old bolt.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.510
And then the switch right here you can see
that the LEDs light up which is showing that

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.420
the switch is getting power.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.769
And then I can press it and we got the LED
light.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.340
It turns on and off.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.660
So the light is connected.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.440
I’m shining it over at our neighbor’s
house and it lights up the entire building

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.209
all the way to the top of the roof.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.819
It’s pretty intense.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.600
So I’m going to talk about the wiring for
just a second.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.490
So remember the center part of the harness
with the relay and the two connections for

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.490
the battery?

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.060
So this is here, and it “Y’s” off and
we have the switch wires that are just wrapped

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.810
around the edge of the car.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.060
And then there’s a hole right back here.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.650
So the metal panel between your engine compartment
and the cab of your car is called a firewall,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.489
and there’s always a hole somewhere in your
firewall where wires can go through.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.290
So there’s a little rubber piece right here
that we’ve just kind of pushed down and

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.080
then fed the wires through it.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.050
And sometimes they’re on the other side
by the driver’s side or the steering wheel.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.480
In this case it was on the passenger side.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.650
So we put the switch wires through there and
then we’re just going to ground it off of

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.329
one of these same silver bolts that I did
before.

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.269
Going back to the battery, the second part
of the “Y” is over here.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.680
And so we have one connection for an LED light
bar here because this is a dual harness.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.120
Fed the wires here next to the radiator, and
then we’re going to take these wires and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.800
drop them down and connect them to the LED
light bar itself.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.250
And it’s wires are going up there as well,
through the grill.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.780
These are the connections on the wiring harness
that are supposed to clip into the light bar

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.910
wires.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.160
And so I bought these right here and they
attach them to the light bar wires.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.900
So if you can see them down there coming up
through the front bumper of the car.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.470
They’ll just plug into these and the light
bar will be connected to the wiring harness.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.690
Now the switch right here, since it is coming
from the passenger side of the firewall, we

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:58.290
just routed it underneath the dashboard, behind
it, and underneath this plastic part right

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.360
here.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.830
And now every time we can just press the button
while sitting in the driver’s seat.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.900
So it’s easily accessible.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.190
So we’re going to test the bar right now.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.850
So this is just the regular headlights that
are on on the car.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.820
And then this is with the LED light bar on.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.120
You can see how it lights up the trees in
the background.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.010
And then turn on your brights really quick.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.210
And that is with the brights on.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.160
And turn the LED off.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.140
And those are the different lights.
