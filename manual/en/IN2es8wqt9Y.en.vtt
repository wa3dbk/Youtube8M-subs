00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.410
TV is a new game.  It's about finding the content at the time you want to watch it,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.679
on whatever screen you want to watch it,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.039
and I think this is a really the challenge
to find a user experience that

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.149
attracts people to buy the service and
that's why it's important to conduct

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.980
consumer research and that's what we
have ConsumerLabs,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.050
to find out what customers all over the world
are asking for.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.600
We use the consumer knowledge in order
to base Ericsson's products and services

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.510
on real consumer behaviors and needs.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.780
We also help our customers
understand their customers providing

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.800
the best possible TV and video solutions.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.690
The 2012 study was carried out in 
thirteen different

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
markets with thirteen thousand
respondents: that's representative for

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170
475 million consumers.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.230
First of all,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.670
the three most important consumer trends is the increase in on-demand, streaming

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.409
and time-shift behaviors among consumers.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.250
Secondly we can see that social
behavior and how that relates to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.000
TV and Video - people chatting at the same
time, sharing their

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.350
views over social networks.
Third, the companion devices on the second screens

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.880
being able to watch when you want, where
you want also

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.270
and watching on several different screens
at the same time.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.350
User-experience design

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.500
is the most important part.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.299
We know that.  We know that they way we
consume whatever service on whatever

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.100
screen we want to have

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.530
a very easily understandable, intuitive, attractive user-experience.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.200
We worked together with Bentley University, 
the world-leading university

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.500
in usability

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.320
and user-experience design.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.270
User-experience is at the heart, it's absolutely at the heart

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.970
of technology.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.319
I love to work with Ericsson because it's an organization that really values

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.389
user-experience and is trying to take
it to the next level -  it's not just about

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.969
the usability and can people actually use it,

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.909
but it's it's everything else that goes
along with it right, it's the

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.749
delight of the customers, it's helping

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.689
people work more efficiently.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.639
It's understanding their engagement

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.819
and they're really asking to me some of the most

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.819
interesting, cutting-edge user-experience
questions from any client that we're working with.

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.759
Our customers expect us to be innovative

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:50.349
and evolve the user-experience all the time.
The user-experience for them is key to

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.650
attract customers to buy their services.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.459
Our Multiscreen TV solution and it's user-experience - it's flexible, it's modular,

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.799
it's intuitive,

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.919
it's a triple award-winning solution.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.769
It's a fantastic product,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.589
and i'm proud of it.

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.159
 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.929
The Ericsson Multiscreen client is designed

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:21.219
and built for the modern TV consumer.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.509
It doesn't matter if you're using the TV,

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.169
your tablet,

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.269
your laptop,

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.469
or your phone: you'll get the same
experience with a unified interface,

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.249

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:46.799
You can be watching on the bus,
pause it,

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:47.979
when you arrive home,

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:53.449
simply turn on TV and pick up where
you left off.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.799
Or let's say you're

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.379
watching TV, but what you really want to
see is a good movie without interrupting

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.319
the main big TV screen.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.029
You can browse the movie section on your computer,

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.089
find a film,

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.639
rent it,

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.339
and when you are ready to watch, simply
to play the film on your big screen -

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:21.989
no interruptions or switching cables.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.610
