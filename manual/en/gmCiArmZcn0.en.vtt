00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.320
 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.720
if you're looking for good all-around
family car

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.070
you can't do much better than the
hyundai santa fe sport and I mean it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.430
cars.com just and our top pick for small
families

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.300
it seats five if you need to see more
than that you need the regular santafe

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
with three rows and we need that our
topic for large families and our overall

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.240
winner for family car of the year but
for the sport and 2015

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.990
not much has changed it's still a great
car has one nifty new feature we're

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.430
going to show you and everything else
that won is over the base car comes with

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
a four cylinder engine with just under
200 horsepower and it's fine perfectly

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.520
acceptable but the turbo 2.0 liter
four-cylinder we have here put that over

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.969
260 horsepower and it's a blast to drive
power comes on instantaneously from stop

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.289
and you go flying up highway on ramps
passing power is always there too and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.379
even if you use the eco function which
saves a little fuel economy

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.440
there's still plenty of passing power
and that's not always the case

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.640
unlike a lot of hyundai's we test the
steering and the hyundai santa fe sport

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.380
is actually quite good

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.950
now it has a button to control settings
for steering with comfort normal and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
sport but I tried them all and really
can't tell the difference so I'm just

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.869
going to take it for what it is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.119
i recently tested nissans all-new mirana
which has a base v6 which competes

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.079
against the turbo sport we have here and
the rado used to be a sporty SUV

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.939
instead the new one they aim for comfort
so it's not quite as fun to drive as a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.360
sport we have here but it is more
comfortable and a little quieter

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.680
if there's one downside to the santa fe
sport it's definitely it's mileage you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.759
get the all wheel drive turbo like we
have here gets 18 miles per gallon city

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.009
24 miles per gallon highway 21 miles per
gallon combined against competitors in

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.659
his class to get 12 MPG better combined
which actually is pretty significant

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.979
so let's say hey Dave I don't need a
turbo I want the better mileage I'll get

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.119
a base four-cylinder well unfortunately
the base four-cylinder only gets one to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.810
two miles better than the turbo engine
does it against other base four

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.620
cylinders

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.930
it's significantly worse what I like
about the interior is this mix of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.440
above-average styling and materials and
really easy to use technology

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.299
now the materials on the doors and -
might be hard to the touch but the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.590
patterns on them look really good and
even simple things like window switches

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.200
are actually quite unique

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.709
then there's a straightforward
multimedia system which is exactly what

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.000
you want as a driver

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.049
you don't want it to be too complicated
as great clarity as you can see here the

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.069
functions are exactly where we expect
them to be and has nice big buttons for

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.209
everything else

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.519
one of the reasons you pick a santa fe
sport over compact SUV like a honda crv as

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.030
well

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.090
it's a bigger vehicle a lot more
interior room

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.769
he compared to its own class like the
Nissan Murano subaru outback the spec

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.380
sheets all pretty much the same there's
not much difference

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.709
you want the real field you want to sit
in the back seat for example you can see

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.359
have plenty of knee room and Headroom

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.230
now the driver's seat exactly what I had
it when driving and the other great

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.200
thing is there's plenty of space between
you and the passenger

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.049
so if you have little kids well we'll
probably find a way to hit each other

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.739
anyway but there's plenty of room there
and another great feature for little

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.540
kids is the air vents are in the pillars
of the doors which is unusual usually

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.569
they're down here in the center console
so those kids will actually feel the air

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.680
coming out of them

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.950
one new feature on the santa fe a

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.180
and it's only optional on this top trim
level is a smart liftgate you can hear

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.940
right now as you approach

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.880
let's say you have a ton of groceries in
your hands or something it senses you're

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.569
coming it senses the key fob in your
pocket and opens automatically so you

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.410
can get everything in without going in
your pocket or your purse for it has a

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.910
system like this - but it requires you
to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.210
move your foot underneath the sensor
this one just knows you're coming

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.980
once you're in the cargo area you've got
thirty five . four cubic feet of storage

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.760
about the same as the outback but
definitely less than the murano

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.530
however there is a ton of underfloor
storage and these bins are really quite

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.400
big

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.300
there's another one right here and there
is a spare tire

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.510
it's underneath the santa fe sport
starts around 25 thousand dollars and if

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.720
you want a loaded version like the one
we have here with the turbo engine

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990
all-wheel drive and that ultimate
package smart look

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.710
nice move well that's well over thirty
five thousand dollars but there are a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.920
lot of prices in between for a lot of
different shoppers and a lot of

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.880
different budgets and that's one of the
reasons we like it so much if it wasn't

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.810
for the mileage

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.810
probably the perfect family car

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.090
