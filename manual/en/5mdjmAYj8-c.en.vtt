The Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Abbasiya, Cairo
7 January 2013

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:14.854
Pope Tawadros II conducts first Christmas
holy mass since his ordination

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:30.762
Mohamed Abou Hamed, former MP

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:34.226
Christmas is a national as well as
a religious occasion:

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:36.821
All Egyptians celebrate it.

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:40.854
I’m honored to attend
the holy mass every year.

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.977
There is something special about this year:

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:51.562
This is the first Christmas
holy mass conducted by Pope Tawadros II. 

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:02.450
Awatef Karam

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.475
I’ve been attending the Christmas

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.315
holy masses led by Pope Shenodua 

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.842
ever since I was born.

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.045
This is the first time for me 

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:13.957
to attend a holy mass where 

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:15.959
Pope Shenodua is absent.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.853
I have mixed feelings: I am sad

00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:19.101
about the loss of Pope Shenouda

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.550
yet happy about the ordination 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.767
of Pope Tawadros.

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:47.052
Michel Hakeem

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:50.533
Jesus Christ spread peace, love

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.514
and reassurance among people of the world.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:57.815
His message was for everyone,
not only Copts.

00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:19.403
We hope the new year will be
a better one for the country,

00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:21.839
and that those demands of the revolution
which we have failed

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:26.206
to achieve over the past two years
be satisfied.

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:30.401
My first wish is that peace spreads everywhere.

00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:33.148
I want peace for Egypt, Arabs and the whole world.

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:36.097
I want every creature to live in peace.

00:02:38.932 --> 00:02:42.579
I came here to pray
for my country and people.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.116
I want everything good for Egypt.

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:49.972
I want the people, Muslims and Christians,

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:52.085
 to love each other and live in happiness.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:54.606
I hope the country will pass this stage and

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:59.966
that we'll live in harmony
for the sake of this country.
