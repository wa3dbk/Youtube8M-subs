00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.580
there's a growing trend among college
students very strong correct siap and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.050
this is something i didn't hear anything
about up until now but it's something

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.020
that i definitely experience myself when
i was in college it turns out that more

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.820
more college students are completely
skipping dinner derek eating something

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
either very light or not eating dinner
at all and then they go out and they

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.430
consume all the calories while drinking
now they do this for two different

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.150
reasons one they want to reduce the
amount of calories they consume a dinner

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.850
that way they can consume calories uh...
during partying and not feel guilty

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.910
about it later and i feel for that there
is no no no it happen

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.150
the first for some students especially
female students this is part of any

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.120
disorder they don't want it consumes so
many calories of they're counting

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.320
calories so they're like mama don't
raise some just not going to have dinner

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.070
which is stupid

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.680
and then uh... there of course other
students who are doing it for the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580
calories or whatever they're doing it
because they want to get run faster they

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.700
want a binge drink on an empty stomach
so they filled run comedian right so i

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.500
experienced college students like that
all the time when i was in college i

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.520
didn't realize that this is now of a
growing trend any huge problem when it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.300
comes to eating disorders and if we were
just fed ease because living

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.039
the with

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.829
this roof of the planet and be a column
on the unprofor like now i'm going to

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.390
get into these old man stores like back
in a man who is live this way

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.789
don't need to make sure you before we
were not venture black no less than

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.329
uh... let me get their triple
cheeseburger from wendy's

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.860
them arthritis and the super giant and
they were still digging on this maneuver

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.990
is exactly the point is we're going to
dry ice is off tonight

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.850
let's get a lot of food in us

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.750
so we will look like

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.170
efferent any it's stone around run run
into some of the that was the plan like

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.220
the if someone getting before when i
like is wrong with you the at the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.660
agonizing and on that sort

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.940
i know you on the curb first person i
agree with your plan my plan is even

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.920
fattier than your plan because when we
would go out and drink

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.340
in my opinion the best part about going
out and drinking is having a drunk

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.870
neil afterwards yeah i'm going to hear
ya looked before and after that so you

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.420
are my carrot i'm pretty like

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.340
land in your book by lightening in
rather than having like two she's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.210
burgers i have one cheeseburger and so
because i want you to fall and then not

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.400
be able to train i hated that to you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.900
and then you go when you have a couple
of years or you know couple cocktails

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.040
maybe a little jungle juice if you're
feeling up for it and then afterwards

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.120
you go you have like a bacon wrapped up
tight on the streets of hollywood or

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.950
something of a man well yeah forgot how
you are actually we never left the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.650
school

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.270
the fire was that was all around you of
the what does the windy city officials

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.140
here is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.680
you go back to the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
to the spot consider unfortunate
drinking beers that d_n_a_ or

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.100
then we miss lee go out cuz you know
sometimes and they cannot be enjoying at

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.759
home

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.680
you make it out

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.679
your party's ticket

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.759
in incumbent enacted then i would back
me some of those are going to stop that

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.890
they're talking about

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.420
imbalance and you bring the food matters
it was

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.680
it was a good evening

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
evening can even tell us about sinning
and pass out anyway to make their life

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.879
somehow we cannot eighty-four dazzling
union

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.480
thing is that wasn't what these people
are honest

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.230
denying landed any entity in everything
together without a lot and regulate

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.900
propel this this is the sole backorder
for and is not what you have any less

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.329
hasn't house because

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.110
you eight before you drink do they still
hookup with the body's trunk

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.740
recognises kendall of the how they're
doing now here's the thing is i think of

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.910
course the group of these people ka
seriously eating disorder right ends

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.910
with those people they need it they need
therapy they need help

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.990
they're not doing it af rainy other
reason other than trying to keep their

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.229
calorie count liao

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:40.209

causing long-term health effects ok you

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.659
might have issues on cognitive issues
for instance uh... issues concentrating

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.769
issue studying uh... there is a study
done that said that that you might have

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.739
you got problems making decisions for
the rest of your life like it has a

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.150
rogue seriously impact on your brain so
don't do that and also when you're not
