Presenter:
Hey, everyone, this is Gary House with Cooking

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.420
Everything Outdoors show and our review today
is on the MoJoe Griddle.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.720
It comes in a box and it is heavy.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.769
So opening the box up, the first thing you're
going to find is the owner's manual.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.910
Now, this is an extensive owner's manual.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.570
It's a 20-page booklet covering every aspect
of using your MoJoe Griddle whether on a kettle

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.100
barbecue or a campfire pit or just on the
ground.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.120
Digging a little further first thing you're
going to find are the handles to lift and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.900
move your MoJoe Griddle.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.760
These I believe are made out of stainless
steel.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760
They're nicely made.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.610
They fit your hand very comfortably, too.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.620
Digging deeper into the box we find our MoJoe
Griddle, accompanied with 3 legs that's going

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.720
to allow you to raise it above your campfire
or even use it as a freestanding unit.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.480
Quick observation on your MoJoe Griddle is
it has the braces underneath.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.860
This will help keep the griddle from warping
as it heats up and it also allows it to sit

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.550
on the 22.5" Weber kettle barbecue.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.719
This is one heavy bugger and it's made out
of 1/4 inch steel.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.630
Now, take those handles that came with this,
put it in the precut holes and give it a lift.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.649
Do this about 10 times every day and you're
going to have some seriously huge shoulders.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.869
As you can see it fits nicely on the Weber
kettle.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.060
The first thing you need to do once you get
it out of the box is give it a good wash.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.090
I just used a little warm soapy water, gave
it a good scrub, then rinsed it off with some

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.329
fresh clean water until dried it, then I let
it sit in the sun for a good 15 minutes to

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.450
make sure it was extra dry.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.399
Now, there's no need to clean the underside
of the MoJoe Griddle.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:42.659
So let's put ours to the test.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.100
I took about 75 charcoal briquettes and fired
them up.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.270
And I want to spread them across the bottom
of my Weber kettle.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.329
I'm using the performer if you hadn't noticed.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.909
Now, before we get started one thing that
you need understand is you always treat the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.130
MoJoe Griddle as if it is hot.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.540
There are 5 pages of safety tips in this owner's
manual.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.689
So take this seriously.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.229
Now, place your MoJoe Griddle securely on
the top of Weber kettle and you'll see that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.440
those support brackets help raise the MoJoe
Griddle above the kettle for air circulation,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.740
and you can always adjust the heat by adjusting
your vent down below.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.780
Less heat, closed.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.240
More heat, open.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.420
Just simple as that.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.530
So, now that we have our MoJoe Griddle cleaned
and heated up, we're going to test to see

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.080
if it's ready to cook on.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.140
And we'll do the water test.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.140
You sprinkle water on there and if it beads
up, it's ready to go.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.720
Seasoning at first is as simple as applying
a little bit of cooking oil and just working

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.450
it into the surface.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.090
Always make sure you use a thick wad of paper
towels and a pair of heavy-duty heat resistant

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.090
gloves.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.220
So let's give this a cook.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.840
Our griddle is seasoned.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.910
Added a little bit more cooking oil.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.490
And I have some leftover chicken strips that
I'm just going to throw on there and see how

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.490
it does.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.260
You'll notice it's relatively non-stick right
after the first seasoning and you know how

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.030
difficult skinless, boneless chicken breasts
can be.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.280
Look at that.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.650
Flips easy the first time.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.450
After just a couple of quick minutes, it's
ready for some salad.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.140
Yep, that's what I did with it.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.620
Cleanup is just a breeze.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.200
Take a stiff spatula, scrape some of gunk
off, pour some table salt all over it and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.820
give it a scrub.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.240
Got something stubborn there, take that special
back and knock it down.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.580
Once you have the food cleaned off your griddle,
apply just a little bit more vegetable oil,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.460
rub that in and it is seasoned and ready to
go for next time.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.730
