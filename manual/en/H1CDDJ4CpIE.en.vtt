00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:10.268
Hello dear friends of SIP
My name is Jan and this is episode 2 of our mini-series "winterproof scooter riding"

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.577
In episode 1 we explained how you can keep yourself safe from the weather

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:17.294
Using gloves, thermal underwear and all the stuff that's necessary

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:22.797
Episode 2 will now show you how to get your Vespa winterproof and what you will need to do so

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:28.633
The first item on our list is the TUCANO URBANO leg cover

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:33.293
It comes in a stylish bag which you can also strap around your shoulder

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:41.851
It's amazing to know that every single bag, even if you're buying two leg covers for the same scooter model, will always have a different design

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:46.789
It is important that when ordering this leg cover to look in the list explicitly for your model

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.072
Because the leg cover is also explicitly manufactured to suit your model

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:54.570
Which means it's accurately fitting when ordered for the right model with the right item code

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.544
I will show you the cover on a LX50 where we already mounted it.

00:00:59.544 --> 00:01:01.898
We have prepared that for you

00:01:01.898 --> 00:01:09.323
On the front of the legshield you'll see how accurately it fits. So that it presents no target at all for the wind

00:01:09.323 --> 00:01:13.023
It provides full protection from the rain

00:01:13.023 --> 00:01:15.023
Let me show you that quickly

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:20.162
By putting the cover over my lap

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:24.806
And I am completely protected from the outside world

00:01:24.806 --> 00:01:27.628
A gimmick I like a lot about this one

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:31.990
Is that there are air cushions at the sides of the cover

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.496
Which can be inflated and which give a rigid structure to the leg cover

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.257
So that even when riding at high speed there won't occur any flapping

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:44.788
Moreover, you got a reach-through here that allows you to access the ignition lock and all other controls you need

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:52.304
Also there are other gimmicks like the inner lining, which you can easily see if I turn the leg cover over like this

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:56.917
The lining is made from snug fur and warms your legs

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:00.709
At the rider's side of the cover you'll find a document pocket

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:07.346
Of course our winter update flyer so we know what's important for the upcoming winter season

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:10.294
I can put it back in here and close it with a zip fastener so it'll stay safe

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:13.560
Additionally, one thing all of us know

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.336
Our seats are made of leather, very sensitive to weather exposure

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:24.604
That's why many people order new leather seat covers because winter weather just wears out the leather

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:32.233
The leg cover offers the possibility that, with the help of this little fold-out flap, you can fully cover your seat

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:41.294
You can relax and go to work, no need to carry along an additional seat cover in your helmet compartment which usually is crowded anyway

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:46.840
What a useful feature to protect yourself from the weather

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:49.961
Let's move on to item number 2

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:51.857
Our hand grip covers

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:54.562
Here they are

00:02:56.224 --> 00:03:01.671
These hand grip covers have the advantage of mounting plug&amp;play to your handlebar

00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:10.187
Done, they fit tightly

00:03:10.187 --> 00:03:14.400
What you need to know about these is that you can either fit them with the mounting material

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.826
Or connect them to the mirror by this clip on the upper side of the cover

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:20.303
That's up to you, of course it's included in delivery

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:24.715
Moreover, we got the thumb here

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:26.715
Super cool and super important

00:03:26.715 --> 00:03:33.696
Once you have slipped inside the cover, you can still use all the controls with the help of this thumb

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:39.373
The neoprene will keep your hands dry, warm and safe from the wind

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:43.459
That's what you need to know about these covers, let's have a look at the tires - They're very important

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.459
Why do we talk about tires?

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.995
Tires are a very important item

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.998
First of all because they're all that connects you to the road

00:03:49.998 --> 00:03:52.802
Secondly because they're part of your chassis suspension

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:57.435
Which is not just made up of the shock absorbers, but also includes your tires, air pressure and everything else related to this

00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:06.265
What adds up to their importance is the fact that (ATTENTION! ONLY APPLIES TO GERMANY, LOCAL REGULATIONS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT!) the legislative authorities have decreed that two-wheel vehicles have to have winter tires mounted during winter weather conditions

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:10.192
This means that if you're riding during such conditions, winter tires are mandatory

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:12.192
What options are there?

00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:19.643
Some time ago the company IRC started to sell tires exclusively for winter use with a M+S marker meaning "Mud and Snow"

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:22.932
It has a lamella technology

00:04:22.932 --> 00:04:26.066
This was the first ever exclusive winter tire for scooters

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:30.226
The rubber compound includes silica particles

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:35.265
They provide that the tire is very flexible with maximum grip

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:38.426
This is a major difference to a summer tire

00:04:38.426 --> 00:04:41.708
The rubber compound can be somewhat harder with summer tires

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:43.707
Because the temperature will make it smoother

00:04:43.707 --> 00:04:46.536
The road has different temperature levels too

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:51.135
The kneading of the tire also makes for more heating of the tire

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.735
And therefore the tire has to have maximum grip during different temperature levels

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:59.452
That's different for winter tires
During winter the road is cold, we often make short-distance rides and the tire doesn't really get warm

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:03.396
So then it's important first of all that we have grip

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:09.952
And secondly that the road will be cleared from all the debris on the road, snow, leaves, mud, you name it

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:16.454
That's why you cannot ride slicks during winter, you would just slip all the time

00:05:16.454 --> 00:05:19.887
The tire manufacturers have taken on this problem, for example CONTINENTAL

00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:26.424
You might know this from your car, they offer all-season tires

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:31.397
These tires also have the M+S marker for "Mud and Snow" but you can also use these tires during summer

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:36.359
All people who are commuting daily to work on their scooter during winter, please choose the winter tire

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:40.351
Because it has much improved winter handling compared to the all-season tire

00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:43.772
Much better grip and much safer

00:05:43.772 --> 00:05:49.940
If you're just an occasional winter rider the all-season tire will keep you on the right side of the law just as well

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.082
But if you're a frequent rider, please use the winter tires, for example those of IRC

00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:57.400
I hope you liked this program

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.083
With our winter special we prepared you well for what is to come, both with clothing and equipment for your Vespa

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:07.659
Of course you will find all of these products in our webshop or in our update catalogue

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.168
 

00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:13.168
Your Jan
