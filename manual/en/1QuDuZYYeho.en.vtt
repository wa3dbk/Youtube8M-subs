00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.730
RUNNER WHILE TRAINING THIS WEEK.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.200
.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.010
IF HER PATS -- IF HER PAST

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280
HAS ANYTHING ON HER FUTURE, SHE

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.780

OUTDOOR TRACK AND FIELD

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.380
CHAMPIONSHIPS.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.980
LAST YEAR AT NATIONALS, AMANDA

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.420
FINISHED SEVENTH.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.150
THEN AT THE OTHER CHAMPIONSHIPS,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.890
SHE PLACED THIRD IN SHE FINISHED

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.990
FIFTH IN THE MILE.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.160
BUT THIS BY ALL OF THAT SUCCESS,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.960
AMANDA DECIDED TO TRAIN AT UC

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840
DAVIS, NOT IN UTAH.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.170
THE ONE THING I WAS LOOKING

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.240
FOR WHEN MOVING UP TO THE NEXT

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.640
LEVEL IS I REALLY WANTED A

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.580
TRAINING PARTNER.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.480
THIS

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.280
IS A CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE SO

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.020
I WANTED TO BE AROUND OTHER

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320
PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPERIENCE

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.920
RUNNING AT THIS LEVEL FOR LONGER

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.090
AND WHO I COULD RUN WITH EVERY

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.960
DAY.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.990
ALTITUDE TRAINING HAS ALWAYS

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.490
BEEN THE PREFERRED WAY OF

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.260
TRAINING IN MOST SPORTS.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.170
BUT IN THE CASE OF AMERICA -- OF

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.240
AMANDA, HER PARTNERS TRAIN AT

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.540
A

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.170
HIGHER ALTITUDE.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.270
THE ATTRACTION OF BEING ABLE

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.770
TO TRAIN AROUND ATHLETES THAT

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.480
ARE SIMILARLY MINDED OR

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.110
SIMILARLY ABLE WAS SOMETHING

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.480
THAT WAS A STRONG CONSIDERATION

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.780
FOR HER IN RELOCATING TO

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.350
CALIFORNIA.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.480
THIS UNIVERSITY OF UTAH

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.390
GRAD

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270
WAS A FIVE-TIME ALL-AMERICAN

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.830
FROM SHELBY AMONG -- SHELBY

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.730
TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.700
BUT SACRAMENTO IS HER NEW HOME.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.200
THIS IS THE TOWN THAT I AM

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.830
USED TO.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.240
HERE AND I WANT TO REPRESENT THE

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.650
CITY REALLY WELL.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.710
