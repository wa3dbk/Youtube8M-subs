nab the hell are you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.940
but have never been thrown on the right
with the whole wide world thing is that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
this was the sexual

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
at that time of great right market

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.000
that might affect contact he sits in a
and about one thousand dollars his

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.240
product

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.240
catsup carl's junior house brave front
and my friend dick

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.820
and update it works

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.820
yourself up by the recipient half
scandal crop

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.300
one of my favorite things these
terrorists is on the road to success

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.049
do your best or your worst extended they
thought of it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.810
right now of course and the question
here is is a success

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.210
well dot

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.000
i have a problem with eighty different
ways or you don't get than number one

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.710
problem i have with that is there's
already so much temptation for young

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.360
women to sell out and uh... be viewed as
a sex symbol dot of an intelligent

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.729
independent woman right

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.930
and that's about it it's like all of you
could win a thousand dollars can be on a

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.759
commercial

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.130
again if it's on the command center the
burger

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.079
during the right practices

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.950
yet somebody's gonna put up their
careers

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.189
fit like that you could confirm
inversion across university armored form

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.389
where they like are you out of this
trial we think truth is that i don't

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.010
like the idea that don't

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.519
poll but haven't you

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.279
and germans i dot com julia very hot we
got started

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.090
usr detested

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.019
that is why we put on a tim

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.349
well my thoughts assignment and i see

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.099
thought about it is why is it of hot
checks eating burgers campaign like

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.300
kennedy hot people keepers because

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.300
content the target women as well

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.069
favor i would like to see a hike i don't
think they can do a commercial finally

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.409
exam maybe they can do a commercial with
a hot woman anaheim today

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.299
but it's very liberal data like this is
an incident that happened and the fact

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.910
that a number of iraqi elements of the
harmful brain after saying oh well

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.820
uh... then it's not that it's because
who was there demos people who ecology

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.299
on your are young

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.340
guys that's why they're having hot

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.689
sixteen members

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.629
if they're demos were young women

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.659
they would have david beckham smearing
it all over this

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.789
you see what i'm saying

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:13.329
but they've had their goal for the demos
now is a sexist by definition no i don't

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.149
think so it is

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.559
when you have hot chicks and romance he
doesn't need all the women are good for

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.370
is five fifteen in paris

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.560
widest everybody make that assumption
because women are so not at i'm not

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.200
trying to get all crazy family right now
women are over sexual lies in the media

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.090
and its

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.590
it's just it's frustrating

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.220
because there comes a point in a woman's
life ok this is an attractive woman

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.999
sites where they can be either sellout
and yet be important

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.799
you know being playboy and to all this
of this sexy ads for the connections a

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.670
different route

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.870
and it still attempting to give it
distancing because that's what it seems

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.120
like everyone wants everyone wants sexy
women sexy women young men are the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.500
executives c_e_o_s is that women have a
sexy you know sex uh... favorite so far

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
here's a man whose

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.980
sizable but

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.270
uh... that's all for now see here's a
pic occupied partly relief you and i

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.340
think your perspective as an important
one and if you are at the supreme court

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.650
and i'm glad you're here

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.569
physicist very non-citizens but the flip
side is

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.759
uh... we know that young men are
attracted to hop women and if you're

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.909
gonna sell products the young man and it
is perfectly logical to sort through

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:27.639
them through hot women and this doesn't
do anything for me because as i told you

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.080
know the commercials and record birthing
center

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.889
this centralizing the burgers to the
point where i want you to many more

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:34.990
usually then

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.260
is like the girls of course artisan wood
nor the para uma dot i want to put that

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.849
burden my mouth

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.490
you know it's not a messed up my
dissemination super sorry i have had no

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.280
interest in anybody's seven for

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.910
so you know that's my

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.009
issue with it that's why it doesn't work
for me

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.730
but you can't tell people in my opinion

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.929
well you can't do sexy ads because that
hurts the

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.310
perception of women

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.130
in the media too much

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.820
me that i have sexy

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.770
stuff you know what i'm saying as sexy
as he had a sexy show

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.050
and so beneath if u then carried that
over

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.600
or to the political sphere

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.860
than a month million per cent behind you

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.289
revisited the sexualized

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.669
enjoyed unabomber no no no but enjoys
them based on that like if they were to

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.710
say you know madeline albright was not a
good secretary of state

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.090
because she could meet its plumber
sanctuary

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.000
and according to the world's largest
moron

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.460
fifty-eight one has no end to another is
so i'll send

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.199
okay go ahead

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.820
answers i think look

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.490
both a good point stony in iraq has
ideas or my point is personal life these

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.139
women want to do it whatever all the
power to them i don't care if they're

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:48.020
all business

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.050
i guess what i want to see is unchanged
perception toward women

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.290
uh... especially in the mainstream media
he doesn't against the thing that

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.520
bothers me the most is

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.349
women are seen as sex symbols you don't
like

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.539
megan fox and transformers at attacks
are online shop and they have not

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.090
hillary clinton shoes i mean we didn't
think

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.090
megan fox to being transformed for
michael they didn't because

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.509
he's brilliant

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.070
the paper cassie she watches
pro-parliament

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.039
you know what i'm thinking she was sexy
but

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.910
sometime i got a separate out the job
that i think it's a fair to say

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.789
actually make a judgment visual for
women based on how they look

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.780
if you're going to higher than at the
office

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.680
which a lot of guys do ralph course but
that's totally unacceptable on the other

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.919
hand

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.120
unique i mean you can't say we can't
really sexy woman in the addressee i'm

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.080
not saying that when people want
campaigns that are based

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.580
all-knowing onsite in there

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.180
it's kind of annoying

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.710
uh... yeah okay look if you say it's
annoying i can't deny that 'cause that's

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.849
how you feel about it

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.919
paternity i get it's logical

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:53.870
wanted so there you have
