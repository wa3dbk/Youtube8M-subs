00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.100
Scientifically, it is inevitable.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240
&gt;&gt; Reports of riots and chaos downtown.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.849
&gt;&gt; Mathematically it is logical.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.640
&gt;&gt; This is not a hoax. There are reports of
some sort of outbreak.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.349
&gt;&gt; It is a terrifying, yet unavoidable, reality.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.529
&gt;&gt; The origin of this crisis at the Botany
Bay Convention Center. God help anyone alive

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.970
down there.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.420
&gt;&gt; But for some, reality has never been an
issue.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.769
&gt;&gt; Dude, your costume sucks.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:41.729
[Laughter]

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.980
Like a tablecloth. I'm like -- hey! What you
are you doing?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.360
&gt;&gt; This is highly illogical!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
&gt;&gt; This is a good day to die. Hyah!

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380
&gt;&gt; He does know he's not a real klingon, right?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.540
&gt;&gt; Facebook.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.780
&gt;&gt; Assimilate this.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.960
[Shouting]

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.000
&gt;&gt; The needs of the many outweigh the good
of the few.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.900
&gt;&gt; We're doomed. Trapped. It's hopeless.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840
&gt;&gt; Are you saying this is a no-win scenario?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.480
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.180
&gt;&gt; Live long, and prosper.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.440
[Growling]

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.940
&gt;&gt; GulfCon!

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.620
&gt;&gt; Fix it. They're right behind me, aren't
they? I'm not surprised. Are you surprised?

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.700
I'm not surprised. Oh, yeah, a red shirt dies.
Big effing surprise.
