00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:16.510
&lt;Intro&gt;

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.130
Somewhere

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.650
Beyond the sea

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.110
Somewhere

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.900
Waiting for me

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.310
My lover stands on golden sands

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.370
And watches the ships

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.540
That go sailing

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.890
Somewhere

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.660
Beyond the sea

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.540
She's there watching for me

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.280
If I could fly like birds on high

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.010
Then straight to her arms

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.350
I'd go sailing

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.760
It's far

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.600
Beyond the stars

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.610
It's near

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.590
Beyond the moon

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.580
I know

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.480
Beyond a doubt

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:11.790
My heart will lead me there soon

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.890
We'll meet

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.980
Beyond the shore

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.810
We'll kiss

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.790
Just as before

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.810
Happy we'll be

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.970
Beyond the sea

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.310
And never again

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.800
I'll go sailing

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.650
&lt;Intro&gt;

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.110
Somewhere

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.880
Beyond the sea

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.330
Somewhere

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.350
Waiting for me

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.830
My lover stands on golden sands

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.410
And watches the ships

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.940
That go sailing

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.150
Somewhere

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.790
Beyond the sea

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.200
She's there watching for me

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.680
If I could fly like birds on high

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.130
Then straight to her arms

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.540
I'd go sailing

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.930
It's far

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.640
Beyond the stars

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.280
It's near

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.370
Beyond the moon

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.830
I know

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.350
Beyond a doubt

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.450
My heart will lead me there soon

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.660
We'll meet

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.180
Beyond the shore

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.690
We'll kiss

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.780
Just as before

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.670
Happy we'll be

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.710
Beyond the sea

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.900
And never again

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.500
I'll go sailing
