JORGE BENLLOCH: Now, we are going to start
making the legs because you can see that it's

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.209
like an axle here and this is going to be
the two legs and the structure that is going

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:24.320
to support the cat. Then we are going to add
a part of the body here. And then it's important

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.779
that we meld these two parts together. Then
melding means that we have to put these two

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:41.100
pieces of clay together leaving these in the--these
attach a little bit. You don't need to press

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.420
too much. This is going to be the two legs.
Later, we are going to shape this as a leg

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:59.140
form. Then, with all these clay that I had,
all the pieces--it's the same of kind clay,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.511
cut in there. We're going to add some kind
of volume here that is going to be the rear

00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:19.470
legs and the rear, the butt. And then we'll
start building up with coils or whatever,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.420
you want to do it like this, so this we call
coils, clay coils. You can build whatever

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:40.870
you want up. You have to start building up.
Put more material here, more material there,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:02:05.150
whatever you have, just more, and we have
like a base, a self-standing base. This is

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.090
very important because this is going to be
the support. I mean, this is going to support

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030
whatever we build on top of that.
