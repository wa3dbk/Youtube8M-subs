00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.200
How many things have we killed in video games?
Seriously...millions, right? From Pac-Man's

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.400
ghosts to Mario's turtles to Titanfall's...titans.
I've been a natural born killer for 30 years

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.600
now.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.800
And never, not once, have I ever given it
a thought.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.000
Never have I regretted any of it.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.200
And then this happened.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.400
It happened at the end. And in my defense,
there was a lot of stuff leading up to it.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.600
I was fair to these guys. I took the high
road. When they were brought in for questioning,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.800
I treated them with dignity, and respect.
Despite that, they still threatened me. At

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.000
a funeral, no less. And even then, I was the
bigger person. I tried to diffuse the situation.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.200
I tried to cut a deal, and calm them down.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.400
And yet, despite all that...these f*cking
guys...

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.600
I'd had enough. I was pushed to a limit...a
limit I didn't even know I had. And for hours

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.800
afterward, even days...it bothered me to know
it's there. I felt...regret. Over a game.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.000
That's the magic of The Wolf Among Us.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.200
You don't just do. You honestly, legitimately...feel.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.400
So, you know The Walking Dead? The amazing
adventure game from Telltale Games? This is

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
the same kind of thing. Only more stylish,
and more of a fantasy. And in fact, maybe

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
even more captivating. Point is, it's really
good. If you liked The Walking Dead, or even

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
games like Heavy Rain, or Beyond: Two Souls...you're
gonna love The Wolf Among Us.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.200
This is a story-driven adventure game...with
a story that can actually drive.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.400
Now, we've reviewed both of the first two
episodes. So definitely check out those reviews

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.600
for more details. In short, you play as the
Big Bad Wolf. Like, the guy from the stories.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.800
He and his fellow fables have left their homeland,
giving up their storybook pasts to start over...to

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.000
have a more realistic reality. Now, they live
in Fabletown...a neighborhood where enchanted

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.200
forests and giant beanstalks and old women
who live in shoes...are just stories for kids.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.400
The Wolf Among Us is not a story for kids.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.600
So Episode 3 picks up right where Episode
2 left off. The wolf, Bigby...has found a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.800
murder scene. A pretty sick murder scene.
And a murder scene that sends him into a rage.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.000
What he finds there, and how it affects him,
sets the tone for a manhunt that fuels Episode

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.200
3. You're looking for a familiar face, but
in doing so...you meet plenty of new ones.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.400
Over the last two episodes, we've raved about
two things in particular. The story, and the

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.600
presentation. But one thing that Episode 3
does really well...is character progression.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.800
The decisions we've made in the first two
episodes, and how we've been interacting with

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.000
the characters...it all comes to a head in
Episode 3. Fables you thought you knew reveal

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.200
new depths to their character. Every character
in this game becomes interesting.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.400
Even more so than they already were.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.600
And of course, the story itself continues
to get more and more intense. And like the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.800
prior episodes, we're treated to a couple
standout moments. Especially that final scene,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.000
which is probably the game's coolest, and
most powerful moment yet. Like I said, I literally

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.200
thought
about that scene for hours and hours...genuinely

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.400
regretting what I'd done, and fearfully wondering
how it would change things moving forward.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.600
And you know, I feel like I should point out...I
generally don't like story-driven games. I'm

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.800
definitely more of a gameplay-first kind of
guy. And even I'm totally engrossed by the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.000
tale this game's weaving. It's just unbelievably
well written, and the decisions you make have

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.200
serious consequences. So as much as I'm enjoying
it now? I can't wait to finish it...not only

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.400
to see
what happens, but so I can play through it

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.600
again, and make different decisions.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.800
But for this first time through...I'm just
reacting naturally.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.000
And at times...your reactions kind 
of scare you.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.200
For more on The Wolf Among Us, including more
about the amazing graphics, and the spectacular

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.400
music, and the sharp gameplay...watch our
reviews of the first two episodes. Obviously,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.600
we're trying not to repeat the same points.
But with a game this good, that's somewhat

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.800
unavoidable. This game is fantastic, and Episode
3 is the best one yet.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.000
If you love a good story?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.200
You'll love The Wolf Among Us.
