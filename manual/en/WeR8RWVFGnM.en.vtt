On behalf of Expert Village my name is Seth
Williams. I work for Dean Case Services and

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.250
I am here to tell you about simple street
bike brake repair and inspection. Alright,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.180
we are going to go ahead and reinstall the
master cylinder back on the bike. We are going

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:32.349
to start with the connecting linkage. Go ahead
and slid this up into its cavity,

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.070
slide the rod through then the small washer,
and will be replaced with a new cotter pin.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:01:00.980
After that is done, we will take the reservoir
line reattach that tighten the clamp down

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:18.389
on its surface. Next, we do the banjo bolts,
it holds it all together. Now pay close attention

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:22.950
when you are reinstalling these banjo bolts
as they are finely threaded and it would be

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.289
easy to cross thread them. there is also a
locating nub right on the back side of this

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:36.759
as you can see here make sure that your brake
line below that locating nub. These are factory

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:51.499
locations that are specific for brake performance.
Now once we have that tight go ahead and snug

00:01:51.499 --> 00:02:14.569
it down. Once that is snug down grab your
mounting bolts

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:57.739
slide your guard back into place.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.200
And youâ€™re ready for reinstallation of your
caliber and rear wheel.
