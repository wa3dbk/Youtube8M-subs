00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.140
weird animal government experiments

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.600
operation acoustic Kitty,  during the Cold War

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.250
the US was desperate to find new ways to spy on the soviets, somehow

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.330
the US government spent between 10 to 20 million dollars on turning household

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.740
cats into international spies

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.120
by planting a microphone in the ear canal, a small transmitter at the base of

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.720
the skull

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.980
and an antenna into the tail, it seem like they created the perfect

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.240
elite spy except for the fact that in the first test mission

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.730
the little guy was run over by a taxi almost immediately. two headed dogs

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.120
in 1954 Vladimir Demikhov  successfully took the head and forearms of a

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.020
puppy and grafted it to an adult

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.030
German Shepherd, I know that makes no sense but get this the two dogs slept and ate

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.340
at different times

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.480
even though the puppy received nourishment from the larger dog. what's

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.620
more is that Vladimir was able to recreate the experiment 20 more times

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.200
Now, before you go on and hate Vladimir for his mad scientist practices

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.370
these experiments were the first successful heart and lung transplants in

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.930
animals meeting Vladimir's work eventually lead to organ transplants

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.720
which saved countless lives. psychedelic elephants.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.790
okay this was a real head-scratcher a group of researchers studying

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.470
aggression in mail elephants thought the right thing to do was to give 3000

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.890
times the level over human dose of LSD, wanna guess how it ended? well the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.630
big guy fell to his knees and although they tried to revive him

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.430
the elephant died within minutes the conclusion, it appears that the elephant

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.720
is highly sensitive to the effects of LSD...

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.710
The Earmouse.  this little guy made headlines when the world saw it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.850
hairless mouse with human-like-ear-thing growing out its back, some folks

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.030
protested saying his genetically engineered mutant was a crime against

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.060
humanity however there was no human DNA in the mouse and he wasn't actually

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.640
genetically engineered at all

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.070
instead the scientist created a biodegradable scaffold made from cow

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.770
cartilage cells

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.300
and implanted it under the skin at the mouse, so in time the mouse could replace

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.970
and support the ear-shaped cartilage

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.800
The point of the experiment was to figure out a way to replace lost or damaged ears

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.960
not to create some sort of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.380
ear mouse mutant thing.  human/ape hybrid.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.560
doctor Ilya Ivanov and his son secretly tried and failed thankfully to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.030
impregnate a female chimp with human sperm

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.400
even though they had some backing from the Soviet Union Ivanov  knew that his plan was

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.420
super "F"-ed up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.170
had to keep it a secret from pretty much everyone, after his plans failed the plan

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.450
was to get a human female volunteer

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.350
to carry the Human-zee baby, surprisingly he actually got a few

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.640
female volunteers that thankfully never got to see his dream come to life

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.090
for Stalin was not a fan of his and sent him to a  prison camp for about two years

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.800
putting a stop to his disturbing plans

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.900
*Chimpanzee noises*
