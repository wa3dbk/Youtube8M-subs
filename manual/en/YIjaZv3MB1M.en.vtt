00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Philosophers and poets devote their lives to the question, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
“What thoughts lie on the mind of the King?”

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But one does not need to be either to 
 see what is on your mind, my friend.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So let me hear it in your words, Yudish. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Tell me why the king does not sleep and instead burns with conflict. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
A million men, Krishna…

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
“A million men burned alive in an instant.”

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
“And this was just the FIRST day of this war.”

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
“All the fears and doubts I had when I challenged Duryodhana

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000
for my kingdom lie in front of me again before 
 the sun rises on our second day of battle.”

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
All on account of my actions, Krishna. The blood is on my hands…

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
All these men and the countless yet to die for my birthright and honor

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
would be living happily if I had just surrendered to Duryodhana.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I need no counsel, Lord Krishna in the burdens a king must bear.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And yet, if my honor and birthright is to 
 soak in the blood of ordinary men,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
who do not question my orders, but rather lay down their lives for them

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I don’t know how many more days I 
 will be able to prolong this war.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I lose sleep, Krishna, because I chose their deaths over their lives.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And, as I see the river swallow up their ashes, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I am not certain I made the right choice.
