Hello everyone Spidy awesome as Peter Parker
and today we are going to play with this

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.350
awesome Gazillion Premium Bubbles Bump-N-Go
Bubble Car, it looks really really fun and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.350
I

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.720
am so excited to play with it.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.980
This bubble car is really cool because it
blows the bubbles

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.750
straight up into the air and it comes with
a four once bonus solution so you can keep

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.750
adding

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.750
more bubbles.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.050
And the nice thing is there is no complicated
anything about it you just fuel

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.730
the car with the bubble solution at the top
and then you just turn it on and watch it

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.730
go.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.730
And

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.090
Gazillion bubbles also makes a couple of other
awesome bubble machine called the tornado

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.250
and monsoon machine and we have a video of
the monsoon you should check that out.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.250
And

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.550
here to the side I have an extra thing of
Gazillion bubbles because I love bubbles and

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.550
I want

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.550
to use a lot.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.400
And here is our awesome Bump-N-Go car out
of the box alright lets take a close

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.510
look at this.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.440
We’ve got the easy on and off button right
on the hood you just press it to turn

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.920
on it and kind of looks cool in the front
it’s got a nice style.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.330
And the wheels actually more

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.730
around so it will drive around and it’s
got a cool looking back.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.670
Here’s the fan for the air for

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.070
the bubbles and it has a little spinning wheel
so it can spin and go in different directions.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.260
And here on top is our little spinning wand
you can dip it where we put the bubble solution

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.470
so we can dip it in and it spins around go’s
by the fan and blows the bubbles.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.470
And right here

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340
I have the four once bubbles of the Gazillion
Premium Bubbles And I am just going to pour

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.220
it in here into the little purple part, that
is where the wands dip and I fill it up until

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.220
it hits

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.190
the very edge and here we go.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.510
Alright so I got the Bump-N-Go Bubble car
on the ground, I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.250
built a little arena for it.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.310
And now lets turn our car on and ohhh this
looks awesome.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.310
Looks

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.490
how that bubble wand goes it just dips dips
dips and then it goes over the fan and blows

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.490
all

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.080
these awesome bubbles and that is a lot of
bubbles this would be really really cool at

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080
a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.080
party or something.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.600
And I love how it just totally moves around
on its own you don’t really

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.979
see a bubble machine like this.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.070
And now I am going to have a little car fun
with our Bump-

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.530
N-Go Bubble car I have a whole bunch of our
favorite Disney Cars characters laying around

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:30.599
our bubble car and we are going to see how
many the bubble car can hit.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:50.819
Music….Well that

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.249
was super fun to watch so now we are going
to play another game just like it.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.249
I figured since

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:01.719
we have a car that blows bubbles I would do
Disney Cars and now I will do Bubble Guppies

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.650
and a bunch of rubber duckies and I got Ariel
strapped to the car here that will be really

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.650
funny to watch.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.189
And so we are going to see how many of our
Bubble Guppie characters and

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:38.279
our rubber ducks that our Bubble car can hit.

00:03:38.279 --> 00:04:03.239
Music….

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.459
