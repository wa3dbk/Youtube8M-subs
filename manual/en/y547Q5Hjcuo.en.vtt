I want to show this technique called “flicking”,
because it’s the way that I knit, and it’s

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.680
almost a cross between Continental and English
knitting – I don’t know how to describe

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.680
it.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.720
I haven’t met very many people who knit
like this, but I wanted to shoot this video

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.750
because I do get this question a lot.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.890
People wanting to know how, how I do it, and
how they can knit like this.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.200
I’ll tell you – I haven’t always knit
like this. I made a conscious decision, I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.410
think in my 20s, that I didn’t want to let
go of the right needle anymore.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.860
That I was going to pick up speed if I could
still hang on to the right needle and get

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.160
the needle wrapped at the same time.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
So if you’ve been knitting the normal right
handed way of letting go of the right needle

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.250
and wrapping it, you can do it, too.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.470
You can just change the way you knit and force
yourself to have that economy of movement

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.040
which will pick up the speed.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.800
Let me show you.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.150
Okay, a normal right handed knitter puts the
needle in, wraps it, pulls it through, and

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.220
lets go of the right needle each time.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.040
Okay the way that I knit – whoops I just
did it the way that I knit.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.270
The way that I knit is I never let go of the
right needle.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.299
I actually use this point right here as a
pivot point, and I stabilize the tip of the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.520
left needle on – the tip of the right needle
on my left finger.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.200
And when I do that, I pop the needle back,
and a little flick of my index finger I get

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990
it wrapped and pulled through.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.950
So the needle is stabilized here, it’s a
pivot point here, I push, grab the yarn, and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.950
pull it through.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.960
It’s similar to how left handed people knit,
or Continental knitters knit, because it’s

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.049
just a kind of grabbing the yarn and pulling
it through, not really wrapping the needle

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.529
as much.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:59.429
So again, it’s in, cock it back, grab the
yarn, and pull it through.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:09.239
And then with purling, it’s about the same
thing.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:18.440
The only difference is that I’m holding
the yarn in front.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.370
I’ve never heard of another name other than
“flicking” for this technique.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.450
But this is how I knit, and how to do flicking.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.250
