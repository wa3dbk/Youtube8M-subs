Florida Virtual School Full Time is an online public school program

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.580
for students in kindergarten through twelfth grade.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.260
The types of students that thrive at Florida
Virtual School Full Time 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.800
are really all types of learners.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.520
The teachers at Florida Virtual School Full
Time really work hard to meet the needs of

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.050
different learning styles.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.090
So those students who need remediation are able to get the extra support.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.570
And those students who need challenge are given enrichment.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
We have athletes that are preparing for athletic careers.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.950
We have musicians, dancers, all kinds students

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.620
thrive here at Florida Virtual School Full Time.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.510
It helps me do better in school because I
have a more flexible schedule.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.229
I can think more and it makes me learn.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.930
It allows her to work at her level.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.809
If she's really understand things she can
move forward.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.979
When she's struggling she can reach out to the teacher,

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.940
she can get extra work to do, in order to
understand the concepts better.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.030
Our daily routine with Florida Virtual School
Full Time is gratefully, it's very flexible.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.189
I'll start with student about nine o'clock
or so.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.369
Then the other student who sleeps a little
later she'll start about an hour and a half or so.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.560
We just do it when we're up and ready to do it.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.300
When I wake up in the morning I go downstairs and I start my schedule.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.050
And then once I'm finished, we drive straight to gymnastics.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.860
The fact that you get to adjust your schedule depending on what you have to do.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.860
I'm a pianist so if I have lessons or if I
have a recital then I can adjust it to that day.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.320
One thing I really enjoy about Florida Virtual School Full Time is that

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.000
I have the ability to work with my children
one-on-one

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.960
and have access to certified teachers to help as well.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.850
It's been absolutely wonderful interacting
with the teachers at Florida Virtual Full Time.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.250
They're always have been available to me via phone as well as email.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.270
Almost sometimes within minutes when I needed help with something.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.229
Working one-on-one with students you really develop

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.759
a great rapport with them, with the families,
with the students.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.140
And just working and developing that rapport, 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.870
you're really able to see a lot of gains and
growth throughout the year.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.090
I love my relationships with my students and families because I get to interact with them more often.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.090
I'm on the phone with them constantly.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.870
We have some amazing clubs and social events and activities that we have here.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.510
I love interacting with my parents during
live lessons and field trips.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.500
How I interact with other students is we have webmail and then we also have discussions.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.690
It's fun. We email, we talk, we text,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.030
we call each other, we talk in live lessons.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.870
The teachers and the students, we're all like one big family.
