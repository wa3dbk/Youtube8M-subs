00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.210
This program will demonstrate injecting insulin.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.870
The goal is to inject the insulin into the
subcutaneous tissue between the top layer

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:25.020
of the skin, the dermis and the underlying
muscle layer.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.210
The only concentration of insulin available
in the United States is 100 units per milliliter.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.570
A milliliter is equal to a cubic centimeter.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.710
All insulin syringes are graduated to match
this concentration.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.840
Insulin syringes are available in various
volumes, for example: 3/10 cc, which would

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.540
hold a maximum dose of 30 units, 1/2 cc to
hold a maximum dose of 50 units and 1 cc to

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.850
hold a maximum dose of 100 units.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.320
Some insulins are cloudy suspensions.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.510
To ensure uniform dispersion of the insulin
in the cloudy suspension, roll the vial gently

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.880
between your hands.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.549
Avoid vigorous shaking, which will produce
air bubbles or foam and interfere with obtaining

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.720
the accurate dose.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.350
Wipe off the top of the bottle with an alcohol
swab.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.140
Discard the swab.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.850
Pick up the syringe and remove the needle
cap.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.060
With the syringe held upright, pull the plunger
back until the end of the plunger is at the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.690
mark of your dose,

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.240
which in this example is 20 units.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
There is now air in the syringe.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.460
Check the insulin bottle to ensure you have
the correct type of insulin.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.770
With the insulin bottle held firmly on a counter
or tabletop, insert the needle through the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.810
rubber cap into the bottle.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.420
Push the plunger down so that the air goes
from the syringe into the bottle.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.900
Turn the bottle upside down so that the air
in it is at the top.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.879
With the tip of the needle kept in the liquid,
pull the plunger back to your dose.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:39.209
If any air bubbles are in the syringe, push
the plunger back in and draw up the dose again.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.099
Remove the syringe and needle from the bottle.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:50.930
Do not let the needle touch anything else
until it touches your skin for the injection.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.269
Wipe the skin of the chosen injection site
with an alcohol swab and let the skin dry.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.279
Pinch up the skin and put the needle fully
through the skin at an 80 to 90 degree angle

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:12.419
and push the plunger down completely.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.390
Discard the syringe and attached needle into
a puncture-proof container and replace the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.800
container's screw cap.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.980
Instead of a puncture-proof container you
can purchase a special "Sharps" container

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.400
with a hinged lid to store your used syringes
and needles.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.839
"&gt;
When your storage or "Sharps" container is

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:42.189
3/4 full, dispose of it according to the policies
of your local authorities.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:49.949
The recommended sites for insulin injections
are shown.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.400
Change the place of each injection by moving
a couple of inches from the previous site.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:11.700
By doing this, you can stay in one general
area for several days.
