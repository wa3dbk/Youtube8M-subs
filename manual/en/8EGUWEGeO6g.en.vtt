&gt;&gt;Randy: Hello, my name is Randy Ritzenthaler
and I'm with R Squared Renovations, we are

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.160
a Dallas Texas general contracting company.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.770
Today I just want to give you a few pointers
on sizing mirrors, vanities and light fixtures.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.330
Getting them all to gel together and look
decent.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.770
A couple rules of thumb, when you have a small
vanity, just a single sink up to about 30

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.140
inches, your mirror and light fixtures could
be just a few inches narrower then the vanity

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
itself.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.730
Just to keep everything in proportion.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.809
The mirror and the light fixture can almost
be the exact same size.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.270
Generally you'll find something about 24 to
30 inches wide you can find a light fixture

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.180
that would be somewhere in the same ballpark.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.280
When you get into a larger vanity say 5 foot
even if it's just a single sink 5 foot vanity,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.530
I think a good rule of thumb is to have your
mirror about two thirds the size of the vanity.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.590
The light fixture could also be a little smaller
then the mirror.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.600
Proportionately you could go two thirds on
the mirror, and two thirds on the light fixture.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.590
When you get into larger double vanities,
you have to make the decision if you want

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.729
to go with two mirrors and two light fixtures
or one large mirror, generally you want to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.480
put two light fixtures up centered over the
sink bowl.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.799
You can take the information from a single
vanity and apply it to a large double just

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.409
to keep everything in proportion.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:49.960
If you have mirrors that you are dividing
you'd like to have equal space on both sides

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.680
of the mirrors and usually about half the
width of the mirror in between the two.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.329
Just a few things to help you make a decision
on lights, mirrors, and vanities.
