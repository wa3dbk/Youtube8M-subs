[ ring ring]

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.070
Lowery, Pick up the phone.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.820
Where have you been? You know I'm the only one left at the command center

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.349
Can you go down to the lab

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.500
and find out everything you can about

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.529
another Indominus Rex?

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.750
Did you say another Indominus Rex?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.079
Didn't we just kill one?

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.340
I'm afraid there is another one that is chasing us down.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.790
I'll hack my way into Dr. Wu's computer and see what I can find.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.150
thanks. Where are we going?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.500
To the lab. But we are to stop at the armory first. We are going to need a gun.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.250
Did you bring a flashlight?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.720
No

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.750
That's ok. It's a little dark here.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.530
[Dino screams]

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.600
It's behind you.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.960
Duck. Ahhhhh!

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.580
Run!

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.420
This should be good enough. Hide over here.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.030
[Dino screams]

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.240
Do you have another flare? No. I used the last one in the last fight.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.210
We need to distract T-rex

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.170
[Dino screams]

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.640
Give me your phone.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.590
What are you going to do? I'm going to create a distraction.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:53.420
You run as soon as I throw this phone.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.140

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.010
[Shoots] Run!

[Shooting]

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.860
Did you kill it? I'm not sure. But I'm not going to find out. Let's go.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.610
[Shooting]

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.989
Did you find out? I was trying to call you? What did you do with your phone?

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.019
I lost it. Look at this.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.640
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do
look at

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.819
You are right. Doctor Wu has been working on

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.489
another Indominux Rex. Look at this. I'm not a geneticist

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.470
but this Indominux Rex has a different genome sequence than

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.230
the previous Indominux Rex.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.620
So a mutant? Well....not really. Look at this genome sequence.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.709
What is it mean?

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.640
This gene only exists in primates like

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.760
chimpanzees, gorillas, humans.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.109
Are you saying this dinosaur is part human?

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.290
No,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.650
that's too far fetched.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.959
But I think this one could be  a lot smarter than previous dinosaurs.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.030
Unlike anything we've seen before.
