Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to show you how to create a select query in

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.619
Microsoft Access. Let's open Access, by double
clicking on this icon. Let's start a new blank

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:27.790
database. I'm just going to call this one
my database three. Let's create a new table.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:35.070
Add an ID field that is of the auto number
type. This way it will automatically increase

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.230
its number. Right click on ID, and make it
a primary key. Now let's add another field

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:49.409
and call it my text and leave it as a text
field. Let's save this as table one, and create

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:57.530
our query. To create your query, select the
queries subsystem of Access, and say select

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.190
great query and design view. It's going to
ask you what tables you want to include in

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.420
your query. Select table one, press add, and
say close. To include fields, click on them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.951
and drag them down here into the field area.
This is going to select field ID, and it's

00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:26.170
going to select field "my text." To run your
select query, just go to this little icon

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.880
at the top that says view and click on it.
There was no data in the table, so let's run

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.759
it again this time with some data. Close the
query and say save it. We're going to save

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:46.329
it as query one. Go back to the tables, let's
add some data. Let's say Dave's text and Dave's

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:53.869
text two. Now that we have data in our table,
let's close it, and run the query again. Just

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:03.210
double click on it, and as you can see, it
returns the data from the select query. My

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.079
name is Dave Andrews, and I just showed you
how to create a select query in Microsoft

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.659
Access.
