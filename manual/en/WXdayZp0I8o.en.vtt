00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.827
Valiant is really an iconic company in the history of comic books.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.964
We've sold over 80 million comic books in our history.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:17.734
We have Rai, X-O Manowar, Ninjak.

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.771
It’s a 750 million dollar industry in the United States,

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.006
and a 6 billion dollar industry globally.

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.643
Our ambition is to be the leading independent company in the comic book world.

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:30.447
The editor is the hub of the wheel of the production process

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.716
and Dropbox is right at the heart of that.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:36.453
The people who actually work in the trenches in creating the comics…

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:40.457
the writers, the artists, the colorists, the letterers, these are all freelancers.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.894
We employ dozens, maybe hundreds of freelancers.

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:46.096
They’re all over the US, they’re all over the world.

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.332
We’re just constantly transmitting files back and forth between all of us.

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:51.001
It’s all done via Dropbox.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.637
The comic book process really begins with the layout stage.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.140
The artist uploads high resolution scans of pencil pages via Dropbox.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.178
I pull them in from there and then I transmit them to an inker, also via Dropbox.

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:04.381
And then the inks come in and go to get colored, to get lettered.

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:07.617
At the same time that I send the files to the colorists in the Philippines,

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:11.388
I send the same black and white art to the letterer who is in Maryland.

00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:14.091
A finished comic could be a really international affair.

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:17.094
We have never missed a deadline at Valiant.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.696
Deadlines are very important in this business.

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.898
A comic has to go to the printer every 30 days,

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.701
so it has to be ready by that deadline, no matter what.

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:29.439
There’s been major snowstorms where we have been unable to come to the office.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.676
But our fans, who are not necessarily in New York,

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.479
they’re gonna be at the comic stores on Wednesday morning,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.180
looking for their Valiant comics.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.217
Our production staff works remotely as well as in-house.

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:43.854
So they’re able to access files that they need wherever they are.

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:47.824
Working remotely, we can meet our deadlines because of Dropbox for Business.

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:52.229
Conventions are a major part of the comic book industry.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.930
We have them almost every weekend.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.934
Our staff that’s working at the conventions, have work to do at the conventions

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.504
but also need to handle their real day to day work as well.

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:05.142
And whether they’re working on a laptop, an iPad, an iPhone, all using Dropbox for Business.

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:07.911
Dropbox for Business provides us with flexibility,

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:13.083
efficiency, ability to work remotely, cost-effective solution…

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.019
I mean, it really provides a technological backbone of what we’re doing

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.221
in comic book publishing here today.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.525
Dropbox for Business.
