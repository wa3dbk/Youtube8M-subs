00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.630
Hey guys Photoshop Pro Help here and today I'm going to be showing you how to really

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.360
whiten your skin and really go for that high
key effect, now as you can see this is the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.500
original image and we haven't yet applied
our effect, so I'm going to show you what

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.680
the effect will look like, so I'm going to
apply it, so here it is right here and it

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.590
really has brought most of the colour out
of the skin and brought in the shadows and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.900
really gone for that high key effect, so this
works great on self portraits and it will

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.840
work just as well if you have plenty of other
people with in the pictures and you can really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.360
play around with the settings, if you have
a high definition image it will work brilliantly,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.730
if you have a standard one it wont work as
well but it will give it a good kick, so we

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.420
are going and play around with this now, so
it only takes 3 steps, only 3 adjustment layers,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.939
so we are just going to hide that and we are
going to go the to bottom right hand side

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.570
now and we are just going to go to this little
circle that's black and white, click that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.890
and we are just going to play around with
the "channel mixer", click that and all we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.469
are going to do is make sure we have "monochrome" clicked on and that takes all the colour out

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.579
of the image, so we are going to hide that
panel and we are going to "duplicate" this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.950
layer twice, so we can do that by pressing
"ctrl" + "J" or "command" + "J"if you have

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.619
a mac, so do that "twice" and we are just
going to hide those top "2 layers" and play

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.689
around with the first layer, so for the "first
layer" we are just going to bring the "opacity"

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.400
to around about "32%" and all we really want
to do is just bring down the skin tone just

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.039
so she is pale but not to much that the colour
is going to much out of it, now once we have

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:09.700
done that we are going to bring on the next
layer, click that and we are going to bring

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.450
the "blending mode" to "screen" and this really brightens the image up but it has brightened

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.600
it to much so we are going to bring the "opacity" to around about "20%" but as I said play around

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.220
with it because each image is totally different, so we want to brighten it up but not to much,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.420
so I'm just going to show you what it looks
like, a lot brighter and we are going to bring

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.400
in our next layer, so un hide that, we are
going to change the "blending option" to "soft

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.440
light" and we are just going to play around
with the "constant" and as you can see it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.620
really makes it darker and it brings in the
colour a bit more, so I'm going to go for

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.300
around about "-58" for this, but really play
around with this, so all we want to do is

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.180
really bring in the shadows, bring in that
colour a bit more and as you can see that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.280
is the job done, that's all we have to do
and it was really easy to get that high class

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.640
key look, so we are just going to go and group these together so hold down "ctrl" or "command"

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.710
if you have a mac and go and select all 3
layers and then press "ctrl" + "G" or "command"

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:35.600
+ "G" if you have a mac to group them and
you can really just play around if you want

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.840
to change the settings because these are all
adjustment layers so you can just go back

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.300
in and change them if need be, now I've done
this to this image and there are a few others

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.370
so lets go and look at the others and see
what they turned out like, so there is this

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.200
one, so as we can see its just paled it down
and really brought in the dark tones and the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.300
shadows and I'm going to jump to this next
one, so if I just take it off and this one

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.600
was pretty vibrant but it was a bit to tacky
for my liking so it was a bit to in your face

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.560
and I really wanted to bring that luxurious
feel in to the image, so I just toned it down

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.100
and this is what it ends up like, so it really
depends on your taste, you can play around

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.680
with the setting so you can get it just right
but you can have a lot of fun with this, so

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.060
that is a simple technique to try out, so
go and play around with it and let me know

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.600
if you do need any help, so that's about it,
