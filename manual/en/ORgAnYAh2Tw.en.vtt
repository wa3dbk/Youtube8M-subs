00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.443
Claudio: I feel like you really slacked off and

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:05.784
you just-
Hero: I can do more if you like!
C: No, wait, wait!

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:07.772
I think the audience has suffered enough.

00:00:07.972 --> 00:00:09.711
We're done I think. I think we're done here.

00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:10.980
Hero: Okay.
Claud: I think we're done here.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.007
Hero: Bye guys!

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:17.615
Pedro: Alright, well, if that hasn't put

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.601
Beatrice and Benedick off this video, I don't
know what will, sorry you all had to see that.

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:24.228
Okay, we're all gathered here today

00:00:24.408 --> 00:00:27.415
for a very specific reason.
So that's got rid of Team Blessed.

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.570
Hero: And now allow me to introduce the new team.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.467
H: We have Balthazar, Ursula, Meg

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:39.108
H: Pedro, Claud, and myself.

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:41.385
Introducing Team Love Gods.

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:45.585
Pedro: They really are

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.098
like an old married couple. The other day

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:49.734
I was hanging out with Beatrice

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.880
For six hours, she was going on about something

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.218
Ben said. And then that night I was hanging
out with Ben. Guess what he talked about?

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:02.482
Pedro: Ridiculous.
Claud: Was it Beatrice? [everyone laughs]

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:03.897
Balthazar: So the other night, right

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:06.519
[stammers] It was just, like, as I normally do.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.343
I was playing Ben a song I've been
working on, right?

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.885
And then, he just says,
"Oh you know what,

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:14.832
I've got some ideas for lyrics."
And it's just basically, you can tell

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:16.122
it's just all about

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.295
saying this girl is just a bitch, right?

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.547
And it's so clearly about her but he
wouldn't admit

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.900
anything to do with it.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.291
Pedro: Beatrice is a B is a
good title for a song though.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:27.193
Balthy: But imagine the return song
that she would then write.

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:27.873
Claudio laughs

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:29.786
Claud: No that reminds me
actually the other day

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.907
Ben actually showed up on one of our dates.

00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:32.755
Everyone: What?

00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:35.309
Claud: We went to a movie and

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.055
we bought tickets and we sat down

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:39.851
and then Ben was in the row behind us

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.628
Now, whether or not that was planned, I don't know.
Pedro: It was planned.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:48.979
Hero: I reckon the best part was
reaching between us for our popcorn.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:50.609
Pedro: Well as we can see

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:52.729
we've all had it up to here

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.597
Pedro: Can I get a-
Balthazar: Raise it.
Pedro: Oh more, okay.

00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:58.384
Balthy: Maybe, yeah, yeah!
P: Out of shot, probably.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:02:00.632
Hero: Well, I suppose it's in
everyone's best interest

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.200
for them to be happier.
Balthy: Mmm.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.239
Meg: Also we're bored.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.471
Pedro: Am I the only one who thinks
they're perfect for each other?
Hero: No, no, it's like destiny.

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.937
P: So we're going to get them together.

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:12.470
Hero: We're going to get them together.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.670
Pedro: At least that's the plan.

00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.768
Thoughts? Team?
Meg: Well, you know my ideas.

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:22.298
P: Yeah we're not kidnapping them.
We're not doing plot of Saw at all.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.157
Ursula: We could have them eavesdrop

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:28.395
on conversations of
us talking about each of them

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:29.823
liking the other one.

00:02:30.023 --> 00:02:34.829
Claud: Does it have to eavesdrop?
Can we not just be outright like "Hey, guess who likes-"
Pedro: No, no, no.

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.748
P: 'Cause that will make
Beatrice think she's like

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:40.151
"I'm so clever. I overheard them and like

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.485
they weren't going to tell
me but I knew."

00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:44.759
Ursula: Yeah.
Pedro: Yes.

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.970
Hero: Keep the suspicion down?
Pedro: Keep the suspicion down.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.000
And then we'll just...

00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.089
do a fishing metaphor.

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:56.000
Hero: Do you really think that-
Claud: Hook, line, and sinker.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.297
Pedro: Hook, line and sinker! that's the one I was
looking for, thank you! Alright.

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.505
P: Perfect. We'll hash out the details later.

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:05.959
Watch this space. [clicks mouth]
