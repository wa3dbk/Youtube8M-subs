00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.979
Hello, Ken Burgin here from Profitable Hospitality
looking at Why Restaurants Go Broke.

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:07.369
Let's have a look at what the profit and loss
statement would be as I've got a simple version

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:09.149
of the P &amp; L here.

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.089
On the left, costs - a combination of variable
costs that goes up and down according to how

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.149
busy you are, the fixed costs are the ones
that have been negotiated (leases,loans, insurance),

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:27.509
things that XX and stays the same and often
ones that cause big problems.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.609
On the right, we've got our income here, we've
got 8,800 a week made up of a thousand customers

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:39.589
spending $8.80 per person. Some other figures
we've got here.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:47.659
The blue figures are labor costs - combination
of casual, fixed wages, and the on-costs of

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.648
workers' compensation, insurance, superannuation,
etc. - that's calculated on the total of the

00:00:53.648 --> 00:00:58.878
other 2 blue figures. Now, put all those 3
blue figures together, we've got an employee

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:04.408
cost of 39% - that's the total cost over our
sales.

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:09.949
Prime cost is a figure that's often looked
at a combination of employee cost plus food

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:17.399
and beverage cost. In this case, 67%. Anything
above 60% you've got to be a little concerned.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.949
Now there's another important figure here
which is the weekly interest payments on a

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:34.469
loan that loan is a $150,000 dollars paid
9% interest which is low for commercial loans.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.069
Working that out, that would be $260 dollars
per week.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:44.999
so, let's have a look at some of the events
that cause our business to drop into a loss.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:53.559
you can see we're right on break-even point
here with a profit of just 0. If we had another

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:56.949
100 customers a week, of course that would
make a difference, wouldn't it. That would

00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:06.228
move us into a profit. But, let's leave it
on break-even point. It's usually the problems

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:11.769
start to arise because not enough customers
and they're not spending as much as expected.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.440
If the customers went down to 900 a week,
maybe it's a quiet week XX or whatever, you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.659
can see that moves us into a loss. Or maybe
they're going to spend less money because

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.739
of tight economic conditions, that moves us
into a loss as well. If we had the 2 things

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.409
together, that gives an even more painful.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:43.189
Let's leave those reduced figures there, but
I now particularly want to look at my concerns

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:50.369
around these fixed costs because in my experience,
you can see how our ret cost which is a percentage

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:55.949
of sales has gone - I think it started off
at about 12 and a half percent, we're now

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:04.029
up to 14 and a half percent. Bench mark should
be in the 6-8% figure. This is very high.

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.669
Remember there's only a hundred cents in a
dollar and a 14 and a half cents is already

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:16.169
going in the occupation costs. So, that is
one figure that we need to be concerned about.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:22.809
I'm gonna highlight that in red. That is one
of the main reasons why businesses go broke.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:29.919
They may not be very efficient up here in
the variable costs but they've signed a lease

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:36.649
that is just too expensive and the cost of
paying that week in week out becomes unaffordable.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:45.199
The other one is loan costs here. You can
see we've got $260 a week of interest payments

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:54.199
here - that's not insignificant for sales
of below $8000 here. And that's on a loan

00:03:54.199 --> 00:04:03.259
of $150,000 paying 9% interest, but in my
experience, people usually have borrowed much

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:13.289
more than that. What if that was $400,000,
what's that look like on a weekly basis? Wow,

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:19.399
that's pretty difficult, isn't it? Even if
we took out numbers here back to where we

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:27.949
started and remember on a $150,000 loan, we
were break-even, but with a $400,000 loan,

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:37.509
we're making a loss. Maybe you haven't been
lucky enough to get 9% interest, maybe your

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:44.449
interest is more - 11% or something. You see,
it gets very difficult.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.199
In summary, why do restaurants go broke? Obviously,
there can be inefficiencies here, we do have

00:04:51.199 --> 00:05:00.249
labor costs that are very high. But, the main
problem comes around fixed costs. The rent

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:07.209
is too high or the burden of finance that
they've got - loan costs, loan repayments

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:15.209
- is much too high. I've highlighted those
2 in red and put your own figures here, you

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:16.479
can see how this works.

own figures in. This is excellent for someone

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:33.899
who's starting a business, who wants to look
at the feasibility of the idea they got in

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:40.879
mind, and also a good tonic for people who
are already running a business to see how

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.559
their figures take up.

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:49.399
Thanks for being part of the video today.
