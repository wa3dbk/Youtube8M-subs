their stethoscope.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.820
...of all the culmination of all the hard work that I've done...and, uh, all the steps that I've taken...

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.600
to get this point; so there's a little bit of  that, there's a little bit of excitement, uh...

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.330
...for the future, a lot of nervousness; um, kind of just a whole...

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.230

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.520
Luce Auriane, MS1: Growing up and saying 'I want to be a doctor,' and here I am...

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.650

definitely a big, emotional day for us.

Thanh Cao, MS1: A lot of the excitement that's going on right now is my nerves kind of running s little bit.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.220

Alessandro Carotenuto, MS1: My grandmother suffers from Alzheimer's and so I, but...

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.350
...she doesn't live in states, so I took it
upon myself to go help...

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.340
...those that can I reach. It kind of
verified my, my love for patient care.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.560
Luce Auriane, MS1: Because I was born in the Ivory Coast, which is in Western Africa, and then growing up, you know, and seeing poverty and social injustice...

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.450
...then coming here to the US and comparing both lives and seeing how you can improve...

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.110
....so much by being a physician. It was definitely like a turning point for me.

Thanh Cao, MS1: I've always been inspired with science, and..uh...had a keen interest in science...

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.079
...but it's that connection that you have
with your patients is what motivated me; that...

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.899
...this is what I wanted to do: take science
to a different level and...

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.640
...move from the bench side to the bedside and provide that compassion and care.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.800
