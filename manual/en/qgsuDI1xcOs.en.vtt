00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.630
Now whether you are going to try something
just once for a costume or maybe a special

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.140
events or for a show or maybe you would like
to start building your wardrobe to have some

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.309
real fun vintage pieces to work into, either
way let me suggest some ideas you can look

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.270
for. First of all I am so excited when I find
some really awesome vintage dresses. I think

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.340
there are great ones out there you can wear
any day of the week. You can wear for a wedding

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.480
or for nice or for whatever and I know a lot
of people might be a little bit hesitant but

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.969
it looks like I am wearing a costume. But
hey as long as you look nice and feel great,

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.329
who cares. You can dress it up more or make
it a little more subtle. But either way, I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.940
just think the vintage dresses and pieces
in general are just classic and they are timeless

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.399
and they just look lovely on ladies. I'll
refer back to this one here. This one here

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.869
is a little vintage one that I found that
I think you can dress up and dress down and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:03.690
it has some really nice detailing on there.
You just don't see this, the sequences and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.670
what not. Just really really beautiful and
to me when you find sometimes the craftsmanship

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.640
of vintage clothing you can tell they doubled
lined it. None of the sequences have even

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.090
fallen off which I think is amazing. Other
staples that I think that are really really

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.659
great to incorporate into your wardrobe are
just simple cardigans. Again, if you are on

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.432
E-Bay, type in sequence vintage cardigan sweater
and find some really great pieces. There are

00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:41.710
lot of them out there. This here I believe
a little wool sweater and you are going to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.929
find a lot of them like this. Some cute little
pearls, sequences and some little rhinestones.

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.780
This you could even layer up over a dress
like this or if you wanted to wear this to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.460
dress it up or dress it down, why not pair
it up with a pair of jeans, a little modern

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.821
under day shirt, throw this over and this
adds a really nice little styling to it. This

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:11.450
one here is angora lambs wool blend. You could
again find a lot of these and even wow! this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.560
is a unique piece. Where am I going to find
this. Again, type in cardigan sweater vintage

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.180
sequins either are E-Bay or on-line. You are
going to find some great pieces. They can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.760
run you anywhere from a few dollars to $30
bucks and these are in great shape too. Again,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.099
this is great for layering with modern pieces
or layering for a full vintage look over a

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:42.459
vintage dress. So those are some really good
pieces to keep in mind. Some cardigan sweaters

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:50.190
and vintage dresses as well. If you are going
to like a wedding or say a party, prom or

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.640
dance, I love the little vintage party dresses.
If you are on-line, you might want to type

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.530
in vintage prom or party dress, swing dress.
The down side of these are they are not always

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.829
going to be the most comfortable. Little petticoats
that you find underneath, they add a great

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.560
puffiness underneath the dress and they can
be a little bit itchy so I would recommend

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.060
wearing some tights underneath it or some
bloomers because it is a little bit scratchy

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.640
on your legs even though they are really really
cute. So I think that these are really really

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.561
popular. These are super cute. I think they
look great. Always if you want to look for

00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:38.251
some tops to use, something like this you
could wear with modern day skirt, modern day

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:43.250
jeans or you could vintage it up with a vintage
skirt on the bottom if you like. And these

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.319
shells, you might want to type in vintage
shells are also really great staples that

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.140
you can incorporate in with like a vintage
pencil skirt. They are really really sweet

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.209
and I really think they have the timeless
look to them and they are really really nice.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.669
So those are some vintage basic staples that
you can look for when you are hunting around.
