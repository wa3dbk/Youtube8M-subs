00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.420
friend of mine has it that will in l_a_

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.490
that if there are more than two persians
aunty on it

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.139
either team he will play basse-bolle

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.509
that because their pain and that's the
key is there anything definite because

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.919
they don't passable

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.310
and it often

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.390
the serbs grocers issue that we just
played ball global budget break ins

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.849
half of them did not fit that all they
were great ballplayers other half

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.599
well we fit that description

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.679
in the balls guy thinks he she should
everything

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.940
stricken ball

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.890
it witnesses is a sense of entitlement

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.200
it has nothing to that uh... departures
of arts but it has to do with the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.370
direction does allow the prisoners
founder achcha right right this day the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.660
same time of like while i passed the
ball

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.150
before games being played so i can shoot
more

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.010
and then he goes

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.140
they were playing

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.140
defects are okay

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.739
judge exit is it okay to be racial
cycles

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.440
and make it too personal

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.880
unrest or

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.710
that those two

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.199
even if it's on the other team will play
in

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.130
net he first choice for cheap parts of
favorite is gonna play

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.630
but if he says is more than two f
bridges on either side

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.969
you begin to decide commissioned by the
flood an open process

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.590
are another battle over them

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.590
but not i sometimes the situations i
like unplanned falls involved as the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.700
morning people playing from watching and
waiting for the next year

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
related walked into court of it was i
was driven from their ourselves that's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.690
you know i'm glad he reminded me because
you know what happened is we had one of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.150
the guys are our team

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.130
on the racial stuff of course is to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.550
rediculous originals i think is the best
players on the other two were partners

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.270
and a past may play defense they were
played well i

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.640
anyway but our guys appealable straight
people play defense is that right

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.870
because of budget talks while weather
forecast garters guy

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.520
every single basket is scored by the guy
he's covered we switch into three

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.259
different guys

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.450
that this man is that he's not a bad
light

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.649
he could be a good place to be just what
the plan

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.970
so that we lost because of course there
is another wide-open show from his

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.059
player and the one thirty twelve pdt
date

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.049
next game

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.879
he's on the other two

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.280
and season okay

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.450
because i'm a decent shooter caesar make
sure you got him

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.919
hasn't he won't go review

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:23.609
and look at all

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.159
all budget will be shocked

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.419
so sick is said to be on the court has
got a kit

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.430
