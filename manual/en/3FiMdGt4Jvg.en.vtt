I’m Doctor Ed Weaver with Woolerton Optometry
in Woolerton, North Carolina on behalf of

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.860
Expert Village to tell you how to care for
your contact lenses. Contact lens solutions

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.269
should always be approved for the use; such
as “soft lens only” for soft lenses, “hard

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.021
lens only” for hard lenses, it’s a different
solution for each of those contact lenses.

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.090
Some people are sensitive to the preservatives
in some solutions and if they are they need

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.010
to stay away from it. The problem is they
only learn this by trial and error and if

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.750
they have a reaction they will know to stay
away from a particular, a particular solution,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.130
disinfecting solution. One of the things that
you should know about contact lens solutions

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.649
is that the, to store it overnight it needs
to have the word disinfecting on the label.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.949
Many of the low cost solutions will not have,
will have the word; overnight or storage or

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.339
soft lenses or sensitive eyes but they will
not have the word disinfecting. And that disinfecting,

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.100
that word disinfecting is critical in order
to kill the bacteria to make it where it will

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.149
be safe for the next day. So you need to always
look for that, you should never have your

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.269
contact lenses touch tap water, the reason
for that is that there are certain contaminants

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.269
in tap water, particularly some parasites
that could become embedded in the contact

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:13.660
lens and eventually affect your eye. Also
your

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:25.080
contact lenses should not come in contact
with river or creek water, fresh water, it’s

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.330
been known to contain the parasites, the same
parasites in that water. Currently there is,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.700
are a lot of alarms for freshwater contamination
of soft contact lenses. Saltwater, from the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:50.720
ocean is not nearly as, as critical, but freshwater
is. And the last thing is hot tubs, chlorine

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.600
and other chemical related waters should not
come in contact with your lenses, because

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.050
those chemicals will become embedded in the
contact lens and you’ll end up wearing the

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.670
chemicals in your eyes for days and days,
not good either.
