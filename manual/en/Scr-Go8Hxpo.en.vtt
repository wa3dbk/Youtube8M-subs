00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.629
You know, you can use apples for a lot more
than just eating.

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:19.980
You know, I'm always looking for interesting
ways to display ordinary things, like candles

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.380
on a table for a party.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.150
So it's the fall of the year.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.720
What's plentiful out there?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.779
Certainly apples.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.869
You can find them at a farmer's market, a
farm stand, you can go to the orchard, or

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260
you can just pick them up at in the grocery
store.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.649
What I doing here is I'm actually making some
little apple candle holders for a festive

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.300
table decoration.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.079
These are really easy to make and let me just
show you.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.100
It's as simple as taking an apple that, well,
you wanna make sure that apple will sit by

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
itself and sit upright so it doesn't roll
around on the table, for obvious reasons.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.839
This one is doing a sterling job.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.539
And I have one here that I've just placed
a votive candle on the top and I used a pen

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.809
just to go around and score the exact diameter
of it.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.180
And you can see that circle there.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.870
Now it's just a matter of taking a little
paring knife and cutting directly into the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.580
apple, straight in like this.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.930
And cutting very carefully around the edge.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.500
And then you can take a melon baller, which
has a sharp edge, and you can just take out

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.530
that core of the apple.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.040
See how simple this is?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.410
You get a nice, clean cut edge with this melon
baller.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.320
Okay, then it's just a matter of sort of sizing
the candle.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.180
It's better not to make it too large in the
beginning, because you can always cut it out

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.430
but you can't put it back in there.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.950
Alright, so there we go.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.650
And you can see, that fits just about right
with just a little pressure.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.330
What I like to do to keep the edges of the
apple from shriveling, because we've cut into

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.450
it it's likely to dehydrate, and it will discolor
as we know apples will, you can take just

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.319
a little bit of lemon juice, like this, and
apply it to the flesh of the apple like that.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.760
And that'll keep it from discoloring, at least
for your party.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.201
Now the other thing that I've done with pumpkins
and acorn squash and things like that that

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:25.000
I've cut, you can actually take a little petroleum
jelly or Vaseline and rub right around the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.260
edge, and that will seal this off and keep
it from loosing moisture and shriveling around

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.260
the edge.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.260
Just another little tip.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.170
You see, this sits in just like that, and
then you can light it and let some of the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.510
candle wax drip around the edges, like I have
here, to sort of seal that gap, if there is

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.840
one, between the candle and the apple itself.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.280
Now, you can see, I have an arrangement here
that the colors work beautifully with this.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.750
Now just imagine these lining a table all
lighted with these beautiful arrangements.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.170
You can make a magical table setting.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.210
Now, if you like this idea, share it with
a friend.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.940
I'd love to hear your comments on it.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.240
And if you've done anything like this with
other sorts of fruits and vegetables.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:28.920
