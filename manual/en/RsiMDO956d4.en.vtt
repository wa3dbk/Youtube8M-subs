CUSTOMISING THE CAR

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.150
We’ve chosen this Nissan because it’s one of the few 
vehicles that you can get which is still a very basic vehicle. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.000
It has no electronics in it – it has wind-up windows, naturally 
aspirated 4.2 litre diesel engine – so it’s got masses of power 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.080
under the bonnet. Being able to keep the occupants in the 
vehicle safely heated at minus 50 degrees, and equally being 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.150
able to keep the engine running at an operating temperature, 
is going to be a big challenge for us.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.100
So what we’ve done is we’ve chosen a Webasto heater which 
is a great big diesel powered heater which runs independently

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.230
of the engine – and that’s going to give us extra heat into 
the engine through the cooling system.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.030
The roof lining has been pulled out, the side panels have been 
pulled out, and we’ve stuffed it full of insulation. On the floors 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.230
we’ve actually taken the whole mat up and we’ve put foil down – 
and felt, which is 30mm thick – to give us a huge amount of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.050
insulation. And in order to get this vehicle really, really safe, we’ve 
fitted a custom-built roll cage. So we’re going to upgrade the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.060
suspension, stronger springs, better shock absorbers – 
and lastly, the most important thing is the grip on the road – 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.160
and the only way we’re going to achieve that is by 
putting specialised snow tyres on.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.150
We’ve insulated the battery – this is a gel battery. The fuel 
system has got a heater on it – so this will warm the fuel as 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.110
it comes in – and if we leave the engine running all night we’ve 
got a warning system over here; if the engine should cut out, 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.030
we’ll be able to hear this buzzer.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.080
You lose most of the heat coming out through the top of the 
engine as it rises up so we’ll put this thick, felt blanket across 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.030
the engine – literally like you cover yourself with a duvet – we’re 
going to trap the heat from escaping. Simple but very effective.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.220
Something we’ve had to do here in Yakutsk is to double-glaze 
the windscreens – and these guys are amazing the way they do it; 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.130
they took another windscreen, some insulation to give an air 
gap, and then it gets stuck on the windscreen. Never have I 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.170
seen this done anywhere else.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.170
I think it’s okay – 4-wheel-drive and good tyres – 
it goes anywhere.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.000
That works.
Yeah, that works.
