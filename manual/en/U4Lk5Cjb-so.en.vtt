Wood, one of the most elegant and toughest
sculpture materials that there is. I'm Robert

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.140
Markey, an artist and I'm talking about making
are with wood. The possibilities are pretty

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.739
endless. Here's a sculpture made of steel,
wood, actually a actually a locust log, marble

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.879
and more steel. The wood can just add a whole
new dimension to something as very straight

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:59.090
ahead, wshh.. the curve the beauty of that.
Over here we have another piece. A hanging

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:12.140
sphere.. made of wood that's been burnt, charred,
cut out, held together with metal wire and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:23.079
then charred to be hung up in a tree, o.k.
These are just two, two possibilities. Wood

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:31.719
can be carved. Wood can be glued together
to create a laminated thing. Wood can be bent

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.770
in to a circle in to any kind of shape you
want it. You can carve wood and make wood

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:48.619
block prints out of it. You can paint wood.
You can put wood on something else to make

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.710
a basically a wooden mosaic out of that. The
possibilities are really endless in terms

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.960
of what you can do to make art from wood.
There's a sculptor up in Vermont who makes

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.200
huge sculptures out of lengths of firewood
and they're beautiful. So the possibilities

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.380
are really going to list. I'm Robert Markey,
I've been talking about using wood to make

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.381
art.
