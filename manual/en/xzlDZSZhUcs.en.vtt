00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.480
one, two, three, four!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.500
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.700
if your thinking about upgrading your headlights to these
new high intensity blue lamps, then stay

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.000
tuned, because I'm going to show you how easy it
is to do with one of these kits,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.119
now some people install these
high-intensity blue lights, because they

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.900
like the way they look, but me I'm
putting them in because I'm getting old, and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.090
they work three times better at night, so
I can see, I just got mine from motor

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.310
online for 59 bucks, installation is
pretty simple, you just take the old bulb

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.600
out, then unplug it, then you get the
ballast resistor in the wiring, plug it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.030
in to where the light was, this clip here
fits right in to where your old socket

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.280
was, it just snapped right in, then the new
HID bulb goes back into the car, fits

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.660
into the hole and it twists in place to
lock it and then the other end plugs

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.250
into the ballast resistor and voila
there is and just look at the difference

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.780
here's the new one, and here's the old one, it
doesn't work nearly as well it doesn't

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.369
look as cool either and of course you
want to do a neat job, so bolt it in

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.549
place with the bolts that it comes with,
so it's nice and solid and doesn't

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.470
rattle around, then of course do the
other side, so the two match and voila

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.640
there they are, all done didn't take but
five minutes and believe it or not they

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.860
actually use 35 percent less energy than
halogen bulbs, so if you want to look

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.299
cool and see better at night, why not try
some of these high intensity xenon

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.740
lights, and remember if your car has any
problems just visit the Scotty Kilmer

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.130
channel,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.870
before it's too late!
