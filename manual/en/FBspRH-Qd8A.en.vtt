Erik: How has recipe writing taught you to
be more creative?

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.660
Julie: Recipe writing is very hard.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:18.150
People don't realize that -- I mean, it's
an art form and it's a skill.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.619
You know, not only does it apply to my blog
where you have to make sure -- if you get

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.060
something wrong in your recipe people are
gonna tell you about it.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.169
People are very willing to share when they
post on your blog.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.200
I've got some -- I've gotten some comments
where I feel like I've really upset someone,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
you know?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.720
There are some people that leave funny comments.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.610
So you've gotta be meticulous about making
sure that -- you gotta learn how to read what

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.129
you're writing and make sure that it makes
sense to people, it's chronological, that

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.920
you're not leaving things out.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.870
And then with cooking contests you're basically
graded on whether or not you write a good

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.870
recipe.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.439
One example was the "Build a Better Burger"
contest.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.380
This is a contest that they get 8,000 to 10,000
entries a year.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.300
It's a huge grand prize of $100,000.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.600
So the first year that I entered I ended up
getting into the finals.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.880
I was one of the five finalists.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.660
So we're sitting there before the contest
and we're talking to the people that did the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.150
judging and, of the initial batch and they
said that out of whatever, 8,000 entries there

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.130
were a few hundred that were acceptable, that
either didn't -- and their rules are laid

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.960
out very clearly, you know?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.280
Make sure your ingredients are in order, just
very simple things like that, but they said

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460
people just, they're not organized.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.720
They don't take the time to have like a fresh
set of eyes look at it if they're not used

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.340
to writing recipes or just, you know, making
sure that it makes sense.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.490
So it's a way of communication, you know?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.510
You're giving someone directions on how to
do something.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.810
And I think, you know, in a way it does help
you to think very logically on how to teach

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.150
people how to do things.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.940
And I think once you get comfortable with
putting things like that down on paper, it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.540
also makes you more comfortable when you talk
about a recipe and talk people through it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.840
because you're basically doing that in your
head as you're writing down the recipe.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.250
So, you know, it's kind of a stepping-stone
to maybe doing a recipe demo on camera.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.760
So it's kind of a training process.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.370
Erik: And where does creativity come into
that?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
Julie: Well, as far as like creating the recipes,
you know, you just gotta get comfortable in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.860
the kitchen.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.180
It's the kind of thing where, you know, get
comfortable around the ingredients, you gotta

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.870
know what works.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.050
There are certain things that work together.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.690
I mean, when you think about a baking recipe
you know you have to have leavening.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.810
You know, you have to have something that's
gonna make the thing rise.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.050
So you gotta know what works with what ingredients,
you know?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.260
So there are certain basics that each recipe
has to have and then you can start playing

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.260
around with flavor profiles.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.160
And there are a lot of things that don't work.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.260
You know, I've made some disasters.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.930
But you never know because I've had some flavors
that come together that are maybe unorthodox

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.630
that end up being amazing, you know?

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:19.570
So it's -- it is a very creative process,
I mean absolutely.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.370
And it's a lot of, like just a lot of trial
and error.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.680
And you know, every once in a blue moon, you
get that winning combination.
