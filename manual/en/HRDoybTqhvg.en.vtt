off, don’t do this at home.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.911
I am going to try to jump off the play set
and use this as a

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:47.911
parachute.

00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.660
Even though its only like four feet off the
ground.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.900
For some reason I think this is

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.690
a bad idea.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:03.130
Yea this is probably a really bad idea I can
get like tangled in the parachute.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.220
Okay I think I got maybe whoops kind of like
half way point.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.320
Here we go so this is the

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.490
parachute.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.490
This is just a bad idea okay.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.389
Should I stand up? oh yea.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.560
Okay this is just a bad

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.950
idea.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.099
One two three.

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.900
Yea the parachute did nothing.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.960
It was still fun though.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.120
Alright so now

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.820
we are going to take the parachute and make
a big mushroom out of it lift it up run under

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.820
it

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.319
really fast and then tuck it underneath us
and it will make a big pillow cloud thing.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.319
Okay

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.319
