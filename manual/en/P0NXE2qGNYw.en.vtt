00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.230
We're just come up here onto the reef platform

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.230
on Browse Island and this expansive

3
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.230
place that we've come to see

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.230
what else is living here, and of course one of the risks

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230
that have to be careful of while we're walking

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.880
around is Stonefish, and if we

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.890
walk in here, we're lucky enough

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.890
to have found one.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890
This one's called a Reef Stonefish

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.130
it's not the same as the real Stonefish

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.130
but almost as venomous

12
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.130
and just as spectacular.

13
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.160
If you have a look at this guy here you'll struggle to see him

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160
unless you really get in close

15
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
and you can see

16
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.960
looks just like a stone

17
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.440
has a little bit of algae growing all over him

18
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.040
and he's hiding there waiting for something to come past that he can eat

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.650
these guys have 13 venomous spines along their back

20
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.630
and if see here, each one of these little spines

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.010
is highly venomous and has two little sacks

22
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.210
of venom at the base of each one, adn when you step down on it

23
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.400
it slides the sheath of skin down

24
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
and the venom is injected

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.230
into you, just like out of a hypodermic syringe

26
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.230
if you're unlucky enough to step on one

27
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.230
of these things you'll be dancing around in all sorts of

28
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.230
pain and all sorts of agony

29
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.230
we can treat, but it's going

30
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.230
a last a long time and there's not much you can do

31
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.230
other than some warm water and hopefully

32
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.230
and some pain killers and lots of rest

33
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.230
so he sits on the reef like this

34
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.230
and he's just waiting for something to come past

35
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.230
opens his mouth and creates a vacuum

36
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.230
sucks in the little fish that he can eat

37
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.230
but of course while he's sitting here he's

38
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.230
highly vunerable, and so he needs these

39
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.230
incredibly venomous

40
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.230
spines to act as protection

41
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.230
These guys are also really, really

42
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.230
hardy. Living here on this intertidal reef

43
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.230
platform, they spend an awful lot of time

44
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.230
at low tide, and in fact

45
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.230
out of the water, they can spend 24 hours

46
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.230
out of the water and still survive.

47
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.230
If they happen to be stuck up on a rock

48
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.500
they wait, and eventually the tide comes back in and away they go.
