00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.709
Hi I'm John Graden for the Martial Arts Teacher's
Association. As a fighter and as a coach here

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:10.780
are two offensive strategies that once you
learn to understand that everything falls

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.960
into place and quite simply it is a direct
attack versus an indirect attack. You want

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.289
to become a master of both but the real intricacy,
the real advanced student really becomes a

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.500
master at the indirect attack. What do I mean
by this? Joining me from Pro Star Mixed Martial

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.870
Arts is Mr. Joe Brignoli. A direct attack
just like it implies, I am out where I set

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.210
point control without a fake, without anything
else, I simply step in, pow, and I directly

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.320
attack him. That is fine, however, if he is
bigger, stronger, faster, more experienced

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.350
than me, stepping in with a direct attack
could be kind of dangerous especially if he

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.649
is a really good counter fighter. So I want
to become a master of the indirect attack

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.320
so possibly in this case I'm going to throw
a little fake on him. In other words I'm going

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
to hit him with this jab but I'm going to
go about it indirectly. So I might, I've got

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.940
this much distance to cover in order to get
in there. If I go direct he is going to clock

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.580
me as I come in and I don't want that to happen
so I go about it indirectly. I'll throw a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.010
little fake on him, draw that punch out, and
then finish the attack by stepping in the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.840
rest of the distance so it is an indirect
attack. So a direct attack, nothing proceeds

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.180
it and an indirect attack is usually proceeded
by a fake or some kind of draw step or something

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.040
that sets the attack up. You want to hit him
with the punch or the kick but because of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.920
their counter fighting skills or speed or
power you'll want to go about it indirectly.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.380
So become a master at direct attacks and indirect
attacks and when to use each. I'm John Graden.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.920
