00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.280
Hi, I'm Clara from Online Fabric Store.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.940
Sewing your own decorative throw pillow is a great DIY project for all sewing levels.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.580
There are many different styles of pillows,

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.380
but today I'm going to make a basic throw pillow that's sewn closed.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.920
So let's get started.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.000
The materials you'll need are:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.340
1 yard of fabric, this is HGTV Turtle Shell Turquoise,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.020
a pillow form, I'm using an 18 by 18 inch down pillow,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.740
a ruler, scissors, a hand sewing needle,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.800
a fabric marker, pins, and thread.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.980
First, I'm going to cut two panels for the front and back of the pillow.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.100
My pillow form is 18 by 18 inches,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.700
but I'm going to make a cover 1 inch smaller to create a nice, full looking pillow.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.660
So I want the finished dimensions of the cover to be 17 by 17 inches.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm going to use a 1/2 inch seam allowance on all sides,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.580
so add an inch to those measurements and cut two 18 by 18 inch pieces.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.680
If you're working with a patterned fabric,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.940
pay attention to which part of the pattern you want to see and if you want it centered.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.580
Align the two squares of fabric with the right sides facing and pin them together.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.320
I'm going to sew around the edges of the pillow,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.460
leaving a large opening at the bottom about 2 inches in from the corners.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.200
Using a 1/2 inch seam allowance, start sewing at one end of the opening.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.480
Backstitch to lock in the stitches.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.620
When you get 1/2 an inch from the corner,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.160
leave the needle in the fabric, lift the presser foot, and pivot 90 degrees.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.220
Then lower the presser foot and continue sewing around the pillow

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.700
until you get back to the bottom and sew the final 2 inches.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.260
Backstitch again and raise the needle and presser foot.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.440
Next, trim all 4 corners to remove extra bulk.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.340
Cut at an angle close to the stitches without cutting into them.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.700
Then turn the pillow cover right side out.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.440
Use your finger or something with a point to push the corners all the way out.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.880
Lay the cover flat and iron the edges of the fabric under 1/2 an inch at the opening.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.760
Now insert the pillow form and arrange it until it fills out the cover.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.440
Finally, I'm going to hand stitch the opening closed using an invisible stitch.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.360
Thread the needle and make a knot at the end.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.920
I'm doubling up the thread for extra strength.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.980
Bring the needle up through one of the ironed edges so the knot is hidden.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.040
Then go to the opposite side and slide the needle through the top of the fold

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.440
so you pick up a little bit of fabric.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.000
Next go directly across to the other side and do the same thing.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.740
Repeat this a couple more times.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.320
The trick to this stitch is when you go from side to side,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.460
go straight across so the thread is perpendicular to the folds.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.720
The thread will start to look like the rungs on a ladder.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.820
When you pull the thread taut, the stitches will disappear.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.560
Continue this process down the opening, pulling the thread taut every couple of stitches.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.180
When you get to the end, pick up a bit of fabric like before.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.940
This time bring the needle through the loop of thread so you form a knot.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.800
Then repeat this, going through the knot you just made.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.180
Do this once more just to make sure it's extra secure.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.600
Finally, to hide the tail of the thread,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840
go down through the knot, out the side of the fabric and snip the thread.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.820
And here's the finished throw pillow.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.720
It's easy to make, and a quick way to update your decor with the fabric of your choosing.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.420
Thanks for watching this OFS project.
