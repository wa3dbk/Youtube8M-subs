00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.630
Hi, I'm Bobby crispy

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.709
This guitar lesson is how to play the intro Solo to Welcome home Sanitarium by Metallica?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.570
So I'll play it first that'll show house played note for note yet in pads. Okay here it goes

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.550
Okay, I have taken off the distortion so you can hear the notes more clearly so I'll break it up into little sections

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.669
and then you can follow along with the tabs up here okay, so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.139
There's the first part I'll short first

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.850
Yeah, it starts with the fifth string 7th fret

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.409
4th string 9th fret 3rd string love a threat

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.409
12 9

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170
12

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.029
second string 10th slide up to 12

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.699
First string slide up the from 10th to 12th

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.229
first string slide from 15th 17th fret

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.159
Then the next part is this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.850
that's

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
50 first string 15th fret

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
Twice

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.720
The second time you play the 2nd string 17 threat the same time

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.019
second string 17

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.310
Slide up to 19 threat

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.040
Then 17th fret second string bend it up and down again

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.639
Then the second string 15th

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.110
first string 12

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.320
second string 15th

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.739
13th

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
12

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.120
that section is this

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:37.738
Okay, so that's second string 12 hammer under 13th profits off

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.930
Third string 14th fret

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.940
12 Slide down their lives

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.760
fourth string Twelfth fret fifth string 14th fret

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.880
fourth string Twelve slide up the 14th

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.330
Okay, the next section is this

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.310
Okay, okay

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320
so

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.809
Third string 16th fret

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.519
second string night 17

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.540
first string 19th

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.180
so play them all together, so

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.829
like that then back down

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.120
So first string 90s second string is our teeth and 31-6 needs

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.059
and slide down 16 to 14

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.729
Then first-string 70 threat

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400
the next section is this

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.639
so first string 17th fret

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.069
15th

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.069
14th

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620
second string 17th

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.889
15th 14th

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.579
Third string 60

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.690
14th

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.249
Then to the 12th ended up first then back down

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.509
the next section is this

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.680
so obviously Gonna need my minor chord in the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:10.059
Proposition just playing a part of it though, so for string fourteenth

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.390
Third string fourteenth

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.839
second string 13th and first string 12th just

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.470
that very quickly

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.510
The first string 10th hammer on the 12th and pull off the tenth

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.330
then second strand 13th

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.270
so it's

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.569
The last part is this

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.339
Parts of the Major Chords, so we'll slide up to fourth string seventh fret

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.629
Third string six

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.970
first string fifth

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
and then the same

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.029
Pattern from your pattern slide up to fourth string fifth fret

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:28.209
Third string fourth fret for a string third

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.710
And slide up to fourth string so threat

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.140
3/6

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:43.469
so it's

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:54.899
And that's it okay. That's a lesson. It's been helpful then thanks for watching
