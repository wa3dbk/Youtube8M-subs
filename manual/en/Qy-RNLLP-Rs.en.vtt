00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.779
Hey everybody. Here's a short video I put together
on DCS: A-10.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.990
This is of course the open beta of DCS A-10 so
don't assume anything you see here is gonna represent

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.240
the final product

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.939
So just keep that in mind. What we're gonna be
doing today is dropping multiple JDAMs

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.279
on multiple targets in one run.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.169
There's been a few requests on the Eagle forums
and elsewhere for instructions on how to do

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.130
this and of course there's been a few really
well-done vids up on youtube

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.270
where people are demonstrating the technique 
very well, in some cases dropping nine JDAMs on

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.480
nine different targets

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.750
so with this vid, I'm gonna do something
little bit different and slow it down a little

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.520
bit and do it step by step so everybody can
see exactly what needs to be done

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.970
and I'm also going to show you how to store
your markpoints in a seperate flight plan

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.450
so you can call up your targets at any time

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.390
and you can store as many targets as you need to

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.040
In my training scenario here I've just passed 
what should be my FENCE IN point--it's on the Nellis

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.210
map--and I've got some targets out on my third
waypoint

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.519
so I'm gonna set my third waypoint to my current
steerpoint

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.310
which is called threat one

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.229
and that's going to be out to my one o'clock

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.570
next thing I want to do is take my targeting
pod out of standby mode to air to ground

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.159
mode

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.159
and set it as SOI,
so I'm gonna do that now.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.550
and next, since I've got SOI I'm gonna put china
hat forward long to slew my pod onto my current

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.970
steerpoint.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.180
And you can see here, I've got some
vehicles in sight

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.830
of the pod.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.500
So the next step is going to be designating
a markpoint on top of each of those vehicles

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.789
or whatever I want to use as a target,

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.369
in this case it's going to be all three
of them.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850
because I want to destroy all of them

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.150
and, that's what I'm gonna do now, so
I'm gonna slew all the way to the right

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030
and get my rightmost vehicle set up in
point mode there.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.090
Now, once I have a point designated you
want to do a TMS right short 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.850
to designate your first markpoint.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.559
So I've got markpoint A

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:15.559
and we're going to make the middle one
markpoint B

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.609
and finally we're going to make the one on
the left markpoint C.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.449
Now, as you practice this you'll find that
you can do this very, very quickly with the

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:37.419
targeting pod; it did it deliberately slowly
so you can see it, but you can get quite

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.269
a few vehicles marked up in

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.559
almost no time at all if you practice. I'm
gonna turn my pod into standby mode now

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:50.609
and I'm gonna turn my aircraft on a reverse
course away from the target zone so I can

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:57.609
get some altitude and program my
markpoints in.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.480
Okay, now to store these in the flight plan
we're gonna hit the flight plan button on

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.449
the CDU. You see we have our default flight
plan set up.

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.609
And what I want to do is make a new flight
plan--I'm gonna call that "target 1" or

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.439
TGT1...type that in now...

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.669
Hit the LSK on the left for two,

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.209
and it's a new flight plan.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.819
And you want to hit FPBUILD.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.149
And do A...one

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.980
B...two

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.219
C...three

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.329
and that's the flight plan. If I go up to my
TAD

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.859
after selecting it,

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.519
you can see on the map

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.719
and you can make as many of these as you want

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.159
with as many markpoints as you want to
program in there.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.520
And that's really it. Once you do it once
you'll remember it, and it's pretty easy.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.409
So, that's the flight plan step.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.760
And the next thing we want to do is arm
the plane

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.680
and go to the DSMS, select three JDAMs--
one JDAM for every markpoint

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.609
that we made.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:15.609
You'd probably wanna do this during your
FENCE IN procedure but I'm gonna do it now.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:26.229
Alright, I'm gonna speed it up here so we
can get to the target a little bit faster.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:41.129
One thing that you want to keep in mind
here is the altitude. I'm going to

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.719
go to about 14,000 here or just under that.

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.269
If you look at the launch window as sort
of a cone that opens up and spreads wider

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.119
as you get higher,

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:53.039
you can picture that you know the higher that
you go, the more that you'll be able to

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.740
launch and the longer the window's gonna
be open as you go over the target. But

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.729
the downside to that is that depending on
the threat picture, you could expose yourself

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.849
to radar-guided SAMs and other nasty
stuff

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.539
so you definitely wanna take that
into account when you're planning this out

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:14.539
and depending on the mission, follow
that accordingly.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.689
Alright, we're inbound, CCRP system's up
everything is aligned and we're just

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:22.689
about ready to go.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.009
Pay attention to the minimum and maximum range
carets on the pipper.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:27.890
When those start to move

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.469
rapidly, that's going to tell you that
you're approaching your release envelope

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:38.680
Alright, window coming up.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.889
Got my release cue; pickle the
first JDAM.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.889
Switch to steerpoint B, pickle the
second one.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.219
Switch to C, pickle the third.

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.259
And all three are away. Now I want to
egress rapidly.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.660
And we'll take a look at the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.110
JDAMs as they hit.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.669
Now you'll notice that these will hit
in exactly the same sequence as you

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.979
marked them, which is pretty spiffy.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.710
There goes A,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.330
and the other two.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.199
And that's all there is to it. Like I said
before you can get up to nine of these off

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.840
in one run, if you're quick with
switching your steerpoints

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.050
and I hope everybody enjoyed this. 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.359
If you're into flight sims and you like
the A-10, this is definitely something

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:30.339
that you should check out if you have the time.
You can get it by following the link in the

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.949
description of the video.
Take care!
