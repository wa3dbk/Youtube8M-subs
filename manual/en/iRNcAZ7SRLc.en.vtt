00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.060
&gt;&gt; All these people who love the arts get
to live together.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.684
&gt;&gt; Most valuable things for me is just
meeting other

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:24.590
peers and other students who have, share
similar interest and passion.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.217
Some of them are visual artists, and some
of

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:30.170
them are dancers and some of them are
musicians.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.479
And we have a wonderful medley of all
different

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.750
kinds of people who are interested in the
arts.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.870
&gt;&gt; ITALIC is a brand new program to give

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.910
students an immersive experience in all of
the arts.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.396
And it operates as a dorm-based program in
Burbank Hall, where the 45 students

00:00:50.396 --> 00:00:56.280
live and take two morning lectures and two
afternoon sections a week.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.512
So, the structure of it is to let them

00:00:58.512 --> 00:01:04.050
experience the arts, both theoretically
and practically where they live.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.380
&gt;&gt; We don't expect our students to be
artists.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.040
We expect them to be arts engaged.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.015
And so the way we framed the class, we
went

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.950
from a question of is there a
purposefulness to art.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.470
We call it why art.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.400
And we spent the quarter looking at art
from a perceptual, and cognitive,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.020
and neuroscientific view and then we end
the year questioning why not art?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.332
With the broad question of, when art
pushes the boundaries of, of

00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:35.330
its own definition, and when art pushes
boundaries of acceptable social behavior.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.900
What does that mean for society?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.840
&gt;&gt; The great thing about it, is that like,
we don't have answers.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.800
No one has answers.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.026
And, but we come out of it knowing a bit
more about how art has progressed through

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:53.310
time, through space in different cultures
and within different disciplines of art.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.160
&gt;&gt; Having active artists come to the class
and share their work.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.440
Share their thoughts about art.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.060
Having critics come in and talk about the
act of criticism and, and their

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.810
take on how the arts evolve makes this an,
a lively experience.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.470
So, I think it's, it's key to making this
class work.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.860
&gt;&gt; We know on a really very personal level
each of our students.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.999
We get to know them in class, on group
field trips,

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.500
and we have our meals together at least
two days a week.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.534
So we, we really understand the whole
student,

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:29.580
and we see the student blossom over time.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.500
It develops a rapport and an intimacy that
I've

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.350
never experienced in the 20 years I've
been teaching here.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.786
&gt;&gt; Being in this program I've had an

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:43.240
opportunity to stretch my artistic
sensibility and creative side.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.776
My own artistic practice has been
strengthened so much by learning

00:02:47.776 --> 00:02:51.910
about these other art forms, and what I
can draw from them.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.630
&gt;&gt; You really learn so much about the
boundaries of, of what I can be.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.300
This experience has taught me, as to how I
think

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.450
creatively, how I can use these skills
that I have

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.700
gained in creative thinking to go out to
create new

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.255
solutions to problems that I may solve in
the future.
