00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.115
Correction Doubles (3) For Vincent from France-2 (go back to the base)

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:08.931
Next point is

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.169
you are at the net

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.264
and then you did net play here

00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:20.079
and then instead of after net play, you ready

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:21.982
after net play

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:25.225
you follow the shuttlecock and try to block

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.319
opponent hit

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.849
so if he do cross net

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.926
or middle court push

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:32.891
you are not ready

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:36.830
so do this way

00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:38.897
net play and then ready

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:40.929
rather than

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:43.834
net play and then ready like this

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:46.136
ok

00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:48.808
imagine that's you

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:51.979
when I saw your clip

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:55.451
quite often you do this way

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.120
so you do the shot to one corner

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:03.147
and you follow to that corner after the shot like this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.837
so net play and come closer

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:08.174
yeah like that, like that

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:12.171
and what happens

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.282
ready do it again

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:14.563
like this

00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:16.314
what happen that one

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:19.397
so its better after net

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:20.981
go back to the base

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.923
and ready for both sides to intercept

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:26.063
so like this

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.648
so net play ready to kill

00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.849
net play, ready

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:31.025
and then kill

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.761
yeah again

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.801
net play, ready and then kill or

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.001
net play, ready and then kill

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.219
watch again

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.507
so net play and try to block it

00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:46.107
net play and block

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.247
more just run and racket up

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:50.885
watch again

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:53.854
like that, like that, like this, yeah

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.968
same the other side

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.957
watch net play you move to the shuttlecock

00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:01.888
like that

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.301
and then you are not ready for the other side

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:08.930
no like that

00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:12.336
ok try to go back

00:02:12.995 --> 00:02:15.873
