[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:06.715
As a swimsuit model, there's
more to being camera-ready

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:08.870
than just hair and makeup.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.400
I need to be ready to wear anything.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.840
Or close to nothing.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.860
Because in this business, I
never know what to expect.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.690
And you get it.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.070
I mean, you might go on a
beach trip with your friends

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.480
or go on a romantic date.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.390
You've got to be ready.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.130
I shave and keep up with
my bikini area to make

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.500
sure I can work the camera anytime.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.740
When I first started, I knew I
had to come to the shoot prepared,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.410
but I really didn't know the best
way to keep up with my bikini area.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.990
Since then, I've picked
up a lot of tips.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.730
So let me share my secrets
to keeping my bikini lines

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
and the area in between looking great.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.960
First, I shave with a razor
to shape my bikini hair.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.230
I love Venus Embrace.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.929
It feels comfortable and gives me
a super close shave every time.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.095
What I like about it is
that it has five blades that

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.330
give you a really close shave.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.305
And it pivots, so you can get
to those hard-to-reach spots.

00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:06.580
Plus, this ribbon of moisture
gives you a really smooth glide.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.740
First, decide on the shape you want.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.400
Now you can shave just around
the bikini area or further in.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.590
And if you want, get creative.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.210
Next, you have to trim.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.670
In my opinion, when
bikini hair is shorter,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
it just looks and feels much
neater and more feminine.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.620
I discovered this incredible
Venus bikini trimmer,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.280
and it's made my life so much easier.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.800
I've tried everything; electric
clippers, a razor, even scissors.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.950
Not easy.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.330
But this trimmer gets the job
done, and it's an easy and safe way

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.440
to get just the look I want.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.710
The trimmer has a blade
to cut bikini hair,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.090
and this comb to protect
your skin from the blade.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.770
Now, there's no more fumbling around
or worrying about getting nicked.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.600
Plus it helps trim to
get a consistent length.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.650
Just guide it over your bikini
hair, just like you would a razor.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.510
Finally, I always moisturize.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.680
Olay bikini lotion is my favorite.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.510
But really, you can use
any gentle moisturizer.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.000
It's that final touch that
makes a big difference.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280
It provides immediate
soothing hydration,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.390
and it leaves your
skin looking beautiful.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.410
So see?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.240
It's easy to look and
feel like a goddess.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.810
Just shave, trim, and hydrate.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.740
Of course, makeup doesn't hurt.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.780
And remember, taking care of
yourself is important year round.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.890
It makes me feel sexy.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.750
And when I feel sexy,
I'm way more confident.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.800
