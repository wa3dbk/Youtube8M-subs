00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.640
The long here poses are great but more difficulty
than the covert we just rolled over the biggest

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.879
problem is it's unsupported it's higher off
the ground and it's going to be pretty slippery

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:21.189
cause it organic. So we need access how to
get over it with at least you know possibility

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.720
of smashing our bike against it and you know
slipping out and falling over. So the obvious

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.320
line is straight down the middle but it's
much higher not much less supportive there

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.530
than it is over to the side. The side is still
on the trail as well so what we're going to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.970
do is go up go over the side and you know
safely clean this object that other wise we're

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.000
going to have to walk. So roll up try to make
sure we hit it at a 90 degrees pick up the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.210
front wheel pick up the back wheel and we're
on our way so if we're face with an obstacle

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.650
like this going downhill we have some added
options because we have more momentum. Going

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.620
downhill on might be best to just lean back
a little bit and not even let the front wheel

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.479
hit it so just pop over it. If you do that
you have to be prepared for the back wheel

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.689
picking up but it also gives us a little bit
momentum rolling over. Momentum is always

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.789
our friends as long as we keep in mind that
where our centered mass is in relations to

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:29.649
the wheels. So if we're coming down this I
want to move my weight back and down because

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.740
that laws going to kick my front end up. So
we're going to roll at it once again on the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:48.060
side and we basically just completely, completely
cleared the obstacle with very minimal input

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.240
just right over. And you know unprepared I'm
going to sort of semi loose strip on the handle

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.009
bars my muscles are pretty tensed up I'm ready
to take an impact if it comes, but other wise

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.279
I just let the trial unfold before me.
