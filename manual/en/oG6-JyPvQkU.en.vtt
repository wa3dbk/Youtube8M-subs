00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:06.950
Hi, this is Ross at Woodfirepower, and this
is another update on the 4 by 16 Aquaponics

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.950
System. We are going to be planting some arugula.
We took out the lettuce in the front, it was

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.059
very tasty. There's still a couple of the
Romaine lettuce. If I look down the length

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.869
of the table now you can see it's green
all the way down. The snow peas are getting

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.419
taller and I'll show you those in a minute.
The Bok choy and chard and kale keep on producing

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.579
and we've been harvesting individual leaves
and have them for dinner and then new leaves

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.579
grow back. The brassica's, the cabbage,
and especially the Napa (Chinese) cabbage

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.089
are still having problems with aphids. So
we're probably just going to harvest those.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.270
The leaves look great, so just harvest them
and wash them before eating. But we are going

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.270
to do a little experiment with Lady Bugs.
The broccoli is doing great, super tall, chives

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.970
are here, beets are also doing great. The
onions behind the beets are doing ok but getting

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.500
shaded so that didn't work so great, we
probably should have turned that around. The

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.500
lettuce starts, remember this is seed I put
into the gravel rocks about two weeks ago,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.240
they're coming up nicely. Maybe in two or
three weeks we'll be able to harvest some

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.250
baby greens out of here. Let me come around
over here.....we're just throwing some seed

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.550
down on the gravel. Little tiny seeds down
at the moisture line and then we'll cover

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.280
it back over again with the gravel. So this
is just to get the seed down to where it's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.560
exposed to the water on every flood cycle.
And this is basically what I did two weeks

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.250
ago with the lettuce. We're going to see
if this works. This is four varieties of arugula.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.250
Here's the water coming in from the pond.
And back here we have the snow peas, 3 different

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.410
varieties, boy they just really blend in.
But you can see that we have a bunch of snow

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.630
peas. These guys should climb 6 feet tall,
so they're just getting started. Hopefully

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.510
we'll get a lot of snow peas out of them.
We probably could have planted them a little

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.950
earlier, but we did what we did.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.950
So, that's it, we hope to get the film covering
on. Here's the view down the table and as

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.709
I said, the hoops are about two feet above
the surface of the gravel surface. So, that's

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.340
that for this update, have a great week. Ross
at Woodfirepower.
