00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.850
Hi I'm Emily Larew continuing on with our
intermediate Hip Hop combination. We're now

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.140
on our fifth count of eight, counts one through
four adding the knee spin to our floor work.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.580
So, we just finished getting low to the floor
and we smack the floor on eight. You're going

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.050
to snake up so make sure it's more like a
body roll actually than a sideward snake.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.660
I want your head to lead one straight up,
one, what's going to happen with this knee

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.070
spin is, let's just do the knee part without
the spin. Your right leg is going to come

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.850
down and then your left leg is going to switch
so your left foots up right knees down. So

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.910
we were here, we snaked up one and two, ok?
So what we need to do is use your arms to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.131
help get you around so I'm going to go in
slow motion. I might have to cheat and use

00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:55.579
my hands, we'll see how sticky the floor is
today but you do this on eight. We're going

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.550
one, you're going to turn, you push this arm
out and around so make it strong don't make

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.829
it sloppy, ok? So we go knee around from there
left foot comes up and if you saw I didn't

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.049
even need to use my hands because I cheated
and used my toe to help push me. If all you

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.349
rely on is your knees you're going to get
stuck and go out of control and then you'll

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:21.959
be over here instead of landing where we need
to land it here alright? So don't be afraid

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:29.039
to use these feet's like little Wilma Flintstone
alright? So we're here on eight we roll up

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:36.100
one and two, then from here we're going to
push on our left leg around so get your left

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.439
hand here you're going to push three and four
alright? And it switches again but I want

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.959
you to make it like a big wide circle, you're
pushing this leg and because the left leg

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.969
hits the right the right leg comes up alright?
And I keep my hand on my hip, right hand on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.319
my leg so you've got a place to put your arms
ok? Good job, let's try it again so we slam

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:06.829
down on eight we push up one and two around
three and four, good. Let's go ahead and put

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.510
that together with the whole combination,
are you ready? Keep it slow here we go so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.540
we count it one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, one and two, three, four, five,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.180
six, seven, eight, and one we go two, three
and four, five, six and seven, eight. One

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.920
and two, three, four, five, six around seven,
eight, get low, one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.569
six, seven, eight, one and two turn three,
four good job. That was your knee spin on

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.610
the floor for your intermediate Hip Hop combination.
