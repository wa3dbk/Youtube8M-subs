(dance music)

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.523
- (Skyy) Christina,
darling, you look ravishing.

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:08.637
- Yes, Darling, thank you.

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:12.367
- In this glass is some booze, okay.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.472
You are going to taste this and
you are going to describe it

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:18.547
in one word or short phrase
unrelated to food or drink.

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:20.581
Wow, this tastes like Coca Cola,

00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.562
mmm this taste like a Big
Mac, none of that okay.

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:24.354
- Big Mac?

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:27.489
- No references to food or drink.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.769
Taste!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.034
- Mmmm.

00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:34.831
That smells delicious.

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.010
Did you put a mixer in there or no?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.490
- No, there is no mix
in this, this is raw.

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:45.764
I didn't need you to drink
the whole thing, you know.

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:47.714
One word.

00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:52.602
- Virgin.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.345
- Like Mary?

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:58.409
What kind of virgin is this
you're talking about, okay?

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:01.420
- It's..

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.795
Okay, do you want me to tell you why?

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:03.321
- Yeah.

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.990
- To explain why, I have
to tell you my joke.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.333
- Go on.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:13.333
- What did the virgin
say after her first BJ?

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.901
- (laughs) I don't know, what did she say?

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.282
- I love you.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.295
- Oh god! (laughs)

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:30.818
- Oh my god, this is the first time

00:01:30.818 --> 00:01:34.874
he's ever laughed this
hard at any of my jokes!

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:37.492
- Because it's so nasty!

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:38.835
Virgin.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:39.614
Okay.

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:40.736
- Can that be on YouTube?

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:41.794
- (Skyy) It can be on YouTube.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:43.113
Now, do you like it?

00:01:43.113 --> 00:01:45.007
- Yes.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.535
Taste!

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:51.703
- Mmm.

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:57.206
- One word.

00:01:57.206 --> 00:01:58.712
- (foreign language)

00:01:58.712 --> 00:01:59.579
- What does that mean?

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.705
- Summer.

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:01.453
- It tastes like summer?

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.226
- It tastes like summer, yes.

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:07.050
- You like it?

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.024
- Yeah, I do.

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:10.069
- Yeah, me too.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.226
- Smells good.

00:02:13.226 --> 00:02:14.875
- Delicious, right?

00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:23.360
- I like this, so I'm
saying that it's like...

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:25.047
Like the tropics, the Caribbean.

00:02:25.047 --> 00:02:26.748
- Taste!

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:29.921
- Oh my God, oh now.

00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:32.093
Ooo...

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:35.080
- That's right, it's got a soap I use--

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.759
- Soap?

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:43.853
- One word.

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:50.292
- (giggles) Baby.

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:53.253
- It tastes like a baby?

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.117
- Breastmilk.

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:58.175
- It tastes like baby breastmilk?

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:01.065
- It feels nurturing, but...

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:02.315
- It feels nurturing?

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.908
- It's like the smell of
baby, that baby breath.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.490
You know baby breath.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.632
- So it's baby breath?

00:03:09.632 --> 00:03:10.535
- Yeah!

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:12.599
Right after feeding.

00:03:14.032 --> 00:03:15.008
- Do you have any kids?

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:17.683
- No, but I've been
around plenty of babies.

00:03:17.683 --> 00:03:18.705
- Sure.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:19.463
Taste!

00:03:19.463 --> 00:03:21.281
I'm so scared.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.313
- Savor that taste, feel it in your bones,

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:27.573
feel it in your soul like that.

00:03:27.573 --> 00:03:28.605
- Whoa.

00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:29.591
- One word.

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.620
- Reggae!

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.455
- This tastes like Reggae?

00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:33.509
- Yeah.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:34.795
- Oh, really, wow.

00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:37.683
- It looks scary but it's delicious.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:38.357
- You like it?

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:40.801
- Yeah, I want to go on
a beach now and jam out.

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:41.500
- Can you dance to reggae?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.276
Would give us a demonstration?

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:43.349
- No.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.723
- You were doing like this, go ahead.

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:45.933
You must be.
- No.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:47.594
- That's it?

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.021
- I've never seen you laugh at my jokes.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.255
- Okay, hold on, what
do you think this is?

00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:54.306
- Uh...

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.037
- Going back for seconds.

00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:02.416
- There's like a lychee something.

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:03.986
- No it's not.

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:06.147
It's peach and coconut Alize.

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:07.162
- I never get this right.

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:09.460
- Umm, like a pina colada
something or other.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.138
- Well, not exactly, but that was close.

00:04:12.138 --> 00:04:14.554
Alize Coco Peach.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.299
- What is this?

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.235
I've never heard of this.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:17.027
- Coconut peach.

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:18.098
- Alize?

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:19.027
- Never heard of Alize?

00:04:19.027 --> 00:04:20.749
You never listened to no rap?

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:21.738
- No.

00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:23.186
- Tupac was talking about Alize.

00:04:23.186 --> 00:04:24.890
Alize go all the way back.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.443
It has a strong history in black culture.

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.366
- Thanks for teaching me.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.800
- You need to listen to
more rap music, okay?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.464
- Well?

00:04:34.464 --> 00:04:37.891
- I'm going to say it's vodka.

00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.749
- Really, vodka?

00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.117
- Yeah, some type of vodka.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.727
Baby vodka.

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:45.204
It's Alize, girl.

00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:46.254
- I would have never guess that.

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:47.294
- Peach, really?

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:48.743
It's peach?

00:04:48.743 --> 00:04:50.191
- Peach and coconut Alize.

00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:54.431
- Coconut, maybe, it's baby breath.

00:04:55.718 --> 00:04:57.284
- It's Alize.

00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:59.353
- Oh, coco and peach.

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:00.582
- Yeah, coco peach.

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:02.166
- Two things I like.

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.192
- Something with peach.

00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:05.785
- You're good!

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.232
Alize Peach Coco.

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:09.968
- Oh, that's a fancy bottle.

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:10.975
I like it.

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:11.860
- You like, it's good?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.968
- Yeah, it's so good!

00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:13.972
- And there you have it!

00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:16.256
The Strawberry Batida!

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:17.618
Kind of like a strawberry daiquiri,

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:18.767
but it's a little different.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:19.920
Go ahead, put your lips like that.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.829
Tell me what you think.

00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:25.378
- Mmm.

00:05:25.378 --> 00:05:26.042
- But you're Brazilian.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.133
She's going to automatically say it's good

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:28.716
just because it has Cachaca in it, okay?

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:29.654
- Of course.

00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:30.411
- Okay.

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.924
She is very biased, she is
not a great judge on this

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.413
but that's a good drink, alright.
