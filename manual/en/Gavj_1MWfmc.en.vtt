BROOKE BOSTON &gt;&gt; Hello, and welcome to the first segment of the relaxer series.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
My name is Brooke Boston.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My client will share her terrifying experience that she had

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with a chemical hair relaxer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now don't get me wrong,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
chemical hair relaxers are a great way to straighten the hair.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
However, it's up to the cosmetologist to know
0:00:23.000,0:00:10.000
when, why, and how to relax the hair.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Always be highly educated, and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
always take chemical hair relaxing seriously.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Thanks for watching.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:01:04.000
[NARRATION]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
CLIENT &gt;&gt; Upon the cosmetologist applying the relaxer,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
during the process, it was burning really bad.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
My scalp was really red and inflamed, and it hurt.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She went ahead and finished the hair style, which was

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
referred to as a pin-curl ponytail.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So the next few days go on and my scalp is constantly hurting.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The pins were pushing deeper and deeper into my scalp.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
By this time, my scalp is starting... it's cut, and it's bleeding.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I keep trying to readjust the pins to give comfort to my scalp.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It caused me to have really bad headaches and things.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Within a few days, I went to try and adjust the pins...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the bobby pins.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[I] went to touch the ponytail and the ponytail lifted right up.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There was no more ponytail, just open, bloody scalp.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The hair was gone.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I pretty much knew what had caused it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
There really was nothing to do.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Later on, down the line, years to come,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I did end up going to a dermatologist.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I've had biopsies done where they had to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
go in and cut pieces of my scalp to [be biopsied].

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I've also had injections done to test the follicles.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
They're completely dead.  The dermatologist said that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
there's never going to be any growth in those areas.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:55.000
[NARRATION]

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
CLIENT &gt;&gt; [I advise everyone] to be very cautious in who you select

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to do your relaxer.  Don't just allow anyone.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Don't do home kits, because those are the worst.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Those cheap relaxers do the most damage.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Make sure that your cosmetologist is well versed

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and educated in the process and application of relaxers,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
or else the end result can turn out what I have.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
At first, for me, it was a very

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
degrading, humiliating situation.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's something that I've struggled with... dealing with,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because everyone wants hair - hair is the end [goal].

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Regardless of the situation, you can rise above, 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and there is life after hair loss.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
