Hi! My name is Chris McKay with Expert Village.com.
Right now, I am going to show you how to spring

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.100
playing cards. If you would like to learn
more about my work as a magician in Cleveland

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:19.270
and in Los Angeles you can check on my website
at www.mckaymagic.com. All right, so this

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.210
is what springing the cards looks like and
you probably see this all the time in cartoons

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.610
and stuff like that, but it is actually possible.
The cards are shooting from between my right

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
hand and my left hand and probably if you
micro analyze this right now, you can see

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.230
how I am doing it and it is really not that
hard. It does take a lot of practice to really

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.579
control it but I will give you a few pointers,
so that you can be doing this pretty quickly.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.800
Lots of people think I am bending the cards
back, because that’s how they feel like

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.030
cards should shoot off. If they think that
there should be tension with your pointer

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.890
finger just like you’re riffling the cards.
That’s not what I am doing; I am actually

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.920
bending them in the opposite direction, bending
like this and what happens is that cards will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.229
use this tension and once they kind of get
released by my thumb they will shoot out and

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.750
they do end up just kind of shooting out backwards
a little bit but you can use that to your

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.450
advantage. Somethings that is really crucial
is catching the cards because these cards

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.130
are really flying all over the place and you
got to be able to catch them in your hand

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.170
without dropping any otherwise you are going
to look like you don’t know what you’re

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.270
doing. The key to this really catching them
in your hand is this pinky because like I

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.060
said the cards shoot off backwards and so
that means when they land in the hand, they

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.590
are going to bump up against this pinky, my
bottom pinky because they are coming in, in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.150
this direction and so they are squaring off
against my pinky and these fingers, so this

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.260
is kind of a V that the cards are getting
caught between, these fingers and my pinky.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.850
The cards are shooting in here like this and
squaring off. What I did for a very longtime

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.220
when I was a kid when I was learning this
was I just couldn’t catch them in my hands,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.490
I just didn’t have big enough hands to catch
the big pile that I was making because it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.129
was so messy because I wasn’t good at it.
I just couldn’t catch them with my hands.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:27.919
So what you can do to kind of cheat is actually
just bring your hand up against your body.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.290
You pretend like the card box was my body.
You know I am just bringing my hand up against

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.079
my body and not using my pinky as this support
down here by my entire chest basically. That

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.090
is springing the cards. It really takes a
lot of practice. This takes lots and lots

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.569
of practice to get down but it’s really
worth it because it looks really fancy.
