(Italian music)

00:00:06.484 --> 00:00:08.410
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.368
and you're watching Cooking Stone.

00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:11.897
And on today's show, I'm gonna make

00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:14.466
this chilled Israeli Couscous Salad

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.340
with Brussels sprouts and tangerines.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.891
I think you're really going to enjoy it.

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.687
Start off by melting about
a tablespoon of butter

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.994
in a sauce pan.

00:00:23.994 --> 00:00:26.064
And we're gonna use this to

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:30.346
just toast the couscous
before we actually cook it.

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:32.007
Add our couscous to the pan.

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:33.770
Once it's toasted, we're
gonna add our water

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.690
which is gonna

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.093
(searing steam)

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.307
instantly bubble, like that.

00:00:43.212 --> 00:00:44.981
And bring that to a simmer

00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:46.637
and cook for about 10 minutes.

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:49.016
Now, that the Israeli couscous has cooled,

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:52.265
we're gonna add that
to a large mixing bowl.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.763
Add in our cilantro.

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:01.946
Some olive oil.

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:05.997
And some salt

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:08.036
just to give it a little bit of flavor.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:11.689
And then let's just mix that all together.

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.403
You might need more olive oil

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:18.982
depending on how sticky the couscous get.

00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:21.787
Now, we're gonna add in our
roasted Brussels sprouts.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:24.922
Let's mix those into the couscous.

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:26.199
Just lightly.

00:01:27.547 --> 00:01:29.959
This salad is freaking
amazing, by the way.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.777
You're gonna love it.

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:32.386
Now let's add our tangerine slices

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:36.905
trying to remove as much
of the pith as possible.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.391
We really don't want that in the salad.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:43.359
That extra stuff, just get rid of that.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:44.947
No like-y.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:49.281
And we gonna toss those in.

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.401
I'll be adding more tangerines than this.

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.251
But just to kind of show you.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:59.406
