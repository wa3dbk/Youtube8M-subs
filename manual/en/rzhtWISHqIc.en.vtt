00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.369
Hi, I'm Dan Garcia and we're going to talk
about arpeggios right now.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.390
An arpeggio is when we break a chord down
into individual notes as opposed to strumming.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.780
You can strum a chord or we can arpeggiate
it, okay?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.990
Arpeggios have unlimited combinations.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.850
You can do millions of different combinations
with your fingers to arpeggiate a chord.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.920
We're going to talk today about a couple of
the most common ones to flamenco guitar.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.949
The first one is going to be a triplet figure
and is going to be a thumb on a bass string.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.239
Right now, we'll play the sixth string on
the guitar, and then your middle finger is

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.379
going to play the first string, followed by
your index on the second string.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.680
It's going to be a triplet.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.620
So 1-2-3.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.160
1-2-3.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.690
Thumb-middle-index.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.229
Thumb-middle-index.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.760
Thumb-middle-index.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.299
Thumb-middle-index.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:19.590
To 
demonstrate how this works, I'm going to play

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.869
the Malaguena Compas.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.219
First I'm going to play it without the arpeggio
and then I'm going to harmonize this baseline

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.219
with an arpeggio.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:28.219
Let's see how it works.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.859
So first...

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:41.940
Okay, now I'm going to play the same line,
but with the arpeggio on the top, so very

00:01:41.940 --> 00:02:12.030
slow at first, and up the speed, and that's
your triplet arpeggio.
