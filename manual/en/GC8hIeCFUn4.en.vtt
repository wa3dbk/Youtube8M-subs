00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.080
How to Get Your Video Noticed on YouTube.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.570
Wanna be an internet star?

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.170
Knowing a few tricks will put you on the most-viewed
list in no time.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.000
You will need A great idea Video and computer
equipment and persistence.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Step 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.940
Click the "Videos" tab on YouTube to see what
the most-viewed videos of the moment are—and

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.900
then make a video response to one.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.140
Parodies of currently popular internet videos
often "piggyback" on the fame of the original

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.480
and end up becoming famous themselves.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480
Step 2.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.109
Aim for a large but specific group, like video
game fanatics, or people who hate Carlos Mencia.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.059
Although throwing out a wide net seems more
logical, a targeted audience is actually more

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.859
likely to latch on and spread the word.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:47.859
Step 3.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.510
It seems obvious, but use the best idea you
have.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.809
It's probably the one that makes you and your
friends laugh the most or has you using the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.139
word "awesome" repeatedly.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.800
Violence really hurts, and should never be
used for base, commercial motives.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.369
So don't do it.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.369
Step 4.

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.130
Shoot for the highest production value you
can afford.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.750
Videos that are severely underlit or have
blown out audio are pretty unwatchable, and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.610
unlikely candidates for internet fame.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.610
Step 5.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.100
Before you output, do a Google search for
"Exporting for YouTube."

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.200
Heavily pixelated, out-of-sync video clips
rarely make the rounds in office emails.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.630
Step 6.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.100
One of the keys to getting your video seen
is having a title, tags, and a thumbnail that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.380
will attract your audience.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.240
YouTube offers you a choice of 3 different
thumbnails—whichever images are found a

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.030
1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the way through your
video.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.100
Savvy users find a frame they like during
editing and make sure it occurs at one of

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.890
those points.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.940
The other key factor in attracting an audience?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.530
Keep your video short and sweet.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.680
Two minutes or less is ideal.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.690
Step 7.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.200
Remember the specific interest group you targeted?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.710
Now that you're finished, consider emailing
your video's link to websites relevant to

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.820
that group.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.470
Sometimes all it takes is a single blogger
to get the ball quickly rolling.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.550
Step 8.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.250
Don't just upload your video and forget it;
become part of the community.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.780
Comment on other videos, respond to comments
on your own video, maybe even stir up a little

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450
controversy.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.590
Step 9.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.750
Repeat the process.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.750
Each time one of your videos makes even a
small dent, you gain subscribers, and a large

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.499
subscriber base is the number one reason a
video attracts a large viewership.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.870
Did you know According to its community guidelines,
YouTube does not allow videos that show "graphic

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.029
or gratuitous violence," or "someone getting
hurt, attacked, or humiliated."
