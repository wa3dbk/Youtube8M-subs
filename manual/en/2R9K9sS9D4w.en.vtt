00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.349
"Freeze", or "stick 'em up", as I like to
call it, is definitely a crowd-pleaser.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:18.980
It is a behavior or trick that is a variation
on what we often refer to as "beg" or "sit

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.980
pretty".

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.550
For Jack, he does better with a "stick 'em
up" because it helps balance out his body

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.619
composition a little bit.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.240
He's very heavy in the front.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.890
So what we're going to do is look for small
variation on what the end result will be.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.019
Whenever you're training any behavior, what
you want to know is what the end behavior

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.649
is supposed to look like, and then you're
just looking at what the dog does and breaking

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.399
it down into small, achievable steps.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.449
What I definitely want to communicate to him
when I'm training this is that I want his

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.690
rear end on the ground and I want to see his
paws start to come up.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.350
So I'm going to use a clicker to communicate
to him what he's done correctly, what he's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.879
getting a reward for.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.119
And slowly, I will shape him to the end result.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870
So it's perfect that he's in a sitting position.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.870
That's what we need.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.560
I might click just to sit a couple times and
reward it.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.330
So I click what he's doing right and I reward
it.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.930
I'm just going to wait to see if he does anything
with his feet.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.260
I'll even take that little stepping with his
feet a little bit.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.280
I just wait for him, see if he offers anything.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.170
I took that.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:46.270
It's a little bit of a waiting game.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:01.440
Yes, good job.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.659
I'm looking for those paws to raise up.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.340
He's being a real good boy just offering me
a sit.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.410
I can encourage it a little bit by kind of
pressing my hand up and back.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.959
Good boy.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.950
I'm going to try to click when the paws come
up as high as they can.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.689
Good job.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.800
I might go for a little duration.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.480
And when I feel like it looks like what I
want it to, I can start throwing in a cue,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.409
when I feel fairly certain he's going to offer
it.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.430
I like to use my finger, like I'm pointing
a gun at him.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.810
Stick 'em up.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.099
Good.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.599
You want to show him the cue and then get
the behavior.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.170
Good.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.170
Good job, Jack.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.920
Now to make sure he understands that cue,
I might throw in a few things that I know

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.140
that he knows, such as a "down".

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.989
Good.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.230
Ask him to sit.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.230
Good.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.439
I'm going to make sure he's making the connection
between the stick 'em up behavior and the

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.439
cue.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.790
I'll try that one.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.790
Stick 'em up.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.459
Yes, good job.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.150
And there you've got it.
