00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:27.450
 Using a mortar and a pistol, mix the ground spices, the fennel 
 seeds, and coriander seeds together until they are completely crushed. 

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:11.780
Add the Harissa to the mortar and continue mixing.

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:19.290
Add the sliced garlic cloves to the mixture, and grind them with 
 the spices until you get a smooth texture.  

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:33.550
 Add the olive oil and  spice mixture to 
 the ground meat. Mix well using a fork. 

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:45.130
Place the meat mixture in a bowl, cover, and place in the fridge for at least 
 2 hours (preferably overnight) so that the meat soaks up all the flavors. 

00:03:58.218 --> 00:04:05.280
After marinating the meat, you can shape it any 
 way you want: into skewers, hamburgers, etc.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:42.280
You can grill the meat in your barbecue grill or a 
 grilling plate that you place on top of a stove.

00:04:42.283 --> 00:04:44.640
Note: If you are using a grill plate, cover 
 it with a little bit of olive oil.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:05:02.740
Grill the meat on both sides for a few minutes each side. 

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:17.350
grill the meat for a shorter time if you like 
 meat rare or medium-rare, and longer for well done.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:27.790
Serve with rice and vegetables.
