Well ladies and gentlemen, I'm Joey Gunz and
you can check me out on line at www.joeygunz.com.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.860
I'm here on Expert Village today to talk to
you about the tripod and the uses and applications

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:24.340
of the tripod. Well in the spirit of photography,we've
got a pretty sturdy professional gray tripod

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.369
here. The tripod has pretty much one application
in photography and it is to hold your camera

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.489
and hold it as still as possible. Tripods
today come in a variety of sorts. They come

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.640
with varying heads that attached to your camera
that will allow you to move your camera while

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.280
it is mounted. But all tripods pretty much
have telescoping legs. Some of them kind of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
lock into place differently and if you will
see I am kind of just going through the motions

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.780
here of extending legs on this tripod so that
we can set up for a shot. Now one thing that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.440
you will always find that most professionals
will do is to not extend the neck on this

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.500
tripod. If a professional needs to get higher
for a shot, they will find some way of getting

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.360
this tripod in position to elevate to where
they need it. Because what happens is when

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.510
you choose to elevate the neck on this tripod
like most amateurs will do, it is not as sturdy.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.910
You tend to get a little camera shake in there
associated with it. So whenever possible,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.070
you always want to keep the neck down in that
tripod and lock it into shape. What are some

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.880
uses and applications for a tripod? Low light
situations. If you have a situation where

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.000
there is low light and you have to open up
and use really kind of a long shutter speed

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.120
to get more light onto your film, onto your
censor, you definitely what to make sure you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
shoot with a tripod. Normally if you are shooting
with a telephoto lens you never want to shoot

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.460
anything below 60th of second without a tripod.
What are the negative things about shooting

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.510
with a tripod. You kind of loose that flexibility
of rapidly flaming different angles. So if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.659
I shoot with this tripod and I am pretty much
going to be stuck shotting from this position,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.380
I can vary with this handle here to go from
portrait to landscape or to give me some varying

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.140
angles at a point in directions. You kind
of loose that free flowing affect that you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.980
get when you are shooting without a tripod.
Remember every professional photographer has

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.860
got one and every advanced amateur has a very
good tripod. It seems a quality tripod is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.700
going to run you a couple of hundred bucks.
It is worth the investment. So go out and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:38.950
put one in your arsenal. Put it in your stable.
