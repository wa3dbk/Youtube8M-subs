00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.069
Welcome back!

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.900
I've got something really exciting to share
with you. It's a new feature inside YouTube

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.940
that lets you get a lot more views for one
particular video of your choice.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.940
That, and also how you can win one of five
really cool prizes, all up worth about $250

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.260
inside this video. Keep watching!

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Recently, YouTube has just released a brand
new feature that I think is a little bit of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.940
a game-changer. It's their new InVideo Programming
feature. Unfortunately, this is not available

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.050
to everyone just yet as far as I can tell.
But definitely, partners and perhaps some

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.770
older channels will have access to it. It
is really, really fantastic!

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.070
Inside this video, I also talk about how you
can make use of this cool new feature even

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.199
though it might not be activated for your
channel.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.960
First of all, what is it?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.420
Well, there are two things that they've included
in this feature. One is the sort of branding

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.420
for your channel. I think on the bottom corner
here, you'll see a little GS logo of mine.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.860
That's one thing you can do.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
The other thing that you can do that I think
is even more valuable is push one of your

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.290
videos, or basically any video, to all of
the videos on your channel. I'll talk a little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.689
bit about how you can use that very effectively
for getting a lot more views on one particular

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.250
video or any video of your choice. Really,
really powerful stuff! You'll see soon why

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.189
I think this is a game-changer that YouTube
has just released. So that's what it is.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.229
How do you activate this?

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.970
If you want to go and check out if you've
got it available, go to your YouTube channel

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.970
settings, look for the InVideo Programming
field or tab. Click on that and you should

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.979
be able to see those two options for branding
your videos and for getting this little video

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.049
inset thing happening. Very very cool!

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.520
Go check it out if you've got it and play
around with it. It's really easy to use. Just

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.310
go through the steps that they have there
and you'll be able to get it setup and running

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.590
in no time.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.430
How do you use this?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.020
Obviously, the first one -- for branding it's
great. You just get your logo in there and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.860
it looks great. When people click on the little
logo, it just goes to your channel. Very nice!

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.720
I am not sure how useful it is, but it's nice
for being able to brand your videos. And it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.430
will look particularly nice with the new embed
code from YouTube that gets rid of the YouTube

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.090
player. So instead of having YouTube branding,
it will have your branding. Business is going

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.180
to love it.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.250
For the InVideo one, basically what you can
do is select any video on your channel and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.720
then decide where you want to place this video,
in one of the four corners. And also decide

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.720
when this little video inset is going to show
so people can click on.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.129
You might see mine already over here somewhere.
If you click on that, it will open up another

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.560
video on my channel. This is something that
I think is really game-changing because what

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.560
it means now is this video that you can see
here, if you click on that, you can go and

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.769
watch that video. That video gets displayed
on all of the videos on my channel.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.370
Just think about this for a minute, what you
can do with this. Think about what sort of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.500
things you can use this for. I've got three
suggestions. Listen carefully because this

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.500
is going to be important for the little competition
that I'm going to run soon. I'll tell you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.260
about this in a second.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.260
The first thing is, obviously, if you have
some sort of an event coming up, like running

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.709
a webinar or you've got a live event, you
could create a little video on your YouTube

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.709
channel. Then push it over to your inset video
in minutes. Run it for a week until your live

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.060
event happens so that whenever someone comes
to your YouTube channel, it doesn't matter

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.590
which video they watch, they'll be able to
see that little video that promotes your live

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.700
event. Very useful.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.700
Another way that you can use it on a more
regular way, is to link to a video that promotes,

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.979
say, a free report or the free resource that
you have on your website. In fact, that's

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.979
what I have at the moment, or when I'm creating
this video, I'm thinking of putting a little

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.990
video here that goes to my Splasheo site,
for example. Well, it's a video that talks

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.370
about the Splasheo site and then people can
go and visit my site. Very very useful for

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.360
sending people to that particular video...
Giving away free resource and having a little

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.750
video that "sells" that. Very useful for that.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.479
The third way, and this is the way that you
can use if you haven't got this activated

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.590
in your channel just yet. Think about this
for a minute. There will be a lot of people

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.190
who will already have this activated in their
channels. All you have to do, if you don't

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.680
have it activated is to approach these people,
perhaps offer them something in return and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.330
say, "Look, would you be willing to feature
my little video as your little inset video?"

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.430
(I can't remember if that's the right name,
but I'll check it out. You know what I'm talking

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.080
about.)

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.100
So ask them if they will feature your video
(it's called featured video, I think) as a

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.490
little inset and you pay them, you'll give
them something for the next month. Maybe someone

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.630
has a YouTube channel that's getting a million
views a month, or whatever. If you'll get

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.840
them to do that, you have the potential to
get your little video seen by a million people;

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.650
a million potential views of people that go
and click on your little video. How cool is

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.270
that?

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.550
Even if you have this feature activated in
your channel, you can go and do this with

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.520
other people who also have it activated. Provide
them something and get a ton of views on your

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.080
video. It is a really powerful strategy.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.430
I'm sure there's a lot of other ways that
you can use this little new inset or featured

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.100
video. I'd love to hear from you, what you
think. And this ties with a little competition.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.100
I'm going to give away five professionally
created intro animations to five of my viewers.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.870
Five of you guys! All you've got to do is
leave a comment below this video and talk

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.639
about your idea for how these little inset
or featured videos can be used.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:44.139
What I'll do is go through all the comments
and decide on the top five best tips for how

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:51.139
we can use this little inset videos. Each
of those five people will get given a free

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.330
animated intro that I do through my Splasheo
business.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.430
Normally, they're selling at the moment for
around $47. So all up, that's close to $250

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.919
in prizes that I'm giving away for this little
competition.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.240
So five people will get access to that. All
you've got to do to enter is leave your comment

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.770
below and tell me your best idea for using
this little new feature that YouTube has just

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.630
released. I love to hear your thoughts. Make
sure you leave a comment right now.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:26.539
The deadline for this competition is October
19, 2012. Very important. You've got to leave

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:33.199
your comment before October 19, 2012, it's

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.030
it. Leave your comment; you can leave other
comments too if you want to. In fact, if you

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:48.550
just enter an intelligent comment, you don't
have a tip necessarily, I'll consider you

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.840
as an entry as well. I just love to hear from
you.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.840
