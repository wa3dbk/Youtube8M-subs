00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.049
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace worn front

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:12.320
brake hoses on a 1991 Ford Explorer. In this
step, we're going to talk about your new brake

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:20.370
hose, your banjo bolt, and your sealing washers.
This is one of the old ones. I have some replacements

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:29.170
in the bag here.
You can see those there. Some instructional

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.760
manuals will tell you to replace them; others
will say that they are reusable. For safety's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.230
sake, you can go ahead and use the new ones
if you prefer. I always use the old ones,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.039
and every vehicle I've ever worked on, I've
never had a problem with. The reason being

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:53.109
as you can see, if you get a close-up on there,
there are grooves cut into that washer. That

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:59.190
brass washer squeezes into the steel and seals.
It already has the grooves on it, so it's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.899
going to fit the hose and the caliper perfectly
the way they are instead of having to crush

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.420
new grooves into a new washer. The bolt makes
a sandwich with your washers of the brake

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.690
hose. I have a washer which is already stuck
on the caliper--it pretty much just stayed

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.600
there. You're going to want to take your other
washer and slide it down onto your bolt, just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.649
like so. If you're reusing the old one, make
sure the grooves are towards the inside or

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.200
the threaded part of the bolt. We're going
to take our hose and line it up right here,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.630
ensuring that our other washer is in the proper
location. We're going to slide our bolt on,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:50.210
and run it down-hand tight.
Once you have it tight, you can go ahead and--this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.490
one takes a fourteen millimeter, and I have
that on there, and tighten it up. It's a lefty

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.429
Lucy righty tighty kind of bolt. That bolt
is hollow, and it is possible to break it

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:08.110
if you over-tighten it. So, what we'll do
is just get it snug. All right, there. That

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.300
is the proper way to reinstall your sealing
washers, banjo bolts, and brake hose.
