00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.810
-Eff you, guys.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.180
-Whoa.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.550
-Whoa.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.560
David, Jesus.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.414
-No, no, no.

00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:20.270
Fuguys.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.370
That's 23 points, plus 50
points for the bingo.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.330
Fuguys.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.020
-But, David, Fuguys is
only six letters.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.732
-Ye-- yeah, and it's not
even a word, David.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.900
-Eff you guys, and that time I
mean it outside of the context

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.860
of the game.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.295
ZANDY (OFFSCREEN): Jesus.

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.470
-David, you seem really tense.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.540
-I know.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180
I really just can't
seem to chill out.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.410
-David, you know, when I'm
stressed out, I like to do

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.290
yoga, or meditation, or maybe
some nice candles.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.192
And, um, maybe a mellow CD
or something like that.

00:00:57.192 --> 00:00:57.880
-Oh, man.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.145
I just wish I could
do something that

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:00.090
would give me a release.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.840
-Your wish is my command.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.310
-Who are you, Zoltar from the
movie "Big?" What does that

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.970
make me, Josh Baskin
AKA Tom Hanks?

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.220
I mean, what's the deal?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.300
You know, a little-known fact,
that movie was directed by

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.040
Laverne of "Laverne &amp;
Shirley." Who knew?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.760
A woman directing a movie.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.225
What did she say, like-- (IN
FALSETTO) Um, action.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.603
I gotta get a tampon.

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:21.720
Like, how could that
possibly work?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.490
-Do yourself a favor
and go see Kiki.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.870
And ask for the--

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.120
-Happy ending, please.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.405
Wait, wait.

00:01:34.405 --> 00:01:35.510
Hold on a second.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.760
Shouldn't I at least take you
out on a date or something?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.270
Maybe get you drunk?

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.220
-Fine, I'll have a lemon
drop martini.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.200
-Great.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.670
There you go.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.920
-Thanks.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.845
OK.

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:50.250
-Hold on.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.640
Stop.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.930
-Listen, David, I see what
you're trying to do,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.180
but this is my job.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.970
Rubbing strangers with oil
and then jerking them

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.640
off, it's what I do.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.730
Did I always want to do this?

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.015
No.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.530
I think it'd be pretty strange
if at five years old, I said,

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.880
I want to grow up
to be a massage

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.830
therapist/handjob giver.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.626
But a BS from Cal State
Fullerton and a failed dot-com

00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:10.080
later, and here I am.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.330
-I'm getting hard.

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:23.370
-Ooh.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.710
So this is the new and
improved David Wain.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.039
-Hey, hey, hey.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.820
You got that right.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.360
Who knew that a good handjob
from the right woman would

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.090
turn me into a new man.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.620
Namaste.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.400
-(TOGETHER) Namaste.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.090
-No, no, no.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.890
Knobumstay.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.560
23 points, I got there.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.500
So now I am in second place.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.340
Very good.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.140
-So, was I right about
Kiki or what?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.180
-Miles, I have to say when
you're right, you're right.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.480
When you're wrong, you're
dead wrong.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.140
When you're right, you're
really right.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.670
-Well, David, it's just
so nice to see

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.960
you looking so relaxed.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.420
-I just wish I could feel
this way forever.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.957
Hey, hey, hey now.

00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:01.418
Hey, hey, hey now.

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:03.366
I have an idear.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.230
Happy ending, please.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.840
-Coming right up.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.780
-You mean, like cumming
right up?

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.265
Is that it?

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:12.750
What?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.720
Coming right up.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.000
-That's fantastic.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.880
David, it's beautiful.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.710
-I know.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.090
But what do you think
about the ring?

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.590
-I don't know what to say.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.870
-Just say yes.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.070
You make me feel so good.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.570
I want you to jerk me off for
the rest of our lives, till

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.730
we're old and gray.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.970
I want you to jerk that off
until it's brittle and bony

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.120
and disgusting.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.970
I want you to jerk me
off until there's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.910
no more dick left.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.500
It's just a spindly little stick
of a dick, with no skin,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.110
no muscles, just the
little middle part.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.280
-That's so sweet, but I'm afraid
it'll never work out

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.110
between us.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.060
-Why not?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.490
Is it because I'm Jewish?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.490
Or is it because you're
a type of whore?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.260
-You can say I'm already
married.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.850
Married to my job.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.200
I make people happy five days
a week, six if I'm saving up

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.560
for a trip or something, like if
I want to go to Vegas with

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.670
the girls and let loose,
you know, go clubbing.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.920
Who else can say that
about their job?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.230
-Yeah.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.550
Do you ever stop talking?

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.110
I feel like I'm watching
"The View."

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.550
-You could also say I'm
married to Walter.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.800
-Who the hell's Walter?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.626
Now I'm not so hard anymore.

00:04:17.626 --> 00:04:19.529
-You know I can help
you with that.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.180
-You can?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.769
-What do you say?

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.710
Let's give this story
a happy ending.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.520
-Well, yeah, all right.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.593
Oh, that's good.

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:30.060
That's good!

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.740
(BRITISH ACCENT) Oh,
god, that's good.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.257
I'm two minutes away.

00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:52.058
