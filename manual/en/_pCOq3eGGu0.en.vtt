Nina has an MSc in Mathematics-Economics and
is an industrial PhD student at DONG Energy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Today Nina is presenting her research about
oil prices in the global market.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Her challenge will be to maintain their
interest and avoid too much criticism.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm adding the final touches to my presentation
for a conference in Australia in two weeks.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.350
The presentation is about the connection between
oil prices and exchange rates. I have asked -

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.420
- some colleagues to be guinea pigs for my presentation,
and I'm very excited whether I'll be able -

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.960
- to capture their attention when presenting
this highly mathematical material, and whether -

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
- I'll get feedback that can make my presentation
a little more focused.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.100
YOUR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AS A 
MATHEMATICS-ECONOMICS GRADUATE

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.300
I'm very excited to see whether they follow
my way of addressing the issue. And I hope -

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.400
- that they can give me useful feedback, so
that I'll be ready for the conference.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.550
My name is Nina, I'm 30 and have an MSc in
Mathematics-Economics. I work at DONG Energy,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.260
where I am doing an industrial PhD thesis
about the oil and gas market.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.030
I'll present my current research, which
is on the correlation structure of commodity -

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.740
- prices and exchange rates.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.310
With more than 240 speakers, the conference
ranks among the largest within mathematical -

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.250
- finance theory. And there will probably be
twice as many participants. I'm really excited -

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.550
- about doing my presentation down under, and
I hope that I get some new angles on my work -

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.520
- when I get feedback from my colleagues and
from the conference participants.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.250
Thanks for your feedback. I will...

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.160
Good luck!

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.510
Today's presentation is over, and now I'll
have to incorporate the last corrections.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.150
They say I can easily make the presentation
more technical without losing audience attention.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.330
So I'll try to remove some of the simple stuff 
and add more hardcore mathematics.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.580
A good day for me is when I can tick off things
on my list and I've achieved minor milestones -

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.920
- in my research project.
So today was a good day!

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.319
Mathematics-Economics is an excellent study
programme if you're into mathematics -

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.510
- and also have an interest in the business sector.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.250
