00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.060
Last night

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.050
I saw one of them in my dream

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.070
Last night

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.150
I chased one of them in my dream

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.690
They say “We speak in different voices

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.300
when fighting with the ones we’ve loved”

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.610
I know we also speak that way

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.470
when looking after our own

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.750
I like to play hide and seek

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.550
But before you count 50

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.920
I’m sure I will get tired

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.510
I think I’d rather seek

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.380
I know that you speak in different voices

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.710
Don’t be afraid show me who you are

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.100
Searching for things not here

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.580
From me, spinning ’round

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.940
To you, weaving words

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.400
I give this song

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.130
Last night

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.380
I saw one of them in my dream

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.000
Last night

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.600
I chased one of them in my dream

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.000
Last night

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.670
I saw one of them in my dream

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.090
Last night

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.760
I chased one of them in my dream

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.410
They say “We speak in different voices

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.790
when fighting with the ones we’ve loved”

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.630
I think we always speak that way

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.050
but on the edge of life

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.360
I like to play hide and seek

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.970
But when you count 100

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500
I realize at last

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.330
I’d like to go away

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.540
I give them shape and line them up

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.010
I stack them then knock them down

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.900
Everything I see with my eyes

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.930
I take for an illusion

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.580
 (Show me)
Words are everywhere.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.940
(Who you are)
And there lies a heart.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.010
When you’ve lost everything,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.200
Then, you’ll be able to see it.
