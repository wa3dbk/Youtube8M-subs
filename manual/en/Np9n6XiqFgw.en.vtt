00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.189
okay i want to talk about something
that's not in our london today but it's

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.680
something that i am personally
experience and i think a lot of students

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.329
experience it as soon as they enter the
job market

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.779
you know you obviously build all of
these very close friendships out when

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.829
you're in high school

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.730
right and their friendships that you
think are gonna last for ever oregon are

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.500
gonna last a long time and i feel like
friendships from childhood and from high

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.379
school

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:27.680
art the french obscene cherish the mouse
because they've known you for so long

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.220
but they wanted the job market you start
your career and you start growing into a

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.620
completely different person and you
realize just how different you are from

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.580
those people yeah

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.700
eight and something that i am personally
going through right now and it's a scary

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.569
transition because you start losing
touch with those people

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.510
we'll actually do spend time with them
you feel like there's really no level

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.210
that you can connect with them on

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.990
uh... you get more frustrated and
annoyed with that because you know some

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.060
of that haven't changed at all since
high school year like come on get your

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.380
life to gather you've gotta do something

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.580
so i think that something that a lot of
our viewers are going to go through so i

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.850
just want to share my personal
experience with you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.320
you're definitely gonna grow out of a
lot of friendships and you've got to be

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.340
open to it because you don't want it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950
you know what you like to be stagnant

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.530
you want to move forward

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.780
and it's hard to let go of those
friendships but i think it's inevitable

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.060
uh... i come from a very different
position uh... i'd always feel weird and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.189
i was around in undergrad would face
book hadn't yet taken offer anything

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.490
like that so

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.980
getting friended five years after high
school by somebody that you've certainly

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.710
barely knew always made me feel a bit
weird

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.510
uh... uneasily shared the memories of
these people book

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.160
what our friendships you know after
college actually about and you do day to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.600
day you talk about the things are going
on in your life your career

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680
you're not talking about you know we did
when you are a you'll really have any

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.100
any connection with these people in
lawrence

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.220
i mean we share good memories but that's
really that's it for me such a shot

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.940
their heads off like when i got my
family and dont like as pretty far from

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.829
them i mean you're across the country

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.159
it's nice to check in the a c what
they've been doing but

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.740
i could meet somebody like i just moved
to l_a_ i can meet somebody three weeks

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.679
from now i would know them better really
than the people that i a supposedly knew

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.720
so well growing up you know in high
school or something like that that's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.639
kinda depressing

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.879
but yeah you know if they don't see it
is depressing but i do because

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.149
it's interesting to know that someone
could be your best friend for such a

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.879
huge part of your life and then all the
setting you not only lose contact with

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.849
them you just never speak to them again

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.109
you know and and they shared really
important

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.980
parts of your bets with senator

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.190
yet so i i and out for me and a little
more sentimental i guess uh... a little

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.290
bad about it but it is what it is you
guys are the next periods at i don't

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.319
think if

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.209
you know if they're really good friends
of yours they're gonna continue to be in

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.940
touch with the new non stop it i have
friends from

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.180
elementary school even and f_ lee from
high school that i still talk to him

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.329
there's a reason a still talk to them
and not others no offense to them but is

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.109
that we should remember is but that's

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.329
it is a sort of friends you know who you
are

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.469
i'm sure they're watching right now who
are john had a role as friends were in

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.199
grade school he did not like you not
what you feel the rest of up to them you

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.519
know actually friend in l_a_ right now
is from uh...

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.339
elementary school existed in some of my
best friends are high school students
