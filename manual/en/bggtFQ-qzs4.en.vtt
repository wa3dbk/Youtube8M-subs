00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.500
So this is Smokey Joe.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Smokey is a ten-year-old cat

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
we adopted from the Humane Society of Seattle/King County

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
two years ago, when he was eight.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I started training him about one year ago

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.900
when he was nine.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.000
He's learned very quickly

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
because he's very, very motivated by food.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Any cat that's motivated by food

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
is usually pretty easy to train.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
So, we start with a target stick

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(or really anything).

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.500
The most important thing is the clicker

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
and some reward

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
which in his case is just kibble

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
because he just loves food so much.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.000
So...

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Cats have an attention span of about three seconds

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which means you've got to give him his reward

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
within three seconds

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of whenever he does whatever you want him to do.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
So I put this down

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
and he noses it. [click]

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
I'll give him a click to say

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
"Yes, that's what I wanted you to do"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
and here's a piece of food.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
TO CAT: So here you go -- try nosing that again.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
And, you know, cats are just curious

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so when they do something that seems...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.000
TO CAT: Uh-huh, come on -- over here.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
When they do something that seems [click]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
interesting to them

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000
and it's what you want,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
just let them know. [click]

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
TO CAT: Yep, that thing right there; keep doing it.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.500
And pretty soon...

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.000
TO CAT: Oh, you get a treat, Sweety.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
And then pretty soon you can sort of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
lure him all over the place.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
He's like: "Oh, this is what I'm supposed to do."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
"I'm supposed to follow that thing there." [click]

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.750
He'll hit it maybe

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.000
or something like that.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
And after a few months, it leads to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
the show I'm about to show you:

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.000
The Amazing Smokey Joe Show

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
TO CAT: Come on Smoke, let's show them how it's done.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Come on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.500
[click]

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Very good

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Back... back the other way

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.000
[click]

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Good

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
Now higher

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Come on

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Let's go

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
[click] Excellent!

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Oh, and some hang time there.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
And back, let's do one more really big one.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Come on, go back

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.500
[click] Okay...

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.000
really big one now.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
Way up, shoulder height... come on

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
Come on, you can do it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500
You can do it, yes.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
[click] Yes! Good boy.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Come on... come on, Smokey

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[click] Excellent.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.500
Good, come on

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.500
[click]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Come on

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
[click]

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
Excellent, now...

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Both together

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.500
Yeah, come on

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Come on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.000
[click]

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Yes, very good

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
Two treats for that one

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
Come on... come on

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.000
Come on, back the other way

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.000
[click]

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Excellent.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.000
Do it one more time?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
One more time

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
[click] Very good.
