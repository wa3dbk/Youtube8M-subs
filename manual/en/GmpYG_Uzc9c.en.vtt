hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.580
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.470
Today I'm going to cook a dish using
spike melon

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.460
these are kind of the same family as
bitter melon but they're called as a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.400
field melon and in Andhra they call this
Aakakarakai and you know they have got

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.980
little spikes here you can see what we
do is just you know cut them into

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.860
quarters see these ones are very tasty
and especially when the fruit is little

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.260
bit ripe the seats inside become nice
and crunchy and especially they cook

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
this with meat but also you can just
cook this with the onion and tomato

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.629
masala

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.440
today we're going to make this spiky
melon along with onion and tomato see

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.030
the recipe is very simple

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.789
there is nothing super awesome about it
but when you make this with the spiky

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.979
melon it becomes very very tasty and
also this is a reminder for you to go

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.760
and try different different vegetables
when you go to the market if you find

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.420
something new

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.610
pick it up and in today's world if you
go online you will find quite a few

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.600
number of recipes with that and try it
that way you'll be incorporating and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.740
encouraging your children to try different vegetables and once you cut

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.610
this all you need to do is just fry them and when you fry them you can see

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.900
the seeds of this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.680
they'll become nice and crunchy and they
will remain crunchy even if you cook in

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.340
the gravy

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.729
so let's go ahead and make this
preparation for this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.680
pour some oil into a pan and when the
oil is hot add mustard seeds when the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.479
mustard seeds splutter, add cumin seeds , crushed garlic and slices of onion

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.299
and also add salt and you don't want these onions to be brown or anything you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.869
just want them to be slightly
transparent and while you cook the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.549
onions you can also add some turmeric, now you don't have to cook the onions

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.239
you just have to saute them and you want the onions to still remain little

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.410
bit crunchy, in this add chopped tomato and also

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.680
add chili powder you know for this
little extra chilli powder would be good,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.700
little bit of cumin powder, coriander
powder and just mix all of this and you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.720
can also add this fried spiky gourd and
just let this cook along with this for

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.670
another 2 - 3 minutes

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.970
put the lid on and just let it steam and
it'll be ready in two minutes; after two

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.680
minutes of cooking just saute them wow

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.290
that should be good enough in this add
some chopped coriander and this is all

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.480
ready to serve and you see this vegetable
very crunchy when you eat them

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.800
look at this melon and also you can see
this little bit seeds they look like the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.270
seeds of okra

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.710
but I'm telling you these will remain
crunchy even after cooking; you boil them

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.390
in the soup or you make anything they'll
still remain crunchy and that's what

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.030
make this dish very very special

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.540
