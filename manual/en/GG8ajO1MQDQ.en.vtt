00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.360
every day ISU dining

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.270
feeds thousands of hungry students whether in the dining halls

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.480
vending machines or cafes across campus
but trying to plan for

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.840
and order the exact amount of food is
simply impossible

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.620
it isn't an even flow because as we get in
the beginning of semester we may have

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.260
more and then as we get closer to the
end the semester

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.670
actually was really more the middle of
the semester it becomes

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.149
less because of the efficiencies of our ordering

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.239
but then as it comes to the end of the
semester people eat different when

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.170
they're under stress

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.239
for their finals.  that means there are
leftovers we have leftovers

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.640
in the retail and one other things as
important as we don't wanna see the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.480
students

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.780
who are the last ones we serve have a
different experience than the first one

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610
and those leftovers were the discussion
in an honors class at Iowa State a few

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.559
years ago

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.739
what that class did is they came to us and
said you know we really are concerned

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.890
about food waste

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.840
and we realize that your composting in
the residence halls but what are you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.689
doing in retail and catering and how

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.979
can we help?  that's when the
class did some searching and found

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.429
Food at First. Food at First is a 
combination

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.689
have a community meal program we serve a
meal seven days a week.  it's free

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.929
to anyone that wants to show up the
other half is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.060
our grocery distribution

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
it's a a food pantry.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.689
we distribute food here three times a
week we give all of our  food that are

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.849
going to be perishable ro Food at First. My
team is pretty efficient using leftovers

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.829
but it's all these packaged items
that are already processed and turned

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.359
into something that's where we fall into
a bigger

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.029
problem and now this is given as a
resource to take care of it.

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:56.889
it really is food you can eat. it has  the quality level that we feel

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.249
is expected of us

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.289
that's not the offering that we want to
put out there so six days a week

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.169
volunteers and students like senior Kyle Donnelly

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.330
pick up the leftover food and deliver it
to Food at First

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.750
I just want to get back to the ames
community a little bit and this program

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.970
kind of helps people who are

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.530
maybe not the best situation be able to
get some food and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.750
put that money toward something else
but Kyle's not the only one

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.330
Iowa State plays a huge role at Food at
First We are really lucky in that we get groups

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.310
from Iowa State

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.660
that sign up to do the service

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.810
at the at meal programs and the infamous
Stuff the Bus donation drive at Iowa State

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.030
provides Food at First with enough
food to last a year

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.700
there our other groups will have food
drives primarily Iowa State

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.770
fraternities sororities service clubs

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.760
will they'll have their own food
drives

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
it's on a smaller scale but it adds up and every donation is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.680
appreciated

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.710
because the need is constantly growing
I've been involved with Food at First for

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.490
three years

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.570
and what I see is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.620
a lot more children that show up at
those meals

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.770
a lot more families come then they use to
Food at First serves hot cooked

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.170
meals to an average seventy people each
night

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.370
and the food pantry has seen record
numbers too. Since 2011

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.370
we've seen  the demand

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.770
here more than double it used to be that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.200
50-60 people was a good day

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.900
was a high number for us now we're
seeing 130

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.060
and that's that's a trend that continues
to grow and grow

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.350
we don't wanna send anyone out here
empty-handed and we never have to do

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.780
that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.010
and that's just the mission of Food
at First -  feed people

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.120
recycle food and and never say no,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.210
because they know for a lot of people
we are the primary source of food

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.590
and that motivates all of us

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.100
we can't do this without Iowa State

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.190
these students donated their time
through their class set up different

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.350
people to  volunteer and pick up that
food

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.700
and take it to Food at First, so they really were the link

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.250
that brought us there here we are
because of an honors class

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.510
sharing with the community it's such a
great feeling to see someone who's grateful

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.620
 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.009
for what they get and we don't see that
that too much there's more expectations

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.970
then gratefulness promise, you can just see in their faces

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.150
they were they felt so good when they
went on that day there very glad that

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.740
you did this for them the very thankful

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
they know that you are taking time out of your day so they really appreciate

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.919
what you're doing to me it has been a
very rewarding program

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.810
it's been an opportunity to share with
the community here in Ames

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.689
but also to share with our students

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.249
in providing that opportunity I'd love
for us to be

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.499
unnecessary I love for food for first
to be irrelevant

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.259
but that's not gonna happen so instead
food at first will be filling the hungry

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:55.879
stomachs

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.120
and warm in the hearts of those in need
smiles and tears both

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.180
for years to come it's the most
gratifying thing I've ever done in my

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.770
life

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.340
