Hi. My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today, I'm going to show you

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:11.929
how to make Black Eyed Peas. Now for our final
presentation here, i would actually recommend

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.370
using a slotted spoon like this. Actually
this one has already got some bean juice on

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.280
it. It's not dirty I promise. To get your
beans out of the pot, because this way you'll

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.630
get a lot of bean and a lot of pork and not
a whole lot of juice. Although some people

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.839
really like the juice and if that's the case,
then use a non slotted spoon. So you'll see

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.600
here. I'm putting it on a small side plate
because this is traditionally a side dish.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.390
Although a lot of people I know will be eating
this as an entree. So, then depending on where

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.710
you grew up will determine how you eat this
and what you eat it with. I grew up in Texas,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.050
and so this is how we eat it. Just plain like
this with just a little bit of Tabasco or

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.600
something on it. Although something I learned
while living in Georgia, is a pat of butter

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.871
on top. As you know, everyone in the south
likes their food to taste fantastic and it

00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.190
can be really, really be bad for you. And
I've got to say, I agree with the way they

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.689
think. I think that food is something that
should be tasted and not just something to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.929
eat for sustenance. If you're going to go
out, go out happy. Little pat of butter on

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.850
top of this. You know a little bit of cornbread
with this or like a roll. I know growing up

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.710
in Texas, we always put cornbread with it.
In the south, you're going to get cornbread

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.930
or a biscuit with it or a roll. So, whatever
you really want, I think it is completely

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.240
acceptable to eat this as meal unto itself.
Especially with the way I made it with a lot

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.890
of ham and fatback in it or I'm sorry, salt
pork as the proper term is. A little butter

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.140
on top, stir it in. I like mine a little salty,
so we're going to hit mine with some salt.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.770
Going to give it a twist of the pepper mill
and we're even, something else you can do

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.689
is put a little Tabasco on top or a similar
kind of sauce, salsa or even just some little

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.140
pickled peppers on top. It's really excellent.
So, there we have our black eyed peas. You

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.740
got to have these the New Year. This is an
awesome recipe. From start to finish, it will

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.680
take you about, depending on your peas and
depending on how long you cook it and how

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.560
you cook it, anywhere from three to four and
a half hours. I did mine on a super low heat,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.200
so I went about four hours on mine. Everything
else said and done. But that's not including

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.420
soaking the peas. So that's the actual cook
time. It's an awesome dish. I hope you enjoy

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.560
eating it. I know I enjoyed making it. Look
for my videos on Expert Village and enjoy

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.670
your Black Eyed Peas.
