Hi. This is Justin from RockyMountainATVMC.com.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.100
Today, I'm going to show you how to install the Eagle Manufacturing Subframe Bolt Upgrade Kit.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.920
If you ride a KLR 650, we highly recommend that you upgrade your subframe bolts.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.800
The stock bolts are made up of a low-grade material and may leave you stranded.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.520
Eagle Manufacturing has 2 Subframe Bolt Upgrade Kits.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.680
The first kit simply just replaces the stock weak bolts with higher 12.9-grade bolts.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.260
This is a great kit for the average commuter.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.720
If you're going to be taking you KLR 650 adventure riding and you have panniers

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.050
or any weight on your bike, you'll want to get the drill-through bolt kit.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.780
The Drill-Through Subframe Bolt Upgrade Kit is the kit that we're going to install on this KLR.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.900
The first thing that we're going to do is remove the side plates.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.440
Once the side plates are removed, go ahead and take off the seat, 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.100
then you can move to the tank.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.440
On the tank, make sure to take off the vent hoses off the back of the tank

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.230
and also the two hoses running to the petcock.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.460
Once the tank is out of the way, we're going to loosen the hose clamp on the back of the carburetor;

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.180
this hose clamp holds the air boot to the carburetor.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.660
Once that's loose, we're going to remove the silencer.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.340
The reason we're removing the silencer and loosening the boot on the carburetor

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.119
is so we can get the subframe out of the way.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.099
Getting these two things out of the way makes that a lot easier.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.220
Once the silencer is off, we're going to loosen the lower subframe bolts,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.700
and then we're going to completely remove the upper subframe bolts.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.780
Once the upper subframe bolts are out of the way, we're going to let the subframe drop back,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.780
which is going to pull the air boot off the carburetor.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.739
With the carburetor air boot open and the carburetor open, you're going to want to make sure to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.439
put a rag in the carburetor and air boot so you don't get metal shavings in either of those.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.020
Now that we have the subframe out of the way, we should have plenty of access to the holes in the frame.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560
Now we're ready to start drilling the frame.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900
When you're drilling the frame, you want to make sure you're using a good cutting oil or drill oil,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.200
if nothing else a motor oil, but it's important to keep the bit oiled as you're drilling through the frame.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.340
Start out with the 5/16 bit to get a pilot hole through the frame.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.880
When you're drilling the frame with the 5/16 bit, drill through the frame about halfway on each side.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.700
Don't try to do the whole thing from one side. You'll be surprised how easy it is to drill that hole crooked.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.120
Once you've drilled all the way through with the 5/16 bit, use the 13/32 bit

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.769
and slowly drill through the frame going halfway through each side, just like you did with the 5/16 bit.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.760
Be patient when you're drilling.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.740
The frame is solid in the middle and it does take a little bit of time to drill all the way through the frame.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.640
Once the frame is completely drilled through, you're going to do the same thing to the subframe.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.599
Start with the 5/16 bit, drill through each side of the subframe and then use the 13/32 bit,

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.739
drilling through each side of the subframe.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.860
Once you've drilled through the frame and the subframe, it's time to clean up your mess.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.870
Get an air hose or whatever you need to blow away the shavings from drilling.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.540
Make sure everything's clean.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.360
Make sure you don't have anything in your air boot or carburetor.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.900
Remove the rag, and then you're ready to install the bolt.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.280
Install the bolt on one side of the subframe, through the frame,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.040
and then on the other side, install the spacer and the nut.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.400
Once that's on, you're going to torque the nut to 33 foot-pounds; you may need to go

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.700
a little more than that,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.360
especially if you have a gap in between the subframe and frame.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.560
Once that's tight, we can replace the lower subframe bolts.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.220
We'll go ahead and remove the stock subframe bolts, and as you can see looking

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.240
at the stock subframe bolts, it already shows a lot of wear on it.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.420
We're going to apply a little bit of thread locker to the new bolt and install the lower bolt and washer.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.560
Once it's in, we're going to tighten it up to 18 foot- pounds, and we're good to go.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.800
Now that you've upgraded your subframe bolts, you're not going to have to worry about your

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.550
subframe falling off out in the middle of the desert.
