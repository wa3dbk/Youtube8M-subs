00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.120
You know a game has a grip on you when you
say something like, "I'd have bought a Nintendo

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.889
DS just to play it".

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.230
The World Ends With You (TWEWY) was just such
a game for me, and knowing that I'd get to

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.770
play it again on the iOS platform immediately
dredged up a host of happy memories spent

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.410
lazily enjoying its Beat'em-up RPG-like gameplay.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.829
The reason I'm gushing from the outset is
to establish a base-level of 'rose-tinted

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.550
glasses' for our readers/viewers and perhaps
to soften the blow of the following statement:

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.260
TWEWY for iPhone and iPad is not perfect.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.800
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it doesn't
live up to the original Nintendo DS game just

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.290
because it removes an entire screen - in fact
the game's solution to this issue is quite

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.790
elegant - or because it somehow messes with
the original in a fundamental way (it doesn't),

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.160
but rather that the port is so faithful that
despite the vast improvements made to the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.350
game, it retains many of the basic flaws of
the original such as the dated use of text

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.460
bubbles to tell the story.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.500
When you take this in to consideration you
can focus on the game's many successes, including

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.980
a revamping of the visuals to a glorious Retina-quality
resolution and retooled social systems such

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.150
as the Tin Pin Slammers side-game; Twitter
integration; and easy to use trading.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.310
Despite already existing on the Nintendo DS,
this feels like a game designed from the ground-up

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.300
for the iOS platform.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.590
You play the game (ostensibly) as Neku, a
smart-alec loner-type who finds himself lost

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.960
in the UG, or 'Underground', and forced to
play a game run by The Reapers or face being

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.990
erased.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.100
Along his journey he bumps in to other 'players',
forming pacts of friendship in order to defeat

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.550
the 'Noise'- creatures controlled by The Reapers.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.960
It's a game with distinctly Japanese themes
(aside from the fact that it's set in the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.780
trendy Shibuya District of Tokyo).

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.200
TWEWY's central gameplay revolves around 'pins'
- collectable items that can be used to unlock

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.180
various powers in combat including active
abilities and passive boosts.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.580
They can be leveled up to increase their potency
and potentially even 'evolve' in to powerful

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.660
new pins if they earn enough of the right
experience, and to get them all you'll need

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.230
to invest in trading with other players.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.490
Of course their best use comes in the form
of direct combat with Noise, with each pin

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.420
activating based on a specific gesture used
on screen, from swiping to tapping or even

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.480
moving Neku around the screen.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.510
Your partner can also get in on the act too,
making it easy to dish out huge amounts of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.040
damage, especially if you alternate attacks
to 'sync' up and activate a super-power.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.470
Things get even more complicated when fashion
trends start to influence the strength of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.510
your equipped clothes and pins, while eating
food (up to 24 'bytes' a day) can also give

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.290
you a permanent stat boost, and turning off
your game to go do something else can earn

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.459
you experience for your pins (up to a set
limit).

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.120
If there's any downside to playing The World
Ends With You, it's that iPhone users are

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.730
unlikely to be using a stylus, resulting in
a fair share of misclicks, but it's hard to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.040
complain at all on the iPad, especially when
it proves to be so responsive.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.630
A final note of mention goes to the price
of the game - something I'm sure will become

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.340
a hot topic of discussion.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.061
If you own the original, then you know whether
or not you want to invest in this game; if

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:12.200
you loved it, then you're being afforded a
chance to play it again in a readily accessible

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200
form.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.600
If you didn't own the original, you'd be mad
not to get it, especially if it goes on sale;

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.890
even if you can get the original at the same
price, this version features improved visuals

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:32.560
and gameplay features, making it worth making
your primary choice.
