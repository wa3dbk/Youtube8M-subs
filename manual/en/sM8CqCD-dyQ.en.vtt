00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.130
Okay, here's the deal and this is the real
deal.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.080
You see a lot of a little books that will
say "Here's the Bet, Here's How To Do It."

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.570
But nobody is going to bet you on those.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.380
You have to know how to lure the mark into
the bet.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.750
How do you do it?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.550
Sit down next to somebody, introduce yourself.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.590
The first thing you have to do is invade their
body space.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.960
People have this comfort zone around them.It's
normally only three feet, but if you reach

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.480
out and shake somebody's hand, body contact
has happened.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.890
You've broken that personal zone.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.150
Now ask them a question or just start chatting
casually to them with questions.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.870
You can say something like "I just popped
into the bar on the way to the train station.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.420
I just thought I would have a couple of drinks
before going home.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.920
How about you?"

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.150
Notice how I answered a question.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.220
You could say at an airport, "I arrived early
from my flight so I'm just sitting at the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.750
bar, going to have a bite to eat.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.860
I think that's pretty cool, I am finally early
for a flight.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.440
Where are you going to?"

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.950
Always end those opening questions with a
question.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.390
Always do that, because that forces them to
reply.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.430
You've broken the body language.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.750
They have to reply to you.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.850
So now you start to socially mirror them and
body mirror them.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.320
So body language there have been humongous
books written on this.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.650
Some companies have spent millions of dollars
on this.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.460
Don't fold your arms.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.360
Don't cross your legs.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.320
Stay open to them.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.170
They will immediately, at a very subliminal
level start to see you as a friendly person.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.549
You've talked to them.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.409
You've got their name.

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.129
Remember their name and use it.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.459
People love to hear their name repeated back
to them.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.749
It's very big deal with people, especially
if they see you being just slightly better

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.609
than them.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.590
And that's the key.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.730
Be exactly what they are.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.870
My nickname from the FBI wasthe Ghost, because
I could become anybody.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.989
I could become a dentist.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.310
I could become a lawyer.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.309
I could become a blue collar worker who worked
in construction.

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:58.159
Whatever their job is, mirror it.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.909
Whatever their problems are, you mirror their
problems.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.430
"I am just here at the bar because my wife
shouted at me."

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.579
"Jeeps, I know exactly what you mean.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.969
My girlfriend has just done the same thing
to me.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.709
That's why I'm stopping here on the way home."

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:23.720
The moment they start to empathize with you,
you own them.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.060
You see the difference is that they like you.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.579
I don't like them.

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.000
I just see them as a walking ATM machine.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.790
All I want is the contents of their wallet.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.890
It's very important that if you're going to
do these bets, you can't have no caring for

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.169
people, whatsoever.

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.819
You have to be ice cold.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.309
It doesn't mean you don't have to have a emotional
heart or be a nice person, but at that moment

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:03.510
you are a ice cold machine, looking at a free
ATM machine.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.769
And when somebody walks up to me at the bar
or I sit next to them at the bar that's exactly

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.769
what I see.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.599
Then all we have to know is how much money's
in their wallet.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.790
How do you do that?

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.310
It's an old con man's game called Peek the
Poke.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.310
Peeking the Poke means seeing how much money's
in their wallet.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.020
Now I've employed girls to do this before
called Ropers.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.900
And a roper, if you get a good one can look
at a guy to 30 paces and tell you to a dollar

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.550
what they've got to their wallet.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.430
My technique, I used to dip the wallet and
that means pickpocket, by the way to my untrained

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.940
friends out there.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.150
And I'd would count the money and then I'd
drop the wallet on the floor behind them and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.430
I'd say to the guy "Oops, it looks like you
dropped your wallet."

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.510
And they look down and say "Oh, my goodness
me," and they'd pick up their wallet and they'd

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.560
thank me.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.450
Probably buy me a drink.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.960
But you know what happened?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.680
A; I know exactly what's in his wallet.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.160
B; he's now my best friend, because I just
saved him from losing his wallet.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.000
So once you've spotted the mark, social mirror
them, body mirror them.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.070
If they reach for a drink, you reach for a
drink.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.480
If they eat a pretzel, you eat a pretzel,
even if you hate them, which I do by the way.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.210
They light a cigarette, you light a cigarette.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.590
You social mirror them, and you become exactly
like them, and that's how you become their

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.880
friend.
