00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.830
There are four shotguns in CS:GO; the Nova,
Sawed-Off, MAG-7 and the XM1014. I might as

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.309
well compare them all.
A big thank you to SlothSquadron who has given

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.959
me valuable feedback and advice to ensure
that this video doesn't have any glaring mistakes.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.449
Thank you!
There are three tiers of pricing, with the

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.230
nova and sawed off both costing $1,200. The
MAG-7 covers the middle-ground at $1,800 and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.230
the XM1014 is $2,200. Essentially, shotguns
are competing with SMGs and lower-priced rifles.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.910
However- there's one massive benefit that
shotguns have over the other choices, and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.350
that's the kill award. You get a massive $900
per kill with the shotgun, compared with just

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.590
$300 for rifles or $600 for most SMGs. Factor
in the shotgun's low cost and you've got yourself

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.780
a potentially lucrative income from choosing
these weapons.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.280
I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that I rarely
use shotguns. They require a different style

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120
of play to the other weapons in-game, but
they can be brutally effective at close-range

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.970
and have been used in proper matches by high-level
players, Get_Right included.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.670
I don't think that I'm in the best position
to advise you on HOW to use it. However, this

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.430
video will simply analyse the pros and cons
of the different shotguns, which is something

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.580
I can do. If you want to know how to use them
then look else-where or simply load up a deathmatch

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.970
server.
Let's look at some odd quirks that the shotguns

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.040
have. The MAG-7 is the only one that isn't
reloaded one shell at a time. This is a mixed

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.990
blessing. Overall it's faster to reload completely,
but you are unable to fire mid-way through

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.320
the animation like you are with the other
shotguns. The MAG-7 has a smaller magazine

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400
size than the others as well so you may find
yourself facing difficult decisions regarding

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.680
when to reload. Shotguns are very much a close-quarters
weapon and you must have a plan of retreat

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.490
should the situation turn against you.
As for fire-rate, there's one clear winner.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.330
The XM1014. You may be interested to know
that the nova is slightly slower than the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.270
MAG-7 and Sawed off shotgun. Fun fact: the
sawed-off shotgun is the only shotgun where

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.880
you have to manually press fire for every
shot.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
With three of the shotguns, the delay between
shots is long enough to reset the recoil,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.709
resulting in a similar spread pattern every
time. However, the XM1014 is the odd one out,

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.749
as it's an auto-shotgun. Holding down fire
with this beast will make later shots fire

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.709
above the crosshair. I COULD have kept this
feature in and made the gun look terrible

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.579
in all of these comparisons, but instead I'm
going to add a fake delay between each shot

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.689
with this gun to make the results more comparable.
I think it's unfair that this gun should be

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.980
punished for giving you more freedom over
the fire-rate and accuracy. With experience

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.680
you'll manage to get the best of both worlds
out of this gun. Simply keep in mind that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.189
you'll have to compensate for the recoil if
you go full-auto with this gun in-game.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:43.669
Right, let's get on with it. I fired 32 shots
with each gun at a wall 512 units away in

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:48.159
four different stances, and this is how they
compare. Note that I walk closer to the wall

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.790
to get this view, this isn't the range at
which I was firing from.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.739
Standing still and firing, they all offer
the same level of spread apart from the sawed-off

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.169
shotgun, which is more imprecise. The XM1014
was fired the same number of times, but it

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.400
fires fewer pellets than the others so it
doesn't look as... nghhh... 'hole-some'.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.569
There are no major surprises with the crouching,
it shows about the same thing again.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.049
Moving is where things get interesting. Immediately
you can see that the MAG-7 has the tightest

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.689
spread. What you might not notice is that
the sawed off shotgun does surprisingly well.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:25.019
It's now about as accurate as the nova and
XM1014- a significant improvement in comparison

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.959
to standing still.
Interestingly, when crab-walking, the sawed-off

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.680
becomes the least precise weapon again. Hmm.
I might as well use this opportunity to say

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.230
how few pellets the XM1014 fires. Beyond close
range it really is hit and miss. Literally.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.999
You'd be lucky to hit the broad side of a
barn.

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:48.120
Movement speed also varies between weapons.
Here is a table of all the maximum speeds.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.079
The slowest is the sawed-off and the fastest
is the MAG-7. Using a shotgun will make you

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.730
slower than SMG-wielding players, but about
the same as rifle-users.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.469
And how about damage? The XM1014 does the
least, at just 20 damage per pellet and 6

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:08.760
pellets. The nova does 26 with 9 pellets,
the MAG-7 does 28 with 9 and the sawed off

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.599
30 with 9, making it the most powerful...
on paper.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.780
But it's not that simple. The nova and XM1014,
despite being the weakest up-close, do more

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.830
damage at range than the mag-7 and sawed off,
which drop off very quickly at distance. Beyond

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.680
750 units the sawed off doesn't even do any
damage!

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.169
Against armoured opponents the nova is the
worst and the XM1014 the best, with the sawed

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.720
off and mag7 coming just behind.
With that in mind, the nova is best used for

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.039
an anti-eco after the pistol round, or any
other time when you know that the opponents

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.849
will not be buying armour.
The sawed off is useless at range but is good

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.110
for holding close-range positions against
armoured opponents. It is best suited to hostage

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.789
rescue maps since only the terrorists can
buy it. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.389
have any sort of penetration. I can't even
shoot through one unit of wood against this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.340
opponent.
The mag-7 is like a better version of the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.759
nova. It's more effective against opponents
with armour and is best purchased in rounds

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.050
where you can't quite afford the more expensive
weapons.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.180
The XM1014 won't leave you helpless between
shots but its price premium makes it difficult

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.240
to recommend over the FAMAS, Galil or P90.
As with the Mag-7, there may be certain situations

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.580
and positions where it outperforms these other
weapons, it's really down to personal preference.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.669
I would say that the shotgun to use depends
very much on what you're going to do with

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.909
it. Take some time to practice with them and
you'll be rewarded with a cheap and occasionally

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.590
very effective weapon that others don't really
understand. Plus it's a great way to upset

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.740
opponents. And at the end of the day, that's
what CS:GO's about.
