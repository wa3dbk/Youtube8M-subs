00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.269
In 2010, a devastating series of avalanches
tragically killed 175 people here in the Salang

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.119
Pass, northern Afghanistan.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.830
Many of those who died were trapped within
this 2.6 km tunnel, with snow blocking both

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.760
its entrances.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.210
In response to the 2010 avalanche, International
Security Assistance Force and the Afghan government

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.270
started an avalanche mitigation project here
in Salang.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.280
Avalanche expert Marty Schmoker has spent
the last four years training Afghan authorities

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.289
not only how to respond should such a disaster
occur again, but also how to anticipate avalanches

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.440
before they happen.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.749
"Our job here was to put together and assist
the Afghans in a sustainable avalanche control

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.149
programme for the country of Afghanistan.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.530
We were able to bring them to where now that
they are capable of conducting their own weather

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.629
forecasting, their avalanche forecasting and
their snow mitigation."

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.620
"Afghanistan is a very mountainous country.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:10.720
Most of the roads here go through the mountains
and into the high areas.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.260
The research that we are conducting here at
the moment will help to rescue and help our

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.110
fellow Afghans when there are avalanches.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.100
We have learnt about avalanches and have improved
ourselves.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:35.000
At last, we now feel that we can help our
fellow Afghans through our new knowledge."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.300
Using their forecasting knowledge, Marty's
Afghan team can pre-empt avalanches.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.680
Having evacuated areas at risk, they assist
the Afghan National Army in shooting at the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.320
mountains, accurately dislodging the snow
in a controlled manner.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:01.670
"Our hope for the future is that the Afghan
government and supporting countries help us

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.729
to expand this programme to other Afghan provinces.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.050
Bamiyan, Badakhshan, Daykundi, Nuristan and
Kunar are all provinces which would benefit

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.180
from this project."

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.430
"I'm leaving today, this is my last mission
here to Salang, I've thoroughly enjoyed working

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.450
here, it's an eye-opening experience.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.060
The people are very friendly and accommodating.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.950
They are just really good people."

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.040
With Marty heading home, and his mission here
completed, the reins are firmly in Afghan

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.439
hands to continue the much-needed work conducted
here.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.620
For NATOChannel in Afghanistan, this is Jack
Somerville.
