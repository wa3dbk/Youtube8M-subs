Jim Bruce Channel http://www.youtube.com/user/acoustictravellersl

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.090
then

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.629
and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.629
from indiana

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.140
baskets

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.530
huh

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.760
uh...

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.760
uh... too

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.610
loaded

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.590
so they were going to look at uh...

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.960
uh... version of love in vain by robert
johnson

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.739
is based loosely on the original much
luck eat many of them dixit johnson used

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.449
it might lack of vigilance intensity
which was uh... which is very special

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.519
but it does allow support on cells into
the music

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.519
and that the basic structure

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.030
let's take a look at the court in drug
use

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.709
the civil is alone any in this fall

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.389
are usually looking at

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:47.389
this is a lot and hope industry receives
a greenhouse effect

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.859
you noticed throughout this song

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.869
that film is striking the the pastries
quite happily very often damping as soon

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.339
as it strikes

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:07.019
in this way

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.199
the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.639
is a strange started technique because
if you get to halt the strings boasts

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.409
that they don't make a very nice nice
notes so the down payment that obviously

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:26.119
be critical buddy predict requires this

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:31.219
nice driving basically gives it a lot of
intensity but of course the treble notes

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:38.219
that the fingers what happens at uh...
thanks

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:47.579
yellow no

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.999
lie

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:13.079
needed

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.079
diner

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:27.389
with the senate

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.879
we open the basic doubled up from back
home we've been that way

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.139
not

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.020
fun

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.960
you

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.680
sexually certificate

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.310
and here is in effect that is a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.280
the trademark of johnson's

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.379
is holding

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.400
the six came down the second fresh with
this problem

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.009
hitting them with some of our own

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.780
middle copied after the first right

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.990
them back to the second

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.819
link between those troops but i think
it's fiction often get

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:06.469
it's not like this
