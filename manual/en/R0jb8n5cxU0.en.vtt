00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.380
Some of the most beautiful and powerful cars
on the road today are assembled in England.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.600
And though we have long since declared our
independence, this is the kind of British

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.539
command no red blooded American could refuse.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:30.780
Meet the all-new, 495-horsepower Jaguar F-Type
V8 S.F-TYPE-0435Jaguar's resurgence continues.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.160
Already stocked with a stable of sexy speed
machines, the one car that has eluded the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.890
brand for some time is a true sports car.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.420
But with the introduction of the aluminum-laden
F-Type, that void is immediately filled.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.580
When you shop the all-supercharged model range,
you could opt for a 340 horsepower V6, step

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.790
up to the S variant of the same engine raising
the ante to 380 horsepower or go all in with

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.600
this fire-breathing V8 S model.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.789
But for your wallet's sake, just don't drive
this one first because once you do there's

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:16.340
no looking back.Though there are three different
engine outputs for the F-Type, this supercharged

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.440
V8 is top-dog.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.320
So if you like the feeling of instantaneous
torque mounting ridiculous acceleration then

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.340
you're absolutely going to love this V8 S
model.With a starting price of almost $93,000

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.920
this kind of awesomeness doesn't come cheaply,
but the power hungry and speed freaks will

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.880
have their F-Type in no other way.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.130
No matter if you use the Dynamic Launch Mode
or simply mash and hang on, this Jag hammers

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.730
through acceleration runs with shocking urgency.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.830
The company lists a 0-to-60mph time of 4.2-seconds
but that's conservative.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.500
Getting there in fewer than 4 is not a problem.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.619
With 460 foot pounds of torque working through
a ZF 8-speed Quickshift Automatic and electronically

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.969
controlled limited slip, these 20" Pirelli
P Zeros -- 295 wide in the rear -- have a

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.790
monumental task of getting this car to stick.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.559
And because it's been really cold here and
the tires like warm, dry pavement, I often

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.489
used the winter mode until things warmed up.

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.549
And it's not until then that the F-Type is
ready to make a gentleman's hand shake with

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.239
the driver -- instilling the needed confidence
to charge through the turns and exit with

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.219
ear rattling authority.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.189
Steering is quick and reactive as the paddle's
fire off the next gear.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:50.519
And the amply padded sport seats with adjustable
side bolsters keep you situated and comfortable.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.150
The Adaptive Dynamics Suspension -- a double
wishbone setup -- keeps the F-Type aggressive

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.790
though compliant, not quite as forgiving as
an XK but closer than you'd think.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.010
And a configurable Dynamic mode allows for
as much tire smoking oversteer playtime as

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.099
you can handle.When I think back to some of
the most memorable sounding cars I've driven,

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:22.579
like a Z06 or an AMG this F-Type has got to
be right up there as one of the most bodacious.

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.749
With this active selective exhaust system
you're just a button push away from complete

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:36.900
craziness.It pops and spits as you let off
the throttle -- just magnificent.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.719
But as a good roadster should, the F-Type
is unobtrusive to top-down conversations.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:49.590
Mine is also equipped with the much appreciated
heated seats and steering wheel and as you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.799
would expect from a Jaguar -- it completely
oozes with cool -- with features like these

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.489
pop out door handles and disappearing vents.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.639
But sorry, no telescoping gear shifter for
this car.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:10.799
With a host of options this fully loaded F-Type
V8 S is priced at $102,770 - perhaps the only

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.549
legitimate F-Type criticism I can dole out.

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.880
It even returns very respectable gas mileage
of 16mpg city/23mpg highway.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.030
Though white would be my last choice, it certainly
has the look, more power than you could ever

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.151
need, a soundtrack sports car lovers drool
over and a sports car drive that's the real

00:04:32.151 --> 00:04:36.220
deal.
