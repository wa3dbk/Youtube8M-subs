00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.500
pit or smoker Hickory wood chips and clean
kitchen towel (optional). Step 1. Pull off

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.530
the thin sheet of skin from the back of each
rack, and place the ribs on a clean, flat

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.060
surface. For a better grip on the skin, use
a kitchen towel. Step 2. To prepare the dry

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.190
rub, mix 1½ tablespoons black pepper, 1½
tablespoons brown sugar, 1½ teaspoons celery

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.370
salt, 1½ teaspoons cayenne pepper, and 1½
teaspoons garlic powder together with the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.040
kosher salt, dry mustard, cumin, and paprika
in a mixing bowl. Step 3. Put on your gloves

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.979
and rub two-thirds of the dry rub on both
sides of the meat. Cover the meat with plastic

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.580
wrap and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
To enhance the flavor, refrigerate the meat

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.720
for up to 8 hours. Step 4. Oil the grill rack,
and prepare the barbecue pit or smoker according

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.620
to its instructions, using hickory wood chips
to flavor the meat. Maintain a temperature

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.630
between 250 and 300 degrees. Step 5. Put the
ribs on the grate bone-side down. Smoke them

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.520
until the meat is very tender and has shrunk
back from the ends of the bone, about an hour

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.909
to an hour and a half. When you have about
15 minutes of cooking time left, sprinkle

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.430
the remaining rub on the meat. Step 6. Once
the meat is finished cooking, remove it from

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.230
the heat and let it cool for one hour. Step
7. In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.989
spices and other ingredients, except the oil.
Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.459
the sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer for
25 minutes, then, stir in the oil. Step 8.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.180
Place the sauce in a small serving bowl for
easy dipping, grab a rib, and dig in! Did

no. 6 on the R&amp;B; charts in 1967.
