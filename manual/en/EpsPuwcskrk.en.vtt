00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.209
[Music]

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.540
It's the first pigeon shooting outing of 2013
- it's not through lack of trying but the

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.860
weather and the seasons being all over the
place has meant that the birds and the Crow

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.030
have been difficult to get in the same place
at the same time.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.470
Finally it's starting to happen, especially
in this corner of the farm where the birds

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.829
are flitting between winter rape, spring peas,
and buds off the trees.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.829
What a lot of the pigeons are doing at the
moment is they are still feeding on buds which

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.420
they should be finished on now.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.303
From now onwards we should be hopefully picking
up some good easy day's pigeon shooting.

00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:52.829
But it is not going to happen for a while
because they are going to be on these buds

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.730
and as soon as you start shooting they are
going to go away and sit in the ash trees,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.929
on the oak on the flowering, on the beeches
and that and they are going to be on those.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:09.050
The winter rape at this end of the field has
struggled in the bad weather, and the whole

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.490
crop is behind, which means the plants are
small enough for the pigeons to land for a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.490
munch.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
In a normal year, this field would be a vibrant
yellow with the plants too high for the birds

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.010
to drop in to.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.430
Andy knows where he wants to be - but that
isn't always possible.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.150
I have got a field of spring peas next door.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.649
They have started on those a bit.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.170
So it is really a bit of a draw to this corner.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
The place I want to shoot is a bit further
down the hedge, but I don't know if David

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.090
can show you.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.030
We have got a telegraph pole and some wires
going across.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.560
So we can't shoot where I really want to shoot.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.310
So we are going to have to do second best
go just here somewhere.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.869
It looks like the wires are close to us, but
they are not they are 80 yards further down

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.310
the field.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.130
So we are just going to hope that we can draw
the pigeons up the field to where we want

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.430
them which is here.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.560
Andy has some new kit on test.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.530
A1 Decoys, Lincoln shotguns, Gamebore cartridges
and Jack Pyke clothing have asked Crow to

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.700
use and abuse their products and see if they
have the right crowdentials - sorry!

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.220
The Lincoln was fresh out of the box yesterday
and old Crow has done all right with it so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.220
far.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.850
The old Lincoln doesn't seem to be doing too
bad.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.430
It is making me look good.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090
I have had four shots, four kills so I am
happy.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.900
Oh no sorry five shots, five kills so I am
happy.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.300
It is going to take a bit of getting used
to.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.830
I am used to the safety catch being at the
back of the trigger.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.010
On this one the safety catch is on the top.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.230
Yes, apart from that it is a good old thing
and the gamebore, clear pigeons seem to be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.379
performing well as well.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.110
Andy has always emphasised the importance
of good cartridges for pigeon shooting, for

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.450
that all-important knock-down power.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.690
To try and explain a bit about what Crow wants
from a cartridge we need some visual aids

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.160
and a glamorous assistant.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.290
... talking a bit about knock down performance
of cartridges and it is a difficult thing

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.290
for people to grasp.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.840
It is a bit subjective for some people and
they don't quite know what it means, but they

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.340
know what the results are.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.540
Yes, that is right.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.290
So, we have brought some handy visual aids
along to try and explain this a little bit.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.020
So can you tell us what the key elements of
knock down power are.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.340
Dom it is speed, size and weight of the shot.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.511
So you can have two projectiles which are
fundamentally the same size, but one of them

00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:39.511
can weigh more than the other.

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:40.570
Cricket ball, similar size to a tennis ball,
but weighs a lot more.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.700
So that is going to have more energy and it
is going to deliver more knock down performance

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700
than that.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.600
So lead shot heavier than steel shot.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600
Yes.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.130
Lead is always going to give more knock down
than steel shot.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.870
Plus the lead performs as well.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.111
Basically what that means is it is not passing
through the bird all the energy it imparts

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:01.920
is within the bird.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.600
The other thing of course is the speed.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.900
So for example if I was to chuck this tennis
ball at your face very gently it would annoy

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900
you.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900
Yes.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.090
If I were to chuck the tennis ball at your
head very hard it would probably result in

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.530
me visiting A &amp; E.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.690
More than likely yes.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.160
So we are going to demonstrate that with our
handy dummy because Andy wasn't brave enough

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.250
to stand here and let me throw tennis balls
at him even though he has seen me shoot and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.680
he is pretty sure I will miss.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.020
In slow motion, we see the jacket buckle to
a greater degree as the ball gets heavier.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.580
Another thing that Crow wants to mention is
density or tightness of the pattern.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.840
Dom doesn't have 15 cricket balls to throw
but Andy likes his shot to stick together

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.840
as there's more chance of killing the bird
stone dead.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.139
As this footage shows, the lead pellets in
the Gamebore cartridge need to be fast, heavy,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.080
distort on impact, and keep tight.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.780
Andy wants plenty of pellets finding the target.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.569
Seeing we're talking about Andy's style of
shooting - these reverse shots show his gun

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.060
is always swinging through the shot.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.110
We also spot that Mr Crow closes one eye just
before pulling the trigger.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.850
It may not be the way they teach you at school
but it works for him.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.650
Right, back to the pigeon shooting and the
birds are playing hard to get.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.180
Andy has a change around and sticks a whirly
up with a couple of A1 Decoys' new Pro Flap

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.590
models.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.120
Crow is not 100 per cent sure he's set them
up properly as they're fresh out of the box

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.450
but help is at hand because A1 Decoys has
a YouTube site with an instructional vid.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.810
The birds come in fits and starts and we are
constantly reminded that the best place would

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.139
be on the corner near the wires - but that's
life and we are getting some sport.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.050
If the birds do keep to the trees Crow claps
them out for a couple of reasons.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.270
I just had some pigeons land in a tree up
there to the left.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.169
I just clap them out otherwise other birds
are going to just decoy straight into them

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.690
and if you do have a shot you are scaring
them anyway.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.259
You are better scaring them out to get rid
of them, to get them moved on really so they

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.710
don't hear the loud bang of a shot.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.600
The afternoon has flown by and it's a lot
later than we'd imagined.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.940
Mrs Crow brings out a lasagne for one and
all so it's time to pack up.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.189
We got upper 60s.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:12.560
We got 65, 66 something like that and a crow
and a jay which is quite nice.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.509
In the end we pick up 74 woodies.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.499
Crow feels we would have doubled that if we'd
been under the wires but that's life - the

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.570
most important thing for us is that pigeon
is finally back on the menu.
