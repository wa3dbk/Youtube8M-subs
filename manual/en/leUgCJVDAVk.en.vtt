00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.509
It's-a-me, a-Cherio! I am one of Waterloo's
first year bloggers this term

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.850
and you know when you're in a university,
in Canada, and it's Canada,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.240
and sometimes it snows a lot and you hate
everything?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.840
Well, Waterloo has this really awesome thing
called tunnels.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.169
You may have heard of them --

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.310
it's this thing where you can get to places
without having to die from cold

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.810
and in this video I'll be showing you a bunch
of the tunnels

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.320
to get around the Waterloo campus.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.239
In this video I'll be showing you tunnels
from South Campus Hall to Modern Languages,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.739
Modern Languages to Hagey Hall,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.250
Math and Computing to Chemistry 2,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.370
and Engineering 2 to J.R. Coutts Hall.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.379
So if you don't want to watch this whole video
of me going around to all these places,

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:40.960
cause ain't nobody got time for that,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.899
click on one of these things to take you to
the specific tunnel you want to see

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.899
or you can watch this whole video cause you
just have time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So if you need to get from the bookstore in
South Campus Hall all the way to Modern Languages,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.829
there's a tunnel that'll take you directly
there. Follow me.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.560
If you're not sure which door to go in, it's
the one that says tunnel to Arts Lecture Hall,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.049
Modern Languages, Environmental Studies, and
"geeee" -- whatever that is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And not only is this the best echo-ey spot
on campus,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.409
but it also leads you to the Tatham Centre
which is the co-op building.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.350
It'll pop you out in the basement near the
change rooms,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.009
so if you're on a nice afternoon stroll to
Modern Languages

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.960
you can stop by here and have a nice relaxing
interview.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.960
But if you're not in the mood for such a nice
relaxing time at the interview,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.000
you can just continue on down this hallway
to the Arts Lecture Hall.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.600
So here you have a choice.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.460
Door number one that'll actually take you
upstairs to the sunlight again,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.719
and you'll pop out by Arts Student Union

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.719
or door number two that'll take you down another
tunnel to Modern Languages.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080
And after our epic trek all the way from South
Campus Hall,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.080
we pop up here in Modern Languages right by
Timmies and the Modern Languages Café.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.900
So I'm in the café of Modern Languages with
real friends,

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.060
I have them they're real okay, okay,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.489
and if you want to get to Environment 1 or
Hagey Hall, just follow me.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
And here we are in the basement of Environment
1

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.650
right by the Department of Geography.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.650
Now come along down here and we'll go straight
to Hagey Hall.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.500
(panting) And we're finally here, at the back
entrance of Hagey Hall.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.600
If you want to get between Chem 2 and Math
and Computers,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.680
go through the doors by the bathrooms on the
first floor, and down these stairs.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.900
And you pop out here in MC through these totally
not suspicious doors

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.930
under the fire do not proceed sign across
from room 1078.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.069
We're here on the first floor of Douglas Wright
Engineering, which is the bottom floor,

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.180
and we can get to other engineering buldings
through tunnels.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.750
For instance we can go down more stairs to
the second floor of J.R. Coutts Hall,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.150
otherwise known as RCH.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now that we've crossed RCH, we can head back
upstairs to Engineering 2.
