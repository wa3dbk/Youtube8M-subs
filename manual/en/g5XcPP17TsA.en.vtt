00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.580
What scares you? Well...it needs to
God knows it's what we all do...

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.120
What I see...well that scares me and I hope it scares you too.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:15.809
That cold fate that you feel and those fates that aren't real.
Well I laugh at my fears cause I know my fates already sealed.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:37.100
I know what's real, I know what's real
Cause I know what's real

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:57.474
So what are you, what are you 
what are you, what are you

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:12.300
What are you afraid of, could it be...
could it be your scared that your nothing like me

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.400
Never living up to all the things they said I could,
Never being any good...

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.920
Accepting for a lifetime that I'll never be complete,
miserable in victory, happy in defeat..

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:42.400
So what are you afraid of, nothing's wrong with this picture...

00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:16.953
My truth is half fiction with a lack of strong conviction.
My life was your vision and I blame my indecision

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:41.940
One life in ruins but don't let that scare you, cause your life, it's OK for now, but don't think the fates are going to spare you...

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.260
...cause they never do...

00:03:46.800 --> 00:04:01.680
They never do...cause they never do

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.760
So what are you? What are you? What are you?
What are you?

00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:37.703
What are you afraid of, could it be...
could it be your scared that you are just like me

00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:46.221
Never living up to all the things they said I could, never being any good.

00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:54.781
Accepting for a lifetime that I'll never be complete,
miserable in victory, happy in defeat

00:04:55.001 --> 00:05:02.981
Learning all my friendships had never really been, never knowing love except from a god damned movie screen..

00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:16.121
So what are you afraid of, nothings wrong... with this picture...
