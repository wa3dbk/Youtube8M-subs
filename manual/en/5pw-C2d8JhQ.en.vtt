00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.019
I'm Mark Williams for pickup trucks dot
com

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.590
and we're here at the 2011 SEMA show in
Las Vegas

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.120
and some people say the only difference
between men and boys

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.120
are the size of their toys and that
you're gonna go look at today

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.620
per struck we have the 2011

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.730
F 350 Super Duty supporters calling this

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.460
the Matchbox its big toy for big man
this is a super

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.900
firefighter truck got a 10 inch lift 41
is super swampers

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.270
and it's got fuel tanks poses on both
sides

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.430
this will put out any fire that anybody
want to get few

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.420
very fast

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.020
another cool vehicle we found outside
yes we know it's not a pickup truck

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.040
but it's still very very cool attack
2011 Jeep Wrangler that's been

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.300
completely modified

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.080
Teraflex suspension 37-inch Licking
County tires

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.970
completely Rhino lined exterior interior

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.640
completely sprayed but the coolest thing
about this obviously

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.850
.50-caliber machine gun decommissioned
on the roof

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.950
also has machine guns and a clock in the
center console

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.280
this probably could be one of our
favorite tracks the shop

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.350
is there anything that says a voice call
a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.340
more than a monster truck I don't think
so behind me we've got Jim Cramer's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.649
artist is big for a truck fifteen
hundred horsepower

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.020
more than 1300 per pound the torque and
I'm told

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.110
that this thing is jump higher 10:30
feet were here

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.289
Toyota where they've made the ultimate
motocross

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.560
support vehicle they basically started
with the tundra

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.640
bigger wheels and tires a mild left then
they've done some customization

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.800
to the pickup bed in fact on both sides

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.880
they've created some serious storage on
this side they have a generator

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.180
and a power washer first prayer on the
other side

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.099
to air compressors to deal with any
problems any motocross team might have

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.220
and the bad

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.990
all sorts a tie downs to take their
vehicles to and from the track

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.300
it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.140
were here at the wild boar booth where
they've created

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.670
a different type a duly they've actually
put a tag axle on the back in a 2011

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
Jeep Wrangler with a pickup bed extended
of the back

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.700
the extra payload is significant because
you've got another axle

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.620
to work while Springs eventually he's
going to be putting an auxiliary fuel

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.260
tank

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.780
that allow him to go upwards of 1000
miles

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.130
on a single tank this might be very
interesting for a lot of people here

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.700
it is probably the most qualified

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.070
traction oriented six-wheel drive jeep

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.550
have this entire show but I might have
some other people asking

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.560
why

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.060
my
