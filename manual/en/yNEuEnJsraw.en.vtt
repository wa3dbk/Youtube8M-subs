00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
New Cardboard Minoriko 5

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.680
One

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.410
Minoriko

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.180
I fixed Morikawa-kun Number 2
 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.550
I fixed Morikawa-kun Number 2
What!?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.850
H-How?
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.510
H-How?
I just dried it and taped it back together

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.910
Welcome back, Morikawa-kun Number 2!
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.510
Welcome back, Morikawa-kun Number 2!
You'll crush it

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.780
Two

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.580
Wow......! He's really healed!
 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.450
Wow......! He's really healed!
I just dried it and taped it back together

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.750
But he feels weird!
 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.480
But he feels weird!
Yeah, because I just dried it and taped it back together

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.850
B-But......

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.910
thump thump
B-But......

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.380
wouldn't he rip if I try to carry something in him?
 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.450
wouldn't he rip if I try to carry something in him?
Yeah, probably

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910
Three

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.710
You can't call him a cardboard, then!
 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.710
You can't call him a cardboard, then!
Okay

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.180
So, I will try to carry this 5kg dumbbell in him!
 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.780
So, I will try to carry this 5kg dumbbell in him!
Wouldn't the bottom fall out of MOST cardboard boxes?

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.110
Bigger ones can hold more than 20kg
 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.850
Bigger ones can hold more than 20kg
Huh

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.010
The dumbbell doesn't quite fit inside Morikawa-kun Number 2
 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.750
The dumbbell doesn't quite fit inside Morikawa-kun Number 2
It's not even a question of if it can carry the weight

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.950
Four

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.780
[Opens eyes wide]
But I'll do it!
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.750
[Opens eyes wide]
But I'll do it!
You know, you really never learn anything from your mistakes

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.580
thump thump

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.610
H-Here I go!
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.110
H-Here I go!
Yeah

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.650
--yaa!

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.880
Five

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.110
You can do it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.550
You can do it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.350
You can do it, Morikawa-kun Number 2

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.710
Six

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.080
RIP
THWACK

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.950
[peel]

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.950
Thanks, Oneechan
 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.980
Thanks, Oneechan
......yeah

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.150
Thank you for watching
[Minoriko: After "New," will it maybe be "2" or "The Movie"?
Shizuha: By the way, Morikawa-kun Number 2 was okay. The tape on the bottom just came off]
