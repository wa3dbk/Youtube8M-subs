00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.380
My name is Joseph Lee. Now I am going to tell
you about how to prepare your bird for the

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.250
race. In racing there are two matters of racing
pigeons. One is called the natural and the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.470
other called the buddy hood system. But in
Calcutta most of the fancier practice natural

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.730
racing. In natural racing it is where the
male and the female are separated. They are

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:35.859
kept in separate lofts. You have a male loft
and a female loft and they are flown also

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:44.059
separately; never mixed together. In the buddy
hood system, this system is mainly used for

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:56.549
long distance race. This is where you have
to plan and fly your birds in such a way that

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:07.750
the bird will be sitting on the egg. After
sitting on the egg before 14 days because

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.970
when they are sitting on the egg, their homing
instinct is much higher because they have

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:22.550
to come back to sit on the eggs to hatch the
eggs. After laying eggs, the hen tend to become

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.980
a little weak so it should be after 10 days
of laying the eggs and for the hen lay the

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:39.880
eggs, the cock goes to a driving season. If
the hen has not laid the eggs when you release

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.670
what happens the cock chasing the hen, they
will not allow the hen to be outside the loft.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.970
They always chase the hen to go back into
the next to lay eggs. At that time, they don't

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.970
eat properly and they don't drink properly
and the only thing they have in mind, chase

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.950
the hen make into the next so that the egg
will not be laid outside. In that period of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.269
time the cock will become a little weak. So
after sitting on the eggs for 10 days, they

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:17.239
recover to some extent. It should be before
14 days because after sitting on the egg for

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.969
14 days then the milk gland starts forming.
Once the milk glands start forming, then the

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:34.639
bird will have less stamina. They will not
be able to fly a long distance. So buddy hood

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.680
system is a bit complicated.
