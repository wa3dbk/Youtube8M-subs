00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.720
it's happening again Lewis the US is
sending missiles and this time

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.940
supplementing them with drones

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.330
to iraq to help Iraq by al Qaeda

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.330
cNN is reporting that two years after
bringing home US troops from Iraq

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.289
the Obama administration is sending hell
fire rockets

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.449
and scan Eagle surveillance drones to
help the government forces fight al

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.910
Qaeda affiliates

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.830
that they believe are growing in
influence that's according to a State

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.619
Department

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.219
officials statement to CNN

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.670
as first reported by The New York Times
the 75 hell fire rockets but by iraq

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.539
arrived last week plans call for 10 the
ScanEagle drones to be sent in the early

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.210
months of 2014

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.289
State Department spokeswoman Jennifer
Sakhi

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.420
said that terrorists were seeking to
gain control

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
up terrorist to territory inside

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.600
the borders a rack Louis it is true that
iraq has experienced an increase in

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.290
sectarian violence you have

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
the SUNY community the dominant a Shia
community

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.030
that controlled the government in there
are sectarian tensions there have

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.590
in sectarian tensions in Iraq for a
really really long time

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.770
and I can't help but feel Louis like
getting into the exact same circle again

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.659
because remember

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.450
this is not a new strategy in the region
we supported

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
the shot over Ron against iraq once the
shot was deposed

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
and the ayatollah came to power we
turned around and supported Saddam

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.180
Hussein during iraq's war

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.229
against Iran it's this vicious cycle
where then we end up going into iraq to

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.180
take down the leader we supported

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.430
and then now we're told it's different
Louis because no

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.430
we had the war in Iraq we installed

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.790
the government which some people believe
was like a hand-picked government

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.829
and now they're with us but we thought
they were with us before in the exact

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.930
same vicious cycle could start again

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.110
yeah and I mean overall it's not just

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.680
a site is strictly in this region that
this type of thing happens and this is

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.390
how we buy most of our worst right

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.770
these these proxy wars where we just
kinda send a bunch weapons then

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.390
and aid to someone and let them just to
help them out in the fighting

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.900
I'm as a completely separate thing from
weather will eventually need to use

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.879
more of our weapons against those
weapons we sold or gave to them because

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.550
they turn

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.510
against us so they're no longer a
strategic ally it's just this tired old

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.260
military-industrial complex and
nearsighted

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.580
foreign policy approach that together
lied to us fighting against our own

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.840
weapons or at least

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.030
against the individuals we supported at
one time it's just unbelievable

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.400
yeah I and you know when wannabes drone
strikes goes bad

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.060
right I you you can't assume that the
city the civilians that are killed

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.120
are going to think that oh well maybe
this came from from iraqis now they're

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.940
probably just going to assume there was
another US term strike

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.680
and I boom all of a sudden you've got a
hundred more al Qaeda recruits yeah and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.209
speaking of assuming that bombs are
drone strikes come from a certain place

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.480
I got an interesting story for you a
little bit later on

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.519
shell was teasing that story
inadvertently he's so good at it that he

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.690
doesn't even have to I just comes
naturally to him
