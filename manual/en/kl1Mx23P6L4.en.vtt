00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.810
Raining and a bit windy morning

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.780
I'm in a high seat waiting for a buck to show up

00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:31.597
Testing waterproofness of my gear ;)

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:48.682
Face and hands covered because of midges...

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.679
I have to be quick, deer don't give much time for a shot here 

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:33.458
He is not going anywhere

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:52.130
Quartering shot through the lungs

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:03.360
I like to examine the place where deer stood 
 even if I know where it dropped

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.130
It makes sense to collect hair for future reference...

00:02:20.258 --> 00:02:27.260
Nice 5-pointer

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:36.950
Probably only 2-3 yo, but on this ground all bucks get shot
