Hello! Welcome to BestBackBets.com!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.290
We provide winning predictions

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.749
for horse racing back bets as featured
on Betfair,

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.459
the largest and most successful betting
exchange in the world.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.909
Our predictions may also be used on pari-mutual
or tote betting on united states

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.389
racetracks.

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:21.939
First, a well known fact -

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.060
over ninety eight percent of horse
players lose

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.679
money...

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.119
Why?

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.149
They failed to select the winning horses
because financial success requires a

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.530
steep learning curve.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.650
There are two groups of horse player
losers.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.000
The first group

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of horse player losers are those who
foolishly pursue a steep learning curve.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.840
Examples include:

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.030
purchasing massive amount of books

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.460
dvds

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.040
software

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.610
newsletters

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.159
attending seminars, conferences

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.000
and webinars

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
that discuss horse racing tips, secrets
or wagering systems.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620
This same group

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.020
also may watch YotuTube

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.460
Betfair videos on trading,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.860
scalping,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.750
laying horses,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.420
horse racing systems,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.070
and automated bot trading.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.430
Now, the second group of horse player
losers differ - 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.300
differ from the first group

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.940
by pursuing a very short learning curve.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.970
Examples include purchasing and studying
a racing program at the racetrack,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.990
making decisions based on jockey, trainer
or horse owner tips.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.250
This same group

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.909
may also purchase predictions from
tiptsters who do not publish or

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.230
discuss their results the following day.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.880
Now, both groups are pursuing a magic bullet
that does not exist.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.150
Remember -

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.109
over ninety eight percent of course players
are losers.

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.609
Albert Einstein's definition of insanity:

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.629
Doing the same over and over again

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.539
and expecting different results.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.260
So; 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.159
what is the definition of a horse player
winner?

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.250
