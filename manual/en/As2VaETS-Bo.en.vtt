Alright folks in this series, we are drawing
magical objects and in this clip I'm going

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.780
to teach you how to draw different types of
magical rings. So let's come up here in this

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.289
corner and we'll start up here. Now obviously
in theory rings are quite simple. You can

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:20.671
just kind of draw the rough shape of the ring
itself just by drawing a simple circle and

00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.939
maybe kind of coming in and drawing the inside.
Now if you are just drawing the ring by itself,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.460
this would be quite easy. And then you could
draw maybe a little setting for the stone

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.270
and the stone on top like that emanating its
magical power or if you want, you can get

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:46.670
even more ornate. And it is good practice
learning how to draw a circle, draw something

00:00:46.670 --> 00:01:03.190
with a lot of sort of frills and flair, draw
like a ruby shaped thing and that is also

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.440
interesting. Now what I am going to do though
is there is obviously lots of choices you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.940
can do when it comes to drawing rings. I am
going to teach you how to draw a ring similar

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:22.000
to one found on a popular movie which shall
remain nameless for copy write purposes, just

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.750
kidding. But first, to draw the texture and
shape of a ring, we are going to learn how

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.423
to draw a little bit of perspective here.
So this would be the start and that would

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.950
be the outer edge of the ring and now here
we are going to come in and draw the inner

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.479
edge, keeping in mind the rough shape. As
you can see that is going to be the inner

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.953
part and the outer part of the ring. Now we
can come in here and draw a little bit of

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:55.909
shadow to it too and if you have the ability
you can come in and shadow these parts. Like

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:06.659
take a pen that is a little bit thicker and
come in here and color in that part. And this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.200
is just a rough shadowing technique. Obviously
there are a lot more detailed ways to go about

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.249
this but this might work if you are just trying
to kind of draw a harsh black and white type

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:28.489
of drawing. So you can see the rough shape
begin to sort of take place. And if you had

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.090
a more detailed way of adding shadow you could
maybe come in here and kind of like work your

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.790
way out of the dark and gradually just to
create sort of that sort of a thing. And then

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:52.620
if you want to you can obviously add the inscription
on it, like I am not a professor of elvish

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.260
or anything magical like symbiology but you
know, I remember that the famous ring that

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.689
this picture is referring to obviously had
some sort of a magic engraving on it which

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.540
had a very famous message. So if you wanted
to take the time and go in there and like

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.279
kind of burn a sort of a flaming message into
the ring that would be kind of interesting

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:30.900
too. The ring of power, add sort of a magic
flame around it. You can kind of keep going

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.340
with the inscription on the inside if you
want to. And obviously if you want you can

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.780
come in and make, if you really want to draw
something very detailed, you could come in

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.299
here and like make this magic ring much bigger
and really show like a lot of detailing in

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.699
the lettering and all that stuff. But that
is just basically to give you a rough idea

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.840
of how you might want to go about drawing
a magic ring, different types of magic rings.
