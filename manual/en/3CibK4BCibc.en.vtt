Hi, I’m Chris Tavano for Tundra Restaurant
Supply.

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.280
In today’s episode I’m going to show you
how to change your blade assembly for your

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:15.480
Nemco Tomato Slicer.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000
First you’re going to need a crescent wrench

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.490
To loosen up the nuts on the side of your
blade assembly.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.189
Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:32.950
Then once you’ve got those bolts out the
blade assembly won’t come out quite yet.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.649
You’re going to loosen up the wing nuts
on the side of the cutting board

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.730
So we can get our pusher block assembly off.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.230
From there your entire block assembly should
slide out.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.230
Now be careful.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.680
The sharp parts of the blade are facing the
inside of towards the pusher block itself.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.120
We want to take that one out.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.920
Get your new blade assembly.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.120
One thing to keep in mind is the distance
of the holes from the base of the hinge assembly

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.149
itself.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.210
The smaller distance should be going on the
bottom.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.970
Again, remember just look closely and you
can see the beveled edge of your actual blade.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.159
That’s going to be facing away from you
towards the Brand name.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.520
It slides right in.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.610
We’re going to grab your pusher block again
and notice that there are grooves

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.670
And that’s going to slide right in to the
groove of the cutting board.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.850
Gently slide it into place.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.120
Once you’ve got it in all the way we can
go ahead and get our bolts right back in the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120
side.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.350
Here you can see as I’m screwing in through
the unit itself

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.520
The bolt is actually securing itself into
the blade assembly.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.570
For this stage you need to get them finger
tight.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.119
Then you can get your crescent wrench and
be sure we screw righty-tighty.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.390
The last piece you’re going to need

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.899
Is your end cap for the cutting board to go
back in place

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.450
So your pusher block doesn’t come off.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.450
It’s pretty easy.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.850
It only goes in one way.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.190
That’s how you replace your blade assembly
for a Nemco Easy Tomato Slicer.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.490
Watch your fingers!

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.640
