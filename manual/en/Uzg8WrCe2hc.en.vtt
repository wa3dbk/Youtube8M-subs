Hello, YouTube. I'm Scott from Scotthermanfitness.com and today

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.450
We're going to talk about a good chest workout to do at home involving different variations of push-ups now

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.349
The push-up is a great functional exercise for two reasons one

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.899
It's very convenient and two it's great for total body coverage

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.260
Now the push-up the standard push-up works deltoids your pecs and your triceps

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.500
What I'm going to do is show you different variations of a push-up

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.480
So you can then do them at home and get a great chest workout the first pushup

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.750
I'm going to show you is the standard push-up the standard push-up

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.419
Involves you going on the ground keeping your feet together keeping your body very straight

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.309
You're spine neutral, and then you're going to also put your hands about shoulder length apart

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Check out this demonstration

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.690
The second variation of push-up that you can do at home is going to be a diamond pushup now a diamond pushup is

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.169
Everything is the same your legs are straight your body straight

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.030
you have a neutral spine, but now you're going to put your hands on the floor like this and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.140
when you come down

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
You're going to come down to right about here

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.709
when you come down to the floor and then push back up

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.160
here's a demonstration

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.039
The third variation of push-up that you're going to do is

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.130
Going to be wide stance pushup which basically means you're going to put your hands about shoulder length apart and then

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.860
Take them out about five or six inches

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.339
and once you have that done keep everything the same keep your back straight your feet together neutral spine and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.070
Then proceed to go down without touching your chin to the floor

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.619
Now the fourth variation of push ups that you can do is you can keep your body the same keep your feet together

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.340
Keep your back straight

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.590
But now what you're going to do

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.550
is you're going to take your hands and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.630
Usually you'd start about here or the around underneath your shoulders

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.348
Now you're going to bring them down like this and by keeping your arms down like this

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.759
It's going to cause you to use a little more tricep as you push it hit different parts of your chest, so give that a shot watch demonstration

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.360
Okay, great. Now there's even more variations of push-up

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.959
what you can do now is you can do elevated push-ups

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.159
And what you can do with this is find the surface in the house

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.119
Sometimes easiest to use a table your bed or chair

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.170
And what you're going to do is you're going to put your feet up on the chair

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.598
You're going to keep your body the same you put your hands on the ground and now you're going to perform the same

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.170
Exercises that you did on the floor, but now your feet elevated

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.020
now

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.479
You might say well those are exercises to do. Well. There's one more way you can do it as well

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.030
You can also do them with your upper body

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.929
elevated in the air which you can do the same thing on a table on a surface on counter or on a chair and then

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.359
Perform the same exercises here's an example of the regular pushup and how to do it on an elevated surface

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.619
Now as far as how many repetition you should be doing per set

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.390
Some research has shown that high pushup a routine stimulants human growth hormone production which helps with overall strength and size gains

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.989
with that being said you should be doing you know maybe 10 to 15 repetitions per set when you're first starting off and

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.530
Start up doing 3 sets as you get stronger do more push-ups per set now if you find yourself unable

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.580
To do a push up in the regular starting position with your feet straighten your feet together and legs straight

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.450
Keep your feet together, but go on your knees that'll help you build up and so you can do a push-up the regular way

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.960
Now there's another way to do push-ups as well. If you want to make it harder. It's by using these things called push-up bars

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.409
now unfortunately

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.169
I don't have my push-up bars on me because I gave them to my brother George because he wanted to increase his chest size as well

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.799
But luckily for George where we share the same genetics all it takes is a quick photoshop opportunity

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800
And he can look the same way as me

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.309
