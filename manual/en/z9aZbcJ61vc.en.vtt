00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.620
Ok so we’re taking out the seat right now.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.400
Usually there are just four bolts on either
side.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.780
There are the two bolts right there and the
two ones in the back around that little ledge.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.160
Then the whole seat can just come undone.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.780
Just make sure you take off all the wires
and stuff.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.830
Okay so we had to take out the seat belt too.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.760
Basically it was just one of those little
star bolts.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.050
One of these little guys that was just stuck
inside of there.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.670
Then the seat belt just came up and out, just
like that.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.230
And now the wiring is also unclipped, right
here.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.510
So the seat can just come out.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:49.530
So every seat’s going to be a little bit
different.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.010
This one latches on with these little clips.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.199
Just like that one; that one’s stuck.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.440
So this is the pad itself.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.800
It’s got the connectors coming out the back.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.140
So all you need to do it slip it, now that
I have the seat up a little bit, I’m going

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.670
to kind of tuck it up inside of there without
removing too many clips; make it less complicated

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.880
as possible.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.829
And then get it up inside of here.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.640
So the best way I’ve found to do it is to
take off these little…these strips.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.520
Release them all the way and then put them
back down again so they’re not as tight.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.479
That way when you slip it down underneath
the seat they’re a lot easier to pull off.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.039
Cuz you don’t want to pull them off and
then put them in the seat, otherwise it’ll

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.039
get caught.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.369
And then make sure it’s as flat as possible
underneath so the person sitting on it can’t

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.369
tell.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.120
So now we’re just putting the pad in the
upper part of the seat back.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.810
The pad’s in there all straight and everything,
now we just need to pull out the sticky parts.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.869
So for the side of the seat, this is where
the button goes.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:56.350
I’ve take a drill bit, I believe the actual
size is like a 25/32 or 27/32.Then you just

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.049
take the little sensor and slide it inside.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.549
And then once the sensor’s in, just press
it down into place.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.960
Looks like I need to make it just a little
bit bigger and it’ll snap into place and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.039
not come out.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.970
And that’s what it looks like with the button
in place.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.980
So now we’re just cleaning up the wires
underneath.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.959
I put them all down flat so I could still,
if I need to, adjust the seat at all.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.760
And I’ll still be able to slide it back
and forth.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.540
Right now I just have these wires sticking
out just for the grounding power.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.810
So once I attach those I’ll clean those
up as well.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.819
So when we’re connecting the power, you
have to connect it to a wire that is only

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.840
on when the car is on.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.620
So right now I have that wire cut open a little
bit as you can see.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.371
So if I touch it with my tester it’s not
going to turn on unless the car turns on.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.840
So now that the car is on its running electricity.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:08.069
That’s just to make sure that we don’t
have this running and draining the battery

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.120
at the same time.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.930
So this is only going to be on if the car
is on.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.020
So this is going to work with the power I
took the fuse out…with the ground, the little

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.760
round thing on the end wasn’t cutting it
for me, so what I’m going to do is I’m

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.040
going to attach it to this bolt that goes
right down inside of there.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.730
The bolt was connected to the frame so it
should be grounded.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.220
I’m going to do it on this side.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.280
So I’m going to wrap it around the bolt
and then bolt it in really tight.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.780
I’m going to scrape away some of that black
paint as well to give it a better connection.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.770
And then right here, you never want to cut
any of the wires all the way through so I’m

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.120
going to show you how to splice that in without
cutting it.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.760
I made a connection right here cuz I took
apart a section of wire and then stabbed the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.900
other wire through it…this one, and then
wrapped it around.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.900
And that will make it so that the thing itself
will hold once I put the electrical tape around

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900
it.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.620
And it will also never cut any of the wires.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.620
And there we go.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.379
I have the switch right here, the High, Off
and Low.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.439
It’s got the yellow LED and the red LED
to show which one it is.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.810
I got all the wires tucked up underneath zip
tied to the top of the frame of the seat just

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.579
making sure that when I slide the seat back
and forth we never have any problems with

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.740
the wires getting pinched anywhere.
