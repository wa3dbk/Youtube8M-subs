00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.530
Daddy Clay: Hey there and welcome back to
the lounge. This is the show where our panel

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:10.660
discusses controversial parenting topics of
the day. So Brad, what are we talking about

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.660
today?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.269
Daddy Brad: Today we are talking about “Do
you let your child go to the bathroom in the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.580
pool”?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.910
Daddy Owen: My pool or your pool?

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.990
Lady 1 with child 1: With my children I just
prefer not to know.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.010
Lady 2: It’s fine I pee in the pool.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.680
Man 1: I drink that water do people go to
the bathroom in it? Do they pee in the pool?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.050
Daddy Clay: I have worked hard to try and
teach the kids they have to get out of the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.050
pool.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.050
Daddy Owen: Yeah

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.010
Daddy Clay: To go pee – like through the
chain-link fence into the parking lot.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.380
Daddy Owen: Kind of like gays in the military
– it’s don’t ask don’t tell.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.180
Man 1: Kids don’t pee in the pool no way!

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.220
Man 2 with Casey: I try and teach them that
it’s very important not to waste that opportunity,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.860
and to find one of the kids that they don’t
like very much, kind of go over towards them

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.960
and that’s where they should do it.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.230
Daddy Brad: I’ve pee’d in the pool. I’m
a little nervous though – they’ve got

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.960
new technology out there, that you can put
this in your pool. It’s a chemical, and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.560
when they pee it turns blue.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.900
Daddy Owen: Like you never even conceive that
other kids might be peeing in the pool?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.360
Man 1: No, we go to the ocean and the kids
can pee in the ocean right? - Because that’s

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.080
a huge volume and a little bit of pee. No
way in a pool.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.200
Lady 1with child 1: If they are being quiet
there in the corner, I don’t really know

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.200
what they’re doing, nobody knows.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Daddy Owen: Don’t ask don’t tell?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Lady 1 with child 1: Don’t ask don’t tell.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.840
Lady 2: Its so much hassle to have to get
out of the pool while you’re wet.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
Daddy Owen: Yeah

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.790
Lady 2: Drop trousers and go.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.369
Man 2 with Casey: Casey is peeing in the pool
okay or not okay?

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.790
Casey: Not okay.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.830
Man 2: Mothers influence.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.560
Daddy Clay: One time I was in a resort and
I was feeling a little nervous, and one of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.720
my kids just took a big, long rolling poop
right on the steps.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.340
Daddy Owen: Oh no!

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.330
Daddy Clay: And it started rolling towards
the deep end and I didn’t know what to do.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.150
I had to scoop the poop off the step before
any high-class parents saw me, but I just

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.479
pushed it deeper and deeper and it kept rolling
off the steps and rolling towards the deep

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.570
end. And then I was faced with a real problem,
which was – now it was deeper than I could

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.829
reach with the thing, but now I didn’t want
to put my head in the water.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.920
Daddy Owen: So what did you do?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.870
Daddy Clay: Eventually I bit the bullet – I
swam down, I grabbed it with my hand and I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.870
put it on the side of the pool.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.940
Daddy Owen: I wish you wouldn’t have said
bit the bullet. You pee in your own pool not

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.489
like other peoples, not in public pools right?

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.489
Lady 2: Yeah so we’ll just…

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.489
Daddy Owen: Okay

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.489
Daddy Brad: I pee in anybody’s pool.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.782
Lady 1 with child 1: Chlorine’s there for
a reason right? – I assume its there to

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:27.782
protect us; I figure it’ll be fine.

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:33.890
Daddy Clay: If you’re a non-child bearing
person, you should know you should never get

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.900
in a pool where there are lots of children
because they are using that as their toilet.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.750
Daddy Owen: Children’s pee - it’s just
not that big of a deal. This is not someone

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.620
peeing in the alley this is not a stranger….

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410
Daddy Clay: How is pee not pee?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.291
Daddy Owen: Its children’s pee – its kids
pee.

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:54.129
Daddy Brad: If you’re at a party with me
and I’m in the pool – don’t get in the

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.129
pool.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.129
Daddy Owen: That’s sick.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.330
Daddy Clay: This debate will continue to rage
as we talk about the difference between children’s

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.110
pee and adults pee. If you’ve got some thoughts
about whether or not its appropriate to encourage

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.840
your kids to pee in or out of the pool, please
drop us a comment, let us know what you think.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.640
Thanks very much for joining us here in the
lounge.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:28.680
Daddy Owen: It’s ok for kids to pee in the
pool as long as they’re not in the pool

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
at the time.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680
Daddy Brad: You’re not in the pool?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.440
Daddy Owen: No they’re not – like if they
were on the diving board…

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.461
Daddy Clay: Would you set up like an obstacle
course to get over and in?

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:41.290
Daddy Owen: Like rings! It could be like “Make
Daddy Clay go brown oyster hunting again.”
