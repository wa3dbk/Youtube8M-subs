00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.080
Welcome to our Vision Campus!

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.160
Today I would like to show you how digital cameras work.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.330
You will  learn about
the historical background,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.500
the components of a digital camera,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.820
and why digital cameras are important for us.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.220
Digital cameras are all around us, and are
used in a variety of different fields.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.890
You will find them nowadays not just in our
smartphones, but also in surveillance applications,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.220
traffic monitoring, medicine, modern production lines and many other industries.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.220
So how did it all begin?

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.649
The first camera was a pinhole camera, known as the 'camera obscura.'

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.649
It involved nothing more than a black box
with a small hole in it.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:52.780
No lens.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.520
No film.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040
Nothing.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
The camera projected a poor dark image onto the screen.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360
There was no way to record the image permanently.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.680
To actually preserve the image permanently, you needed a person to trace the image.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.400
The invention of analog film provided the
chance to record an image permanently,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.380
albeit using a complicated treatment process and many chemicals.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.000
At some later point, electron tubes were used to record images electronically and to transfer that information.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.180
Actual storage of the images was still handled using purely analog technology, namely as a video signal.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.780
One option for importing those images to a computer and processing them

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.260
would come later by digitizing analog video data using a framegrabber card and a PC.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.600
A few years later during the 70s, for example
the Kodak Company made the initial steps towards

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.810
a proper digital camera.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.660
The image data was recorded and
transmitted digitally , the same processes

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.160
are still used today.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.920
Over the course of time, our 'black box' has
undergone a massive transformation,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.300
not least through the components that are now used.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.560
Instead of the pinhole, we use a lens.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.100
It allows us to keep the object in focus and
prominent at the image level within the camera,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.600
despite working with different focal lengths
and settings.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.040
Yet it should be noted that this works the
same way on an analog camera.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.100
The image sensor is another distinct component.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.840
It is used to convert image information from the lens into a digital image

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.180
without the detour of tracing paper or chemicals.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.520
Standard cameras use a memory card to store
the image digitally.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.120
Digital industrial cameras require what is
known as an interface.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.180
This interface connects the camera to the
PC via a cable and is used to transmit data

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.880
to the computer for further processing or
simply to be stored.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.780
The image sensor, the heart of any digital
camera, is composed of many tiny light-sensitive areas known as pixels.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.630
These pixels are later collated to form the
digital image.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.459
The more light, or photons, strike a pixel,
the brighter that portion of the image becomes.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.730
The lighter brighter the spot, the higher
the digital value produced by the electronics

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.290
within the sensor.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.710
We describe this value as the gray value.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.000
For a digital color image, we need the color
value for each individual pixel in the image.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.490
There are two common ways to calculate this
color value.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.830
Visible light is actually comprised of a mixture
of pure colors, described by their wavelength,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.490
ranging from red to green and blue.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.820
One option is to channel different portions
of the RGB color mixture to different portions

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.220
of the sensor.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.090
The red portion of the light strikes certain
pixels, the green share strikes other pixels,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.770
and the blue portion strikes yet another portion
of the sensor.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.580
At the technical level, this is achieved through
a mesh of tiny filters, known as the color filter array,

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.980
that is placed in front of the
light sensitive cells, namely the sensor's pixels.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:33.160
As the different portions of the light pass
through, each color is channeled to the relevant portion of the sensor.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.680
As such, the individual pixels on the sensor
can record brightness information for a specific color of light.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.020
Those values are run through a complicated
formula that produces three separate matrices of gray values:

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.000
one for red, one for green
and one for blue.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.680
These are then ultimately combined into
a color image.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.100
The other common way to produce color images is separating the colors outside the sensor using optical components.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.000
meaning the entire
sensor is only struck by the red, green or blue light.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.660
The image can be recorded all at once,  then you need 3 sensors

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.100
or in a sequence, using just one sensor and a color filter wheel.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.280
The final result is the same: the technique
ultimately produces one digital color image.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.700
When you take a picture with your digital
camera or your smartphone,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.980
it is not much of an issue if it takes a quarter to half a second for the picture to move into the device's memory.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.560
When it comes to monitoring production processes
moving too fast for the human eye to follow,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.810
however, a quarter second is far too long.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.540
Images need to be created in just a few microseconds.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.620
There are many different applications that
place special requirements on digital industrial cameras:

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.060
factory automation, traffic monitoring
and special medical techniques

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.810
Digital cameras for industry are just one
part of what is known as a 'Vision System.'

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.170
The components of that kind of system will
be the subject of an upcoming video.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.130
Stay tuned!
