00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.139
Building from a foundation of excellence as
the Goodman School of Drama, The Theatre School

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.879
at DePaul University has become a world-renowned
center for the art of seeing ourselves.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.760
Recently named one of the top 25 drama schools internationally,
The Theatre School's conservatory approach

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.150
brings together the full range of specialties
in dynamic creative collaboration.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.720
DePaul faculty, students, staff, and alumni play
key roles in Chicago's vibrant and influential theater scene.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.690
They can be found both on stage and back stage, 
on screen and behind the scenes in film and television,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.800
on stage bills around the globe—
and among nominees and winners

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.970
of Jeff Awards, Emmys, Tonys and Oscars.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.450
But this is not just about the awards, this is
about the work. The work of theatre, where

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.600
art, math, science and the humanities
come together to create magic. As eternal

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.040
as the canon of drama, as exciting and surprising
as what's next. In the heart of a great urban

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.240
university, The Theatre School's work is deepened
by a greater perspective, by a mission that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.729
respects all voices and serves many dreams.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.929
The new home for the Theatre School raises
the bar and raises the profile, elevates aspirations

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.429
and talent, raises capabilities, and intensifies
collaboration. And DePaul will invite the

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.420
world to see the results.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.349
To enter other worlds and times, other cultures
and hearts.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:37.049
This creative environment will bring out the
best from faculty and students. Students chosen

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.409
for their talent and their dedication, not
for their finances.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.899
Ninety percent of students at the Theatre School receive some form of scholarship.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.459
These scholarships enable the most talented students to train at The Theatre School.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:55.899
They come from all states and territories,
and many countries. They come because we support them.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.159
They come because they are good. They
come because they are driven.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.509
They come to hone their talent to a fine point of excellence.
They come to The Theatre School because

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.530
—through acting or directing or writing or
designing— they have something to say.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.390
They come to DePaul because this is how theatre
happens. This is the work.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.030
Disparate backgrounds and talents, blended
with rigor and care, create moments that make

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.210
us laugh and cry...make us stop and think...make
us move...make us talk to each other.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.430
These stories can open a heart, change a mind, change
a life, change the world.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.950
At The Theatre School at DePaul University,
this is important.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.720
Because it's not just a show, it's a celebration of the human spirit.
