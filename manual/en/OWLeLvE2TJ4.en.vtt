GELATIN ZYMOGRAPHY

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.509
Introduction :
Zymography is a simple, sensitive, quantifiable,

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.330
and functional assay for the analysis of enzyme
activity in tissue or in polyacrylamide gel.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.990
There are many variations of the technique.
We will demonstrate here gelatinase activity

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.250
assay by SDS-PAGE taking conditioned medium
from animal cell culture as source of gelatinase

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.140
activity.
Principle:

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.380
In conditioned media of mammalian cells contain
Matrix metalloproteinases -2 and -9 (MMP-2,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.100
-9).They are released from cells in a proteolytically
inactive proform called as zymogen. Because

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.760
the inactive form becomes activated during
the process of denaturation and renaturation

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.890
after gel electrophoresis, the active form
of the enzyme degrade the substrate gelatin

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.070
. After the electrophoretic run, the SDS is
soaked out from the gel (zymogram) by incubation

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.900
in Triton X-100 (a detergent), followed by
incubation in an appropriate buffer for an

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.180
optimized length of time and temperature.
The gelatin hydrolyzed zones are seen as white

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.219
bands against blue background of the gel when
it is stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.400
.
Procedure:

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.070
Assemble the glass plate on a clean surface.
Lay the longer glass plate down first, and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.540
then place
the shorter glass plate on top of it.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.320
Embed them into the casting frame and clamp
them properly. Make sure that the bottom ends

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.150
of
the glass plates are properly aligned.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.350
Place the casting frame onto the casting stand.
Pour some distilled water between the arranged

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.560
glass plates to check the leaking between
the plates.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.200
Remove the water by placing a blotting paper
in between the glass plate as shown.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.230
Place a comb in between the glass plates and
make a mark 1 cm below the comb teeth.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.720
Take a blue capped tube and label it as “Resolving
Gel”.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:32.440
Preparation of Resolving gel [10%]:
a) Gelatin solution made in 1.5M Tris pH8.8

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.970
- 5ml
b) 30% acrylamide-bisacrylamide mix – 3.5

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.030
ml
c) 10% SDS - 0.0825 ml

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:52.459
d) 50% glycerol – 0.0825ml
e) APS [Ammonium persulphate] - 0.100mL/100ul

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.379
f) TEMED - 0.010ml/10ul ,which should be kept
in icebox.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.319
Once the TEMED is added to the mix, Immediately
pour the resolving gel into the glass plate

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.230
upto the mark drawn.
Pour 1ml of water saturated butanol above

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.190
the resolving gel layer . Allow the gel to
polymerize for 20-30 minutes. During this

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:26.739
time prepare the stacking gel.
Composition of Stacking gel [5%]:

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.750
a) Distilled water - 3.4ml
b) 30% acrylamide-bis acrylamide mix – 0.83ml

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.129
c) 1M Tris (pH=6.8) - 0.63ml
d) 10% SDS - 0.05ml

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.290
Add these reagents into a blue capped tube
labeled, “Stacking Gel”.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.420
After the gel has polymerized, Water saturated
n-butanol layer was absorbed by placing a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:59.470
blotting paper in between the glass plates.
) Now add the - 0.05ml of APS [50ul] and 0.005ml

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.909
TEMED [5ul] from the ice box to the blue capped
tube .

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.550
Immediately pour the stacking gel in between
the glass plates till it overflows.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.840
Now Place a comb in the stacking gel sandwich
and allow the gel to polymerize for 10 minutes.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.609
Mean while prepare the samples for loading
into the wells of the gel. Mix the protein

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.919
samples with 4X gel loading dye in the ratio
of 4:1.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:31.889
To Run the Gel:
16) Take out the apparatus from the casting

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.280
frame and clamp it onto the gel apparatus.
Make sure the short plate always faces inside

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.849
and if you have only one plate to run keep
a dummy plate for

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:49.300
balance. Keep the plates in the casette and
then lock it .Now place this casette in the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.089
tank. Fill the inner chamber of the tank with
1X running buffer of pH 8.3. Now remove the

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:00.710
comb carefully without breaking the wells.
Samples can now be loaded onto the gel. . Rinse

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.870
the wells with 1X running buffer using a syringe.
Rinse the loading tip with buffer.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.330
Deliver the 20ul [microlitres] of the protein
sample into the well, carefully by inserting

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.400
the tip to few millimeters from the well bottom
without breaking the wells. Rinse the loading

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.569
tip with the buffer after each loading.
Close the lid of the gel tank and connect

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:32.910
the wires to electrical circuit, Make sure
the connection is proper i.e black lead to

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:40.930
black and red lead to red. Now set the voltage
at 150 V and run for about 1 hour or until

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.449
the dye front runs to the end of the gel.
Now switch off the power supply and disconnect

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.690
the electrical leads. Take out the gel plates
and remove the gel from the plates into a

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:59.349
box. Wash the gel with distilled water.
Pour Triton X 100 into the box containing

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:05.879
gel and keep it for 5minutes in the orbit
shaker. Repeat this step thrice.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:12.550
Discard the Triton X100 solution and add low
salt collagenase buffer into the gel and leave

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.009
overnight on an orbit shaker or minimum for
4-6 hrs.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.400
After overnight incubation, discard the low
salt collagenase buffer and add 12% Tri chloro

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400
acetic acid [TCA] solution into the gel and
keep for 30 minutes in orbital shaker. Discard

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.219
the TCA solution and pour staining solution
into the gel . Keep it for 30 minute incubation

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.090
in orbit shaker.
Destain the gel until the bands are properly

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.599
seen.
The presence of gelatinolytic activity of

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.149
protein samples loaded will be seen as clear
bands against a blue background.
