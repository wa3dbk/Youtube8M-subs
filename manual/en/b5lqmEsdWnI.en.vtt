Hi, name is Manish Paul on behalf of Expert
Village. Today we are going to know how to

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.920
cut onions. Now we are going to see the second
method of chopping onions fine. For that we'll

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:39.820
proceed as the same for the first method,
that is peeling the onion.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:49.120
We'll steep the onion in water for five minutes
so as to remove all the juices of the onion.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:09.729
Place the onion on the cutting board and start
slitting it. Slit it again. You will have

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:25.350
to repeat the process from all four sides.
When you finish slitting the onion, cut it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:39.200
in half. Place the onion flat on the cutting
board and start slicing it. If the onion is

00:01:39.200 --> 00:02:02.819
big, slice it from one side and the remaining
part the next time. You'll find finely chopped

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.869
onion ready for your use.
