00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.400
Hey, have not read this in a long time.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Oh yeah, I remember this – The Palm Pre.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This was an excellent article.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.001
I wonder who wrote it.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.002
I wonder if I’ll ever get a chance to play with it.

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.003
No way! Palm Pre, in Singapore?

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.004
Palm Pre, this is so unreal.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.240
Wow! For those of you who don’t know. This is the Palm Pre.

00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:09.200
And we at Hardwarezone already have it in Singapore. That’s right!

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.200
So we are going to tell you what…

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:16.201
No, forget that. We are going to show you, why the Palm Pre is the Palm Pre.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:20.300
What makes it different from the rest of the smart phones today.

00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:30.300
As you can see, it’s Piano black glossy finish...

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:33.100
and there’s a centre button here.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.300
That’s it, its very clean cut.

00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:40.100
Uses a 3.1inch screen with half VGA resolution.

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.001
And at the back we have the speakerphone.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
And the 3 megapxiel camera with flash.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.300
On the top we have the power button and the 3.5 mm earphone jack.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.200
Of course the Palm Pre is a slider phone with a full QWERTY keyboard.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.300
And that’s it for the aesthetics of the Palm Pre.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
As you can see, we’ve got some applications open right here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.302
This is also to be done for multi-tasking...

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:12.400
and these are called cards, by Palm.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.300
Basically if we want to click on the calendar app for starters.

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:21.300
Just tap on it, and it will display a full display...

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.200
if not we can click on the centre button and it will go back to inbox.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.202
You can even use the centre button to open it up.

00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:38.203
If you want to close it, just swipe it up, like that.

00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:41.200
Let’s say we are using the apps...

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.001
let’s say we are in inbox for Gmail.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.450
What we can do, if we want to go back to launcher...

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:52.400
just hold here and drag up, and we can see the shortcut bar appear.

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.200
So let’s say if we want to go down to the launcher...

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:59.300
just let go and it will just pop up straight away.

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:04.301
Right, so this is the apps page, where all the apps are listed.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:07.500
We can go through and flip through each page, like that.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.401
A few applications we are going to focus on is the Palm App Catalog...

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:16.300
which is like the Apple app store, where we can browse apps...

00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.000
in their categories and purchase it if we want.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.500
We have the YouTube, which we are going to take a closer look at.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.300
Basically we can search through the videos...

00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:26.301
and check out which ones are popular.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.100
For this case, we are going to check out this video, right here.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.000
It’s running through a Wi-Fi network, so it may take a while.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.400
We are going to up the volume, right here.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:51.400
Quite an appropriate video since the F1 is going to take place...

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.400
in September this year.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.350
So that was the example of the YouTube video.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.100
Now we are going to check out photos...

00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:06.500
and see how they look like on screen.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.100
As you can see, the images really look good and really rich in color.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.100
This is thanks to the half VGA screen.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.200
Well if you guys were impressed, just like how I was...

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.400
and you want to rush out to get one.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.200
Hold on all right, you can’t!

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.500
Why? Because this is a CDMA phone...

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.501
and it is running on the Sprint network in America.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.230
There’s going to be a GSM version in Europe, sometime in October.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.100
As for Asia, Palm hasn’t commented on anything.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:49.300
So fingers crossed we are going to get it, but it is highly unlikely.

00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:53.400
Might be next year, it might never even show up at all.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.401
So there you go, this was a ZoneOut video with the Palm Pre.
