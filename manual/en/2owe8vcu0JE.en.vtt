00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.700
Let's talk real briefly about body position
and the differences between playing defense

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.850
and body position whether you're playing man-to-man
or zone defense. With man-to-man obviously

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.220
we're playing our man. Wherever he goes on
the floor, whether he comes down to the post,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.150
whether he goes out to the wing position,
to the top of the key, floats into the lane,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.170
we're sticking with our man, our opponent.
We're staying on him. We're utilizing our

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.780
good defensive skills that we've learned.
Now, when we talk about zone defense, a whole

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.350
different concept. We're not following one
person around on the court; we're actually

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.699
playing a zone, a particular area. That area,
depending on what type of a zone you're playing,

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.440
it could be one-three-one, it could be two-three,
it could be box-and-one, it could be one-three-one.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.750
You're going to be playing a particular zone
and your zone, if you're down here on the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.350
block, let's say, your particular zone is
going to be, really, right here on the block,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.590
half way up here, we're going to come out,
we're going to play the wing and we're going

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.620
to come down and we're going to play the baseline
wing. What you're concentrating on, what you're

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.700
focusing on, you're still using all of your
skills, your side-to-side pushes, your bent

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.050
knees and you're always keeping your hands
up when you're in a zone, whether they're

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.100
up high or spread out wide. When everybody
on your team does that it creates an illusion

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.670
and an effect that number one, you're fresh,
and number two it's harder to get, when they're

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810
looking down there and they see all these
arms up, they're thinking, "Hey, I can't get

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.880
a pass down through there. There's too many
arms and hands." And, it is better for you

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.980
because you're already ready to grab that
ball when it does come down. So, in a zone

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.190
we're playing an area as opposed to playing
a person. A ball comes and our man is out

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.730
here, we'll have our hands up and we can go
almost into a regular man-to-man defense when

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.260
our opponent has the ball and it's just us
right here because we're relying on our other

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.950
people back. Now, if you're guarding a person
out here on the wing, you've got your arms

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.310
up and they happen to dribble up towards the
top of the key or even into a higher position

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.629
up there, well then they're out of your zone
and they cross into your teammate's zone and

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.769
your teammate's responsibility is to pick
them. We'll get into, that's more in advanced

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.129
basketball as far as position and zone defenses
and how we can play them. The key thing is

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.219
that when you're playing a zone, you're using
the same skills that you've already learned,

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:45.370
the position, the arms up, the focus, but
you're playing a specific area. Whether you're

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.380
playing up at the top of the key, down at
the post or in the middle, you're playing

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.040
a specific area as opposed to playing a specific
person.
