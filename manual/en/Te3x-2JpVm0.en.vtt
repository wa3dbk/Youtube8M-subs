00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.140
This is a story about a boy named Georges
who moves to a new apartment in Brooklyn,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.140
New York.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.210
His father is an architect and his mother
is a nurse, but because his father lost his

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.870
job and started his own business, his mother
works long hours.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.570
Georges sees a sign for a spy club in the
apartment building and attends the meeting.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.170
He is introduced to a boy named Safer and
his little sister, Candy, both of whom are

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.170
homeschooled.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.460
Safer is investigating a man in the building
known as Mr. X, a quiet man who dresses in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.449
black and carries large suitcases.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.790
Meanwhile, at school, Georges' class is learning
about taste.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.010
This unit is significant because at the end
of the unit, the class is given a taste test

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.910
in which only certain people, the "freaks,"
will not taste anything.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.230
There is an increased urgency with Mr. X,
so Georges and Safer decide to break into

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.680
Mr. X's apartment.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.730
Georges is the lookout and Safer goes in.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.600
There are several break-in attempts, one in
which Georges intercepts Mr. X in the elevator

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.250
and stalls for time.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.430
However, Georges realizes that Mr. X is not
a bad man.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.049
In fact, Safer made up the entire thing.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.869
When the day of the taste test arrives, Georges
and his friends decide to stick together and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.869
pretend to not taste anything.

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.439
He hopes this will not make anyone feel like
a freak.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.039
In the end, it is revealed that Georges' mother
hasn't been working late, but has been sick

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.639
in the hospital the entire time.

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.659
Georges finally gets over his anxiety to see
her.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.609
This story is unique in that most of what
readers experience and learn is a lie.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.991
Two major plot points - the apprehension of
Mr. X and Georges' relationship with his mother

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.189
- are constructed on lies.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.959
And despite the word "liar" in the title,
this story takes advantage of readers with

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.729
the illusion of certain realities.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.229
Specifically, this story portrays how and
why children lie.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.249
Safer lies about Mr. X out of boredom, yet
Georges lies about his mother because of security

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:51.270
and protection.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.700
In fact, these lies are so powerful that readers
are sucked into these false realities that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999
these children construct.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.210
While this story preaches that sticking together
in awkward social situations is beneficial

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.979
- in essence, if misfits stick together, they
won't be misfits - the story, more importantly,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.700
portrays the different and ever-changing social
groups, or cliques, that exist in middle schools.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.709
Georges struggles with how his childhood best
friend, Jason, is distant from him because

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.300
they are now in different social groups.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.819
And while this story does not end with them
reconciling, at least Georges understands

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.230
that Jason hasn't forgotten about him.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.489
And what helps Georges accept Jason's new
group of friends, his mother's condition,

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.049
and his family's new apartment is the realization
that all of these experiences are smaller

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.500
parts of a much larger picture.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.590
The painting in Georges' living room is constructed
of tiny images, so that viewers can analyze

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.670
the small individual images, but also see
the painting in its entirety and admire the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.769
image as a whole.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.860
This type of perspective allows people to
see that while the little moments in life

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.650
matter, they are all a part of something bigger,
something greater.
