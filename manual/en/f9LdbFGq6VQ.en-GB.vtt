Clara H Nail Art

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:34.970
Leopard Print Bling!
Today I got my nails filled and redone by

00:00:34.970 --> 00:01:00.910
Clara H.
First the old jewels and 3D parts were removed.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:21.600
Poor Bergamot!
The polish was removed too.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:40.969
Cuticles treated too and the old nails buffed
down.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:52.009
Next the bare nail was filled in with acrylic
and shaped into place.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:09.729
They were buffed to a nice smooth finish.
Of course this all came with a side of girly

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.860
chat!
Top coating for protection next.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:33.520
Then it was all about the design.
I picked pastel base.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.829
The pastel colours were painted on as a base.
Cute colours!

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.900
Clara painted the leopard print with pastel
acrylic paint.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000
To make the leopard print style she used light
brown random splotches.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:01.550
The darker brown to outline them.
Of course, that was just the start. Acrylic

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:51.469
bows first.
To make the bows she used two large balls

00:03:51.469 --> 00:04:51.289
of acrylic.
Made dents in the middle and added a small

00:04:51.289 --> 00:05:10.870
bow for the middle tie.
After the bows were complete it was bling

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.650
time!
The large pieces of bling were held on with

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.430
clear acrylic.
After the big pieces, small damantes and pearls

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.770
were added around them.
Lastly a top coat to protect it all.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.770
I love that they are blingy but not too over
the top.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.770
Of course with nails this cute we wanted to
share them!

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.770
