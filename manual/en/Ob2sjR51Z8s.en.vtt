00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:07.600
I'm here to talk about food addiction because
it's real. We have national Institute of health

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.500
data that now shows us that people can be
addicted to certain foods and surprise surprise

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.100
it's the sugary, fatty, salty, food combos or
the hyper palatables... not an apple that is getting

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.600
you hooked and hijacked and hacked in your
reward center of your brain. So I'm here to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.970
tell you that this is one of the greatest
stumbling blocks on the part of men and women

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.190
children and adolescents out there as they're
trying to be able to reach an optimal weight

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.899
and body composition. They have to know the
science and they have to know the solution.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.230
And the solution is detox and recovery. And
when I say detoxing and food you probably look

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.400
at me with a confused look "what you talking
about!? how can I not eat food ??" well it's not

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.700
that way what you have to do is identify your
'Bingeables' you know the ones that leave

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.899
you with the sense of feeling OUT-OF-CONTROL 
and you're off and running on a binge. You

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.929
know they are make a list of them look at
them and say, "okay well can I live without

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:29.300
jellybeans?" of course you can! Usually
it's refined sugar, fatty, salty combos be very

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.500
honest tell your true truth about this. You
have to sit there and say to yourself "look I

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.130
can live without these certain substances...
I have to live without these certain substances

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:52.200
because they're causing me tremendous mental
angst and I'm also metabolically hurting myself!" We

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.429
see what happens in the brain you're impairing
and damaging your executive function location

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.770
of the brain the pre-frontal cortex. You're hijacking
and hacking into your reward center reducing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.110
the number of dopamine receptors was organic
and psycho-biological. You've got to remember this CD have

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:20.700
to take this seriously as serious as a substance
abuse. Research shows that refined sugar is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.720
more addictive than cocaine. I know for a fact
that in the public policy arena we really have

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.230
very very well-intentioned people working
away and striving to be able to make significant

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.020
legislative and policy changes would you eat normally and
healthfully. we can pitch all these science fair

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.700
projects and we can really make significant
 dents in what currently is a real mess out

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.940
there when it comes to nutrition and physical
activity for people. So I believe that the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.900
future could be very very positive if we get
enough of a groundswell in the grassroots

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.000
with people demanding that in schools that
in retail providers, grocery stores

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.200
that we have more and more whole foods produce,
life-giving nutrients not science fair projects

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.030
available. And there's one thing I want to
make certain you get and that is its never

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.280
too late I don't care how old you are. I don't care
what your genetics are from your family it's

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.400
never too late to new science of epigenetic's
meaning that every single lifestyle behavioral

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:51.800
habit you have impacts on how your genes express
themselves to the rest of the body so you

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.500
can actually modify your very destiny! I'll bet
you didn't know that. So it's never too late and you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:07.200
are extremely powerful because every thought
you have, every mouthful, every step alters

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.980
your gene expression and changes your destiny!
