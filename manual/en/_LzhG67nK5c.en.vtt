Hi!

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.309
This is Teri at Artbeads.com and I'm here
to show you how to make this very simple sliding

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.740
knot to make an adjustable bracelet or necklace.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.180
This is a three-foot piece of leather.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.440
We're going to cross the ends...quite a bit.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.130
And then take four to six inches and fold
it back.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.720
So now I have two ends and a loop.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:46.150
Hold the loop with your thumb.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:57.610
And twist it around, and around 
three or four times.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:13.790
Now take the free end, pull it back through,
pulling on it.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.760
There's your knot!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.960
Take the other side, and do the same thing.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.420
Fold it back.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.750
Hold onto the loop.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:46.509
Go around.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.569
And back up through that tube.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:58.520
Grab a hold of it.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.490
Coax those loops into place.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.979
And there you have it!

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.200
Your sliding, adjustable knot!

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.640
Ta-dah.
