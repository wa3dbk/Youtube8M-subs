Hi this is Scott for Expert Village. I wanted
to make sure that we covered the composition

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.290
of the racket. In the old days you used to
just have the wood. That was pretty much your

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:21.369
only selection. Now a days you can have anything
from graphite, fiberglass to a composition

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:30.600
that is a mix of the two. And also the weighting
of the racket. Each racket is weighted differently

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:41.190
from head to handle. Some are more head heavy.
Some are more, have more of the weight centered

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.490
towards the grip. There used to be a way you
could do it with the old rackets. You could

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.420
put your finger basically at the halfway point
and let go of the racket and you could tell

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.170
if it was head heavy or if it was balanced
more towards the center. Now days they have

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.429
light written on the rackets on a lot of them.
But they will show right on the grip or on

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:11.429
the shaft whether or not the racket is more
weighted towards the head or more weighted

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:20.109
towards the handle. I suggest that with especially
with a beginner that going possibly more towards

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.590
the weight towards the handle not so much
head heavy. You can go somewhere in the middle

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.990
maybe a balance racket towards something more
weighted towards the handle because getting

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.630
the handle of the racket out in front of the
ball isn't more important with a beginner.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.819
As you become more proficient with playing
then you can kind of get to point where you

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.600
might want to choose something that has a
little more pop to it which would have the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.590
weight centered a little more towards the
head of the racket. It would give you more

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:07.289
follow through and more power behind your
shot. Like I said you can go to the store

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.879
and you can be able to pick out which one
just according to what they show on the grip

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:12.930
itself.
