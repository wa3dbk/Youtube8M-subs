RICK TOBEY: I'm Rick Tobey, and in this series
we will be learning how to play blues progressions

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:15.770
and a blues song on behalf of Expert Village.
Now, this is the introduction to "Little Red

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:26.610
Rooster."
Now that can be the intro to lots of different

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.100
blues songs. I'm sure you've heard it before,
so it's not only for "Little Red Rooster."

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.880
So when you learn this, you can use it in
a lot of different places. The way you do

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.690
that is you start. You're using mostly your
second and third finger, starting on the fourth

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.360
fret of the G-string and your third finger
on the fourth fret of the E-string. And you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.300
can see that all these three notes go together
well. And you're simply going to slide it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.249
down to here, only when you get to here, you're
going to lift up your third finger...and you're

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:16.749
going to pick it like this.
So you could basically going to be hitting

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:29.659
all three strings.
So that's basically how that intro goes. Then

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.400
you can do a little hammer and pull right
there, then go to the A string with the first

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.770
and the second finger on the A-string, first
and second fret. And from here, you can simply

00:01:44.770 --> 00:02:02.179
go into your Bchord. So, putting it all together,
it goes like this...and you'll notice when

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.460
I did that...and we'll go into that more in
the next section.
