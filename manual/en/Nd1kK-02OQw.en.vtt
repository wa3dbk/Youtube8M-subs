Hello everyone, this is meteorologist Dave

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.450
Snider at the TV Desk at the Anchorage Alaska
National Weather Service Forecast office.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.800
[wrn over Alaska]
We're monitoring a shift in the weather pattern

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.780
that's headed for Alaska that will bring significant
impacts to many parts of our state and we

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.850
wanted to share what we're seeing with you...
so that you're better prepared.... It's part

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.679
of our mission to support Alaska in a Weather
Ready Nation.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.230
[normal jet]
First, let's look at what we consider to be

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.810
a normal October jet stream pattern over Alaska.
You'll recall that the jet stream is the fast-moving

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.460
river of air at about 30-thousand feet that
guides the major weather patterns around the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.460
planet.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.489
In a normal October, the jet is blowing more
from West to East over the Bering and Arctic.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.840
But we still have a connection to the sub-tropics.
This allows remnants of West Pacific typhoons...

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.410
along with substantial moisture ... to move
North and into Southwest, Southcentral and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.559
Southeast Alaska. Notice how the jet is directed
into Southeast Alaska? For many along the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.300
Gulf coast of Alaska... especially Southeast,
it's the wettest time of year.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.171
[oct 2013 jet]
As we look at next week, meteorologists see

00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:06.420
a pattern that looks more like this: a sharply
defined trough... or dip... in the jet stream

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.259
that changes the track of significant fall
storms. This pattern still taps the subtropical

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.270
moisture and storm energy from remnant typhoons...
but the impacts will bring much warmer and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.570
wetter weather far into the Interior and West
Coast of Alaska, while keeping active weather

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.790
over Southcentral Alaska... and slowing down
the barrage of rain for Southeast. This is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340
very different.
[Temps]

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.340
Here's what we expect to happen with temperatures:
Temperatures will be unseasonably warm for

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.649
all parts of Alaska. For places like Anchorage
and especially Fairbanks, that could mean

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.090
temps running more than 10ยบ warmer both at
night and by day. In Nome and Bethel, temps

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.189
could run 5 to 10ยบ above normal. In Barrow,
temperatures could hover close to freezing

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.460
or above. Southeast could see temps 5ยบ above
normal thanks to decreased precipitation.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.630
[avg temps vs sun vs temps]
While the weather pattern is a major factor

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.950
in producing the unusual heat, another consideration
is that October temperatures trends are directly

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.340
tied to the rapidly decreasing length of daylight
hours in Alaska. Average temperatures usually

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.930
fall off quickly in most areas this time of
year... that won't be the case next week.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.489
[Precip]
Here's the precipitation outlook:

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.769
As I said, Southeast is expected to be somewhat
drier than normal... which is saying a lot

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.940
during the wettest part of the season. With
the subtropical moisture plume directed away

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.970
from the Panhandle, it may not be completely
dry, but you should notice the difference.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.420
In Southcentral, places like the Kodiak, the
Kenai Peninsula , Prince William Sound , the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.650
Mat Su Valley and Anchorage could pick up
that rainfall. Locally heavy precipitation

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.470
may be possible in all of these areas. Along
the West coast, frequent heavy rain storms

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.600
could bring 1 to 3 inches of rain to many
places, up to 4 inches could be possible in

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.370
isolated cases. The mild temperatures are
likely to preclude significant low elevation

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.830
snowfall for at least the next week... although
small accumulations are possible on the back

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.920
side of each storm... especially North of
Kotzebue.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.330
Besides the warmth and rain... or less rain...
what could it mean?

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.069
[impacts]
Many places usually see their first snowfall...

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.860
or accumulating snow by mid October. This
weather pattern could delay any snow by more

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.020
than a week. River and stream levels will
remain elevated. And with saturated soils

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.269
and increased threats for high winds in the
Alaska Range and Southcentral, tree and power

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.510
line damage could be possible.

Remember, this is a broad look at a developing
weather pattern 6 to 10 days in advance. This

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.750
information is not meant to be specific...
you should continue to monitor information

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.739
from the National Weather Service offices
in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau in the

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.989
coming days for watches, warnings and advisories.
You can do that by going to weather.gov, using

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.470
your NOAA weather radio... or tuning into
the Alaska Weather show or your favorite local

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.340
tv and radio stations.
