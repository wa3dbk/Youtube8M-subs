Like Kev mentioned, I'm from Brazil originally,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.109
and I'll do all these interviews back home where entrepreneurship

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.309
is still like a building process and it's not as much

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.519
in the culture as it is here in the Valley.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.449
And they always ask me, "When did you have your idea?"

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.299
"What a great idea you guys have! What struck you guys?"

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.049
There was no one moment where we were like,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.499
'Oh, yeah, photos with filters!'

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.159
Ideas really are the result of a lot of these iteration

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.789
steps that we've talked about earlier,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.279
and your job is just to explore the solution space until

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.569
you figure out where in that solution space you fit.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.919
And it turns out people are always,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.974
'Well, does my idea need to be the most unique thing in the world?'

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.889
Nowadays, especially in the social space,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.939
ideas are combinatorial. That childhood exercise where you take different

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.869
parts of the animals and you make a new animal out of it?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.219
That's a lot of what startups are like.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.469
You're saying like, well,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.199
there's things about Twitter we really like,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.309
but it frustrates us that we don't have an emotional connection

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.149
with the content that we're receiving because it's not visual.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.799
And there's things we like about things like Hipstamatic

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.989
with these cool ways of making your photos look better,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.159
but the photos get caught on the phone and you don't

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.109
really get to connect with your friends through them.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.529
So these combinatorial ideas are really

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.448
where you end up having these 'Aha!' moments

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.289
later after you've explored the solution space

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.029
rather than the shower idea that ends up killing them.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.399
And as we've mentioned before, in the sharing and discussing process

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.079
is where those ideas get refined.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.509
So getting that consumer validation, going through those bar exams...

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.279
we call them 'bar exams'.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.909
Like you're in the bar,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.829
can you explain your idea and show it off to your friend

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.319
in a way that they're not going to be like...

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.439
Well, it's really loud and people are drinking and...

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.684
They have the other 50 things they want to do.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.899
And one thing I really want to emphasize is that

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.339
careers are very much like a series of themes that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.639
you go through and explore in your career.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.039
If you look at Dennis Crowley at Foursquare,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.889
he's been working on that drive,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.609
on that idea around location and unlocking your city,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.269
for almost 10 years or more. He's probably been thinking about it...

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.439
maybe sketching it as a kindergarten, I don't know.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.769
And we've made photo... just like kindergarten, right?

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.709
We've been excited about photography and about

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.764
communicating the real world for years.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.429
And probably whatever we do for the next 30 years,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.899
we'll have some hint of that forever.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.659
So very much so, your startup and your career is an expression

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.579
of you and your co-founders in a way that expresses what are

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.529
the themes that are going to recur throughout your careers.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.349
And you'll know when you hit upon that for yourself because you'll

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.749
wake up every morning and you can't think of anything else.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.889
You're in the shower and you're like,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.269
'Oh, we can do this different thing!'

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.299
And that's when you know you've hit the great idea.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.709
It's not necessarily the idea. It's the theme. It's the drive.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.869
It's the problem you want to solve out in the real world.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.310
What question are you answering?
