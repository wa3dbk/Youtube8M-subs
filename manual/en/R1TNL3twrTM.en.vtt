Good Morning.

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.003
My name is John Smeaton

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.766

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:10.336
We want to welcome the families and 
our new students of the class of 2014 to Lehigh.

It's a beautiful day here.

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:13.754
We've got students to help you move in.

00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:15.965
We're all excited and it's going to be a great academic year.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:18.877
Good Morning. Hey! Hey! Good Morning.

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:19.833
Lehigh!

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.234

For the parking garage you're going to 
go down to the stop sign and make a right, okay?

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:42.732
You're welcome.

Hi, I'm Kiana Daniel,

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.250
the Resident Site Coordinator of M&amp;M and Trembley Park.

I'm one of the Gryphons in M&amp;M,
the first year residence hall.

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:06.484
We're super excited to start the 2010-2011 academic year.

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:09.684
As you can see in the background,
 we have a ton of freshmen moving in.

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:17.450
This class is looking to be one of the greatest classes at Lehigh
 and 2010-2011 is looking to be a great year as well.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.856
So, go Lehigh!

Hi, my name is Kathy Yuengling.

I'm from Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.483
I'm excited to be here and meet some new people.

I'm from South Orange, New Jersey.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:14.600
At Lehigh I'm in the IBE program 
and my major is Information Systems Engineering.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.478
And, I'm a Gryphon in M&amp;M first floor.

00:02:18.478 --> 00:02:20.735
A Gryphon is basically just a resident adviser

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:26.934
but it's better because we kind of mentor students
 and plan all of our programs and all of that.

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:28.957
So, yay Lehigh!

 to talk to people about University Choir and Choral Union;

basically choral arts at Lehigh.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:51.820
We're trying to get freshmen to audition so that either if they join
 university choir they can go on a retreat with us for this weekend

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.472
or just get involved with singing at Lehigh.
