52.4 million woman watch the Super Bowl, does
that surprise you guys at all?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.719
Yes!

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:14.940
That surprises me.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.160
Is it surprising to you guys that 47% are
woman who watch the Super Bowl?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.240
Yeah

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.580
I would think it would be more man.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.439
The Super Bowl has become kind of like a family
event I think their are a lot of woman present,

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.559
even in the room.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.270
We do know a lot of woman that watch it, I
think we just don't think about it because

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.570
ads aren't targeted towards woman.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690
Then let's go right into one of the ads.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.780
Ok

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.280
"I love going all natural, 100% all natural
juicy grass fed beef" 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.380
"Introducing the all natural burger only at Carl's Jr"

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.520
It would be one thing if they did going au-naturel
and it was a normal looking person.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.710
I was just like shocked the entire time, it
was super objectifying.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.010
They showed fruit in the shape of boobs and
butts, emphasizing like we didn't already

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.450
know what your were suggesting.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.670
It's 2015 are you're seriously still doing
this kind of stuff.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.860
"Each month millions of gigs of unused data
are taken back by wireless companies. 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.870
Data you paid for that can be used to see my makeup,
my backhand, my outfits, my vacations, 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.280
and my outfits, help save the data"

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.940
Why would you do this ad? It makes her look so
bad and shallow.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.590
I feel like a lot of older people don't really
care or know who she is so I feel like it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.030
targeted towards our generation.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.920
Because we use Instagram, all that, it''s
supposed to be relatable.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120
Yeah it doesn't really make me want to buy
it.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.480
"911 operator, 911 where's the emergency?"

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.340
"I would like to order a pizza delivery"

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.780
"You know you've called 911, this is an emergency
line"

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.380
"You know how long it will be"

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.320
"Do you have an emergency or not?"

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.620
"Yes"

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
"And you're unable to talk because..."

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.060
"Right, right..."

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.740
"It looks like I have an officer about a mile from your location" "Can you stay on the phone
with me?"

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.640
"No, see you soon, thank you"

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.460
That's so scary.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.489
The way that they filmed it they just made
it seem so real. So that's why you get this

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.370
feeling, this gut feeling, terror kind of...

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.180
The NFL could do a better job of viewing their
players as normal people rather then, they're

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.209
kind of glorified in a way.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.329
Even though this message is super powerful
and really devastating I think that if they

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.729
actually wanted to do something they would
have to, you know, fire these men that have

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.980
abused their wives, as anyone probably would
be in a normal work place.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.680
"Show me what it looks like to run like a
girl"

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.880
"Show me what it looks like to fight like
a girl"

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.720
"Now throw like a girl"

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.059
"My name is Dakota and I'm 10 years old"

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.420
"Show me what it looks like to run like a
girl"

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.699
"What does it mean to you when I say run like
a girl?"

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.639
"It means run fast as you can"

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.199
It did have an emotional effect on me.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.329
It was very informative.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.169
Saying that you do blank like a girl it's
not a nice thing to say it shouldn't be said,

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:38.989
it's sexist.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.870
I feel like it this kind of ad that gets people
thinking and I feel like you don't see many

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.930
ads like this.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.189
And because so many families watch it, so
that even young kids can be educated by like

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.730
the difference.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.730
I mean there're going to be ads no matter
what, and I feel like it's better to fill

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.490
that time up with positive messages.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.680
"Daddy"

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.780
"Dad"

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.040
"Dad"

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.320
"Daddy"

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.500
"Dad"

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.079
like the messages that the brand has.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.360
It shows that men can have a hands on relationship
with their child and it's ok and it make them

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.760
stronger.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:34.920
I mean I love how it was, like how what make
a man a man isn't his motorcycle and his football,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.470
it's like being caring.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.520
I don't know I think it even furthers my like
admiration for 'Dove' because like it's not

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.830
just about feminism.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.180
I was surprised by the amount of positive
ads overwhelming the amount of bad ads.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.030
I think their's a lot more stories this year
that send positive messages, but you know

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.640
we're only seeing a small fraction.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.200
I think some of the positive messages though
weren't about woman as much, as just like,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.360
I think they'r trying to have you get a reaction
or a feeling as they weren't usually.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.170
As a consumer you have a choice whether or
not you want to buy something. It makes you

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.710
like think about that choice, put it in perspective
and say am I going to give my money to this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.270
company, and a company that just like promoting
a message that I don't agree with in any way

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.430
I don't want to give them my money at all.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.180
Yeah I think it's a good, I mean since now
we know how many woman watch the Super Bowl

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.700
I think it's important to have different types
of ads.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.270
I like to represent the woman.
