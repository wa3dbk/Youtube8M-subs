00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.150
in this video i'm going to apply glitter tips

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.369
Always pick the right size of tips before glueing them on.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.189
They should fit perfectly from sidewall to sidewall

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.550
after putting a small amount of glue in
the well, press it firmly onto the nail

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.699
and hold it there for a couple of seconds

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.699
don't forget to press down the corners as well

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.880
With tipcutters, cut the tip to the desired length

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.730
Apply primer and coat the entire nail with clear gel

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.430
Then build the nail to give it strength

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.009
go around the cuticle and let it cure for 3 minutes

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.009
After removing the tacky layer, reshape the sidewalls and free edge.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.599
for a little extra, apply some black acrylic paint

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.709
Finish off with topcoat and cuticle oil

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.209
