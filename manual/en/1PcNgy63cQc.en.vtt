00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.760
How to Cha-Cha.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.000
Even if you've got two left feet, you'll look
like a dance champ when you master this simple,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.500
sassy take on salsa.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.570
You will need A dance partner Patience and
the ability to laugh at yourself.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.570
Step 1.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.180
Label yourselves Partner A and Partner B.
A should face B with his left arm up at a

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.750
45-degree angle, and his right hand in the
middle of B's back.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.080
B should face A with her right arm held up
against A's left, and her left hand resting

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.810
on A's right arm.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.230
Traditionally, A's steps are performed by
a man, and B's steps are performed by a woman.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
Step 2.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.360
The cha-cha has its own rhythm.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.390
Before putting your moves into action, you
must learn the beat.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.309
The count is 1, 2, 3, cha-cha, 1, 2, 3, cha-cha.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.280
This can also be counted as 1, 2, 3, 4-and,
1, 2, 3, 4-and.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Step 3.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.269
A and B's steps will always mirror each other,
so if you get lost, watch what your partner

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.940
is doing and pretend you're looking at your
reflection.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.940
Step 4.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.380
On the "1" count, A's right foot and B's left
foot step to the side.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.380
Step 5.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.299
On the "2" count, A rock-steps forward with
the left foot, and B rock-steps back with

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.479
the right foot.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.840
To do a rock-step, simply step and shift your
weight onto that foot.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.729
Then, without moving your foot, shift your
weight back to your original foot.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:22.960
Step 6.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.000
On the "3" count, A shifts his weight to the
right foot, and B shifts her weight to the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
left foot.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.039
Step 7.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.070
On the "4 and 1" count, A steps to the side
and executes a quick left-right-left change

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.070
of feet.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.460
B steps to the side and executes a quick right-left-right
change of feet.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.070
"Four and 1" can be counted as "cha-cha-1."

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
Step 8.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.319
On the next "2" count, A rock-steps backward
with the right foot, and B rock-steps forward

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.539
with the left foot.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.719
Step 9.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.899
On the "3" count, A shifts his weight to the
left foot, and B shifts her weight to the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:54.899
right foot.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:55.969
Step 10.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.479
On the "4 and 1" count, A steps to the side
and executes a quick right-left-right change

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.479
of feet.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.249
B steps to the side and executes a quick left-right-left
change of feet.

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:06.249
Step 11.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.729
Once you've practiced this sequence to the
music and you feel a little more comfortable,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.729
have fun with it.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.450
Add a little extra hip action, and throw in
some sass.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.870
Did you know The cha-cha, which became wildly
popular in the 1950s, is a slowed-down cousin

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.510
of the mambo.
