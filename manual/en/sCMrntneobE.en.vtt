00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.990
As you may have already noticed, we're doing
things a little differently this year.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.920
Seeing as Dave is contributing just as much
to the year's reviews, we've decided to split

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.211
the Top 10 in to two personal Top 5's.

00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:23.060
I know, it's unorthodox, but as always there's
no order and we'll have plenty of runners

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.550
up in a follow-up video to sate your thirst.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.300
For now lets check out AppSpy Andrew's 'Top
5 iOS Games for 2012'.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.699
Punch Quest by Rocketcat Games and Madgarden

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.560
There are times when a developer creates a
game that's almost too good.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.659
It sounds crazy, but imagine a title so addictive;
so engaging thanks to its almost manic sense

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.280
of variety, that you have no need to delve
in to the paid-for options.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.100
For a free game, this is near suicide - as
loathe as I am to admit it, In-App Purchases

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.049
can be a good thing, especially if it means
the developers get paid.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.000
Rocketcat Games and Madgarden's monster-punching
auto-runner actually had to be made harder

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.930
in some respects just so people considered
throwing them a buck or two.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.690
For me, this game has entirely revived the
genre and I look forward to seeing the clones

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.920
that attempt to cash in on its fame.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.030
Beat Sneak Bandit by Simogo

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.820
Simogo's games just ooze class - from the
lusciously rendered worlds filled with intuitively

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.480
designed elements, to the painstakingly crafted
audio; almost no detail is left unpolished.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.600
Part rhythm game, part puzzle-platformer,
Beat Sneak Bandit takes a logic step forward

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.960
for the genres by combining them.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.409
The latter was always a matter of timing,
so it seems only natural to add a rhythm element

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.280
where the player must time their movements
precisely or suffer the consequences.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.350
If you haven't played a Simogo game yet, this
is the one to try.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.360
Magic 2013 by Wizards of the Coast

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.360
Ever since the iPad was released, I maintained
a belief that it was only a matter of time

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.370
before board games started to see a resurgence.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.450
In many ways this has become true, but the
surprise addition of Wizards of the Coast's

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.030
Magic The Gathering on the iPad was a secret
wish made manifest.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.410
After already having spent a lot of time perfecting
the series on PCs, the iPad version is almost

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.000
the penultimate release, making the pocket-sized
game perfectly portable; playable with friends

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.730
wherever you are; and easy to pick up and
play.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.100
Bastion by Supergiant Games

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.680
Speaking of iPad conversions, Bastion is a
shining example of how to bring a game to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.260
another platform - notably it feels as though
it were always meant to be on iOS devices,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.870
and that's no easy thing considering it already
saw releases on most major consoles and PC

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.160
platforms.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.760
Small tweaks to the game along with dead-simple
to pick up controls ensures this beloved brawler

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.069
holds its own.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.150
A great pick up no matter what platform you
choose to play it on.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.970
And my Pick of the Year - Waking Mars by Tiger
Style

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.030
When Waking Mars was first released I felt
like a broken record as I spent weeks harping

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.800
on about how amazing Tiger Style's latest
title was.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.610
While the initial release had its quirks,
and doesn't hold a candle to the most recent

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.819
updates (notably the addition of full voice
acting), it was no less incredible to play.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.920
Gorgeously simple to pick up and devilishly
clever in its ecosystem-emulating gameplay,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.940
the only disappointment was that things had
to eventually end.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.850
Short though the game may be, it's a rewarding
experience that makes you feel great for solving

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.630
its challenges and surviving its deadly secrets.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.349
For me there's no other game I'd gladly recommend
more from 2012 than Waking Mars.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.320
Dave himself will be voicing his Top 5 - do
be gentle as it has been a while since he

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.840
worked behind a mic!
