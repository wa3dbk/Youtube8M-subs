00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:41.620
-Really?
What kind of UFO are you?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.182
-Not a UFO. I'm a yo-yo.

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:45.728

-What? What?!

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:01.393
-Yo-yo-yo, what's a yo-yo?

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:04.051
-I'm a toy. I do tricks.

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.896
-Yo-yo-yo? You do tricks, yo?

00:01:05.896 --> 00:01:09.845
-It's Yo-yo. There isn't
40 yo's in my name,

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:12.716
and yes, humans use
this string attached to me

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:15.047
to make me do tricks.
-Yo, really, yo?

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:16.590
Can you fetch?
-What?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.225
-Can you roll over, yo-yo-yo-yo?

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:20.585
-No. What?
-Yo! Hey, Yo-yo!

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.228
Shake my hand! Shake my hand!

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:23.583
Wait... I don't have any hands.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.599
[screams]
Where are my hands, yo? Yo!

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.279
-What is wrong with you?

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:30.619
No, I don't do tricks like that.
I'm not a dog.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.647
-Wait-wait-wait-wait.
So, you're not a UFO?

00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:34.510
-No.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.498
-And you're attached to a string
that humans hold?

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:38.563
-Yes.
-And they make you do tricks?

00:01:38.563 --> 00:01:40.148
-Yes.
-Then you're a dog!

00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:41.566

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.936
-Well, stop sucking at fetch,
Yo-yo-yo-yo.

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.809
-It's just Yo-yo,
and I'm not a dog.

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:56.562
I do way cooler tricks.

00:01:56.562 --> 00:01:58.552

crickets chirp]

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:15.843

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:18.301
