00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.070
Alright, the new fad is the slide, alright.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.789
So what we're doing today is I'm going to
show you how to apply your slide to your Ukulele,

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.020
okay?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.541
Forewarned, this is a big heavy slide and
this style of music in all honesty is going

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:38.660
to sound a lot better on a guitar but that
doesn't mean that you can't play with it have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.820
fun with it and experiment with it, and who
knows, maybe you'll find a technique or develop

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.200
something or just be more efficient at it
than I am.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.980
So, for this your going to need your Ukulele,
your open C or your Banjo tuning and a big

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.540
slide, if you don't have this, umm, a glass
bottle works a coffee mug but it gets cumbersome

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.910
if you're trying to play with, you know, worlds
best dad coffee mug.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.689
Alright, so stay tuned, follow me and let's
break it down.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.079
Alright, so the first thing that you need
to do is get back in to that open C tuning

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.780
that we did, okay, the open tunings are going
to work the best with your slide.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.960
So, if you know, if you watched the last video
you know that we have a chord here, and here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.790
One of the most important things with your
slide is to note the position, okay?

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.090
When you play with your fingers, your behined
the fret, but that point of pressure is still

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.649
right on the fret.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.289
So when you play with your slide, the first
thing that you want to do is practice voicing

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.279
your chord, right over that fret.

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:49.990
Okay, so if I'm a little further back you
hear all that dissonance.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.240
Move forward a little bit, and it sounds much
better, okay?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.299
So, that's the first tip.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.229
The second tip I have is these fingers behind
your slide, rest them on your strings.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.999
It kind of helps to get rid of some of the
wobbliness.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.999
Alright?

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.380
It keeps your hands steady and it helps with
the shaking strings.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:25.750
So, if I'm playing, it's important to see
how I slide into the chord.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.670
The first thing I would do is a basic blues
progression.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.480
Your C is your one chord, F is your two, or
4.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.370
G is your 5.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:55.720
So I'd do something like, and than to your
F, back to your C and than your G, to your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.670
F, C. And I would practice that, alright?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.220
That's the basic thing, I'm just kind of not
really worrying about the strum pattern, I'm

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.030
just kind of focusing on the actual slide.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.970
Some other tips, this octave on the twelve.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.450
Gives you some cool options so if you want
to start a song I would say start on the tenth

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.700
and slide into the twelve.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:40.010
Now, this is going to sound better on a tenor,
keep this in mind, we are playing a concert.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.660
The bigger the Ukulele you have the better
this is going to sound, alright.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.319
But you have your octave there.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.870
Another cool trick when your playing this
is you can kind of, slide into that Open G

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.110
and come off it, I'm sorry, slide into that
third fret, which is actually an E sharp major

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.980
and come off it.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.680
Like this.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.740
Alright, that's pretty cool, too, it's really
Muddy Waters, alright, that's really really

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.990
old vintage electric blues, and a lot of guys
have adopted that into.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.500
Muddy Water probably got some of that from
Robert Johnson but see it a lot from Fleetwood

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.949
Mac and Duane Allman and a lot of this guys
have an influence and it all kind of started

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.139
with that Muddy Waters, and that kind of blues
attitude.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.879
It's one of those things that you know it's
in your head, I know you have heard it before,

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.879
okay.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:58.279
Alright, so we have slide up, fourth, fifth
and the octave, right?

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.080
That should be enough to get you started with
playing some slide Ukulele, okay?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:14.470
Alright, until the next time, keep on keeping
on.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.419
That was it, easy alright?

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.849
Painless, kind of fun, interesting, and who
knows?

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.990
Maybe you can, uh, revolutionize the style
of playing, okay?

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.629
Alright, take care, as always, subscribe,
help me help you, if it helped you hit the

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.169
thumbs up, if it didn't watch it again I guess.

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.680
Alright, have a lovely day, stay tuned, take
care and keep on keeping on.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.270
Chao.
