LIZZIE: Hey guys,
Lizzie here, and we're

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.000
back to bringing you some of the
top YouTubers with another "My

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.583
First Upload."

00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:06.020
We've got an awesome lady today.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.300
It's Justine Ezarik
AKA iJustine.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.620
iJustine is hugely popular
with over 3 million subscribers

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.866
across her channels,
from tech shows to blogs.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.240
By partnering with
Verizon, we're

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.280
able to explore the choices
these creators have made,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.160
including their technology
choices that have helped

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.086
them get from their first
videos all the way up

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:22.086
to where they are today.

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:26.260
JUSTINE EZARIK: Hey
YouTube Nation, I'm Justine

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.880
and my YouTube channel is
iJustine, and guess what?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.200
I make YouTube videos.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.100
I started my
channel around 2006.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.750
And I found YouTube
basically because I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.260
was creating video content,
and I was uploading videos

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.002
anywhere that I
could upload videos.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.460
And when I found YouTube, I
was like, this is pretty sweet.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.670
When I was making my
first videos, I mean,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.320
I really didn't know
what I was doing.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.840
I still kind of to
this day don't exactly

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.560
think I know what I'm doing.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.120
Which I think is kind of the
appeal of a lot of my content.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.850
It's just fun.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.430
It's crazy.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.160
It's whatever I kind of feel
like doing at that moment.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.470
This is one of my first
videos that I ever uploaded.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.090
It's my best friend Desiree
throwing an apple at my head.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.430
And I actually used to work
at a chiropractor's office

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.150
doing video editing
and production.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.510
So this was my downtime.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.995
-Don't hit me in the face.

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:07.495
-I won't.

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:08.450
-OK.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.420
All right.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.920
All right.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.086
Seriously, I'm trusting you.

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:12.480
-I won't hit you in the face.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.020
JUSTINE EZARIK:
Oh, here she goes.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.816
Des winding up for the big toss.

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:17.315
-Oh!

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:21.742
(SLOW MOTION) Oh!

00:01:21.742 --> 00:01:23.700
JUSTINE EZARIK: Technology
has changed so much.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.283
I mean, even filming
this apple video,

00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.550
I don't actually remember
what camera I was using.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.980
But obviously you can
tell it's not 16 by 9.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.560
So it doesn't actually fill
up the whole YouTube screen.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.060
I remember the day when they
switched from the 4 by 3 ratio.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.654
Everyone on YouTube
lost their minds.

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:39.070
Right now I'm still making
YouTube videos which has always

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.710
been so much fun,
and I'm also working

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.380
on a book which is really
exciting, because I never

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.140
actually thought that
I'd write a book.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.200
I always joked about it.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.750
And now it's
actually coming true.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.835
So I'm really excited about it.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.710
Obviously, this being
one of my first videos,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.780
I've had to make
a lot of choices

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.430
along the way in
my YouTube career.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.915
And basically how I go about
it is if it's something

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.040
that I like, I know there's
somebody else out there

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.530
that will hopefully enjoy it.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.660
I love technology.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.830
I love video games.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.400
I love just being fun and crazy.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.830
So hopefully everybody else
enjoys that kind of stuff, too.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.830
LIZZIE: Thanks, Justine.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.470
I'm so glad you've moved
on, and you're no longer

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.610
getting fruit
thrown at your head.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.830
And thanks so much to Verizon
for making this possible.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.060
If you have a
YouTuber you want us

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.610
to have a good
old-fashioned gab sesh with,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.790
drop us a link in
the comments with

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.130
the hashtag #myfirstupload.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.046
We have more episodes
coming out twice a week.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.555
So keep coming back
for all the fun stuff.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:27.776
-Wait, throw this at
the back of my head.

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:28.275
-OK.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.920
-Oh, that's going
to hurt really bad,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.170
but it's going to be worth it.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320
Like right here.
