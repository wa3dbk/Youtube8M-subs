Your kids, the Do-Re-Mi song from the Sound
of Music, your kids will know Do-Re-Mi, because

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.480
it's in that song. They will have no reference
for them, like that actually means something,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.580
but they'll be like "oh yeah I've heard of
Do-Re-Mi". "Do, a deer, a female deer, Re..."

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.190
and this will bring on some sort of Julie
Andrews sing-a-long. Which makes all people

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.039
involved happy, but it's a fantastic way.
Thank heavens for that movie because it's

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.250
the first introduction to these words; these
crazy like syllable words that really have

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.370
no meaning if you have no reference for them.
So, we were talking about something before

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.879
and we talked about doing Do and Re, add Mi,
Do-Re-Mi, in all sorts of places. I would

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.020
avoid the black keys at this point, see how
much you can get done without the black keys.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.070
But it's o.k. to put that in too; even though
it may cause problems sort of intuitively

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
for them, they probably won't comment on that
problem. They'll probably just accept it as

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.690
truth. The next place to move is to sing Do
and Re and Mi on the staff. So again you're

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.490
teaching relationships; just like everything,
it's about how things are connected. So, you're

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.110
teaching that if this is Do, this is Re. We've
already taught that on here, that's to make

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.939
sense to them. Now here's the visual representation
of that, if this is Do, this is Re. Same thing

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.979
on here, although I didn't draw the notes
we were working with earlier. If the G is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.829
Do; and the G is on the G line because the
G clef loves G and makes a hug around G, line

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.350
two. Remember all of that? It's o.k. to say
it again, it's o.k. to say it a gazillion

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.060
times, it's o.k. to use the same wording for
it. Because that's what's re-enforcing it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.399
into their head, that's what's putting it
in there locked solid. It's never going to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.320
leave if you use the same words every time
you discuss it that will click. That if this

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.030
is G, if this G is Do, then the A is Re, start
with Mi then. If this is Do, the A is Re,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.660
this is Mi. It should make sense here and
it should make sense here. Then you can use

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.540
your materials; whatever you have, to do simple,
simple melodies with just Do, Re and Mi on

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.802
here and see if they can follow playing it.
This goes back to singing it, you can sing

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:35.730
Do-Re-Mi-Re-Do. Can they play it? You're going
to think, no, but they probably can, your

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.760
kids are smarter than you think they are.
