00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.649
Pomfort presents the new LiveGrade PRO 2.0

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.810
one of the new features is the
LiveGrade PRO Remote iOS app.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.380
Now you're able to control
LiveGrade PRO

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.440
while being away from the computer with
iOS device:

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.770
apply grades from the library, bypass
grades

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.250
show the original signal and apply False Color at a glance.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.449
Additionally, the new ACES grading mode has been added.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.809
Now, ACES compliant workflows will be able to use the advanced color technologies

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.090
offered in LiveGrade PRO 2.0

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.750
Different IDTs and ODTs are included in this
update to give flexibility

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.600
through different camera systems. Once you have the desired look,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.000
simply exchange the CDL values with
other ACES enabled systems

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to streamline the post production process.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.170
The new LiveGrade PRO enables file grading functionalities. Now
it's possible to open JPGs

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.600
TIFFs or frames from MOV files to compare
grades from the library

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.280
directly in your computer monitor, or
using custom thumbnails

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.500
when creating a new grade.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.960
The Device Manager has been also redesigned to improve the management of multiple devices.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.100
Multi-cam or multi-monitor setups will
benefit from the ability to group up to 3 devices

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.000
in each grading slot. This way the same
grade will be appliedin real-time to all the devices

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.600
As you can see, we've also darkened the interface to meet the needs of on-set low-light environments.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.659
However, if it's still too bright,

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.119
just click on the sunglasses to
switch to the low brightness mode.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.770
