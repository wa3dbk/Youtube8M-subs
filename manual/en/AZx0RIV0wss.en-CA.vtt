00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.366
Let's talk about space food. 

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.732
In the early days of space exploration, 

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:12.699
food was mostly squeezed out of tubes and brought up in dehydrated packets. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.766
But today we can have quite a variety of food. 

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:20.599
There's all sorts of things that we normally consume on Earth that we have here in space. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.800
We just need some minor adaptations.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.666
In the case of sandwiches, we had to substitute for bread, so we decided to use tortillas. 

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.966
But why? 

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.666
Mostly it's because bread of course makes crumbs. 

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.499
When you eat them on Earth, the crumbs fall down to the ground. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.666
But here, crumbs are just going to float away. 

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:45.099
On the other hand, the tortillas that we use are heat-treated and specially packaged in an oxygen-free environment 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.766
to prevent mould from growing. 

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.499
They're packed in packages like this. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.433
And thanks to that process, a tortilla like this can be good for 18 months.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.599
So what we're going to do is we're going to open up our tortilla, 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.500
we're going to get our peanut butter, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.833
squirt it onto the tortilla, get our honey, 

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.499
squirt that on there, and we will have a peanut butter and honey sandwich in space. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.333
Open up the tortilla, and voila. 

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.633
A weightless tortilla. 

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.099
OK, we got one tortilla. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.166
Whoa! It got away. 

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.099
Take my peanut butter, open it up. 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.600
Hmm, can't rip it. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.566
Fortunately,we have space scissors. 

00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.699
They're attached by a tether so they don't go floating up. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.200
Take the scissors, cut open the peanut butter pouch. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.633
Peanut butter's open. 

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.299
Squeeze it onto the tortilla - carefully. 

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.932
And now a little honey. 

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.733
Hey, I noticed something cool about the honey. 

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.433
Instead of the bubbles sitting up at the top, 

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.299
because there's no gravity to make them float up, 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.000
the bubble is floating in the middle. 

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:54.299
OK, all closed up, and the envelope of peanut butter and honey's ready to eat. 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.666
Hmm. Not too bad.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.666
Last piece of my sandwich. 

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.032
It's been pretty delicious. 

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.333
But my hands are all sticky. 

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.233
Got to clean up. 

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.766
We don't have a sink, we don't have running water. 

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.432
You've got to watch yourself up some other way: 

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.066
disinfectant wipes. 

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.332
All cleaned up, niceand hygienic on the space station. 

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:22.099
This goes in the trash. Lunch is over. Delicious.
