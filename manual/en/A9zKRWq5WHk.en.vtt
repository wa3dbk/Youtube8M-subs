00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.640
Hi guys!

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.930
This is Eva from Bay Harbour Med Spa.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:14.370
I'm going to answer a question which a lot
of people are uncomfortable asking publicly,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.400
but privately people send me emails and they
ask me questions.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.070
This is actually for male genitalia, for men.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.250
The question was specific.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.540
I received emails, you know I have products
and it's very fashionable and very acceptable

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.980
and very modern in the United States and for
that sake anywhere in the world today, because

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.069
the world copies America in many things, to
lighten your private parts- to lighten the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:54.809
vagina, to lighten around the vagina and around
the anus.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:07.520
Now, here are some questions from male clients
who ask whether you can use the lightening

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.780
treatment to lighten the penal shaft, the
penis.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.950
The answer is categorically no!

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.030
N.O.!

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.360
Is that clear?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.360
NO!

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.270
The lightening treatments cannot be used on
penises and not on vaginas because the skin

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.710
of the penis is the skin- this is the color
it is.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.409
Of course as you get older and you use your
penis more, you will get a different color

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.450
of your penis and your penis might get discolored
and might get darker than when you were a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.299
newborn child which is ok and is normal.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.399
Remember that color is actually a protective
mechanism for the human body.

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:03.270
So, as the penis is something that is being
used and when skins extends-shrinks, extends-shrinks,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.090
by nature it will get darker.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.930
But you cannot make that pink, you cannot
make that white, you cannot change it.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.830
It's just not possible and do understand that
the skin on the shaft of the penis is actually

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.680
very sensitive- the skin is very, very thin.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.700
So it's sensitive, it's thin, it's actually
transparent.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.620
If all you guys out there would look at your
penis when your penis is erect you will see

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.620
that you can see blood vessels.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.860
You would see that you can see transparency
or what's happening under the skin.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.400
So do understand that the skin of the penis
itself is very sensitive and that area cannot

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.019
be changed.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.390
Do not attempt, do not, is that clear?

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.549
Do not attempt to use my lightening products
on the penis shaft.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.439
It is not recommended, it's not meantt to
be, it can hurt you.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:16.549
The only area that a man can use my lightening
products is around your private areas on the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.689
outside.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:24.680
So not even your testicles because you can't
change that color, just like you can't change

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.230
the color of the inside of the vagina.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.390
You can't change the lips of the vagina on
the inside, that is what is.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.540
But you can change the outside.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.860
So if you take your scrotum on the outside
in the bikini, the inside of the legs where

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.849
your leg ends - that part you can lighten
if you have discoloration.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:55.939
There are many men out there, particularly
with darker pigmented skin, who have discoloration

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.329
on that part of the indentation of that area.

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.410
If this is your scrotum, it's the area on
the outside.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.750
So if this is your testicle, it's not the
testicle but the area on the outside of your

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.250
testicle can be lightened if it is discolored.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:24.300
A lot of black men, for instance if they are
heavy, and they rub their thighs against each

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.000
other- a lot of black men or a lot of Hispanic
men and then the skin between the thighs will

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.610
be much darker.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:41.639
So my suggestion would be to lose weight because
as long as you rub it's useless to use my

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.060
products because it will help to lighten but
actually it will make the skin more sensitive

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.500
and if they are still rubbing it can make
it actually worse, so we don't want that.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.020
But if you have discoloration between your
legs and you lost weight and your thighs are

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.740
not rubbing and you want to lighten it, then
absolutely you can get my lightening treatment.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.780
If you are a black person or dark pigmented
person you can the AHA Mandelic Acid lightening

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.110
treatment is perfect for you.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.569
But you cannot and you should not use it on
the sack of your testicles and not on the

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:19.569
penal shaft.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.341
It should not be used because you are not
doing yourself any favors, and you can actually

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:29.360
hurt yourself more than you can lighten it.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:40.389
So it can only be used on the bikini on the
outside of your scrotum and the inside cheeks

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.430
of your butt cheeks.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.100
It cannot be used inside your anus.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.541
Your anus is your anus- it is the color that
it is.

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:52.940
But the outside of the anus, so if this is
the sphincter- this part you cannot change,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.080
but you can change this part on the outside
that you can lighten.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:05.349
So I hope that I clarified this for you out
there that are uncomfortable so you sort of

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.370
asked me in a shy or embarrassed way.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.009
There is nothing about the human body you
have to be embarrassed about, we are all human

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.009
beings.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.979
There is nothing embarrassing or sexual about
this.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.870
This is purely, purely an answer to questions
that you have and I know that a lot of you

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:32.340
will be very, very happy to read the subject
of this video to clarify my lightening treatment

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.810
and no lightening treatment should be used
on the penis, the shaft of the penis, or on

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.470
the sack of the testicles.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:48.150
However, on the outside of the scrotum, bikini,
between your legs, and outside of your sphincter,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.479
outside of your anus, that you can use my
lightening treatment.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.509
I hope I clarified it and until next time,
adios, guys!

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.509
Thank you, bye!

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:57.510
Eva.
