00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:04.116
Florida ...

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.583
known for it's beautiful landscapes and wildlife.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:12.550
But our natural Florida is threatened ...

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.716
by nonnative species.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.233
To bring attention to this threat the FWC partners with local organizations

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.425
to host Nonnative Pet Amnesty Days.

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:30.466
Where Floridians are invited to donate their unwanted nonnative pets

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.933
free of charge with no questions asked.

00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:37.035
And no questions means exactly that.

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:41.635
Unwanted, nonnative pets are excepted without penalty

00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:46.601
so owners who do not have proper permits or licenses for their animals

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:51.318
can surrender them without fear of receiving a citation.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.385
"Southeast United States in general is experiencing a problem

00:00:55.418 --> 00:00:57.735
with nonnative exotics being introduced into the environment.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:59.310
The problem is that people don't know what to do.

00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:00.568
They get theses animals as pets

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.846
thinking they're going to make good companion pets. They don't realize

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.893
they outgrow their welcome. They soon exhibit the fact that you can take

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:08.355
an animal out of the wild but you can't take the wild out of the animal.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.486
In well intentioned acts quite often they release them into the environment

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.186
not realizing that it is against the law, that it is something that is so

00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:15.761
counterproductive for our environment.

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:20.286
So what this event tries to do is give people an outlet to provide ...

00:01:20.678 --> 00:01:23.383
to turn over their animals and provide a good home for them

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:26.270
where they will be protected and properly cared for

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:28.095
and not endanger our environment."

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:32.120
"What we're going to do is ... I'm doing just a brief health exam on him."

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:36.795
All donated pets are examined by a licensed vetrenarian

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:42.271
and every effort is made to place healthy animals with qualified caregivers.

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:46.338
"My mom was listening to the radio and she heard something about exotic pets

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:50.280
so I looked it up on the internet, and I read up on it and I decided

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:55.371
that it sounded like a good thing adopting out pets instead of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370
just giving them to random owners ... people that know what they're doing."

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:03.813
Pet Amnesty Days include educational exhibits and live animal displays.

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:08.530
Experts are on hand to answer questions about exotic pets

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:12.121
and help teach people how to properly care for these animals.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:19.223
At most events, micro-chipping is available for a nominal fee.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.648
Owners can bring their nonnative pets to amnesty day

00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.898
and have them permanently identified.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.706
Micro-chipping is required by law for reptiles of concern

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.190
that are two inches or greater in diameter.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.398
This is part of changing rules on how Florida handles nonnatives.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.768
"Nonnative pet owners generally will release their pets

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:44.333
thinking it's the humane thing to do. In fact most of the pets they release

00:02:44.475 --> 00:02:46.683
don't survive ... so it's just the opposite.

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:50.183
Also it's ecologically unwise and it's against the law."

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.383
The entire event is designed to create awareness

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:57.083
for Florida's nonnative species problems

00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:00.333
and the importance of responsible pet ownership.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:05.508
And working together with communities, partners and volunteers

00:03:05.858 --> 00:03:10.491
the FWC will continue it's efforts to prevent nonnative species

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:12.616
from being released into the wild

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.376
and continue mobilizing people

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:18.810
to do all we can to protect our Florida ...

00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:20.785
... naturally.
