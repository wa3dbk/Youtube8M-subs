00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:28.609
I don’t share Jane’s aptitude for hospitality.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.220
In fact, I don’t believe in hospitality
or kindness.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.680
But while our business philosophies may differ,
we both have very high pheomelanin levels

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.129
in our hair, so...at least there’s that.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.920
We’re only 2 percent of the population!

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.280
And if I gave a damn about numerical review
scores, Jane’s would be a lot higher than

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.280
that.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.710
That’s because Jane’s Hotel 2: Family
Hero is a lot of fun.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.590
It’s one of those games you just keep playing
and playing, even though you’re not entirely

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.590
sure why.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.129
I was, like, really trying to book those rooms.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:21.659
Changing linens, serving mojitos...I was all
about this!

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.729
So you play as Jane, a woman who is trying
to reclaim her family hotel chain or something.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.030
To do that, she’s going to have to buy each
one back, clean them up, freaking book them

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.670
solid...and then pay back the man.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.329
Because the banks are doing so poorly these
days.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.450
Managing the hotel is pretty simple.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.149
Guests come in, they make demands and you
make them happy.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.200
You give them keys to start, and from there,
they might ask for a beverage or a room cleaning.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.719
That means lot of tapping.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.670
You do have a maid and a handyman you can
dispatch, but still, things get pretty hectic.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.189
The whole point is managing your time and
attending to your guests as quickly as possible.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.420
It’s actually really addictive, which makes
it a perfect casual game.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.360
You can jump in, play a few rounds and jump
back out...it’s a perfect time killer.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.940
And part of that addictive quality comes from
the improvement process.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.170
The more money you earn, the more you can
add to your hotels.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.220
In turn, that brings more customers.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.140
It’s kinda like how the warmer climate is
melting the ice caps, which leads to less

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.830
ice surface to reflect the sun away, which
makes it even warmer...uh, it’s like that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.980
cycle.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.890
Only with less catastrophe and more maid service.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:52.600
Jane’s Hotel 2 is another casual-gaming
winner from G5 Entertainment.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.640
It’s a game that’s easy to pick up and
hard to put down, so if you’re interested

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.560
in more business management/simulation games
for your iPad, make a reservation with Jane.
