00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.740
G'day I'm Brett.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.020
Now a common problem with early Defenders
is

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.240
the headlight switch burns out due to the
lack of a relay.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.930
The high currents cause the inside contacts
to melt and you lose your headlights.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.220
So I'm going to fix that by adding in a simple
relay in to my headlight system.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.660
Here's how.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
You'll require the following things:

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.939
Soldiering iron

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.480
Crimping tools

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.820
H4 female connectors

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.290
H4 male connectors

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.070
inline fuse holders

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.930
relays and block

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.400
assorted electrical cables

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.550
heat shrink

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.660
and split tubing.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.660
Start by crimping your battery connector and
then solder into place.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.579
Run your cable from your battery box to determine
the correct length.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.550
Cut as required

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.550
and start crimping and soldering all the connections
for the block.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.070
Insert all connectors until they click in
to place.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.070
This male connector plugs in to your existing
headlight loom and controls the relays.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.640
This plug connects in to your headlights.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Once all connections are completed run split
tubing along all wires to protect them.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.570
I've included 2 fuse holders to protect my
low and high beam circuits.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.720
The left connector plugs in to your headlights
and the right in to your existing loom.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.909
I'll let the results speak for themselves.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.439
This is my original headlight switch showing the
melted contacts.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:35.439
The total cost worked out around 130 Australian
Dollars.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.219
Parts were purchased from Ebay and my local
auto parts supplier.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:47.219
Google headlight relay to find a suitable
wiring diagram to follow.
