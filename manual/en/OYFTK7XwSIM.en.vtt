Hello, I'm Helen Bradley. Welcome to this
video tutorial. In this tutorial I'm

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.309
going to show you how you can easily
make lines thicker or thinner on line art images

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.489
that you either scan into Photoshop or
create in Photoshop yourself.

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.419
In this video tutorial I'm going to show
you a really quick technique for making

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:24.509
lines a lot thinner or a lot thicker.
And this is handy for images where you've

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.899
actually converted it to line art or where you've
got line art like this that we've

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.070
actually scanned in.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.940
To make the lines thicker choose Filter and
then Other

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.850
and then Minimum.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.920
And with Minimum you can then select the
minimum radius which is going to make

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.890
the image lines a lot thicker and you can
test these out. Generally just one or

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.890
two pixels is like all you need to do.
And this is the original image and this

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.740
is the

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.720
thicker lined image. So let's perhaps
take this up to 4

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.360
and I'll click Ok.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.770
And that has just thickened the line. So if
that were all we wanted to do we could just

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.499
save this and be off.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.009
But let's have a look and see how we can
make the lines thinner. I'm going to choose Filter

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.450
and this time, Other,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.630
and this time we're looking at
Maximum.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.470
And we're just going to set the
maximum line width.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.920
And so we want this down to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.930
something that gives us the lines that
we're looking for. So here I have it set to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.150
5. This is what it was. This is what it
is now.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.720
If I go a bit smaller the lines are
going to get thicker. If I get bigger

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.540
the lines are going to get thinner to the
extent where they actually totally

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.560
disappear. So you need to find

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.960
this sweet spot here for your particular
image.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.430
But if you do want to make the lines
that are fairly thick right now to

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.159
be a little bit finer

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.310
then you can do that here with this tool.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.560
And these are again Filter, Other.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.980
Maximum allows you to set

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.550
it so it's smaller and minimum allows
you to set the width so it's larger.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.320
