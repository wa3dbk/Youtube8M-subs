00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.540
Hi, my name is Stacey and today I'm going to give you a few tips on how to treat your feet righ

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.629
after running a big race like a marathon. Treating your feet right after recovery

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.219
is just as important as treating your
feet right

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.130
throughout training. Now I'm sure you've
spent months researching

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.230
the right sneakers, the correct way to train, and what to eat to get your body

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.470
ready for the 26.2 mile feat.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.250
But, how much time have you spent
researching how to take care of your

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.779
body?

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.000
And most importantly your feet after

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.100
a marathon? Not nearly as much time right? Well, you're not alone.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.789
Luckily for you that's what I'm here for.
Here are three tips

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.260
on how to help your feet recover
properly after putting them through a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.110
major race.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.480
Number one, you want to change your shoes
immediately.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.480
Even on the warmest days your body will
begin to feel cool and clammy after a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.170
marathon.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.280
This is because your body is entering
recovery mode. It's a good idea to bring

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.980
warm, soft clothing

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.629
to change into following the race. This
includes footwear.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.530
And no sandals are not a good idea. You want to keep your feet from swelling

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.760
and you want to give your body the
support it needs. Number two

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.760
put your feet up. To help avoid
uncomfortable swelling

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
facilitate your body's blood flow and
take a load off.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.860
Literally, if you're feeling light-headed
ask someone to spot you and just lie

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.460
down.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.070
Keeping your feet propped up slightly. I
recommend you do that for at least 15 to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.040
25 minutes

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.600
the first time around. And definitely
make sure to do a few more times that

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.040
day.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.470
Oh, and you can use this first R&amp;R to eat a protein packed meal to help

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.720
replenish your energy.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.730
Number three, care for damage. After
you've changed, put your feet up and eaten

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.490
something,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.830
take the time to assess your feet for
injuries like blisters, calluses,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.470
muscle strains. All of this needs to be taken care of immediately.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.430
If you let any of these injuries go, they
could cost further greater injury.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.580
Even something as simple as a blister
can cause damage.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.230
Think about it. You'll instinctively want to
avoid the pain of putting pressure on

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.920
the blister,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.220
right? Well in order to do this, you'll force another part of your foot to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.160
overcompensate.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.320
And overcompensation, especially while your
body's in recovery mode

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.260
can cause more injury. So, there you have it...three easy steps on how to help your

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.290
feet recover

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.470
after they've taken on almost twenty-six point two miles.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.850
Remember, treat your feet right and they'll
treat you right.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.260
Thanks for watching, this is Stacy. See
you next time
