00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.070
[Jessi yawns]

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.390
Sorry, guys!

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.380
Do you ever have those days where you just
don’t have the energy to do all that much?

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.270
And when you do move, you move really slowly?

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.330
Well, that’s pretty much what every day
is like for a sloth.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.960
Sloths are the slowest mammals on Earth.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960
Just how slow are they?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.699
Well it can take a sloth up to an entire month
to travel a single mile on the ground.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.400
But that’s OK, because sloths spend most
of their lives in trees, where they can move

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.880
just a little bit faster.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.379
Their powerful arms and curved claws let them
move easily from branch to branch in the rain

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.199
forests of Central and South America, where
they’re from.

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.010
Sloths are identified by the number of these
claws that they have on their front feet.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.800
There are two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.600
But good luck actually spotting a sloth swinging
through the trees -- these guys spend very

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.069
little time moving, and a whole lot of time
sleeping and eating.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.080
Sounds sort of boring, doesn’t it?

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Wrong!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
If you ask me, sloths are super cool.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.460
They’re not lazy -- they’re just really
good at conserving, or saving, their energy.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.163
Their diet of leaves and bark doesn’t provide
them with a whole lot of nutrition, so they

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:19.690
need to save as much energy as they can.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.590
One way sloths manage to conserve their energy
is by keeping their food in their bodies for

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.490
as long as possible.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
Sloths have big stomachs that can hold a large
amount of food.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.240
While it might take you or I just a few hours
to digest our breakfast, it can take a sloth

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.860
30 days to digest a single leaf.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.760
Since they digest their food so slowly, sloths
don’t get a lot of energy very quickly from

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.850
their food, but they also don’t use a lot
of energy to break it down.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.250
Plus, because their stomachs work so slowly,
they don’t need to go to the bathroom as

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.380
often as we do.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.390
In fact, one of the few times that three-toed
sloths come down from the trees is for their

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120
weekly potty break.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120
Once a week!

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
That’s it!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.310
Another weird way sloths conserve energy is
by having a naturally low body temperature.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.130
If our body temperature changes more than
three degrees, it probably means that we’re

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.130
sick.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.690
But that’s not so for the two-toed sloth.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.050
It has the lowest body temperature of any
mammal in the world -- it can dip as low as

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.680
30 degrees Celsius.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.240
Most mammals, including us, have body temperatures
of 36 degrees Celsius or higher.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.170
After all, it takes a lot of energy to keep
your body warm.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.739
So when sloths aren’t active, which is most
of time, their bodies just automatically switch

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.769
into low-energy mode, and their body temperature
drops.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.680
The last weird way that sloths save energy
is my personal favorite.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.569
Three-toed sloths are the only mammal that
can rotate their heads almost all the way

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.540
around their bodies, like owls do.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.209
This is because they have more vertebrae,
or bones in their neck, than other mammals

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.209
do.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.079
This cool trick helps them look for food and
keep an eye out for predators without having

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.150
to go anywhere or do anything.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.900
They can just hang out, and twist their heads
around, observing the world around them.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.329
So sure, sloths are slow -- but not because
they’re lazy.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.749
They’ve just adapted to a nice, mellow,
low-energy lifestyle that works out well for

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:01.749
them.

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.700
They’re basically the ultimate energy-saving
machine!

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.499
Thanks for joining us on SciShow Kids!

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.229
I'm Jessi; this is Squeaks, and we'll see
you next time.
