How to Make the Purple Hooter

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Today on Drinks With Diablo

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hello, welcome once again.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is TheFNDC.com and I am your bartending host,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Jöhnny Dîablø and today we're making

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Purple Hooter.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And this is a shot;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what you're going to need is some Chambord black raspberry liqueur,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
a little bit of vodka,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or as I'm using today, raspberry vodka by Smirnoff;

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and some cranberry juice

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and a little wedge of lime to squeeze in at the end.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
OK, I'm going to make this for two shots today.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you want to make it for one person, cut the recipe in half.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
OK, so...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Two shots for you and your buddy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One ounce of Chambord.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One ounce of vodka or raspberry vodka.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And one ounce of cranberry juice.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Then you squeeze your little wedge of lime in there.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
OK, good to go.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And let's shake that up.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Make it nice and cold.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Okay, that's nice and freezing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
OK

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That's really purple,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a deep rich purple.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There we go, that's good.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's see what the verdict is; how's it taste?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[ sampling Purple Hooter ]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Tastes like raspberries,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it's not too rich.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's got just a hint of crispness.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Crispness at the end, I think that's the lime.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's pretty good.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
OK

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
