00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.580
Today I'm talking with Dr Kat Marhfour, one
of the general dentists at Melbourne's Smile

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.580
Solutions.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.580
Hello Kat.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Hi Christine.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.630
Now, I often see the tower of this beautiful
building lit up at night and I sort of get

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.710
the impression that Smile Solutions is a dental
practice that never sleeps.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.380
It's true Christine, we are open 7 days a
week and we also offer after hours assistance.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
Can you tell me about the services you offer
outside of normal hours?

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.149
On weekdays we start early and finish late.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.100
We are also open on Saturdays and Sundays.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.149
Anyone requiring emergency care has access,
just as our regular patients do, to both our

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.570
registered specialists and general dentists
all working extended hours and our specialists

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.550
available on most weekends.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.010
That's unusual for specialists isn't it?

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.010
It is.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.989
And that is one of the reasons why we are
the emergency dentists of choice for sporting

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.239
clubs, sporting events and for travelling
companies like cirque du soleil.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.390
In fact, we are the official dentist to the
Collingwood Football Club and the Australian

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.100
Open Tennis Tournament as well.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.860
I imagine your central location would help
in that regard.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.970
It does.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.350
And geographical convenience is also one thing
that makes us the emergency dentist of choice

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.740
for many Melbourne hotels.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.710
So what sort of emergencies would you usually
be treating?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.680
Typically we see case of tooth ache, including
nerve pain, broken teeth, pain associated

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.190
with impacted wisdom teeth or even traumatic
jaw injuries.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.480
Regardless of the problem it is important
that the patient is treated promptly and with

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.160
a successful outcome.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.710
Time is especially of the essence if you have
fans waiting or you have a travel itinerary

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
to stick to.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.760
And you couldn't provide such services without
a comprehensive team of clinicians, right?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.760
Exactly.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.390
Under this one roof we have 20 general dentists,
16 registered specialists spanning all fields

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.360
and 10 dental hygienists.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.830
As a team we cover all bases.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.800
For example, one of the most painful dental
ailments is damage or infection of the nerve

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.269
or root of a tooth.

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.680
We have 3 endodontists practicing at Smile
Solutions.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.299
This means our dentists can refer patients
directly to an experienced specialist, rather

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.549
than a junior dentist for prompt root canal
treatment.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.720
Very important when you are in agony.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720
That's right.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.030
And we also have our in house prosthetist
who handles the fabrication and fitting of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.800
all dental appliances.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.349
At the end of the day, anyone needing emergency
or time sensitive treatment can rely on Smile

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.689
Solutions' cohesive team.

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:38.989
That's great to know.
