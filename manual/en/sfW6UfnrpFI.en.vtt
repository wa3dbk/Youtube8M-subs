This is Neily on Nutrition.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.620
I’m here with Charlotte Collins, my intern
from the University of Alabama, explaining

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.300
to her about omega-3s.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.750
Somebody in your family takes (omega-3) supplements?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.029
My aunt.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.449
Her doctor recommended she take them.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.770
Do you know anything about what she takes
or how much she takes?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.850
I think I remember her mentioning that her
doctor recommended she take 1000 mg.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.910
And that’s usually the recommendation they
give.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:49.540
But what the doctor might mean to say is that
they need to take 1000 mg of “EPA” and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.540
“DHA”.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.510
Those are the specific omega-3 fatty acids
in the fish that have been shown to be of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.610
heart health benefit, brain health benefit,
help with our immune function, inflammation.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.949
But you don’t often hear that.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.600
And looking at some products…

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.979
She might look at this bottle and see it contains
1000 mg of fish oil but you told me to specifically

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.859
look for EPA and DHA.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:30.799
I go down and see that in 3 pills there are
750 gm of EPA and DHA.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.169
That’s short of the 1000mg so she will need
to take 4 soft gels.

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:37.169
Exactly.

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.259
So what about another product she may look
at?

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.950
If she kept looking…this product here contains
1290 mg of fish oil which is more than the

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.989
amount her doctor recommended.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:49.989
Which is fine.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.529
So, she might actually choose this one over
that one.

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:57.819
Then, she will look for the EPA and the DHA
on the back.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.561
But this supplement does not differentiate
between how many total milligrams of fish

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:05.729
oil there are and how much actually are the
EPA and DHA.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.630
So, this is probably not her best choice.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
Correct.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.110
If I were buying for myself, I would probably
put that one back on the shelf because I would

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.000
like to know specifically how much of those
omega-3s are DHA and EPA.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.330
If she kept browsing, here is another one.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.550
The serving size is two soft gels.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:34.609
And if I go down, I see EPA and DHA is 1200
mg; this seems like a great one.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.260
Yes.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.030
Two soft gels to get over 1000 mg versus 4
in the other one.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.290
It’s not that it’s a bad one, but you
need to take twice as much every day to get

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.290
the requirement.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.610
Sometimes it’s worth it to look for those
that are more concentrated.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.379
And specifically looking at the EPA and the
DHA.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.560
That makes sense.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.769
And if she wanted to get omega-3s and not
from fish oil alone, how else will she be

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.769
able to get them?

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.769
We can also get omega-3s from plant sources.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.299
If she is eating a lot of fish, especially
the fatty fish like salmon, then she can cut

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.900
back on the supplements.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
Salmon is one of my favorite sources.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:24.969
Our plant sources such as flax seeds and walnuts
are omega-3s but they are different omega-3s.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:33.079
The fish omega-3s are the EPA and the DHA
and the plant omega-3s are ALA.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.519
Different acronyms.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.999
Not that they are bad because they are good.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:44.989
However, to convert to EPA and DHA, the process
is not very efficient at all.

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.310
So, you get very little of the EPA and DHA.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.959
It’s good for us but not as good as directly
from the EPA and the DHA.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.659
A lot of published studies on this and most
of them on the EPA and DHA—it’s really

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:07.749
best to get them from the fish.Love the plant
sources of omega-3s but for the heart health

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:13.810
and the brain health, the inflammation benefits,
the fish oil is better.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.090
Eat the fish!

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.820
So, bottom line, EPA and DHA—look for those
on the labels.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.280
There it is.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.010
Some information for you to take back to your
classmates!

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.510
Thanks for watching Neily on Nutrition and
we’ll see you in the next video.
