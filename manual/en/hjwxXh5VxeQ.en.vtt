00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:14.291
Continue working on your scene. If you need to, you can also use the file uv-unwrapping_garage-roof.max to pick up where the last movie left off.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.254
Make sure the building model is selected and isolated.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.061
You need to unwrap the upper floor and the roof.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:34.571
Start by selecting the front faÃ§ade and the under carriage portion of the extruded part.

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:49.311
Apply an automatic planar map and then adjust the cluster in the UV editor.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.099
Use the Freeform tool as you have learned.

00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:13.039
Switch between poly, Edge or Vertex modes to fit the UV coordinates to the bitmap.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.222
When you're happy with the results, select the cluster and move it to the side by one UV space.

00:01:58.907 --> 00:02:05.755
Next select and treat each wall separately, using X or Y projections as needed.

00:02:06.632 --> 00:02:11.605
Remember that the projections are positive left-to-right and front-to-back.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.590
So make sure you use the mirror tool where needed.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.750
When you're down to the roof, select the center polygon and expand the selection all the way to the lip around the roof's edge.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:08.963
Set it with a projection map from top (on the Z-axis).

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.940
You may elect to rotate the cluster 90 degrees so that the long edge of the roof coincides with the long edge of the corresponding bitmap area.

00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:25.326
The lip around the edge is running parallel to the projection.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.440
It probably won't show much distortion because of the nature of the white pixels but let's be thorough just the same.

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:40.038
With the roof polygons selected click the Shrink button to remove the lip from the selection.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.570
Now scale the cluster to a center point by using Ctrl+Alt.

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:55.499
Switch to Vertex mode and make the necessary adjustments.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.730
When you're done, select the cluster and move it to the right by one UV space.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.240
Repeat the procedure for the other roof.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.340
When you're done and all the clusters are properly set, you want to select them all and "pack" them into the checkered UV space.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:15.460
Simply select all the clusters and move them back by one negative (-1) UV Space.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.995
Exit sub-object mode and the Isolate tool.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.220
You have now unwrapped the building model.

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:35.642
In the next movie, you start working on the car.
