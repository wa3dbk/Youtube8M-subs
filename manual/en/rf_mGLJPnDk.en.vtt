00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.200
Hello and welcome to Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.000
If you've watched my precious videos,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.800
I've prepared pickled green chillies,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600
barbecued pork which is also known as 'char siu'

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.480
and also 'wantan' soup

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Therefore, the next video,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.400
the next recipe has to follow

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
This is 'wantan' noodles

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.200
We have 2 different kinds of 'wantan' noodles in Malaysia

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.400
One is the dry version

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.000
while the other is the soup version

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.200
The soup version is basically 'wantan' soup

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800
where you just add the noodles into the soup

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600
As for the dry version,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.700
I am going to show you how to prepare this

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.300
and to assemble everything

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
together with the 'char siew',

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700
pickled green chillies and of course, the 'wantan'

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Without the 'wantan',

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.800
it would not be 'wantan' noodles

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
So, let's get started

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.800
and look at the ingredients

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.600
To prepare the sauce for the noodles,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.800
we'll need these ingredients

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
So, I have a bit of salt and sugar,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.800
just for taste,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
2 cloves of garlic which I've chopped roughly,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.200
2 tablespoons of oil,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000
2 tablespoons of dark soy sauce,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
1 teaspoon of light soy sauce,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
1 teaspoon of 'kicap manis'

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
and also 1 teaspoon of sesame oil

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Those are the ingredients for the sauce

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.400
As for the noodles,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.400
I've picked some egg noodles

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.600
These are fresh

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.400
I found these at the Asian market

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.280
It's not always that we can get this kind of noodles

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.400
These are freshly made

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.500
and they cannot be kept for long

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.500
To add some greens to the noodles,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.800
I'm using 'choy sum'

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.600
There are always these little yellow flowers on them

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.200
Those are the ones that you are looking for

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.800
Of course, you may replace them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
with baby 'pak choy',

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.700
if you want

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.000
However, for this dish,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.600
usually we use 'choy sum'

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.600
We'll first work on the garlic

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
This is where we're going to prepare the garlic oil

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.660
Pour the oil into a hot wok

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.300
Then, add in the garlic

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.700
All we want is just for the oil

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.600
to infuse with the garlic

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.200
Using the same wok,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
do not need to clean it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.800
I'm just going to add water

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000
Allow the water to boil

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.800
This is where we are going to add in the vegetables

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600
Add in the stems first

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
as they take longer to cook

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.700
20 seconds later,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.000
you may add the leafy parts of the vegetables

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600
Put everything in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800
Vegetables do not take long to cook

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400
You just need to blanch them in hot water

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.200
As you see now,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.000
the colour had changed a little

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.400
It's slightly darker green

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.600
The next step that we're going to do

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.200
is to cook the noodles

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.800
While the noodles are going to cook for 2 minutes,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.200
I'm going to add in the dark soy sauce,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600
soy sauce, some sesame oil,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
'kicap manis' and 1 tablespoon of water

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400
As all the sauces are slightly thick

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800
and we want them to be more diluted,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.800
that's why we added water

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.400
and some salt and sugar

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.600
Cook the sauce at low heat

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.200
Earlier, we had prepared some garlic oil

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.400
Pour the garlic oil into the sauce

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.000
We do not want the garlic pieces,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.800
just the oil

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Then, give it a good stir

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.600
This is where we'll add in the noodles

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.400
It goes onto the plate

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.000
This is when we assemble everything

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
After putting the vegetables,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.800
you would, of course, need to have the 'char siew'

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.800
on top of it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.600
'Wantan' noodles would not be complete

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.200
without 'wantan' soup

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.800
When we have 'wantan' noodles in Malaysia,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.400
we must have pickled green chillies

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.200
This is the 'wantan' noodles

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.600
that you can get in Malaysia

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.600
We called this the dry 'wantan' noodles

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800
It's exceptionally delicious

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.000
