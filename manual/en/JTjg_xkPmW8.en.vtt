00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.430
*Celtic jingle plays*

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.840
Taytos?!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.740
Wow! Smells like flowers!

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.230
Ok.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.920
Like a field.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.610
*chip crunch*

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.540
It tastes like bacon's butt.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.860
I don't really have anything funny to say because my heart's kind of broken. Like this should be the best thing ever.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.420
How do they get all that bacon flavor in there? That is too much bacon flavor.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.350
How can you eat another one?! It's gross.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.800
I don't know! I can't stop.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.250
Jam Mallows.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.180
Ugh! They look like sweet centipedes.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.150
Ooo! Ugh!

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.950
It's just like here's some sugar, here's some marshmallow. Shove it in your face. Quit talking to kids.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.400
It's like dusted with joy.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.060
This is how Irish people eat them. Ha, ha!

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.480
It's a very lazy Pop-tart.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.170
Dairy milk Turkish.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.860
This looks good!

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.340
Oh!

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.520
It looks like slug poop.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.660
You take a bite and you're like I got this figured out. And it's like nope.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.110
It tastes like... perfume.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.560
What is this flavor supposed to be?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.490
It says-- All it says is Turkish.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.730
*laughing*

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.940
It tastes so weird.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.150
It's rose.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.360
What?!

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.500
This is completely normal and they're like let's ruin it.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.370
I like the chocolate more than I dislike the Turkish.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.820
Dip dab.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.750
It's a lollipop covered in sugar

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.380
Ooo! There's also a bear suffocating in a cloud of cocaine right here.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.730
This looks like cocaine! What?!

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.420
I'm confused.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.220
Woo! Ooo! Ahoo- hoo! It's sour.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.330
Yeah... Yeah. I only had a little bit and I feel like boom!

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.190
Yeah! That's the way that the bear wants you to enjoy it. Dip dab.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.130
 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.580
What is in there?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.300
It looks like a poo.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.960
???... meat pie.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.890
They look like cookies and smell like meat.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.100
It's delicious.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.070
It's so good.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.450
What?! *Fork clanks against plate* Get the fuck out!

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.900
What do you mean it's blood?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.590
Wait... is it human blood?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.040
So this is what blood tastes like?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.250
Yeah.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.940
Blood's pretty fucking good.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.150
Blood is good.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:17.030
*Celtic jingle plays*

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.990
Do I have anything on my nose?

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.650
Um. Uh, just like a little on the left.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.790
There you go. You're good. You're good. You're gonna want the rest of that.
