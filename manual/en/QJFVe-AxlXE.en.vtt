00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.089
You've seen how deep brain stimulation
did help the sickest of Parkinson's

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.760
patients but it also be the first
treatment it ever slow the progression

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.379
of the disease?

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.439
Dale Bevels remembers how his life
changed several years ago. His winning

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.120
streak on the golf course became a
losing streak, and simple

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.490
tasks became riddled with simple mistakes.
I noticed in the mornings when I would crank my laptop

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.239
that my fingers would not respond
as i wanted them to

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.849
and when I would type out even short words 

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.410
like the word T-H-E

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.160
instead of having one E,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.210
I would have four, five or six
E's. I would have to go back and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.820
delete those.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.790
I began to be aware that something was wrong. His golf buddies urged him to see a doctor.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.309
After an exam, a neurologist gave
him the news

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.000
He said, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.790
"you have Parkinson's, Parkinson's doesn't have you".  

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.670
For the last two years Dale's been on
numerous medications to manage symptoms

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.870
like tremors.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.950
I have been doing well and as long as I
take it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.760
religiously around the clock,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.930
very few people, I think,  notice that I
have it. 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.410
But he wants more than to just manage his
disease. One of the hardest things for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.890
any patient, I believe, is to lose their
personal dignity.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.520
If I can stay ahead of the game and maintain
that personal dignity, 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.780
for just a little  bit longer, five years ten
years, 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.900
that's one of my most important wishes.
Dale wants to help change the course of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.820
Parkinson's treatments for himself and
others, so he's enrolled in a 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.020
first-of-its-kind study.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.549
Vanderbilt researchers want to know if
TBS can slow Parkinson's progression.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.659
Parkinson's disease there are areas of
the brain that are slowly degenerating

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.990
away and no one knows why.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
As areas degenerate other  brain areas
become overactive possibly leading to

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.720
the advancement of this disease.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.240
so this therapy, deep brain simulation, when applied very early durring the course of this disease, 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.670
It's our hope that by

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
reversing and slowing that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.660
unexpected or abnormal overactivity of
the brain,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.090
that in fact it may slow the progression
of the disease.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.849
In surgery
Vanderbilt's  sophisticated computer

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.300
program has helped guide neurosurgeons to  the targets in Dale's brain.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.230
But can Dale feel that test
current working to control his tremors?

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.830
It's a  tiny little electrical impulse

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.219
enough to 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.319
change the way

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.489
the brain cells communicate with each
other but not enough that you could feel

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.029
it with your hand

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:37.790
or not enough that it could injure the brain.

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:43.689
As we begin stimulating the
right area of the brain

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.050
for the therapy, that stiffness
just melted away

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.700
and in fact it was quite dramatic. He
could feel it, I could feel it

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.699
Open wide and close.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.179
Tap both fingers.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:56.769
I've been awake the whole time.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.379
I'm a little bit groggy, but there's been no pain, 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.129
no discomfort. 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.549
It's kind of like an afternoon nap on the sofa, really. 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.909
I'm going to first be testing to see if we get

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.639
improvements in symptoms, and I'm going to keep going up from there and I'm going to be looking for any side effects.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.969
Doctor Charles says before the study
started

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.599
he didn't know if it would be easier or
more difficult to program the DBS

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.799
systems in early Parkinson's patients
because their symptoms aren't as severe as

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.269
patients who've had later stage
Parkinson's. Cases like Dale's will help

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.989
him gather information to answer that
and many more questions.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.059
So how will Doctor Charles learn if
TBS is slowing Dale's Parkinson's?

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.559
All of the people in the study will be followed.

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.729
Every six months, they'll  come back into the hospital for a week long stay
week long stay

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.589
where we'll stop their medications and
stimulation

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.809
and we'll wait for all those effects to 
completely washout and then we'll be

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.109
testing their

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.839
Parkinson's with a rating scale that's used, 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.430
and that will be the basis of the data collection for the study.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.700
As for Dale...

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.440
After his first programming...I can tell you that my trembling has diminished a bit

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.219
with no meds.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.110
But he understands that it will be

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.239
years before researchers now if DBS
will slow his Parkinson's progression.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.470
In the meantime, Dale looks
forward to a rematch with his buddies on

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.180
the golf course. Katy bar the door, I'm
after their money again because I feel

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.540
like I'm really 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.419
reved up

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.460
and ready to play and get serious again.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.810
another Vanderbilt study is looking at how
long the effects of medications and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.360
stimulation linger in the body

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.709
once patients stop all treatments. That
information will be vital to future

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:51.419
studies targeting ways of slowing the
progression of Parkinson's.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.620
Movement disorders also strike
children. Can DBS help the youngest

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.400
and sickest of patients?
