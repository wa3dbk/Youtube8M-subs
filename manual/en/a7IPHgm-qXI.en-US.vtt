Lesson Four

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:07.188
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:12.445
And I have a wonderful story for you called "Samuel's Service"

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:18.331
Today's memory verse is from 1 Samuel 7:15

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:23.725
It says 'Samuel continued as judge... all the days of his life'

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:29.657
The message for today's story is 'I will serve Jesus all my life'

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.685
Do you know what you want to be when you grow up?

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:35.451
Will you be a leader like Samuel?

00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:41.120
God's people, the Israelites, started worshiping the idols of their neighbors, the Philistines

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.491
One of these idols was Baal, the Philistine god of thunder and rain

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.400
Many Israelites had little idols of Baal in their houses

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:53.554
God sent Samuel to talk to the people

00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:57.440
"Remember, the name Israel" means ruled by God

00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:00.777
Turn bacl to God with all your hearts," He said

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:02.594
"Throw away your idols

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.188
Give yourselves to God and serve Him"

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.182
The people of Israel listened to Samuel

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.977
They broke all their idols and began to worship God again

00:01:12.685 --> 00:01:16.468
"Come, meet at Mizpah," Samuel told the people

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:19.040
"I will pray to the Lord for you there"

00:01:19.737 --> 00:01:21.554
So the people gathered to Mizpah

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.628
"We have sinned against the Lord," they admitted

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.811
"We are sorry. We are really, really sorry"

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:32.354
The Philistines heard that the Israelites had gone to Mizpah

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.674
"Lets go attack them." they said

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:39.211
So the Philistine rulers gathered their soldiers and marched toward Mizpah

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.211
"The Philistines are coming! The Philistines are coming!"

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.942
A young man shouted as he ran up the road

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.120
The Israelites looked at each other with wide eyes

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:53.462
"Ask the Lord to save us from the Philistines!" They begged Samuel

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:56.662
And of course, Samuel did what the people asked

00:01:57.142 --> 00:02:00.182
And the Lord's might voice thundered from heaven

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:02.228
It echoed from the mountains

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.862
It shook the air

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:06.480
It rumbled, it rolled

00:02:06.548 --> 00:02:08.480
and it boomed

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:10.674
The Philistines were frightened

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.108
They dropped their swords and their spears

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:16.365
And they ran away as fast as the could

00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:20.742
The foolish Philistines thought their god, Baal, was the god of thunder

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:26.228
So the true God used thunder to show that he was more powerful than any idol

00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:30.697
Samuel put a large rock for a monument on the road to Mizpah

00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:35.931
He wanted the people of Israel to always remember how the true God had saved them

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:38.925
For years to come, children would ask

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:41.017
"Why is that big rock there?"

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:46.000
And the parents would tell their children the wonderful story of how God saved them

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.011
Samuel was a ruler in Israel for the rest of his life

00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:52.560
He served the Lord all his days

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.942
Boys and girls, do you want to serve the Lord too?

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:58.457
How can you serve Him today?

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.497
