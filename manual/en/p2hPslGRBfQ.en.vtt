00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.940
Introducing Google Video
Advertising Solutions, your

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.620
central place for website
publishers, video creators,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.880
and advertisers to take
advantage of the growing

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.220
online video opportunity.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's first look at Google's
opportunities for website

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
publishers and video creators
from a high level.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750
Let's say you have any kind
of site with video on it.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.530
You can have Google serve
targeted ads into those videos

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.890
using AdSense for Video.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640
Next, let's say you want to
increase the reach of your

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.960
video content.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.080
Well, you could sign up for the
YouTube partner program,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.710
and your video will be hosted
on YouTube and distributed

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.550
across sites on the AdSense
network and through other

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.930
platforms like mobile
phones or the iPod.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.280
Finally, even if you don't have
video of your own or if

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.120
you'd like to supplement your
site content, you can add

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.230
AdSense video units to your
pages and select the videos

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.670
and YouTube partners
to plan your site.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.080
With all of these
options, you'll

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.080
share in the ad revenue.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.730
Let's get into the specifics of
making money with video on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.480
your site through AdSense
for Video with targeted

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.180
non-intrusive ads.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.470
In-video ads adopted on YouTube
can now run on our

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.100
video partner sites with
AdSense for Video.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.810
These in-video ads sit in the
bottom portion of the video

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.320
viewing area while the video
content plays concurrently.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.160
Advertisers have the option to
include a companion video ad

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.810
which opens if their user
clicks on the overlay.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
Also competing in the auction
are text overlay ads drawn

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.220
from the world's largest
advertiser base, and these ads

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.830
can be contextually targeted
or placement targeted by

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.930
advertisers.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.700
