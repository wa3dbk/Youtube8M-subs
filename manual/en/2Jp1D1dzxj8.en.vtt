00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.430
Lately we've been hearing a lot about
global warming, and words like

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.410
carbon footprint, climate shift, carbon dioxide, 
and climate change.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.640
But what is carbon, and what does it have to do with climate change?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.700
Carbon is everywhere in the ecosystem,
and it is always moving.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.780
Some of it is floating in the atmosphere, plants absorb carbon from the air, and store in their bodies.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.560
When animals eat plants, they eat
carbon, and when something bigger eats those animals,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.840
they're having a carbon snack too, but that carbon won't stay still for long.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.100
When an animal poops, or something
dies, carbon moves around again.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.150
Some of it is held in the soil for a
while, and eventually

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.970
most of it ends up back in the atmosphere.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.700
The same type of process happens in the oceans too,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.680
most of the carbon dioxide gas on earth is
actually dissolved in ocean water.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.120
Some of the carbon from dead plants and
animals was trapped underground and over

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.280
millions and millions of years it turned
into coal, oil and gas,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.540
and that's pretty much how the system works.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.660
Some carbon has stayed deep underground 
for millions of years,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.240
but the rest moves around the
ecosystem, from the air, to plants, to animals

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.640
and back into the atmosphere, and
that's the story of the carbon cycle!

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.900
...well, it was, until we came along.  
We've been cutting down a lot of forests

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.650
that used to absorb carbon from the
atmosphere, and we've been digging up

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.360
carbon from deep underground and burning
it for energy.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
Doing that pumps that old carbon back into the air.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.440
By getting rid of plants, 
and burning lots of fossil fuels,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.300
we've changed the system.
The amosphere is filling up with carbon

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.080
faster than plants and oceans can absorb
it.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.000
All this extra carbon in the air is like a blanket round the earth that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.320
traps in extra heat from the Sun.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320
And things are changing all over the globe.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.660
But now that we know that we are part of
the system, we can do things to keep in balance.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.900
We can stop chopping down forests, and plant trees.  We can use less energy.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.420
Even better, we can find other
sources of energy, and leave the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.840
ancient carbon underground and out of the atmosphere.
