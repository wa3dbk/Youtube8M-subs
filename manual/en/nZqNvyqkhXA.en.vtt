00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080 position:80%
In the U.S., more than 800 construction workers die

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.090
every year while on the job.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.090 position:81%
Being struck by vehicles, heavy equipment, and other

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.180 position:80%
objects is the top cause of injuries and the second

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.150 position:63%
cause of death for construction workers,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.110 position:59%
killing more than 150 workers in 2009.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.210 position:72%
One of the most deadly construction hazards is

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.210 position:61%
being struck by cranes and crane parts.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.230 position:73%
But these injuries and deaths can be prevented.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.180 position:75%
The video you are about to see shows how quickly

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.000 position:70%
struck-by accidents at construction sites can

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.150
lead to worker deaths.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.010 position:73%
The video will also show what employers must do

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.130 position:64%
so that the work can be done more safely.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.060 position:92%
Employers have a responsibility to provide a safe workplace

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.100
and required protective equipment.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.140 position:97%
You'll see that taking the right protective steps saves lives.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.230
Please be advised.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.220 position:80%
The scenes you are about to see deal with deaths at

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.210 position:66%
construction sites and might be disturbing

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.220
for some people.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 position:58%
All scenes are based on true stories.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.150 position:70%
A driver was delivering a load of steel beams

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.160
to a job site.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.160 position:75%
After positioning his flatbed truck as directed,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.210 position:83%
he stood near the hydraulic crane that was offloading

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.020
the truck to watch the operation.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.120 position:81%
The company operating the crane had secured the area

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.090 position:67%
using vehicles and two strategically placed

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.040 position:67%
workers to keep out unauthorized personnel.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.000 position:81%
However, no barricades were in place to stop workers

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.220 position:69%
from coming within the crane's swing radius.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 position:78%
The driver was allowed to stay in the secured area

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.120 position:72%
because he was a friend and knew the operator.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.090 position:69%
Before the unloading began, the driver moved

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.030 position:63%
closer to the crane, now within range of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.150 position:69%
the crane's swing radius and out of the line

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.090
of sight of the crane operator.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.020 position:81%
Suddenly, the crane operator began moving the crane,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.000 position:69%
positioning it for the offloading operation.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.080 position:81%
Within seconds, the truck driver was crushed between

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.150 position:86%
the crane's counterweight and the right rear outrigger.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.140 position:80%
He died later that day from serious injuries to his

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.120
chest and internal organs.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.020 position:78%
Let's look at the events leading up to this tragic

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.210 position:80%
incident, and see how it could have been prevented.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.130 position:77%
This worksite did not have the necessary controls

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.150
in place to protect workers.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.150 position:75%
The radius of the crane's superstructure was not

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.190 position:86%
barricaded and the flatbed driver was allowed to remain

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.200 position:66%
in what was supposed to be a secured area.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.040
Let's look again at the work area.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.160 position:72%
Now a temporary barricadeâ€”including three-inch

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.190 position:67%
caution tapeâ€”is in place to prevent workers

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.170 position:86%
from coming too close to the swing radius of the crane.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.020 position:78%
In addition to the barriers, employers should make

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.030 position:75%
sure crane and/or superstructure movement occurs

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.010 position:63%
only when an "all clear" signal is given

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
to the operator.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.090 position:67%
Now, as the crane begins to move, no worker

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.230 position:77%
is within the swing radius and no contact occurs.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.110 position:88%
This example shows the importance of employers following

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.180 position:64%
OSHA standards to ensure that workers are

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.210
provided with a safe workplace.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.170 position:80%
These types of construction deaths are preventable.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.020 position:86%
The protection measures shown here save workers' lives.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.060
Use these protections on the job:

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.040 position:78%
it could be the difference between life and death.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.080
