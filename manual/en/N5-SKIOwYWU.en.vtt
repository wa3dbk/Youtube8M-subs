00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.625
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:02.920
(SINGING) You are
the icing on my cake.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.145
You are the smile
I can't replace.

00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:05.770
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.311
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:08.070
Site.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.570
And today CGH4 and I
are going to show you

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.860
how to create a
butterfly headband.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.850
Now, to begin, I have parted her
hair for one ear to the other

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.610
to create kind of
a front section

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.533
that we're going to make into
the headband and the rest of it

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.720
I've just pulled back and
out of the way secured

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.700
with an elastic for now.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.690
And we have her to tip
her head to one side

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.880
and I'm going to go over here
and pick up right by her ear

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.390
a section hair and begin
the headband portion.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.990
Now, I'm going to be
doing a dutch-lace braid.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
When a lace braid means I'm only
going to pick up on one side

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.904
and I'm going to be picking up
on this front side every time.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:48.320
So you'll see that
I don't pick up

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.849
hair when I'm towards
the back of her head.

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:53.390
You can just go
ahead and we're going

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.670
to quickly do a lace braid
that turns into a headband,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.890
and if you don't know
how to do the technique,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.160
I do have another
video on it and I'll

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.300
put the link in
the description box

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.930
below so you can
find it and go learn

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.780
how to do this if you
don't already know.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.630
You can just see I'm
quickly braiding her hair.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.250
And I'm trying to keep the
braid back towards the part.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.910
I like it when it's
sitting closer to the part

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.930
and not so like tight
on her forehead.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:34.580
And we're just going to
keep going all the way down

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.800
until we reach the other ear.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.610
And you can add water
to wet the hair down

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.276
if you need to for
fly-away control.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.060
Up to you.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.560
When I get to this
part, I'm just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:02.950
going to go ahead and finish
off the braid until we start

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.860
having little pieces
stick out and then

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.830
we'll have to just
secure with an elastic.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.330
Thank you.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.996
-You're welcome.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:11.470
-You knew what I
was going to do.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.860
Now, we'll just leave
that there for a second.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.367
Now, to create the butterfly,
I'm going to take a hair pin

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.450
and I'm going to pick which
loop I'm going to use,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.530
and I'm going to try
to use this one on her,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.310
and I'm going to go
from a downward angle

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.016
to an upward angle
underneath that loop.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.040
Now, I'm going to pick
up a piece of hair,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.480
a little section of hair.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.070
I'm going to add
some pomade, just run

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.990
the pomade down the
hair strand like this,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.730
make a tiny little loop,
slip it through the hair pin,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.110
and go ahead and pull gently
until you create kind of a bow

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.490
affect like we used
in the bow braid.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.510
I want this top one to be
bigger than the bottom,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.930
so that's a little
lopsided on purpose.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.680
Now, for the second
half of the butterfly,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.265
we are going to go
in downward angles.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:08.610
So I'm gong to slide this down
from top this time to bottom.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.870
I'm going to pick up
another section of hair,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.920
add a little pomade, go
ahead and make a little loop,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.505
slip it through the
hair pin, hang on

00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:26.760
to it as we begin to gently
pull it back through,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.050
and create a second
bow that's going

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.150
to kind of cross
underneath our first bow.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.920
And, again, I'm going to
try to make the top loop

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.820
a little bit bigger
than the bottom loop

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.560
so that we really accent the
fact that these are supposed

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.430
to be butterfly wings.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.750
And then if you have any little
tails like this piece right

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.590
here, you can just
take a little bobby pin

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.935
and slide it down
to hide those ends.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.280
Now, there.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.710
Let's see.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.890
We have our perfect
little butterfly.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.744
Adjust a little
bit as needed to.

00:04:09.744 --> 00:04:12.240
There we go.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.710
Ta-da.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.815
And we have our cute
little butterfly wings--

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:22.865
I love it-- in the
middle of the braid.

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:24.690
It's so cute.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.420
Now, I don't love the way
this looks just hanging out

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.070
down here, so I'm actually going
to go on this side of her hair,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.080
see if I can do this.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.400
You can see it.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.690
I'm just going to pick up
a little section right here

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.690
underneath, and pull the
braid around behind her ear.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.020
Kay, can you hold your
hair right here for me.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.950
No, right here.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.340
You got it?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.300
Thanks.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.260
And just elastic
the two together

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.940
underneath, out of the way
where they won't be seen.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.920
Ta-da.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.880
And to me, that
looks a lot better.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.130
Here's your butterfly
and just some cute curls

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.902
in the back all the way around.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:21.110
You went to school last week.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.566
What did everyone think?

00:05:22.566 --> 00:05:24.900
-They that it was
really cool and they

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.100
wanted to know how to
do it, well, the girls.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.200
And the boys just wanted to
know if I could get it to fly.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.150
-To fly.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.730
What?

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.454
They asked you if
they could fly?

00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:39.954
-Yeah.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.775
-Well, if you want to
show us your pictures

00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:50.255
of your butterflies,
#CGHButterflyHeadband and send

00:05:50.255 --> 00:05:53.970
your pictures our way, and we
will see you guys next week.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.600
Bye, guys.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.080
-Try to make it fly.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.580
-Bye, guys.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.850
(SINGING) You are, you are,
you are every bit of beautiful.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.600
-Now, you can see that
we're about an inch

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.760
back from the part line.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.280
We're going to try and keep
it pretty close to her ear.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.690
We don't want it cutting
halfway through her head.

00:06:20.382 --> 00:06:22.280
-What?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.660
Want you to be hairians.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.950
-Yes. [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.670
-Would you want to
be called a hairian?

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.580
-Would you?

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.080
-No.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.200
-Do you want to
call them Mindions?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.130
-Sure.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.630
Mindions.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.740
They're followers of me.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.010
-Stop.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.000
-What's wrong with Mindions?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
-It's too weird.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.570
-What should we call them?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.280
What should our new name be?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.346
-CGH4 Fans.

00:06:50.346 --> 00:06:52.266
-Stop.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:52.766
Sh.

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:55.186
We're supposed to be filming.

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.043
Are you ready?

00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:02.543
-Yes.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:09.750
-You guys.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.350
-Stop.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.150
-We're never going
to get this filmed.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.350
-Stop.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.250
-You started it.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.450
-I did.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.600
-Yes, you did.
