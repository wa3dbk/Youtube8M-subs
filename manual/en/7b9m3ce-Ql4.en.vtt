00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.860
Hi I'm Steve Sapienza I'm a freelance
news and documentary producer

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.010
I'm currently in Bangladesh

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.660
and I'm here on a travel grant from the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.189
I'm looking at water sanitation and hygiene
challenges here in Bangladesh

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.119
and in particular here in Dhaka

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.539
Bangladesh is considered one of the more densely
populated countries on earth

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.140
and here in the capital Dhaka

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.099
it is a very crowded city it's very noisy

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.920
very exciting very vibrant

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.420
and it's also

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.650
growing very quickly at a very fast rate many
people are moving into the city some four

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.980
hundred thousand new residents every year

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.690
from rural areas moving into the city

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.970
and a lot of them end up in in slum areas
which you can see over my shoulder here in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.120
the background an there's a lot of pressure put on
this city

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.220
in terms of the social

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.490
environmental and health

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.010
concerns

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.780
and already the city is facing a lot of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.320
challenges that

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.970
that mega cities face

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.860
in developing countries all over the world

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.630
really really bad traffic

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.210
they've got problems with

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.420
infrastructure in terms of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.220
you know the roads

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.950
and power there are a lot of power outages here

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.560
the sanitation situation here is really
severe

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.869
almost two-thirds

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.289
of the city has

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.060
no access to the city sewer lines

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.990
so that means the sewage is removed from pit latrines

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.540
from septic tanks

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390
and it's actually

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.850
deposited here and there and left to really
seep into the ground

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.160
or the water that you can see

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.410
exists all around Dhaka and this
poses a severe health hazard not only that

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.950
a lot of the water surface water is actually
goes back into the water system here

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.140
in Dhaka it's treated but

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.890
it has the potential to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.820
add more disease and problems to
the local water supply

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.640
so this reporting project will look at the water
sanitation and hygiene issues here

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.890
in Dhaka and around Bangladesh

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.670
and to really focus in on a lot of simple
safe solutions that are happening here

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.410
to really change people's lives these
are solutions that can happen at very low

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.900
cost

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.049
but have huge impacts on

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.129
the everyday lives of

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.539
urban poor and the overall health of the city
in general

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:30.209
reporting from Bangladesh is a challenge
there are many different types of ways

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.319
that make it difficult to get a
story done here

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.339
I can't speak directly to

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:37.639
problems here in Dhaka

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:42.749
first of all it's very very crowded
this being one of the most densely populated

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:43.889
countries on earth

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.329
there are

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.760
insane traffic jams traffic jams like I've
never seen before

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.990
sometimes just a simple trip across town to
take three to four hours

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.239
and when you're on a tight schedule thate can really
really

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.419
mess up your day

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.009
another issue is noise there's always
a lot of noise going on so if you're trying

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.790
to get

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.040
you know a good

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.469
interview or good sound

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.590
for video or perhaps if you're a radio reporter
for radio reporting

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.420
there's just an enormous amount of noise all
the time

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.709
everywhere you go

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.199
another thing that is problematic a lot of
times is it has to work the crowds again

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.460
number of people sometimes we will set up
a camera

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.649
and a lot of people will crown around

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.399
including they'll walk right into the shot or
they'll just come walk right up and just stare right

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.799
into the camera

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:30.889
and

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.799
you know it's it's pretty funny what happens
but it slows slows down your progress in

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.170
what you're trying to get done

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.910
also there are lot of power blackouts so you
have to make sure you have a good source

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.129
of energy

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.430
to power up

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.480
your light

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.520
and you're

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.169
the camera batteries and that's another challenge

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.969
and I think maybe in one last challenge that
happens at this particular time of year which

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.389
is Ramadan

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:01.139
you often have to work around the different
prayer times during the day

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.309
and also take breaks for the different
for the Iftar

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.239
in the evening when they break fast

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.480
so you have to respect the local culture

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.589
and you have to work

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.869
within

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.069
the scheduled time

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.759
that this country is running on during
Ramadan

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.489
so this is my third trip to Bangladesh
and my impressions of Bangladesh have changed

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.330
since I first came here

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.490
you know of my overall impression

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.839
is that this is a country facing so many
many many

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.570
difficult

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.509
challenges I mean you've got extreme from
poverty

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.189
you have climate change issues that are
impacting this country

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.599
you have

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.000
you have disease

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.409
there's corruption

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.959
there's a lot of really really heavy problems that
are impacting Bangladesh

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.759
but

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.780
I've been really impressed with

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.349
how this country

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.649
and its people

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.280
take on these challenges

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.300
unfortunately many many years ago this country
was tagged

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.799
as an international basket case

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:05.509
and it's still

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.739
a very very young

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.830
growing democratic country

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.370
and you feel

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.219
that there are a lot of people here who are very
who are trying very hard

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.990
to make things and succeeding

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.460
in making strides towards improving

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.690
their country

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.240
and that is what I've seen here and I
think

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.699
you know the overall impression i'll have coming
away from this story

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.199
is that there a lot of dedicated hardworking

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.060
people who are finding very simple

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.699
safe

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.649
effective solutions to water and sanitation
problems here

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:40.150
in Bangladesh that

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.270
are going to help this country move forward

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.930
and also could be exported to the rest of
the world

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.979
and help other countries with their sanitation and
water

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:50.889
access issues
