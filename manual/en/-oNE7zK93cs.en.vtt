"So my name is Erin Wolff and we are at NIH,
the National Institute of Child Health and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.849
Human Development.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.570
My primary function is to do research in women's
health, so I see patients in clinical trials

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.850
here in the clinical center, and then I also
do some basic research in the laboratory.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.920
So I grew up in a small town in Ohio out in
the country, and I was interested in biology

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.290
and went to undergrad and studied biology.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.690
I took a class where it was a reproductive
elective.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.120
And I was sitting in the clinic and they were
doing their first gestational carrier cycle,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.890
and it was for a woman that had been born
without her own uterus.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.040
A different woman that was going to carry
the pregnancy came in and spoke to us, and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.470
she talked to us and said that she'd just
always had this dream to help someone else

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.780
after she read a book in high school.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.640
We were talking with the fertility team and
we were like well who's name is gonna go on

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.890
the birth certificate? and they hadn't really
even figured that out.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.280
The laws weren't in place, the medicine was
barely in place and these doctors were sort

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.630
of on the cutting edge of this technology.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890
So then I decided to do Ob/GYN knowing that
I wanted to go into infertility eventually.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.090
So my primary focus is trying to find new
ways to help women with infertility who can't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.299
make new eggs on their own.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.680
So their eggs have run out.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.270
We're working with ovarian stem cells trying
to figure out ways to make new eggs.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
And so we're trying to see if those eggs fertilize
normally.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.670
Before, even ten years ago it was really difficult
to freeze eggs, so if people that had cancer

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.979
wanted to try and freeze some embryos before
they underwent chemotherapy or radiation,

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.749
their only option was to freeze an embryo,
so after the egg had been fertilized.

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:10.580
But for young girls that needed cancer therapy
or other types of therapies that didn't have

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.080
a partner, was a very difficult decision.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.569
So what we're actually starting for the first
time in one of the patients that I saw this

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.830
morning, is that they can now do bone marrow
transplants for sickle cell disease.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.610
So we collaborate closely with a sickle cell
team and we have a 19 year old patient who's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.930
going to have her eggs frozen and it'll be
the first egg freezing at NIH.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.790
So she's gonna undergo a bone marrow transplant
at the end of next month and then this will

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.209
hopefully enable her to have her own children
which she wouldn't otherwise be able to have.

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.460
Since I do both clinical work and basic science
it's a little bit of a juggling act.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.030
Some days I'll have a patient that's scheduled
so I'll go up and talk to them for an hour,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.040
and do an exam, and do an ultrasound and see
if their ovaries look normal and their uterus

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.040
looks normal.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040
speaker 1: Yeah.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.409
speaker 2: And I'm still hungry all the time.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.760
speaker 1: Pregnancy's like an accelerated
starvation mode and your blood sugar spikes

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760
earlier.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.250
Do you have a lot of nausea?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.250
speaker 2: Yes.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.910
And then I'll run down and talk to the team
here about the ongoing stem cell projects

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.939
that we have, and look at data, and think
about what might be a good next thing to do

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.519
or try and figure out why we're getting the
data that we're getting.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.670
speaker 3: So I have the two tubes for it.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.670
speaker 1: Perfect.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.280
And the other part we're gonna do the digest,
but that part you know.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.930
speaker 3: Yeah it's already in there and
we let that set for like 15 minutes so that's

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.930
already going.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.930
speaker 1: Okay great.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.930
Yep.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.930
Yeah.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.930
speaker 1: So we saw a patient this morning
who was a healthy volunteer who wanted to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.620
donate endometrial tissue to look if there's
immune cells that are somehow rejecting the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.099
embryo when it implants.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.890
So maybe if there are some people with infertility,
then it's because the embryo isn't able to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.079
implant in the uterus.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.519
speaker 1: This one's growing well.

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.829
speaker 1: So we're studying these samples
to see if the numbers of the percentages of

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.180
those immune cells are altered too high or
too low.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.640
What's not known is if it's normal to have
any organisms in the uterus, in the lining

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.930
of the uterus called the endometrium.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.771
So we're also checking these endometrial samples
for the microbiome.

00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:18.019
IVF has happened in our lifetime and it's
really changed the way people have families.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.020
And so I'm hopeful that there's a way that
we can find to have stem cells affect people's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.500
ability to have families within my lifetime.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.470
Potentially there might be ways that we would
freeze stem cells instead of need to freeze

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.380
an eggs and then all women could bank stem
cells at a young age in case they had any

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.090
problems with infertility down the road or
their ovaries failed unexpectedly.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.580
So at NIH one of the benefits of being here
is there's so many smart people.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.360
So you have some very, very stimulating conversations.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.189
You get to really think about the frontiers
of where medicine is and where science is.

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.900
Follow your heart and if something excites
you that's where you need to go even if there's

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.960
not a clear path.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.460
So if you're not sure why something is exciting
to you or if someone says well there's no

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.919
jobs in that area, it's more important to
do something that you love and follow what's

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:24.919
exciting to you."
