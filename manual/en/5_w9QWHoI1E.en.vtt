00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.410
The golden rectangle has been used by artists
and architects for centuries. The Parthenon

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.540
is built upon the golden rectangle. The golden
rectangle comes from mathematics. It comes

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.860
from the Fibonacci series of numbers. Fibonacci
series of numbers is one, two, three, five,

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.770
eight, thirteen, twenty-one, and so on. If
you take the first number and add it to the

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.610
second number, it gives you the third number,
add those two together, it gives you the next

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.850
number, add those two together, it gives you
the next number. What you end up with is a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:53.010
ratio of one point six, approximately, to
one. One point six, to one. We're actually

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.250
going to cut this so that it's there. Five
to three or eight to five, therein, lies the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.869
golden rectangle. The beauty of the golden
rectangle, is that if you take the golden

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.440
rectangle section, here is a golden rectangle
section, and you draw a square, out of that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.369
golden rectangle section, what you end up
with is a golden rectangle here, a square

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:29.400
here and, surprisingly enough, another golden
rectangle, right here. You can divide this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.990
space up into fives and eights and squares
and you'll end up with a whole series of rectangles,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.950
that are golden rectangle sections, and squares.
Squares and golden rectangles section and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:55.320
everywhere you go, you'll end up with a square
and a golden rectangle.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.880
Those positions are all where the eye, naturally,
will go, if it's allowed to, that's where

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.540
it finds rest. It finds rest there, primarily,
because of the fact that our selves divide

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.890
that way. When a flower grows, it grows in
a spiral. The shell spiral of a nodelist,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.209
is due to that growth rate, so it's somehow
built into us, to like that ratio and when

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.419
artists discovered it, when they started painting
and when they started doing things like building

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:46.639
buildings, they discovered that that was a
very perfect shape and established good composition

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:53.999
that people naturally liked. I tend to build
any structure, whether it's a still life or

00:02:53.999 --> 00:03:00.859
whether it's a portrait, and use the golden
rectangle as a guideline, as a place to start,

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.449
rather than just breaking things down into
simple halves. In fact, an eight and a half

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:12.069
by eleven sheet of paper, is, basically, based
upon the golden rectangle.
