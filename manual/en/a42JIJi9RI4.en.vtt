00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.300
The go to, do it all daypack for any adventure,
the Osprey Tempest 20 is a really great women’s

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.640
specific pack that is going to be versatile
in lots of different types of conditions.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.070
So anywhere from day hiking to traveling,
mountain biking, commuting.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.850
This is going to be an excellent pack.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.230
The first thing to talk about with any pack
is the suspension system and how it carries

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.650
your gear.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.359
So as I flip it around here, you have got
Osprey’s airscape back panel.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.420
This whole suspension system is lightweight.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
So that is the story here.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.829
It is lightweight.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.440
But it offers all the support that you need
to carry this size pack.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.979
There is spacer mesh here that comes in contact
with your back and that gives you a little

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.190
bit of space between that ridged foam and
the actual channel here behind the back.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.190
So that is going to allow a lot of warm air
to escape as you are moving fast, as you are

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.190
working up a sweat.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.280
This is def-initely going to wick away.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.670
The back panel is a little bit rigid, but
it is pretty flexible as well.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.260
So, you know, you don’t have any hard frame
or anything like that.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.560
It is going to conform to your back and it
is going to be really comfortable and it is

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.610
going to cut down on hot spots.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.469
So really great back panel there.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.149
The shoulder harness is adjustable.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.969
So there is just Velcro behind here.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.680
It is going to ad-just up and down to dial
in that fit.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.100
And it does come in two different sizes.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.509
So definitely look at the size chart to see
what fits best for you.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.100
But the shoulder harness, you have got load
lifter straps that is going to adjust that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.469
up and down.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.350
The actual straps have a lot of mesh.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.509
They are very breathable.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.030
So there are cut outs in that foam.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.320
It is very, very com-fortable when you cinch
everything down and when you tighten it down.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.479
Obviously you have got an adjustable sternum
strap here.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.300
There is even a whistle on that strap and
a small stretchy pocket here.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.620
I have just got a Chapstick in there just
to show the size, so a small pocket for that.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.959
Moving down the shoulder harness you have
got stow on the go trekking pole loops.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.870
So if you are hiking fast even if you are
trail running with this pack, you can take

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.819
those trek-king poles, if you don’t want
to use them for a short period of time and

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.599
just put them on the stow on the go trekking
pole loops.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.870
You have got that other part of the stow on
the go on the side there, so something I really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.980
love about Osprey packs.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.040
Moving down to the hip belt you have kind
of a small hip belt, but definitely enough

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.160
padding to support the weight, to, you know,
transfer the load to your hips.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.830
There is cut outs in the foam on that hip
belt as well.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.120
And it is very flexible hip belt.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.970
It feels really comfortable on.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.700
It really contours to your body.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.100
Again, it is adjustable and you have stretchy
mesh pockets.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.409
I have got a cell phone in here and it fits
really well.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.290
So anywhere from granola bars and maybe a
small GPS, a small camera is going to fit

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.730
in there and that stretchy pocket is real-ly
lightweight.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.730
So something I really appreciate on day packs
is having a pocket there where you can get

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.980
your hands on gear really quickly.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.670
In keeping with the lightweight design of
this pack, the pockets are really streamlined

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.569
and simple, but very convenient.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.940
Starting on the back you have a hydration
sleeve on the back of the pack.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.660
This allows you to take the hydration bladder
out and refill it without having to open up

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.150
the backpack, without having to take any gear
out.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.280
So it is really easy and simple and fast.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.090
There is a webbing loop here to hang that
hydration system.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.290
And even at the bottom of the sleeve there
is a little rivet.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.799
So if you have condensation or if there were
a leak in that bladder it would run out that

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.579
rivet down in the bottom and it is not going
to soak the gear in your pack.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.630
On the side here you have stretchy mesh pockets,
great size for a water bottle.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.410
You have compression that can either go on
top of the water bottle or beneath it.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.610
So if you don’t have the pack packed out
completely, you can cinch that down behind

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.430
the bottle and still have access to that pocket.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.070
It is a traditional panel loading pack.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.180
So you have got main access into the body
of the pack right here on the top, a nice

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.449
big zipper, so you are able to open that up
and pull it down and access all the gear you

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.449
need inside.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.210
You have got an extra pocket up top.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.190
Great place for an extra pair of sunglasses.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.280
I have also got a first aid kit in here so
it is a big enough pocket that you can store

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.470
that gear you want to get your hands on quickly.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:07.950
If you are day hiking, you know, a hydration
filter in there or something like that.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.400
And then you have a stretchy, dump pocket
right here in the front.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.450
So I have just got an extra layer shoved in
there.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.090
The features here are pretty simple and convenient
as well.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.830
You have got trekking pole attachment loop
right there, a tool loop at the bottom for

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.830
that.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.419
So it is really easy to just attach a pair
of trekking poles on the back of your pack

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.960
if you are not going to use them for a while.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.990
You have a lid lock for a helmet.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.759
So if you are using this as a commuter pack
or a biking pack, it is really simple to just

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.569
take a helmet, put it right on the outside
of your pack so you can access it quickly

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.660
and this doesn’t take up any room inside
the pack.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.460
So you don’t have to store your helmet inside
and take up that capacity inside the pack.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.590
So just really convenient features.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.300
Along with the bike features you do have just
a little blinky light attachment here on the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.310
bottom, something really simple, but, you
know, definitely useful.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:17.830
So, all in all, the Osprey Tempest 20 liter
pack is going to be versatile in many different

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.639
types of adventures from biking to hiking,
commuting, even adventure racing.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.600
This is go-ing to be an excellent option.
