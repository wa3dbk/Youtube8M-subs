00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.079
In this video we will hook up a SureServo
system and quickly jog the motor to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.770
verify proper operation.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.970
You will need a SureServo drive,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.100
a SureServo motor,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.010
a motor power cable,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.830
motor feedback cable,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.859
and a power source.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.550
Most importantly you should have a copy
of the SureServo manual.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.520
You can purchase a copy of the manual,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.460
or you can download it for free from the
automationdirect.com Web site,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.440
or the SureServo.com Web site.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.230
Hooking up a SureServo systems is easy.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.490
The encoder cable connects to the motor
lead

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.490
and to the drive.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.510
The motor power cable is connected to
the other motor lead and then to the drive

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.680
with three discrete connections and the ground.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.299
Please note that unlike some other
three-phase motors

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.229
the phases for a servo must be connected
in the correct order.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.570
On a SureServo

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.340
red is connected to “U”

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.160
white to “V” and black to “W”.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.960
The green ground wire has a ring
terminal pre-installed and is attached

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.730
at the bottom front of the drive.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.170
If you have a brake motor

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.470
refer to chapter three for details on
connecting the brake leads.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.670
Note that all AutomationDirect motor
power cables include the brake leads

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.640
regardless of whether your motor has a
brake

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.640
If your motor has a brake you will need
to apply 24 Volt DC to these

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.520
leads

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.909
before you can jog the motor.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.450
This motor doesn't have a break so I
have just capped these leads.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.050
Two types of power connections are
required for most Servo systems

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.060
and SureServo is no exception.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.470
The main power connection powers the
motor

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.750
while a second connection powers the
control electronics in the drive.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.040
In many installations an e-stop
circuit is required to disconnect the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.170
main power

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.789
“R”, “S” and “T”,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.189
while control power to the drive can be
maintained for diagnostic and

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.150
maintenance purposes.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.379
It is strongly recommended that you
implement an e-stop circuit and

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.959
proper circuit protection.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.530
Both for personnel safety

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.239
and for the protection of the
electronics.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.599
See chapter three of the manual for
recommendations on the size and type of

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.750
circuit protection

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.329
for each SureServo system.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.879
Most SureServo installations will require
Three-phase 220 Volts for the

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.009
main power.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.599
Although the smaller systems will run on
Single-phase 220.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.999
In this case supply power to “R” and “S” only.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.359
The control power

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.239
only requires single-phase. Just provide
220 volts across the “L1” and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.379
“L2” terminals.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.409
Double-check your wiring - make sure
you've got the required voltage on the

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.409
correct connectors.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.249
Let’s power it up.

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.689
There will be errors

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.769
alarm fourteen and alarm fifteen are alarm
errors for the over travel limit

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.879
switches

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.219
see chapter eight for an explanation.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.989
The drive is configured for normally
closed limit switches by default and we

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.989
don't have any switches connected,
thus, these errors.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.139
Now we will set some parameters.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.559
First we’ll set P2-08

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:35.610
to ten.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.769
This will reset the drive to factory
defaults.

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.519
Press the mode once then press next
until P2-00 appears

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.889
press the arrow up key until P2-08

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.299
is selected, press enter.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.579
Then press the arrow up until a value
of ten is displayed.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.859
Press enter to accept.

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.049
See chapter four for additional keypad
help.

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.790
Next we will set the appropriate motor
code.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.150
Because each sure servo drive is capable
of controlling several different motors

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.109
we must tell the drive which motor is
connected.

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.589
We will set P1-31

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.129
to eleven for this two hundred
watt motor.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.109
See chapter five for all of the motor
Codes.

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.849
Now we must cycle power to the drive.

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.400
Warning: To prevent serious injury or
damage to equipment always start any

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.819
new servo setup

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.779
with the motor shaft disconnected from
the load.

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.419
In this quick start video we will bypass
mechanical over travels

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.509
Please disconnect the load for the first
test of the motor

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.520
Always wire an e-stop circuit into the power
feed for the drive.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.780
Always drop the main incoming power
for e-stop conditions

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.740
but remember the control power can remain on.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.730
Now we will set parameter P2-30

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.050
to one.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.999
This temporarily overrides servo enable,
clockwise limit, and counterclockwise

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.199
limits.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.110
This parameter will revert to zero if control
power is cycled.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.659
This feature is purely for testing
purposes.

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.030
You should discreetly wire a Servo enable

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.789
and over travel limit switches if
appropriate for your application.

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.580
If your application doesn't require over
travels you can disable the respective

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.599
inputs or use them for another purpose.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.879
The motor is now enabled.

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.340
To jog the motor go to P4-05:
Jog Operation.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.689
Press Enter.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.119
The Jog speed set point is displayed.

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.870
The default is twenty RPM.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.800
Press enter again to enter the jog
operation mode.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.009
The LED display will show jog.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.300
Press the up arrow or the down arrow to jog the motor

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.719
forward or reverse.

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.610
Press mode to return to the jog speed
selection.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.080
Let’s increase the jog speed upward.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.529
Press enter to select the speed and to
re-enter the jog operation mode.

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.680
Again the arrow keys now allow jogging of
the motor.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.090
Press mode to exit the jog operation.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.240
When you have finished jogging the motor
you should cycle control power to the drive.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.840
This will reset P2-30 re enabling
the Servo enable,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.009
the clockwise limit, and the counter
clockwise limit inputs.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.529
The other changes we've made such as the
motor type and the jog speed will be

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.779
retained.
