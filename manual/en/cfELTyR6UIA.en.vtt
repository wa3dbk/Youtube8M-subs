00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.510
King Ahaz stood before his throne.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.140
The prophet, slightly shabby, with his son
by his side, stared back at him.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
Isaiah made Ahaz feel a little nervous.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
He knew about the Lord’s prophets – the
stories of Elijah and Elisha 100 years ago

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.360
had spread from Israel to the southern kingdom
of Judah.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.399
Ahaz had not followed the Lord – he had
been led away by the customs of the nations

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.640
that surrounded his kingdom.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.149
Indeed his mind flashed back to his own son,
on an altar, his blood pouring down the sides.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.469
And now Isaiah’s son stood before him – was
Isaiah mocking him?

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:03.499
Then Isaiah spoke: ‘The Lord tells you to
ask for proof that what he says will come

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.140
to pass, that you won’t be conquered by
the northern kings.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.329
Ask for something to happen in the world of
the dead or in the heavens above!’

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.000
Ahaz couldn’t answer for a moment.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.380
The Lord was asking him to test him?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.480
‘No,’ Ahaz answered.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.870
‘I will not test the Lord.’

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.159
The Lord’s words thundered back at the king
through Isaiah’s lips.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.460
‘The house of David has already tried my
patience and now you refuse to ask for a sign!

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.579
But the Lord will give you proof.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.520
A virgin is pregnant; she will have a son
and will name him Immanuel.’

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.189
Ahaz’s head spun.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.460
What did all this mean?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.659
How was this going to be a sign that he would
not be attacked from the north?

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.560
Why would you name a child ‘God with us’?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.570
But Isaiah had not finished.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.899
‘The two kings you fear will be destroyed,
but the Lord will make more trouble for you

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.340
and your people than you have ever known.’

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.540
Isaiah swept out of the throne room, his son
close behind him.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.950
Ahaz sat down.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.190
‘A virgin is pregnant … she will name
him Immanuel.’
