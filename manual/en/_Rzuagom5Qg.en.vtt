"Hi food team, this is Sasha from the Netherlands. And I have a question about these dull carrots.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.629
I love cooking with them, but I ran out of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.109
ideas, so can you give me any

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.660
exciting tips to create a new dish with these dull carrots please? Thank you.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.289
Carrots are super cheap, you can get them all year round,

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.259
but I think we've become a bit bored of them because we use them whenever.

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.870
So the key to making them really beautiful, is presenting them in a different way

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.900
making them a showstopper. A really amazing recipe that Jamie does is from his

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.340
"Cook with Jamie" book, sticky sauce pan carrots.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.730
A fun way to have carrots. What you want to do is peel

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.250
800 grams of carrots

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.610
Chop these carrots into chunks around this sort of size.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.520
Put these into a pan,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.260
standing to attention.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
They're all a bit higgledy piggledy, but I think that's quite nice

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Rustic, as Jamie likes it. Salt. Pepper.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.600
A couple of bay leaves

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.439
add a knob of butter.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.700
Next you want to add water,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.829
You just want enough to go half way up the carrots. That will do.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.870
Turn your heat on,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.470
bring it to the boil

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.010
A bit like giant's causeway, all those higgledy piggledy steps.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.770
This has come to the boil so I'm going to turn it down to a simmer with the lid on for 20 minutes.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.360
After 20 minutes of cooking, you want to take the lid off

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.850
and reduce

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.850
all reduce all this liquid down for half an hour and then you'll get this.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.790
So in here, the liquid's all reduced and because there's butter in the water

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.310
it's gone all lovely and made the bottom of the carrots golden.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.350
Looks quite fun doesn't it,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.710
It doesn't matter if some of them are halves

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.710
If you want to surprise someone, this is a great way to do carrots.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.079
So the bay can go on as well, just adds a nice colour to it, but you don't want to eat it.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.029
And then that's it, sticky sauce pan carrots.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.400
They're kind of like, boiled carrots

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.400
but then with a sticky top on

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.069
So if anyone else has any ideas for carrots
