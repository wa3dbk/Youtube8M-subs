even like any are you having been seen

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.560
for years mind sock and sometimes
they're in philly and everybody gets

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.900
there

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.520
as the displeased and with the times and
days there's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.870
daniels has ruled out on what is the
place to be fun

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.750
that anti if you see said there is a
single man who would say their best day

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.280
of their life was the wedding

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.300
you probably that far off now of course
that would

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.479
are there some women who were absolutely
you know orgasmic adult but who are not

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.650
good for us not only

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.570
twelve-person one moving was about
saving lives and say more and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.789
those when they need to find something
better and at that time

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.289
blown to air really about one day is
going to be the best day of your life

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.910
without the day that you take off for
your also honeymoon

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.970
will that be better than like having to
deal with all this

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.670
bullshit have a good day your kids of
board earlier caitlin but that's true

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.639
but that's true

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.719
like that so much more important than

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.250
this rediculous like

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.830
invent that you have to like impress
everyone with yes alone but but i'm

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.690
craig review because the whole
impressing people think

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.950
it really bothers me

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.470
completely so i'm actually with you on
your thank you anyway so now this one

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
was leaving a little bit more disasters
and i was one

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.079
it wasn't for the bungled dying which of
course is shaking abated

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.609
he went outside and had a heart attack
was a related to all this it could be

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.619
what could be out of it also could be
that but you know at ever was in for

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.599
that

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.699
you'd be kind of fun

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.559
availabe in tibet and sweating his
sweater it i'd tell you guys in philly

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.359
and they go to work on each other

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.789
no dysentery

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.149
that that that uh... it and neither one
of the guys that the brother of the

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.379
groom decades whether cops and and and
people want is a police brutality they

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.529
go too far

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.480
they had to call for back up several
times that they could not control

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.010
yourself clinton people in that nearly

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.709
they're out of control and we look at
how we get on the constitution to guide

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.540
the wheelchair et cetera but

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.239
this is a guy in it which is a hundred
guys who were

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.629
uh... drug attack is in south delhi yet
every issue just acrobat eight five

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.399
eight of the fact that it was in south
philly and they're not all the time is

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.459
but nonetheless okay

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.430
and so i think that's what that's why
they have the times

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.909
like if the cops so he would cut it out

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.690
and peace in the middle absolute
categorized cut it out

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.360
allies that's didn't have to use it on
