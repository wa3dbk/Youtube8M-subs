00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
The Gruffalo [by Julia Donaldson]
[Narrated by Haroon]

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.290
A mouse took a stroll
through the deep dark wood.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.800
A fox saw the mouse,
and the mouse looked good.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.900
"Where are you going to,
little brown mouse?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Come and have dinner in my
underground house."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"It's terribly kind of you, Fox, but no -
I'm going to have dinner with a gruffalo."

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:33.240
"A gruffalo? What's a gruffalo?"
"A gruffalo! Why, didn't you know?

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.790
He has [terrible tusks, and] terrible claws,
And terrible teeth in his terrible jaws."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.200
"Where are you meeting him?"

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:56.230
"Here, by these rocks,
And his favourite food is roasted fox."

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.240
"Roasted fox! I'm off!" said the Fox.
"Goodbye, little mouse," and away Fox sped.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.650
"Silly old Fox! Doesn't he know,
There's no such thing as a gruffalo?"

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.800
On went the mouse through
the deep dark wood.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.650
An Owl saw the mouse,
and the mouse looked good.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.020
"Where are you going to,
little brown mouse?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:34.070
Come and have tea in my treetop house."

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.900
"It's frightfully nice of you, Owl, but no -
I'm going to have tea with a gruffalo."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.600
"A gruffalo? What's a gruffalo?"
"A gruffalo! Why, didn't you know?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.780
"He has knobbly knees,
and turned-out toes,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.350
And a poisonous wart
at the end of his nose."

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.900
"Where are you meeting him?"

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.790
"Here, by this stream.
And his favourite food is Owl ice cream."

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.970
"Owl ice cream? Too-whit! Too-whoo!"
"Goodbye, little mouse," and away Owl flew.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.120
"Silly old Owl! Doesn't he know,
There's no such thing as a gruffalo?"

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.910
On went the mouse through
the deep dark wood.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A Snake saw the mouse,
and the mouse looked good.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.700
"Where are you going to, little brown mouse?
Come and have a feast in my log-pile house."

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.340
"It's wonderfully good of you, Snake, but
no - I'm having a feast with a gruffalo."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.930
"A gruffalo? What's a gruffalo?"
"A gruffalo! Why, didn't you know?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.410
His eyes are orange, his tongue is black;
He has purple prickles all over his back."

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.000
"Where are you meeting him?"

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.430
"Here, by this lake.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.430
And his favourite food is ..
Snake cake [scrambled Snake]."

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.580
"Scrambled snake? It's time I hid!"
"Goodbye, little mouse," and away Snake slid.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.060
"Silly old Snake! Doesn't he know,
There's no such thing as a .. Gruffalo ..

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.500
OO ....OH!"
"Help!"

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.840
But who is this creature, with terrible claws
and terrible teeth in his terrible jaw?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.410
He has knobbly knees, 
and turned-out toes,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.800
And a poisonous wart 
at the end of his nose.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.600
His eyes are orange, His tongue is black;
He has purple prickles all over his back.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.900
"Oh help! Oh no!
It's a GRUFFALO!"

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.750
"My favourite food!" the Gruffalo said.
"You'll taste good on a slice of bread!"

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.020
"Good?" said the mouse.
"Don't call me good!

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.300
I'm the scariest creature in this wood.
Just walk behind me and soon you'll see,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.300
Everyone is afraid of me."
(mouse bragging)

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.500
"All right!,"
 said the Gruffalo [bursting with laughter].

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.230
"You walk behind me and i'll follow after."
[Actually, "You go ahead and i'll follow after."]

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.290
"OK",
said the mouse.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.960
They walked and walked till 
the Gruffalo said,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.200
"I hear a hoot in the trees ahead."
[Haroon missed the Snake in the story]

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.820
"It's Owl," said the mouse.
"Why, Owl hello!"

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.460
The Owl took one look at the Gruffalo.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:32.770
"Oh help!" he said, "Goodbye, little mouse!"
And away Owl flew [to his treetop house].

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.700
"You see?" said the mouse. "I told you so."
"Amazing!" said the Gruffalo.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:46.060
They walked some more till the Gruffalo
said, "I hear feet on the path ahead."

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.270
"It's Fox," said the mouse.
"Why, Fox, hello!"

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:01.780
Fox took one look at the Gruffalo.
"Oh help!" he said,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.240
 "Goodbye, little mouse." And away Fox
 sped [to his underground house.]

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.870
"You see?" said the mouse. "I told you so."
"Amazing!" [Astounding!] said the Gruffalo.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.110
"You see? I told you so.
Everyone is afraid of me!

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.540
But now my tummy's beginning to rumble.
My favourite food is - gruffalo crumble!"

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:36.220
"Gruffalo crumble!" the Gruffalo said,
And quick as the wind he turned and fled.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.180
All was quiet in the deep dark wood.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.580
The mouse found a nut 
and the nut was good.
