00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000
RON PAUL: Millions of tax dollars are spent on this type of computer surveillance,  a disgusting procedure for a professed free society.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're overstepping the bounds. Just the other day, they walked into somebody's house. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They suspected he was a drug dealer. He was using his automatic selector, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the police marched in a said, "It looked like a gun," after they killed the man.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 In America! Is that what America's all about? I'd say no! We want privacy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
More individual liberty, get the government off our backs, a more sensible foreign policy. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I am very disappointed that so far in this Congress we have not yet seen any sincere effort to cut any spending.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There is something wrong here that could and should be adjusted with decreased spending, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
not raising taxes and not further robbing the Social Security trust fund.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The more we threaten, the more we intimidate, the more we want to bomb people,  the more we lead to another fiasco with Vietnam. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We trade with Vietnam now. That’s a much better way than trying to impose our will on Vietnam by going over there and dropping bombs,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so I would say that just again points out that we have a very, very, very poor foreign policy in the middle east.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I wish the Congress would address the unconstitutionality of President's waging war, 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that to me is a lot more serious than Monica Lewinsky, let me tell you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(EXASPERATED) The corporations are in bed with the Government!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The goal of peace and harmony can never be achieved by bombs and intimidation. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Mr. Speaker, over the last three to four years, I have come to the floor on numerous occasions, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
trying to sound a warning about both our foreign policy and our monetary policy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The cause is the Federal Reserve. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The problem is that the Federal Reserve has been granted authority that is unconstitutional to go and counterfeit money,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and until we recognize that and deal with that, we will continue to have financial problems.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The Federal Reserve credit created during the last eight months has NOT stimulated economic growth in technology or the industrial sector,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but a lot of it ended up in the expanding real-estate bubble.  

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
This, too, will burst as all bubbles do. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Over the next decade, the American people will become poorer and less free.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I do not see any reason whatsoever to take young men and young woman and send them 6000 miles off

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to a land to attack a country (Iraq), that has not committed any aggression towards our country. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
War is not popular. People get killed, and body bags end up coming back.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I don’t want anybody’s head shot off. For some reason nowadays, wars are not justified and are undeclared.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I think this has to be the litmus test of everybody in this country, everybody around over on the Hill (D.C.) too…

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 If the war’s worth fighting, are you willing to go in with your lives, send your kids and grandkids to war?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Will our country become freer, richer, safer, and more peaceful,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 or will we continue to suffer from lost civil liberties, a stagnant economy, terrorist threats, and an expanding war in the Middle East and central Asia? 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Is it not possible that Washington’s admonition to avoid entangling alliances is sound advice even today?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Both candidates (Kerry and Bush) supported the Iraq War and the continuation of it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Both supported the Patriot Act and its controversial attack on personal privacy.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We ought to repeal the Patriot Act! That’s what we ought to do!

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Both candidates supported increased spending in almost all categories.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I’m the most conservative member here. I have voted against more waste and spending than anybody else. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Freedom, Prosperity, and Peace! 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Just come home. We just marched in and we can just come home!

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We have allowed our nation to be over-taxed and over-regulated and over-run by bureaucrats! 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The Founders would be ashamed of us for what we are putting up with! 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
A system designed to protect individual liberty will have no punishments for any group and no privileges. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Today, I think inner-city folks and minorities are punished unfairly in the war on drugs.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I think this is not a consequence of free markets. What's happening is, there's transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:35.000
This comes about because of the monetary system that we have. When you inflate a currency or destroy a currency, the middle class gets wiped out. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So the people who get to use the money first, which is created by the Federal Reserve system, benefit. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So the money gravitates to the banks and to Wall Street. That's why you have more billionaires than ever before. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Today, this country is in the middle of a recession for a lot of people...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Michigan knows about it. Poor people know about it. The middle class knows about it. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Wall Street doesn’t know about it. Washington, D.C., doesn’t know about it. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But it’s because of the monetary system and the excessive spending. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
As long as we live beyond our means we are destined to live beneath our means.”

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And we have lived beyond our means because we are financing a foreign policy that is so extravagant 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and beyond what we can control, as well as the spending here at home. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And we're depending on the creation of money out of thin air, which is nothing more than debasement of the currency. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's counterfeit. And it is a natural, predictable consequence that you're going to have people benefit from it and other people suffer.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So, if you want a healthy economy, you have to study monetary theory and figure out why it is that we're suffering. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And everybody doesn't suffer equally, or this wouldn't be so bad.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It's always the poor people -- those who are on retired incomes -- that suffer the most. 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But the politicians and those who get to use the money first, like the military industrial complex, they make a lot of money and they benefit from it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It is our job to check up and find what the Federal Reserve has done, audit them, and find out who their buddies are that they’re taking care of!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It’s TRILLIONS of dollars we’re spending on these wars!!!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:18.000
(CROWD CHANTS "PRESIDENT PAUL!" "PRESIDENT PAUL!")
