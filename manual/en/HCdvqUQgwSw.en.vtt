00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.200
0:00:07.100,0:00:10.879
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
today I want to show you

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.990
0:00:10.879,0:00:12.929
how to weave

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.500
0:00:12.929,0:00:16.279
ultra suede faux leather bead cord

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.550
0:00:16.279,0:00:18.300
through chain

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.880
0:00:18.300,0:00:20.220
and what it's going to do

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.029
0:00:20.220,0:00:21.590
is give you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.329
0:00:21.590,0:00:24.369
this really interesting

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.340
0:00:24.369,0:00:26.199
solid woven

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.080
0:00:26.199,0:00:27.679
piece.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.810
0:00:27.679,0:00:31.140
This is what it looks like when you use a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.810
round a rolo chain

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530
0:00:31.140,0:00:34.370
like this.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.170
0:00:34.370,0:00:35.970
The base here

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.440
0:00:35.970,0:00:38.760
this is what it looked like when I use

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
this

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
0:00:38.760,0:00:40.560
flat link oval

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.519
0:00:40.560,0:00:42.630
cable chain.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.380
0:00:42.630,0:00:48.430
So you can play around with a different

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.050
types of chain that you use

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.920
0:00:48.430,0:00:50.670
and the different color combinations to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.920
make it look

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.000
0:00:50.670,0:00:54.680
different but it gives you a really

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
interesting

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.059
0:00:54.680,0:00:56.270
kind of

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.280
0:00:56.270,0:00:59.350
piece to work in your jewelry

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280
making.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.769
0:00:59.350,0:01:02.720
bees you can see in in this one I've got

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.219
0:01:02.720,0:01:04.060
the links

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.480
0:01:04.060,0:01:06.370
extending pass the ends

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.260
0:01:06.370,0:01:11.050
and in this one I'm just using the woven

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.700
piece.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.050
0:01:11.050,0:01:12.599
You just want to make sure

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.190
0:01:12.599,0:01:14.050
when you're going

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.861
0:01:14.050,0:01:15.840
to choose your chain

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:16.461
0:01:15.840,0:01:17.500
that your chain

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.460
0:01:18.720,0:01:20.400
got links

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.460
0:01:20.400,0:01:23.560
with holes large enough to accommodate

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.300
0:01:23.560,0:01:24.800
the cord.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.140
0:01:24.800,0:01:26.730
So it's three millimeters wide

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.900
0:01:26.730,0:01:30.800
so you wanna make sure that you have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.170
room for that and take into account

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.750
0:01:30.800,0:01:33.180
the space that the other links take up

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.310
0:01:33.180,0:01:35.050
in there too.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.320
0:01:35.050,0:01:36.939
Another thing to consider is

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.340
0:01:36.939,0:01:38.660
how tight it's gonna fit.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670
0:01:38.660,0:01:44.250
This one has plenty of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.430
room and its a little bit looser

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.320
0:01:44.250,0:01:46.080
this one is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.750
0:01:46.080,0:01:47.180
a tight fit

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.420
0:01:47.180,0:01:50.470
and it gives you a really stable sturdy

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.420
thick

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.720
0:01:50.470,0:01:54.220
piece that will actually kind of keep the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720
shape.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.710
0:01:54.220,0:01:56.020
You can play around with it and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.430
0:01:56.020,0:01:59.540
see what you like.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.820
0:01:59.540,0:02:02.110
I'm going to show you how to do it on

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.670
0:02:02.110,0:02:09.110
flat link oval chain here.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.410
0:02:09.549,0:02:12.629
What I did was just start with a

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.080
0:02:12.629,0:02:14.599
piece of the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.500
0:02:14.599,0:02:15.949
faux leather cord

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.570
0:02:15.949,0:02:19.699
much longer than what I thought I would

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.570
need

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.610
0:02:19.699,0:02:22.659
so that I wouldn't run out.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.520
0:02:22.659,0:02:23.760
And then determine

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.030
0:02:23.760,0:02:25.530
how you want to use it,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.470
0:02:25.530,0:02:32.150
how long your pieces of chain will be

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.130
and how many you want for how wide.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.090
0:02:32.150,0:02:34.279
Then just

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.130
0:02:34.279,0:02:39.180
you're going to start by going through

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.520
0:02:39.180,0:02:43.779
the top link or if you want it just in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.890
the middle then you'll go through the link

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.410
0:02:43.779,0:02:50.099
where you wanna start.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.750
0:02:50.099,0:02:53.479
On this one

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.180
0:02:53.479,0:02:55.939
I had these long pieces of chain here

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.130
0:02:55.939,0:02:59.469
and I went through one where I wanted it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.130
to be on this one.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.130
0:02:59.469,0:03:02.340
I went through the top of all them except

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.130
I
did have

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.640
0:03:02.340,0:03:04.119
a couple of

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640
0:03:04.119,0:03:05.089
links

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.440
0:03:05.089,0:03:09.439
extending on the middle piece to use

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.900
for it to connect to.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.710
0:03:09.439,0:03:10.829
So just make sure that your

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.710
0:03:10.829,0:03:13.189
going through the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.990
0:03:13.189,0:03:19.469
link that you want to be when you start

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.260
0:03:19.469,0:03:21.499
and pull it down

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.330
0:03:21.499,0:03:22.629
to the end.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.430
0:03:22.629,0:03:27.289
You want to leave the tail so it doesn't fly

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.520
off
the end and you want to weave it

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.540
0:03:27.289,0:03:30.779
back in at the end.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.550
0:03:30.779,0:03:33.639
So once you go through go ahead and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.570
0:03:33.639,0:03:35.199
flip your piece around

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.530
0:03:35.199,0:03:39.729
and when you're weaving make sure

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.530
that you grab

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.980
0:03:39.729,0:03:41.349
the cord and you

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.120
0:03:41.349,0:03:44.629
pull it through with your fingers all the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
way to
the end

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.310
0:03:44.629,0:03:46.949
so that you know it's not twisted.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.870
0:03:46.949,0:03:50.650
Depending on how much room you have if it's

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.520
twisted you might have to pull it out

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.570
0:03:50.650,0:03:52.690
and put it back in again

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.090
0:03:52.690,0:03:56.189
because you might not be able to get it to

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.950
spin around very well.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.280
0:03:56.189,0:03:59.919
The next part is very important

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.620
because when you're going through

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.489
0:03:59.919,0:04:02.789
your chain links you want to make sure

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.730
that you're going through all in

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.730
0:04:02.789,0:04:04.279
the same direction

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.349
0:04:04.279,0:04:05.929
so they we'll stagger

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.880
0:04:05.929,0:04:09.039
forty five degrees pointed left

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.000
poined right pointed left pointed

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.819
0:04:09.039,0:04:12.859
right but they all need to go in the

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.290
same direction.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.290
It's easier to see

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.290
0:04:12.859,0:04:13.879
on this one

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.290
0:04:13.879,0:04:15.230
the way that they

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.132
0:04:15.230,0:04:21.619
all point that way and then they all

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.650
point that way.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.009
0:04:21.619,0:04:22.590
If your

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.569
0:04:22.590,0:04:26.190
chain has more room you might be able to

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.190
get your cord through more than one at

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.190
0:04:26.190,0:04:27.259
a time.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.979
0:04:27.259,0:04:31.370
If it's a little bit more snug you might

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:29.979
need to pull

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.569
0:04:31.370,0:04:32.530
through

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.460
0:04:32.530,0:04:34.169
one link at a time

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.970
0:04:34.169,0:04:37.099
and you can pull through a few inches

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.020
0:04:37.099,0:04:40.150
and keep working.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.789
0:04:40.150,0:04:42.160
Just make sure that there are

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.199
0:04:42.160,0:04:49.160
going through and facing the same way.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:57.860
0:04:56.849,0:04:58.879
Once you go through

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.759
0:04:58.879,0:05:02.449
the last link

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.979
0:05:02.449,0:05:05.659
grab the links firmly so that

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.449
0:05:05.659,0:05:07.899
they stay together when you pull

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.849
0:05:07.899,0:05:13.360
your cord through.

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.210
0:05:13.360,0:05:15.539
You can

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.259
0:05:15.539,0:05:17.210
pull it really tight

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.949
0:05:17.210,0:05:19.929
to condense the links down.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:19.949
They'll lay flat

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.430
0:05:19.929,0:05:22.360
and so they'll condense really close

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.430
together

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.319
0:05:22.360,0:05:26.810
like I did with these with this one I

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.759
did leave a little bit of room so that it

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.900
0:05:26.810,0:05:30.649
wasn't totally squished in as

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.220
small as it could be.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.460
0:05:30.649,0:05:34.159
So you can decide that too on

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.460
how

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.089
0:05:34.159,0:05:37.819
close you want your chains to lay

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.089
together

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.370
0:05:37.819,0:05:40.969
You're going to flip it over

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.410
0:05:40.969,0:05:45.939
and go back through the other way

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.569
0:05:45.939,0:05:47.789
you can see that

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.229
0:05:47.789,0:05:48.999
this time

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.340
0:05:48.999,0:05:51.949
the links are laying the other way.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.180
0:05:51.949,0:05:55.479
This one is going to the left and

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.779
this one they're going to go to the right.

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.720
0:05:55.479,0:05:58.889
Again just go

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:06.630
0:05:58.889,0:06:05.889
all the way through.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.270
0:06:10.419,0:06:13.270
And make sure as you're going through your

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.270
links that you

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.940
0:06:13.270,0:06:15.749
pull the rest of the chain down so that

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.430
0:06:15.749,0:06:16.750
the next link

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.199
0:06:16.750,0:06:19.340
sits below you

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.800
0:06:19.340,0:06:21.639
cood there.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:27.909
0:06:21.639,0:06:28.639
That will help it lay flat when it's all done.

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.310
0:06:30.139,0:06:34.479
On this kind of chain where your

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.699
holes are oval

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:37.389
0:06:34.479,0:06:37.639
I have the cord laying flat

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.349
0:06:37.639,0:06:39.719
along the length of the chain.

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.610
0:06:39.719,0:06:43.749
You can also see that on the rolo chain

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.289
where the links are round

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.169
0:06:43.749,0:06:46.340
and there is less room

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.229
0:06:46.340,0:06:47.549
along the length

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.229
0:06:47.549,0:06:48.889
I have the

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.330
0:06:48.889,0:06:49.819
suede

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.330
0:06:49.819,0:06:51.099
going through

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.349
0:06:51.099,0:06:53.100
vertically through that hole

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.439
0:06:53.100,0:06:58.229
so it gives it a different look that way too.

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:58.779
0:06:58.229,0:06:59.509
So you can see

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.379
0:06:59.509,0:07:00.809
you're starting to get

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.379
0:07:00.809,0:07:03.319
that woven

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:05.470
0:07:03.319,0:07:08.019
look and all you would do is keep flipping

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.610
it over and working it back and forth

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.779
0:07:08.019,0:07:10.080
through the links in the chain.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.659
0:07:10.080,0:07:14.329
Then all I did to finish this off

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:13.169
was I flipped it to the back

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.080
0:07:14.329,0:07:15.849
and I

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.039
0:07:15.849,0:07:19.339
skipped the first link

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.059
0:07:19.339,0:07:24.509
took my cord through the next link

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:26.499
0:07:24.509,0:07:28.759
and I pulled it down and added just a

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:28.969
dab of E6000 glue here and

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:29.969
0:07:28.759,0:07:29.710
tightened it.

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.479
0:07:29.710,0:07:32.849
I did a couple more links in the

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:32.479
same way.

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.610
0:07:32.849,0:07:34.919
You can see that it does double back

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.319
0:07:34.919,0:07:36.789
about half way.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.419
0:07:36.789,0:07:41.399
It's glue down nice and tight.

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:39.749
It's
not going anywhere.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:41.830
0:07:41.399,0:07:42.669
We can

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.870
0:07:42.669,0:07:46.599
use these woven pieces for

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.710
0:07:46.599,0:07:48.339
anything you can imagine

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.169
0:07:48.339,0:07:50.169
It's very versatile

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.809
0:07:50.169,0:07:50.699
and that's how you do it.

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:51.809
