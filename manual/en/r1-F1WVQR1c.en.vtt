00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.810
Now I'm going to show you how to turn on the
high speed zoom. By default, when you get

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.460
your XH A1 out of the box, this is not on,
and you may feel like your manual zoom up

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.200
on your lens here is not quite fast enough.
Let me just show you. It takes me almost an

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.890
entire half turn to zoom all the way in which
is kind of awkward with your hand. If you

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.810
want to go really far it's only really comfortable
to zoom like this. But I want to go all the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.850
way out and it's just kind of awkward to go
all the way out like that. So, let me show

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.450
you how to put on the high speed zoom which
takes care of that problem. What we'll do,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:45.120
is we'll go into our menu and then we want
to scroll down all the way to 'customize'.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.470
From here, we want to go to the custom function.
This is where you can set a whole bunch, twenty

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.379
to be exact, custom functions, and one of
these is high speed zoom. If we click on one

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.530
and then we want to go to 'Tune' which is
the very next option there at the bottom.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.530
From here we want to go over to the number
two, and this is where the high speed zoom

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.560
is. If I select that and I'll go down here
and I just scroll down to turn it on. Now

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.150
our high speed zoom is on and I'll click out,
I'll just scroll to return back here, and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.580
then I'll scroll over to apply this set and
make it active on my camera. I hit the return

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.920
key, return again back in our menu, I hit
menu to close. Now our high speed zoom is

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.439
on, and let's take a look at what that looks
like. I hope you can see it's a lot faster,

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.290
and on getting all the way zoomed in only
on a quarter turn of my manual zoom wheel

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.770
here. That's a pretty cool effect. I like
to have this handy to turn on if I plan on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.549
doing some crazy zooming. That's how you turn
on that high speed zoom on your Canon XH A1.
