00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:06.170
In this clip, we're going to be talking about
how to get a sweet, airy kind of sound out

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.650
of the Hammond. The Hammond can express such
a range of emotions, and it's great when it

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.679
gets just that sweet sound. I don't know any
other way to describe it, except sweet and

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:26.679
airy. Before, we used the really low draw
bars for the growly stuff. And then we also

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.750
have the upper and kind of the mids. We're
not going to use the upper so much because

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:39.601
they're just too high. It sounds like someone
going insane. Nobody wants to hear that. So,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:46.760
the way to get the syrupy sweet sounds is--I
like to use the three white draw bars in the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.850
middle. And maybe just--and you can pick which
one you want. A single draw bar by itself,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.239
if it can cut through, it sounds so nice.
So, you know, you can get a...you know, and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:16.530
you can just get a little--you can bring in
like--you want to get it a little lower or

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.490
a little bit higher. And it's great to play
with these things in the middle of the song.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.790
Like I said before, maybe this is your full-on
chorus sound. You're doing...and then by the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.201
time it moves back to a bridge or some kind
of break in between there, you just want to

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:51.700
make it really kind of really even more airy.
And you can hear the draw bars going in and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.250
out a little bit more here, but when you're
in the context of a band and everybody's playing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.011
along, you're not going to be able to hear
that. All of a sudden, you're just going to

00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.000
be able to hear it get a little bit sweeter.
