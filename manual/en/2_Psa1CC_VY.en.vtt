00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:08.624
&gt;&gt; Hello, this is Sandra of
the Disney Cars toy channel and

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:13.877
today we will be playing with this awesome
Hot Wheels Color Blaster play set.

00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:18.444
Inwith this play set we will be playing
with some of my most favorite toys of all

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:20.570
time, Disney Color Changer Cars.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.520
This Hot Wheels color
shifter set is awesome

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.300
because it comes with seven
different color changing cars.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
And it's probably one of the biggest
color shifter set I've ever seen.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.580
This color blaster set is super easy to
use, you just need hot and cold water.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.030
So let's open this thing up and
start playing.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:42.780
Ta-da, here it is and
it was super easy to assemble.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.810
This set has a lot of fun moving parts so
let me show you.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.780
There's a little lever to make
the car go backwards down the ramp.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.840
But if you lift the lever
the other direction,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.760
it slides down to this turntable.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.110
And this is a special color shifting
area where you can spray the car, whoa,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.910
and look it's changing colors.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.700
There's even a splash guard.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.919
So the water doesn't
get all over the place.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:10.583
[MUSIC]

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:14.584
When you're all done with your color
shift, just rotate the turn table

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:18.795
to line up with the road, lift the lever,
and have the car go down the ramp.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:24.083
[MUSIC]

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:29.876
[SOUND] Our car started as blue.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.167
And when we sprayed it with the icy
cold water, it changed purple.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:37.417
Now, if we want it to get back to blue,
we just dip it in this cup of warm water.

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:39.160
Ta-da, let's dip again.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.320
We can get rid of the purple.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.410
And now, look.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.890
It's its original color.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.040
The color changing feature is amazing.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.490
Check out this Disney car.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.860
This is Dinoco Tex, the owner of Dinoco
and he changes from gold to brown.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.330
Let's get his backside and
whoa and it changes so fast.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.510
I love these color shifters cuz you never
know what color's going to change and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.210
how about this one.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.670
It's light green to, oh cool, like a nice,
army green color, pretty dark.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.740
That's really awesome.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.320
And check how in slow mo, it literally
looks like we're painting the car,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.625
like it's got paint poured on it,
but it's just a shift in the color.

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:21.168
[MUSIC]

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:25.750
Now let's have this one race away so
we can do some more color changes.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.250
[SOUND] Here's Mater.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.625
He changes from blue to just
a slightly darker green.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:39.125
It's a pretty weak color change, but hey,
it's Mater, we gotta love him still.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.040
But this Ramone has
an awesome color change.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.480
Look, he goes from yellow to a bright red.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.090
You know what?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.070
I think he has such a good color change
because he owns his own paint shop.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.580
He's gotta have a good color change.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.310
Now, let's check out another
Hot Wheels Color Shifter.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.530
And this one's a bee car.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.792
It has a small color change on the sides,
from blue to purple.

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:03.458
[MUSIC]

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:09.290
[NOISE] Let's see some more here's
a gray Daryl Cartrip works for

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.917
the racing sports network and
he changes from gray to purple.

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.120
This is a really strong color change.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.838
Let's get his backside here and
voila, what a great new paint job.

00:03:22.838 --> 00:03:26.660
Oh, and now let's get back to
another Hot Wheels color changer and

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.090
what color will it change to?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.770
Oh, look, it's going from white to orange.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.820
That looks fabulous.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.770
One of my favorite things about these
color changers is it's a great way for

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.870
toddlers to learn their colors
cuz you can see the color change

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.350
right in front of your eyes
like this Lightning McQueen

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.080
changing from a yellow
to a really dark brown.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.630
Here's another Hot Wheel.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.995
This one almost looks
like a sporty mini van.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:52.810
[LAUGH].

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.690
Anyway, it goes from a lime green
to a nice, solid green color.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.920
And just check out the color change.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.270
It just works so fast and
it is so fun to watch.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.480
Let's change some of the Hot Wheels
back to their original color.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.310
So the orange one that we sprayed earlier.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.010
We're going to dip it into some nice,
warm water to get it back to white.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.590
Ooh, and check out this color change a car
reminds me of the LIghtning McQueen color

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.450
changer.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.792
This one, though, goes from green
to the very dark brown color.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:33.083
[MUSIC]

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.737
[SOUND] Now let's change our dark
green car back to the lime green, and

00:04:36.737 --> 00:04:39.333
check out the windows too,
they're green too.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.325
A heavy green theme here.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:44.865
And what color will this one be?

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:47.965
Holy cow,
I wasn't expecting it to be a dark blue.

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:49.917
This is a really pretty color.

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:59.583
[MUSIC]

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:05.792
[SOUND] And here are all the cars
after their color change.

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:10.850
