00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight featuring Blitzcrank, the Great Steam Golem

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.500
Blitzcrank is a mix between a pure tank, a melee fighter, and a burst mage, depending on what your team needs.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.000
Overall, he excels at disruption and literally grabbing free kills for your team!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Blitzcrank’s passive is Mana Barrier. When Blitzcrank gets low on health, he gains a temporary shield based off his current mana.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.000
Blitzcrank does not lose any mana in the process, but if you happen to be empty when it activates, you won’t get much of a shield.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Rocket Grab sends out a skill-shot nuke which damages and stuns the first enemy it hits. Immediately after hitting, it pulls the enemy to you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Overdrive gives Blitzcrank bonus movement and attack speed for a few seconds.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Power Fist causes Blitzcrank’s next basic attack to deal bonus damage and knock the target into the air.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Using this ability will reset your attack timer, so using it immediately after landing an attack will give you more damage output.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Static Field is Blitzcrank’s ultimate. Passively, it deals damage to a random nearby enemy every few seconds.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.500
On activation, Blitzcrank damages and silences all nearby enemies, but deactivates the passive until it cools down.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.000
At the start of the game, always check to see if you want to push.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.500
Check the scoreboard to see if they have a jungler and use Clairvoyance to see where he’s starting.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.500
One great Clairvoyance spot is right here. It lets you see champions setting up for the golem, wolves, or the brush to the right.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.000
Spotting Akali I walk up and pull her into my team with Rocket Grab, picking up first blood.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
At level 2 try to play aggressively in lane. I don’t want to Rocket Grab right away because I need Alistar’s attacks for damage output.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.500
Instead I walk up for Power Fist, and then Rocket Grab after.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.000
I actually used Rocket Grab too soon because we don’t kill him until after we all Flash. But we still pick up the kill thanks to teamwork and good ability use.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.500
Warding the brush in your lane can be extremely powerful.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Here Teemo ducks in for what he thinks will be a safe place to harass, but now that I know where he is, I land a Rocket Grab.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.500
I knock him up with Power Fist and chase with Overdrive once he flashes away.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Because Overdrive lasts much longer than Move Quick, I know I can keep up a continued chase and land another Power Fist to pick up the kill.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.000
Be patient when using Rocket Grab. I see a fight in mid and chase with Overdrive.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I prepare to grab an opponent with Rocket Grab, but I’m not sure I’m in range.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.500
Because of my extra movement speed, Brand is afraid to take a turn straight down.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.500
He heads to the back side of the turret, which means he has no room to juke.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.500
This is the perfect opportunity to use Rocket Grab. I hit him, immediately land Power Fist, and on the way down activate Static Field.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.500
He basically has no chance to react and goes from full HP to death.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.500
In bottom lane we push down a turret and start chasing Akali toward her base.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000
I Flash to ensure I land Rocket Grab which keeps her out of Twilight Shroud.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Static Field and Power Fist keep her from retreating while Alistar knocks her around.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.500
I run from Nocturne because I know he can kill me, but when he turns to Alistar I turn back to disrupt his chase.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.000
Because of my cooldown reduction though runes, masteries, and items, I’m able to knock up Nocturne twice, letting Alistar live with just a sliver of health.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I want to reiterate that holding onto Rocket Grab is valuable.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.500
We try to catch Pantheon right at level 1 for an early First Blood, so I Flash in to take him down.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500
Look how he Flashes before I even finish casting Rocket Grab.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500
If I had just waited a half second, I could have grabbed him after the Flash and picked up the kill.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.000
We can see in a later fight that this tactic really works well against this Pantheon player.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.500
Right as I reach max range, he keeps walking back and forth hoping to juke me.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Instead, I just walk farther and farther forward, landing the Rocket Grab even despite his Flash.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I see Pantheon and Wukong present themselves, so I grab one in and unload, forcing him out of the fight.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.500
I make the mistake of trying to chase him, which gets me caught by everyone else.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.000
I knock up Master Yi and keep running, but as soon as Shen lands Shadow Dash, I know I can get the kill, so I Rocket Grab into Power Fist, taking him down.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
As Kennen chases me, I try to catch him around the corner with Power Fist, but my team picks up the kill anyway.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.500
Disruption is huge on Blitzcrank.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.500
I get into a teamfight late, but my position allows me to Rocket Grab Pantheon away from the battle, locking him up for about half of it.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.000
I run in and pop Static Field because it will hit literally every member on the enemy team. Sure enough, we clean up three kills in a row.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.500
In another teamfight, I go for a Rocket Grab while standing on one of Teemo’s mushrooms.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.500
I probably could have gone for Pantheon, so it was a mistake to grab Galio. Thankfully he does waste his ultimate, so the fight continues.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.000
Immediately I head over to their most important target, Pantheon.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I interrupt Heartseeker Strike with Power Fist and lock him up with another Power Fist into Rocket Grab.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.500
Note that I don’t activate Static Field. If you’re only fighting a single target, you do more damage by letting it passively hurt targets for you.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.000
Only activate it if you need a burst of damage at the end.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
For runes I take armor penetration marks, flat armor seals, flat cooldown reduction glyphs, and armor penetration quintessences.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.500
This setup allows me to deal tons of damage with Power Fist and Sheen, survive some harassment in lane, and general utility with cooldown reduction.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.500
My masteries are 0/9/21, taking pretty standard masteries, specifically improving Clairvoyance and Flash.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.500
I take one point in Rocket Grab at level 1 and leave it there until level 14.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.000
My first priority is to max Power Fist with a point in Overdrive by level 3.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.500
Lowering the cooldown on Power Fist to use it multiple times per fight is extremely important.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.000
Maxing Overdrive second allows me to more easily chase down my enemies.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
For items, I open with a Sapphire Crystal and two Health Potions.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.500
Ionian Boots of Lucidity and Sheen are pretty much guaranteed buys right after.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.500
Depending on how the game is going, I’ll add more offense with Trinity Force, magic defense with Banshee’s Veil, or physical defense with Randuin’s Omen.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.000
Finally, I end up grabbing more damage output with Infinity Edge and Bloodthirster.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Thanks for tuning into the Blitzcrank Champion Spotlight.
