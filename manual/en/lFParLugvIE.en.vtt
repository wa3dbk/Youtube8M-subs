Hi my name is John Armstrong with expertvillage.com
I'm a professional guitar instructor and today

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:11.799
we are going to be discussing beginning classical
guitar. With this next exercise I like to

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.559
discuss a little bit about some more right
hand techniques stuff. We are going to work

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:21.750
a little bit more arpeggios as we can of discuss
a little bit in the Spanish study I have some

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.220
studies for the right hand some taken from
Mauro Giuliani 120 Studies for the right hand.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.920
I'm just going to give you a few of these
to get you started. Exercise number one basically

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.480
all these exercises deal with the use for
the C chord, and the G7 chord. In exercise

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.180
number one that I have here it just deals
with the chording technique we are using the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:01:08.710
P,I, and M fingers. Just with a moving base
line with our thumb there. Repeated. Then

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.200
with a big C chord. Exercise number two this
is were we start to get a actual arpeggio

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.909
technique. Here I'm using the P, I and M fingers.
On the C chord I will be planting, planting

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.280
those fingers, applying them downward pressure
into the strings, releasing that pressure

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:49.920
as I play the arpeggio. Here is a example
exercise number two.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
Exercise number three is a example of the
a D sending arpeggio now here we can't plant

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.340
all three fingers but what we would like to
try to do is try to plant the P and the M

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.659
fingers. Okay so the P and M. here we go.
