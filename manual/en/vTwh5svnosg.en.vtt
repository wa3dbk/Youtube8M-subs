00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.410
Okay folks in this clip we're going to learn
how to draw ninja clothes. And learning how

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.440
to draw ninja clothes... half of it is in
the actual pose itself. Best thing to keep

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.200
in mind when you're coming in to draw a ninja...
alright so first off, the pose. We're going

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.960
to draw a rough outline first of the ninja
that we have here. And he's going to be holding

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:37.960
a sword aloft in a attack position or more
like a posed position. He's not necessarily

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.360
attacking somebody in this picture he's picture.
He's going to be preparing to intimidate I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.290
suppose would be the best way to put it. One
thing... ninjas are generally covered from

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:58.280
head to toe and are generally also wearing
all black. One good thing to keep in mind

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.700
when you are drawing your ninja... Lot of
times we might even be wearing gloves. For

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.450
the sake of this, I'm not going to have him
wearing gloves 'cause I want to be able to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.609
show some parts of skin here. Right here I'm
drawing the hilt of the sword and the handle

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:23.330
coming down just like that. And the sword
would probably come out to about there. I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.390
would say the sword is very much a part of
the outfit as well. Now, the reason I drew

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.670
just kind of a hooded shape here is 'cause
I want to draw essentially a... just nothing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.909
more than a tiny little hole for his face
to peak out of 'cause his face is completely

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.560
covered in a mask that you know ninjas typically
wear. You can come down and add some detail

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.509
to the mask if you want, but there's really
just a tiny little space for his eyes to be

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.880
able to see and his nose obviously which we'll
draw right in here. I want the black part

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.779
of his eyes to kind of show where it is. But
you see the rest of his face is completely

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:13.780
covered in the hood. And when you come in
to draw the rest of him, what you'll eventually

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.910
do obviously is fill in all this with a black
marker of some kind, but for now, we're just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.400
drawing the outline of the pose. And he's
obviously going to be standing in an attack

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:38.500
position in his all, you know, complete ninja
garb. Not an inch of flesh is showing beyond

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.340
his face. You got his boot down here. Now
you can feel free to add as much detail as

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.320
you like. I mean obviously if you're drawing
an authentic ninja, there's not going to be

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.460
a whole lot of color on him because ninjas
are supposed to be relatively silent and invisible.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.620
So, there's not a whole lot of color or detail.
But this... capturing the pose is really the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.320
most important thing to do and the most important
step by far when you're learning how to draw

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.070
clothes for a ninja. And so once you basically...
once you have that down, you've pretty much

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.430
got it.
