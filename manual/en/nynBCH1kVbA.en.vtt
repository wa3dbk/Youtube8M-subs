Hello. My name is John Traversy and I am the CRTCâ€™s Executive Director of Telecommunications

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.500
As you know, new technologies are making it easier than ever to keep in touch with family and friends

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.500
and to keep up-to-date on developments around the world.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.500
Unfortunately, not all Canadians have access to the same level of services.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.500
Our role in overseeing the telecommunications industry has led us to launch a consultation 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.500
on the telecommunications services that are offered to Canadians and, in particular,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500
Canadians living in rural and remote areas.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
We are looking at whether the obligation of telephone companies to provide certain

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.500
services should be changed in light of new technologies.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.500
This is your chance to make your views known to us. The e-Consultation will run for four weeks.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.500
We will also hold a public hearing in October 2010.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500
Thank you for your time and participation.
