Good morning everyone this is Jonathan
Kurtz here at the National Weather

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.200
Service in

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.640
Oklahoma with a winter weather
briefing regarding chances for

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.990
light freezing drizzle

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.340
and freezing rain beginning sunday and
continuing through Monday morning

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.519
as you wake up Sunday morning it will be

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.430
quite chilly across the region feeling more
like winter as a cold front moves

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.779
southward across the area tonight
through tomorrow morning as moisture

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.859
continues to increase across the area
through the day on Sunday

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.900
the chance for light freezing drizzle
will increase

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.410
through the afternoon hours along with
light rain across texoma and western north

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.079
Texas

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.629
I really want to stress that this will
be really light precipitation expected

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.000
for Sunday afternoon across the area.
Really the chances for freezing rain

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.090
will begin to increase as we head
through Sunday night in the early Monday

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.590
morning

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.539
the chance for light freezing rain will
exist from near the Oklahoma City Metro

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.949
across portions Southwestern Oklahoma
and western north Texas.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.379
our best chance for freezing rain will
exist across south-central and

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.600
southeastern Oklahoma

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.160
and this is where a winter storm
watch is in effect for those areas for

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.489
sunday through monday morning

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.990
for freezing rain. Okay here's our
current thoughts

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.290
on ice accumulations sunday night through early
Monday morning the greatest

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.260
concentrations of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.549
any freezing rain accumulations will be south of the oklahoma City Metro

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.729
primarily along and East of I-35 and South of

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.810
interstate 40 with higher accumulations concentrated across south-central and southeast Oklahoma

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.659
where we have about a quarter

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.460
to .35 inches of ice possible. This will
definitely impact

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.100
Monday morning commuters, and we really stress
you stay tuned to the weather through

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.110
the rest the weekend

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.950
make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to work

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.680
makes you check the weather before you
travel. And this concludes the winter

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.130
weather briefing from the National
Weather Service here in Norman

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.720
