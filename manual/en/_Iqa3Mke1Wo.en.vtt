00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.480
Hi we are Dan and Judy on behalf of Expert
Village in this segment we are going to talk

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.400
about the next car seat the convertible car
seat. Right now we are going to show you after

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.859
your baby has exceeded the weight from between
30-35 pounds now it is time to turn your baby

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.990
forward facing. Now all the parents have been
waiting to do this. So the way this baby the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.340
rules are going to be different forward facing
then when we where rear facing. When your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.520
child is forward facing there hardness needs
to be coming from above there shoulders similar

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.760
from our belts comes above our shoulders cause
we are also forward facing in the vehicle.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.110
Like in the pass segment it is very important
that when you are going to adjust the hardness

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.400
you push in here and you can loosen it okay
and then you would take the baby, there child

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.339
out, pressing the red button to take the baby
out and then you would take the child out.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.980
Same rules apply very important when you sit
them in they sit all the way back, bring the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.540
hardness over, connect there retainer clip.
Agna just another reminder these metal parts

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.940
could get very hot so be very careful on bare
legs. Okay snap it in, pull through snuggled

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.720
on the hips first, then Dan is going to show
you down here the strap that is here at the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.830
bottom this is what they call a front adjust
and you are going to pull here and if you

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.050
notice this now is going to tighten here on
the baby shoulders or toddlers shoulders now

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.120
okay and you cant pinch any webbing here,
it is nice and snuggle and the child is not

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.740
moving forward in the seat. The seat is moving
but he cant move forward. The last thing you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.750
always want to make sure that the retainer
clip is always at armpit level that way the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.100
child is not going to submarine to there hardness.
So again sitting back on the sit,snuggled

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.229
hardness straps at or above there shoulders
and the retainer clip at armpit level and

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.120
in this seat we would go to 40 pounds. In
other seats sometimes they are 65 and as a

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.700
couple of seats they would go to 80 in a hardness
so make sure to refer to the manufactures

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.860
instructions to make sure what the weight
is for that hardness. This child in this seat

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.870
would out grow this hardness she is pretty
close to the top of the hardness when her

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.050
shoulder exceeds that hardness line regardless
of her weight she has exceeded the use of

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.330
this seat she could no longer use that. That
is how yo use the forward facing convertible

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.110
seat in your vehicle.
