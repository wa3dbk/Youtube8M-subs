00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.910
After recrystallization,
the crystals are isolated

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.812
by vacuum filtration.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:14.615
This separates the filtrate
that you don't want from

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:17.484
the beautiful crystals
that have formed.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.621
This is a vacuum
filtration apparatus.

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:23.857
You start with choosing the
correct size filter flask.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:28.161
This is a Buchner funnel, 
as you can see here.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.399
Attached to the filter flask on
top I have a neoprene adapter.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.236
It is very important to have
a neoprene adapter there so

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.640
that there is a tight seal
when the vacuum is formed.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.111
This is attached to a ring
stand and a three-pronged clamp.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:47.514
Do not just prop your filter
flask and Buchner funnel on

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.384
the side of the bench
because it surely will fall

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.586
and then your crystals 
you isolated will go

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:54.187
all over the bench.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:57.124
Alternatively for
smaller batches of crystals,

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.359
we use the Hirsch funnel.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.362
For this, you want to choose
the small pieces

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:06.433
of filter paper that fit
snuggly on top,

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.203
over the porcelain holes.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.273
There are three types of
filter papers found in our

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:17.711
laboratory: The small
one for the Hirsch funnel,

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:22.382
the next size larger for the
Buchner funnel looks like

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.586
this, then the filter papers
that are larger that we use

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.790
for gravity filtration.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.160
You do not want to try to
stuff the gravity filter

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.797
paper into the Buchner
funnel as this would not be

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:40.067
a good vacuum filtration.

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:44.805
In order to start
the vacuum filtration,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:49.977
we turn on the vacuum
which you can hear.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.446
Then you want to moisten
the filter paper

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.615
with a little bit of
cold solvent that your

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:58.452
crystals are not soluble in.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:02.923
This makes sure that the
filter paper is adhered

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:06.793
tightly and the filtered
crystals will not go under

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:12.499
the filter paper 
when you filter.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.969
Next, we have our crystals
that are suspended

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.705
in the solvent.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:23.210
You want to gentle swirl to
suspend the crystals

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.783
then pour in the center
of the filter paper.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:34.388
Isn't that pretty?

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.756
Alright.

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:38.158
You may want to do a couple
rinses and again

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:43.030
you would only use a small
amount of the solvent

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.967
that the crystals are not
soluble in to transfer

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:57.177
any remaining material 
left in the filter flask.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:01.815
You want to leave the
crystals on the filter paper

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:06.219
with the vacuum fold until
they are nice and dry and

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:14.694
can be moved around
with your metal spatula.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:19.166
Good 5-10 minutes on the
filter paper will give you

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:24.938
nice, dry crystals with a
good melting point

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:29.543
if they are pure.

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.746
Alright, after the
crystals are dry,

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:35.282
you want to
release the pressure.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:42.222
To do this, you slowly
pull the vacuum tube,

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:45.459
again notice we use
thick walled tubing here,

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.196
not the thin walled tubing.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:04:03.643
Release the pressure
and turn off the vacuum.

00:04:03.643 --> 00:04:07.280
Then you can carefully
transfer the crystals to a

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.088
watch glass or into a 
vial for massing
61
00:04:15,088 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
or determining the yield.
