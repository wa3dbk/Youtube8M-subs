What's up guys!?

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.089
Danny from Danny Mac's Kitchen
Great to see you as always!

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.769
I don't know why it took me so long
to show you guys this really amazing

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.750
"hot to" presentation on how to make
your very own avocado salsa from scratch

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.800
at home, it couldn't be any easier
yet people screw it up countless times

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.180
and I just don't get it
Like hello???

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.180
What's going on??

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.180
What's wrong with you people??

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.770
It's so easy to do!

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.120
You're not going to be one of those people
I gaurantee it because I'm going to show you

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.500
how
We're going to do it right now

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.610
A few simple steps
A few simple ingredients and rocking flavors!

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.550
So let's get going!

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.070
So like I said there's only a few ingredients
I'm going to use 3 ripe hass avocados

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.410
I like using these avocados because
they have so much rocking flavor

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.620
1 actually 2 vine ripe tomatoes diced up
The juice of 3 limes

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.680
1 jalapeno deseeded chopped really fine
1 small onion chopped up

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.360
and I'm using 1 bunch of cilantro chopped
as well

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.130
Real quick before we move on
I know I've showed you guys this before

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.060
but in case you didn't see that episode
it's real easy to get the seed out of the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.030
avocado
and dice it so all you need to do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.329
is get your knife
It doesn't have to be a ridiculously large

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.640
like murderous type of psycho knife like this
but anyway I digress

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.890
Just stab it in the middle
and now I'm saying stab and yeah

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.400
I don't know what's wrong with me
Anyway, it's going to come right out

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.110
Just like that
Set it aside

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.700
Get a smaller knife
and just start making vertical incisions

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.439
Like that
Turn it 90 degrees

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.280
Do the same
Oops!

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.740
They're popping out
and as you see as you start going like this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
You're creating these cubes
That's all you need to do

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.190
So make it happen!

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.860
Grab yourself a spoon
Comes right out

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.860
Just like butter!

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.950
I didn't know if you knew this but
avocado is actually known as the butter

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.579
of all fruit because of the way
it's so silky and delicious

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.270
and you know, I'm sure you've had avocado
before

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.270
It's amazing!

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.270
Who doesn't like avocado?

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.430
If you don't, well you're missing out
I don't know what to tell you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.430
So just keep doing that
We're just going to add the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.040
remaining ingredients following this
All you have to do now is add

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.730
the remaining ingredients
that you've prepared

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:31.591
I told you, couldn't be any easier
You don't have to add jalapeno if you

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:36.719
don't want it just gives it a nice little
kick

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:44.900
Season with a little bit of salt
Mix it up!

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.420
This is pretty much the same way
you make guacamole but this is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.739
a rustic version of it, which I like
Guacamole is more of like a puree

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.219
You can mash some of this up on the sides
just to really incorporate it

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.320
That's all you really need to do
I need you to let that sit in the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.359
refrigerator for at least 2 hours
All those flavors have to come together

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.569
All that cilantro is going to come out
That lime, that jalapeno

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.329
It's really going to be bursting and amazing!

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.319
I know it's really traditional to serve
it with chips and everything that's fun

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.319
That's great, awesome!

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.699
Let me tell you something
Try it on top of chicken

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.809
Try it with fish
or even if you're grilling a burger

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.029
put it on top of a burger
unbelievable, you are going to be like

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.159
"Oh my God, Danny Mac thank you so much
We love you!"

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.980
Hey, check in soon because we're doing
another recipe, we're going to use this salsa

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.019
I'm making a roasted vegetable quesadilla
and we're going to serve it

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.310
with this exact salsa
You're absolutely going to love it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.189
and I can't wait to show you guys
how to do it!

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.230
So til next time!

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.230
Thanks for watching!

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.829
Danny from Danny Mac's Kitchen!
