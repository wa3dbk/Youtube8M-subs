00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.350
Hey everybody what’s going on welcome to
rock gamer so today we had the first details

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.319
revealed today about rock band 4.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.350
If you guys want to watch the entire video
from ign click the link in the description

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.350
below.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.960
But I am basically going to summarize it for
you guys right here, So throughout the month

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.710
of may ign is going to be revealing all the
details or at least a bunch of details about

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
rock band 4.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.329
And there will probably be more details revealed
in June.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.909
So ign has played rock band 4 they have went
to the developers studio and they are going

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.359
to be they talked about some interesting stuff
in the video . They talked about how the campaign

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.599
is a lot like an RPG.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.920
It’s got an RPG element to it.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.680
And one of the ign editors said this is the
first time he is actually really excited to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.300
play the career mode in a rock band game.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.220
So I am really looking forward to what they
are going to reveal about the campaign mode.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.530
They also revealed that after rock band 3
was released in 2010 there was another rock

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.420
band game in development after that but it
eventually got cancelled.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.480
So they are going to be talking about what
that game was.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.970
I am really interested to know what it was.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.880
So let’s start with the actual features
that were announced.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.980
Let’s talk about the vocals.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.120
So the vocals are being completely overhauled.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.390
There is going to be a new microphone that
is going to be better it’s going to have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.449
a new range for distortion.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.799
It’s going to make you sound a lot better
when you sing through the TV.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.971
The other big feature is now you can do free
form melodies so it’s going to allow you

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.310
to add your own personal stamp onto any song
you’re playing So as long as your singing

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030
in key you can do your free form melodies.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.430
The other huge announcement is that every
old Rock Band 1, 2 or from DLC will feature

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.220
harmonies . Throughout the years if you know
about the customs community there is a group

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.570
called The Rock Band harmonies project.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.700
A great group of guys who were upgrading old
Rock Band DLC songs, they basically upgraded

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
them with harmonies.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.830
They basically handed over their work to harmonix
free of charge so all your old rock band songs

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.820
that did not have harmonies will now have
harmonies.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.799
I am so stoked about that.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.680
The other thing that was announced is for
pro drums and just for drums in general the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.000
overdrive system is being overhauled.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.760
You know how you’re playing a song and you
do your own free form section.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.480
Well basically they are replacing that with
they are basically going to throw fills at

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.950
you for a song so instead of you playing your
own fills the game is going to show you what

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.610
kind of fills you should play and it’s going
to be from a variety of genres like metal,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.930
alternative, hard rock you know whatever it
could be and so you could be playing an indie

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.340
song or an alternative rock song and have
some crazy metal fills thrown in but the cool

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.320
things about the fill is that they are all
in time and they all sound like proper fills

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.700
that should be played in that section of the
song.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.730
The other thing that was announced is that
the cymbals from rock band 2 and 3, from those

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.730
pro drum kits will also be compatible in rock
band 4 so if you have the old madcatz cymbals

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.220
you will still be able to use them.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.940
The other cool thing about the drums is that
now the drummer can count in his band.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.599
So instead of just loading up game and playing
the song the game will be like hey drummer

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.140
you got to count in so that’s a really cool
even though it’s a small feature it’s

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.650
a cool new thing they are adding.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.850
IGN is also going to be talking about how
a rock band song is made they are going to

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.130
be talking about a new career mode and which
songs are going to be on the setlist.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.250
They even hinted that one band who is going
to be on rock band 4’s setlist is a huge

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.810
act that they never thought would be in rock
band.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.209
If you read the article there are a bunch
of Bruce Springsteen references.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.069
I doubt it’s Bruce Springsteen because I
don’t think IGN’s lawyers would let them

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.620
put that in an article.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.190
I think it could be Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin
or Guns N’ Roses.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.819
Those are just my picks.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.170
It could be any other band it could be a band
maybe you wouldn’t think of being playable

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.170
in rock band.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.020
It could be one of those bands too.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.599
And the last piece of news is that the rock
band stage kit will be supported in rock band

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
4.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.739
I know a lot of people are excited about that.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.311
It’s probably hard to find a stage kit,
but if you’re one of the few people who

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.290
has it you can use in rock band 4.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.100
That basically does it for the new rock band
4 news.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.050
