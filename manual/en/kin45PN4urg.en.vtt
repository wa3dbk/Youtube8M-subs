Hi guys, John here with RealTruck.com.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:14.410
We've been getting a lot of
questions lately about how to measure your

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:40.670
exhaust to make sure you get 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.500
the
right exhaust tip.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:57.160
Well, I'm going to show you just exactly how
to do that.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.470
Now, on this particular truck, it's a little
bit different of a scenario

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.040
for measuring.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.170
If you have a pipe on your truck that's cut
straight off, it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.170
makes it way easier.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:22.180
On this one, and I'll show you here real quick
where you can get messed up

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:34.590
- on this pipe, if you measure outside to
outside because of the sliced off

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:49.720
angle, it's going to show us three and a half
inches.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.030
That's not accurate.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.970
If this pipe were straight, no problem.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:05.610
But what we're going to do is we're
just going to hold our tape measure up here,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:16.290
kind of give it an eyeball
look.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:40.190
And that tells me that 
this is a three inch pipe.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:03:19.490
So, that's what we're going to get for 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:39.510
our exhaust 
pipe for this truck,

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:55.630
we'll get a three inch tip.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:08.370
Like I said, if it's cut straight off, just
measure outside to outside.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:42.220
If it's cut off at an angle like this, you're
going to have to do the eyeball thing.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:56.810
So, it's not too tough of 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:26.780
a process,
pretty simple, and there you have it.
