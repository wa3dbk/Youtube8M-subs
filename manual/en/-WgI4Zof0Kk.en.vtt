00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.880
Again, working from trying to establish the
middle values. Let's take a look at those

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.799
pots. What color as those pots? Well, the
simple answer is they're black. But, they're

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:25.110
not black. What I'm seeing is a bunch of colors
ranging from almost a white to a series of

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.800
grays in here. There's another highlight there,
which is white. This one's almost yellow.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.010
This has kind of got some bluish and some
greenish in there. And, you'll see the same

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.480
kinds of things here. This is a gray. This
has got some, this is a light gray in here.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.639
This has got white. So, let's just rough in
that. And, I'm going to use a gray-green to

00:00:53.639 --> 00:01:07.280
just generally establish the general form
of these objects. Not worrying about the highlights

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.180
at this point at all, just filling in with
some color that we will later refine that's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.350
close to what I'm seeing. I'm not worried
at this point with shadows. I'm not worried

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.770
at this point with the lighting or the highlights.
I'm just trying to establish the general shapes

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:42.720
and the general tone of the objects that are
in front of my eyes. Now, one of the things

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.170
that you should be conscious of when doing
this kind of work or this kind of play. If

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:03.810
you're not playing, then you're not having
any fun. Is, to just use what you see as your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:15.140
guide
and to spend more time looking at that than

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:26.810
your painting. Your painting, although it
may seem like it's important is not the important

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.170
thing. Our subject is the important thing.
Our subject has the information that we need.
