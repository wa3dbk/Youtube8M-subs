00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.460
In this video, we'll look at how to
operate the automatic climate control

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.580
system.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.049
Remember, for all these functions to work
properly,

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.200
the engine must be running.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.309
The control panel is equipped with three
large controls:

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.760
The temperature control dial, the blower
speed selection dial,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.900
and the mode selection dial. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
There is an interior temperature sensor
here. Never place

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.029
anything over the sensor where the
system will not function properly.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.230
Let's start with the temperature control
dial. You can set the desired

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.020
actual temperature using this dial. The
temperature set ranges from

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.070
approximately 61 to 89 degrees. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.790
Turn the temperature control dial
clockwise for warmer air,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.960
and counterclockwise for cooler air. In
the middle of the dial

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.860
is the air selection switch. You can
choose outside air

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.500
or recirculate the year that's in the
cabin. Choosing recirculated air is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.680
useful to prevent unpleasant odors,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.720
such as diesel exhaust, from entering the
vehicle. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.090
This indicator lights up when
recirculated air is selected.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.070
You may have to switch back to outside
air if the windows start to fog. 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.980
Now let's check out the blower speed
control.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.400
Turn the blower speed control to the
right to increase the blower speed.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Turn it to the left to decrease the
blower speed.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.860
Turning the control to the off position
turns the blower

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.270
off. Because air conditioning into the cabin through
the open outside recirculation door,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.270
a small amount of airflow can be felt
even with the blower off. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.190
Push the switch in the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.820
center of the dial to turn air
conditioning on and off.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.010
A sound is made whenever you press the
switch. 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.060
When the mode selection dial or blower
speed selection dial has been set to the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.180
AUTO position,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.460
or when the temperature control dial has
been set to the coolest temperature,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.460
the air conditioning switch is
automatically controlled.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.840
Now let's look at the mode selection dial.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.349
This dial changes the location and
amount of air flowing from the vents

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.630
as well as controlling the front and
rear defroster. This is the "face" position,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.799
air flows only to the panel registers.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.800
In this position,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.000
air flows to the panel registers and to
the floor area.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.340
In this position,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.799
air flows only to the floor area.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.270
Here,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.450
air flows to the floor area as well as
the windshield,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.640
and the door windows. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.210
In the defrost position,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.210
air flows to the windshield and the door
windows.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.400
When in auto mode

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.879
add the system controls the air flow
discharge location.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.930
Push the switch in the center of the
dial to defog the rear window. 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.540
When selected, the light comes on. The defogger and light

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.810
automatically turn off after twenty
minutes. Remember that defroster

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.069
performance is improved if the inside
glass surfaces clean. 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.090
Here are a few suggestions so you can
get the most out of your climate control

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.830
system. 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.420
For quick defrosting, set the mode dial
to the defrost position,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.430
set the blower speed to the maximum
position,

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.480
and set the temperature to the highest
position. 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.180
For quick cooling, set the mode dial to
the face position,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.260
the temperature dial to the lowest
temperature setting,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.500
and the blower speed to the highest
position. 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.770
For quick heating, place the blower speed
dial in the full position.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.330
Select the highest temperature setting,
select outside air

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.190
and place the mode dial in the floor
position.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.700
Here's how to use auto mode. Set the
blower speed dial position

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.769
to auto. Set the temperature dial to the
desired temperature.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.510
Set the mode selection dial to the AUTO
position. 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.670
The vents, recirculation door,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.670
blower speed, and AC on and off

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.220
will be controlled automatically. If the
blower control dial is set to AUTO,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.990
the system regulates fan speed
automatically depending upon the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.920
temperature control dial setting.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.850
If not set in the AUTO position, the mode
selection dial can also be used to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.600
manually select specific

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.710
airflow outlets. If the mode selection
dial is set to AUTO

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.750
the system directs airflow to the proper
outlets

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.720
depending upon the temperature control
dial setting. If not set in the AUTO

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.520
position

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.830
the blower control dial can be used to
manually select blower speed.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.380
If both blower control

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.510
and mode selection dials are set to AUTO,
airflow direction

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.410
recirculation door position, blower speed
and air conditioning

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.770
on and off is controlled automatically.
