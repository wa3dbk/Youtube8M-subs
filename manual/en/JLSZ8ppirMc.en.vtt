Hey i'm Ed Van Petten, Executive Director of the Kansas Lottery

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:25.681
I'm here with Dave Leuth the manager of the Cabelas store in Kansas City and 

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.681
James Edwards who goes by Lynn from Junction City

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:38.351
Won a $20,000 shopping spree through our Cabela's scratch game in the drawing just a couple weeks ago.

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.099
And what are you going to do with it?

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.995
I'm going to spend it. 

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:45.093
Ha ha there you go.

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:49.221
James, congratulations on behalf of Cabela's, we're excited to have you hear today.

00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:52.036
Sounds like you've got some of the money already spent.

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:55.988
We got some folks in here that can give you a personal shopping experience

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.909
If you want help you can get it if you don't have at it, the store is yours.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:04.188
Alright, thanks.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:19.644
We've been walking with the Kansas Lottery winner, trying to pick out what he wants.

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:25.891
You can tell he's been wanting alot of this stuff for awhile and now he's got the opportunity to get it.

00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.038
(O.S.) What else did you pick out today, so far?

00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:39.410
Well, couple of guns and a gun safe, BBQ grill, a tent, rods and reels...

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:46.417
They picked it out not me.
Yeah.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:51.001
I was glad to get a lot of new stuff for the boat.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:59.205
New Trevour troller motor, a Lowrance down scan and a new prop so it will go faster.

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:05.728
Ed: I'd like to say this is the fourth game we've done with Cabela's 

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:08.670
This is one of the greatest partnerships you could ask for and I just want to thank  

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:16.057
all the people at Cabela's especially at the corporate level that let us continue this partnership.
