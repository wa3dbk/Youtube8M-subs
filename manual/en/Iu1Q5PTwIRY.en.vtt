00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.200
This is Byron Martin, owner of Logee's

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.270
Plants for Home and Garden. And this is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.640
what we send you in the mail from our

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.260
mail order company when you order plants

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.960
from us. So, the plants are packed,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.230
and when we got them, we open the box up, and we're

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.610
going to remove the plants.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.080
Now there's stakes often, in there, to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.119
keep plants from shipping. This is how we

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.400
pack. The plants are rolled up in newspaper,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.670
so we undo that. And then, we have a plastic wrap

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.200
that goes around it; this is to keep the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.690
soil from falling out of the pot during

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.500
shipping.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.079
Remove the plastic, then there's packing on

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.260
top of that, that allows the soil to be held

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.750
in place firmly. And so now we have, this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.969
is what we ship. [What plant is that?] This is a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.480
Gardenia, and this is what we ship as a

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.480
two-and-a-half-inch pot. So, a plant like

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.039
this, which is fairly tall, and has a good,

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:05.899
strong root system, needs to get moved

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.600
up. And, generally, it was always said

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.450
that you need to let a week settle

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.520
before you pot, and so on.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.070
Oftentimes, when plants are shipped, they come in

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.750
and the leaves are a little crunched and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.390
squished down, and they don't look that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.040
great, so you can take them out and leave

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.409
them in a flat for a day or two. Just, when

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.630
you first get them out of the pot-- box--

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.000
remember to check for watering; if they

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.350
didn't dry out; if they need a drink, give

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.600
them a good drink. You can set them someplace for a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.560
day or two, to let the leaves unfold, or which

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.540
we often do when we receive plants in

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.820
the mail, we just simply pot them up. And

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.110
so, what we're going to do is, we take our

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.790
label out-- remember to keep your label and

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.369
your plant together, because if you lose it,

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.380
you may not remember what it is or you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.060
may not be able to identify it. And then,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.799
what we do is, we tap the plant out of the pot.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.750
You can see we have a good root system

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.380
here. Now this is a two-and-a-half and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.020
we're going into a four-and-a-half inch

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.990
pot, which is an increase of about two

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.390
inches-- they could go to bigger; you

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.560
generally don't want to go any smaller

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.110
unless you're working with really tiny

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.840
items, like succulents

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.670
or some small begonias and things like

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
that. And one of the things that has been

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.280
taught in horticulture over the years, is that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.890
you want to fray the root ball before

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.379
you pot, but that is really not a

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.480
good idea. It's a good idea if you're

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.069
planting outside in the ground, and you're

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.799
working with plants in the Ericaceae

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.019
family; blueberries, rhododendrons, and stuff

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.379
that have very tight roots. In our work here, we

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.209
never fray the roots, and we never get

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.670
a root ball that actually won't

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.840
transition out into the mix. So, simply

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.579
don't disturb it-- it puts more stress on the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.380
plant. And so what we do is, we take our

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.810
pot that's empty, we put a little soil in

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.650
the bottom.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.630
Generally, you want to end up with this

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.319
soil level here, just slightly below, and

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.940
then what we do is, we center the plant--

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.069
that's always important-- and we fill it

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.920
up with potting mix, like this. [Fill it all the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.629
way to the top.] Fill it all the way to the top;

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.190
good drink, give it a good tap, like that,

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.200
in there, there we [Don't you want to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.370
leave a little bit of room for watering?]

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.579
Well the thing is, is that, as the plant gets

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.829
watered, and as it-- the soil settles,

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.630
you'll see there will be probably a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.730
1/2 an inch-- 3/8 of an

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.519
inch drop in the soil level from here

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.530
that will allow for a reservoir as you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.930
water it, as the plant grows. [And this gardenia is what

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.849
variety and where would you put it?] This is a Belmont and

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.200
so you want to make sure you put the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.139
label back in, and then what we do is, we

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.200
get our water and give it a good drink.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.810
[Put in a sunny window?] Yeah, this particular

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.239
plant wants to go on a sunny window, and

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.669
although gardenias are known to be grown

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.620
cold when they're in containers, like

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.290
this. The best way to grow them is above 60

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.269
degrees, if you can. If you do grow them

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.459
cold, make sure you really are

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.380
accurate on your watering, meaning dry,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.290
wet, dry, wet, and reduce your fertilizer,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.169
or eliminate your fertilizer during cold. So

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.109
then what we have is a-- another plant

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.190
here. This is a Hibiscus, and this is our

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.280
4-inch pot size. And again, we rolled it

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.880
up, unwrapped it. You want to remove your plastic,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.280
and you want to remove your packing,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.920
and save your label again. Now, this plant

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.690
here is already in a 4-inch pot. You

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.550
can see we've tapped it out, and there's a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.470
fairly good root system, there, that's ready...

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.120
It's ready to be moved up; you can

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.200
see the height of the plant is a good

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.730
size. And so now, we're going is from a 4" to a 6", and

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.520
it's the same procedure. Put a little soil in

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.690
the bottom... soil in the bottom, center our plant...

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.370
Fill it up with soil; we go around, and around. [And why do

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.590
you only go up, like, a few pot sizes-- a

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.640
couple inches?] Generally, it's a good

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.550
idea not to over-pot things. There we go with

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.380
our plant. And it's generally a good idea not

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.450
to over-pot things, now you could go from a

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.640
two-and-a-half to a six; you could go from

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.080
two-and-a-half to an eight; and in the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.880
nursery industry it's often done where,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.070
they take a small planet called liner,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.200
which is a young propagation, and theyll

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.020
move them up into big, larger containers.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.210
The thing is, is that, there are some plants

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.190
that when they get stuck into these big

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.860
masses of wet soil, you lose your root

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.620
system. And the plant will collapse. So,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.900
for gardeners that have the time, and can

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.490
devote a little more attention to it

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.830
moving your plants up 2 inches, 3

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.470
inches at a time actually eliminates any

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.520
of that risk of loss.
