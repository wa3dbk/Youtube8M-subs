00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:21.039
In 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.111
this current world of hyper realistic football
games like Fifa and Pro Evolution, that allow

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:31.430
you to play practically any way you want,
Ubisoft decided to take football away from

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.230
the high glitz and glamour of Stadio Olimpico,
Old Trafford, and Stadio Renzo Barbera, to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:55.190
create a more down-to-Earth football, a more
real football, a more Pure Football.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.859
Gone are the fans, and refs, and even six
players.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:09.840
This is secluded 5 on 5 matches, designed
to give a feel of how real football is played.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.900
The 5 on 5 nature makes for some very fast
and streamlined matches.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.470
You will spend much less time worrying about
your squad formation and focus more on the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.910
matches themselves.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.960
And the matches are brought to life with graphics
that fits with the game’s nature.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.340
You pick from some of your favorite club and
national teams.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
Most of the players are present in the game,
although they are shown in a more characterture

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
way.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.210
And the gameplay goes right in line with what
you would expect from an arcade style football

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.210
game.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.250
Allowing you to pass to the feet, perform
lobs and through passes, and even pull off

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.320
some stylish moves.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.670
The difference comes when you take a shot.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.250
When you shoot, a meter with different colors
will appear under your player.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.990
If you shoot in the green your shot will be
online but if you go into the red you will

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.180
miss.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.070
What you are aiming for is the white “Pure”
zone, where landing in there will slow things

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.140
down and send a shot that is worthy of a replay.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:18.560
It is really impressive when you get a Pure
corner to a Pure header for a Pure goal.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340
The game has several different modes but the
focus in on the career mode.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.280
You create a player and squad and take them
through a career to reach the top of the world

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280
rankings.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.660
You start with skuds, but by winning matches
and tournaments you can unlock new free agents

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.560
and upgrade your star.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.390
There are different match types too.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.660
Normal timed matches but also some pretty
self explained, “First To” matches where

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.050
its first to a set goal number, and also “Win
by” matches, where you must win by so many.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.590
They mix up the action as you continue your
path to greatness.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.330
Pure Football may not be the deepest or the
most polished football game, with some goals

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.050
feeling more cheap than earned, but it does
provide a solid football experience that is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.860
worthy of playing.
