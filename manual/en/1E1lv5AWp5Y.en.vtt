\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi guys it's Mike Taylor here
from Twoeyesopen Photographer' Collective

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.760
with what I think is a really cool little
program. It's free, which is awesome, that

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.790
you can use for um shooting tethered to your
computer. In this case it would be a mac tethered

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.900
to a Nikon camera.\
\

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.580
And it is called, Sofortbild. That's sorforbilt.\
\

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.820
It's a German word, and uh, look it up. You'll
find it.\

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.079
\
Wow. You can also get it from the app store,

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.210
which is where I got it from.\
\

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.460
There it is. It's a free program. It's pretty
cool.\

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.329
\
And what it allows you to do is tether yourself

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.670
right to your mac and shoot directly to the
computer. \

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.230
\
And here I have it here.\

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.660
\
As soon as you bring it up, it recognizes

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.420
what camera body you have. The settings of
your camera, the lens uh, battery power right

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.969
here.\
\

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.220
And all that kind of stuff.\
\

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.850
You're going to have to set up all your settings
on your camera ahead of time, but it will

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.299
allow you to do some bracketing, and a timer.\
\

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.329
You can set the time delay.\
\

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.249
The number of shots.\
\

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.279
Now I've set up a little still life here with
a softbox. Now let's just see what happens

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:29.740
when I press that okay button.\
\

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.659
Takes the shot.\
\

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.670
And there you go.\
\

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.670
There's your image.\
\

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:48.020
Now, you'll have a file folder set up ahead
of time, or it can go into uh I believe it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:59.420
is iPhoto. iPhoto and umm, there's another
place you can send it to. Ah, aperture. That's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
it.\
\

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.629
So you can use aperture, iphoto or a separate
folder, to save the images.\

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.780
\
You can name them as you wish.\

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.760
\
Set the number format as you wish.\

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.410
\
You can hide the extensions.\

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.910
\
Etcetera, etcetera, start the counters, you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.160
can use hdri format. I'm not sure what that
is, but I can look into it.\

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.590
\
Jpegs, yada yada yada. All kinds of interesting,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.080
interesting things you can do. \
\

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.110
Enable support for older model cameras. The
one I'm using here is a Nikon D90, with a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.310
28 70.\
\

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.420
So it's pretty cool.\
\

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.700
I really enjoy it.\
\

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.010
There's not a lot of umm, control from the
computer other than those settings there.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.099
For that you'd have to change to a different
piece of software.\

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.070
\
One I'll talk about in a future post. It's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.500
called NK remote. It's from Breeze systems.\
\

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.510
And that one for the most part, is applicable
to Nikons, ahhh in conjunction with Windows

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.510
based computers. \
\

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.010
Of course you can run Windows on a mac using
the proper interface software.\

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.120
\
So that's probably not a big issue. \

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.180
\
So you can probably still use NK remote from

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.270
Breeze systems on your mac.\
\

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.490
And I think I'm going to talk about that in
a future post. \

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.490
\
So there you go.\

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.040
\
So this ones called Sofortbild, s o f o r

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.500
t b i l d.\
\

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.780
And over here, in the app store you can download
it for free.\

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.290
\
There you go.\

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.400
\
And you can see I've already installed it.\

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.440
\
And that is it for today.\

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.740
\
This is Mike Taylor at Twoeyesopen Photographer'

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.740
Collective.\
\

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.879

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.879
