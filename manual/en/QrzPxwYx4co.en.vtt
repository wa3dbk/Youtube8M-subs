[Cinderella's
Evil Step Sisters]

00:00:08.373 --> 00:00:10.983
[Anastasia] Where are we?
[Drizella] Is this the Apple Store?

00:00:10.983 --> 00:00:13.443
[St. Peter]
Welcome Tremaine sisters.

00:00:13.443 --> 00:00:15.993
[sisters] Hi.
&gt;&gt;Drizella, Anastasia.

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:18.273
[Anastasia] She's Drizella! I'm Anastasia!
[Drizella] She's Anastasia! I'm Drizella!

00:00:18.273 --> 00:00:21.563
&gt;&gt;I don't care.
&gt;&gt;Can you get me a spring water, servant man?

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:24.053
&gt;&gt;And wash these clothes.
&gt;&gt;And poison my sister.

00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:26.093
&gt;&gt;And darn these socks.
&gt;&gt;No!

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.333
I won't.
[sisters] Fine, but we're telling mother.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.533
&gt;&gt;Listen you cows,
I'm going to make this brief.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.793
You're not getting into heaven.
&gt;&gt;Why not?

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:37.563
&gt;&gt;For starters, you enslaved
and abused your lovely step-sister.

00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:40.113
&gt;&gt;What, Cinderella?
She talks to rodents.

00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:42.963
&gt;&gt;She makes them little outfits.
[sisters] She's crazy!

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:45.173
&gt;&gt;Yeah, well you're both
really bad people.

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:47.673
[sisters] A bad person?
I'm better than her!

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:49.803
You think you're better
than me?

00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:52.093
&gt;&gt;She takes a sleeping pill.
&gt;&gt;Only when I'm hungry.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.243
&gt;&gt;She gave the Duke
a blowy in the woods.

00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:57.163
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so he'd take me to the ball.
&gt;&gt;Sounds like you got both his balls.

00:00:57.163 --> 00:00:59.843
&gt;&gt;No, just one. Ow! Ow!
&gt;&gt;Ow! Ow!

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.223
[sisters] Ow! Ow!

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:07.563
&gt;&gt;Stop it! Both of you!

00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:10.013
&gt;&gt;You stop.
&gt;&gt;You stop.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:12.013
&gt;&gt;Stop!

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:14.903
&gt;&gt;He's kind of sweet though.
&gt;&gt;Yeah and authoritative.

00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:17.933
&gt;&gt;And like cute enough.

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.983
[sisters]
I saw him first!

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:22.663
[sisters]
Now you didn't! Shot for it!

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:27.493
Eh! Eh! Eh!
[smacking sounds]

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:31.123
[sisters]
Throw paper!

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.483
&gt;&gt;Gals, gals, I have an idea.

00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:35.623
I'll make you a deal.
How about this?

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:39.353
If either of you can fit
into this glass slipper,

00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:42.443
you get to go to heaven.

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:44.553
[sisters]
Deal.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.883
&gt;&gt;That tickles!

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:52.153
&gt;&gt;My momma says I have
an athlete's foot,

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.443
whatever that means.

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:56.583
&gt;&gt;Okay, you know what?
I can't do this.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.733
So you both get into heaven.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.723
It's the second door on the right.
[sisters] Yeah!

00:02:01.723 --> 00:02:03.733
&gt;&gt;No, me first.
&gt;&gt;No! No, me first.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:05.733
&gt;&gt;No, me first!
&gt;&gt;Ah come on! Me first!

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.952
&gt;&gt;Me first! Please don't! Ow!
&gt;&gt;No, me first!

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:11.103
&gt;&gt;Me first!
