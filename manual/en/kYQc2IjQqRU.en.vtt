00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.070 position:84%
MILES O'BRIEN: Nothing refreshes like a deep breath of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.570 position:94%
ocean air. But why the salty smell? It's actually an aerosol

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.500 position:98%
- a fine mist of droplets - each one packed with not only salt,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300 position:61%
but life from the ocean… phytoplankton,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.670
bacteria. even viruses.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.800 position:86%
KIM PRATHER: What we're interested in are aerosols that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.200 position:84%
are produced naturally or by humans in the real world.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.500 position:83%
Aerosols are mixtures, these really complex mixtures.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.330 position:83%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National Science

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.530 position:97%
Foundation, atmospheric chemist Kimberly Prather at UC San Diego

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.070 position:91%
and a team of scientists around the country are working to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.730 position:97%
better understand the role these marine aerosols play in weather

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.900
and climate change.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.300 position:97%
KIM PRATHER: The single largest uncertainty in climate change is

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.030 position:69%
- how do aerosols affect clouds and climate?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.130 position:94%
MILES O'BRIEN: At the "Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.100 position:84%
and the Environment," Prather and her team have pumped

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.900 position:95%
seawater into this hydraulics lab from the Pacific Ocean, and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.270 position:97%
spiked it with nutrients to get tiny plant-like organisms called

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.630
phytoplankton to grow.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.370 position:95%
KIM PRATHER: So, phytoplankton give us almost half our oxygen

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.830 position:97%
that we breathe. They fix carbon from the atmosphere like CO2,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.300 position:95%
and then they turn it back into oxygen, just like plants. So,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.330 position:97%
you can think of them as little forests underwater, and the goal

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.030 position:97%
of this experiment is to try and replicate the complexity of the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.600
ocean in the lab.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200 position:89%
MILES O'BRIEN: Prather and company know the phytoplankton

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.170 position:84%
change the chemistry of the water. They want to better

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.300 position:84%
understand how those changes impact the composition of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.430
sea spray aerosols.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.430 position:89%
KIM PRATHER: Our goal is to understand how the changes in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.530 position:97%
the seawater get translated into the changes in the sea spray,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.600 position:89%
which then go on and seed clouds, and change our climate.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.230 position:94%
MILES O'BRIEN: The team hopes data from the tank experiments

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.630 position:72%
will lead to improved computer climate models.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.700 position:89%
OLGA LASKINA: So, we measure chemical composition. We can

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400 position:83%
also measure different properties of these particles.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.170 position:91%
For example, how they interact with water. And, we need to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.570 position:84%
measure these properties in order to incorporate those

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.200
into climate models.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.300 position:86%
MILES O'BRIEN: Prather co-directs the center with Vicki

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.030
Grassian of the University of Iowa.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.130 position:92%
VICKI GRASSIAN: We're learning things for the first time by

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.970 position:88%
having this ocean in the laboratory. And, that allows us

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.270 position:88%
to test hypotheses that have been entrenched in people's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.130 position:89%
thinking, and see if they're true or not. We do have some

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 position:78%
surprises, and new ways of looking at the problem.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.370 position:98%
MILES O'BRIEN: With 70% of our earth covered by water, Grassian

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400 position:91%
and Prather say we need to understand the chemistry of sea

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.370 position:86%
spray aerosols before we can ever really understand our

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.670 position:94%
changing climate. And to do that - well, they're making some

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.330 position:70%
waves. For Science Nation, I'm Miles O'Brien.
