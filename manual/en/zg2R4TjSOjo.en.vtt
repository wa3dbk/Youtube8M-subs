00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.739
YOU KNOW,

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.875
EVER SINCE I SAW YOU            
ON THAT RED CARPET--

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.610
MM, THAT FACE OF YOURS--

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.911
I HAVE BEEN WAITING
                 TO DO THIS.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.680
WELL, IF YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.316
THAT LONG, WHY NOT WAIT
        A FEW MINUTES MORE?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.884
(chuckles)                    
WHERE YOU GOING?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.519
TO THE FRIDGE         
 TO PUT AWAY THESE STRAWBERRIES.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.588
WOULDN'T WANT       
          THE CHOCOLATE TO MELT.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:26.959
I CAN THINK OF A BETTER USE     
    FOR THAT CHOCOLATE.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.293
HA! (mutters)   
          (auto dials)

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:29.495
OKAY. 
(laughs)

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.864
KRISTINA, LET'S TALK   
    ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.199
(cell phone rings)

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.667
OH, YOU WANT TO TALK?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.369
WELL, I JUST-- 
                  WHAT ARE WE--

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.671
WHAT ARE WE--              
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.840
(rings)

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.509
(beeps)

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.110
HEY, CASTLE.           
    HOW'S YOUR DATE?

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.879
WHAT ARE YOU--

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.380
OH!

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.948
Get back. Get back. Aah!

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.283
CASTLE?

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.418
(fast busy signal beeps)

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.719
(Castle) OOH.

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.187
(Kristina laughs)

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.622
DON'T WORRY.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.590
I GOT IT.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.125
(unzips zipper)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.394
AH! OKAY, I'LL HELP.    
                I'LL HELP.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.495
(beeps)

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.630
(auto dials)

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.031
(cell phone rings)

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.068
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>       
   <i>Richard Castle. Lucky you.</i>

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.813
(clatters)

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.281
(trash can lid clanks)

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.016
NOW THAT                  
THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.517
WHERE WERE WE?

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.252
UM, UM...

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.420
OYSTERS.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.988
OOH, LET'S SKIP THE OYSTERS.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.457
REALLY? 'CAUSE I    
                HAPPEN TO BE--

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.958
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING             
  SO HARD TO GET?

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.626
I'M REALLY NOT.
                    I JUST--

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.829
YOU ARE.                        
                (chuckles) WHOA.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.263
YOU KNOW, NO MAN HAS EVER       
     SAID NO TO ME.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.566
WELL... THERE WAS ONE.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.234
REALLY? THAT SOUNDS LIKE
          AN INTERESTING STORY.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.837
TELL ME ABOUT HIM.  
        HOW DID HE GET AWAY?

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:45.971
I ASSURE YOU...

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.508
IT HAD NOTHING                  
TO DO WITH ME.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.044
OH, WOW.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:53.812
OH!

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.748
(muffled shouting and grunting)

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.586
(objects thud and shatter)

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.954
(muffled grunting)

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.222
CASTLE?

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.057
(pants and mutters)

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.427
I, UH...

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.163
UH, I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.
