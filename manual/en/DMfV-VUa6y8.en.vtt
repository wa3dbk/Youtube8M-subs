Hi, Zack with Asetek here. In hopes of reducing
noise on my mac pro, our engineers retrofitted

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.050
it with liquid cooling. 2 low noise fans and
a 120mm radiator are housed next to the dual

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.669
pumps. Not only is it liquid cooled, but it's
also over clocked. In this video, I'll also

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.669
see how it compares to a stock 3.2Ghz Mac
Pro. I'm using a program called Zdnet clock.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.199
It only works on certain mac pros and only
under OS 10.5. As it turns out, the memory

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:48.199
clock speed is the limiting factor here. Not
letting me go beyond 3.1GHz. Now, I want to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.739
boot into OS 10.6 to run my benchmark. The
over clock will hold on a restart, but a shut

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.739
down will revert it back to its stock speed.
So I'm in 10.6 now. I'll be using hardware

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.990
monitor to view my CPU temps. I'll be testing
with an ambient of. 26 degrees celsius. I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.970
have placed a sound level meter at a half
meter from the front of the case. As you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.180
see in the bottom right hand corner, it's
hovering at 37.5 decibels while the CPU is

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.180
at 100% load. Skipping ahead you can see the
CPU temperature is, on average, 47 degrees

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.900
celsius and our cinebench score is 7.45. That's
a substantial increase over the 6.57 this

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.900
machine scores at its stock speed. Let's see
how the stock 3.2Ghz Mac Pro compares. Right

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.800
off the bat, we can see that the noise level
of this machine is a lot higher than mine

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.410
at 50 decibels. The CPU temperature is actually
identical at 47 degrees celsius. Keep in mind

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.470
that this machine is running at its stock
speed and not over clocked. And the cinebench

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.470
score is just a tad faster at 7.46. So in
the end, the liquid cooling and over clocking

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.079
allows my system to run at nearly the same
speed as the more expensive Mac Pro. At the

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.300
same time, it does it with half the noise.
Now that's thermal management done right.
