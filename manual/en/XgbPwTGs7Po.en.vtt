00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.690
&gt;&gt; Morris Proctor: When you launch Logos Bible
Software 4, the home page automatically opens.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.110
Let's take a brief tour of this page.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.610
The top of the homepage is sometimes called
"the ribbon" and it contains software features.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.220
From here you can perform various actions;
such as, jump to your 'my account' page at

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.410
Logos.com, launch Bible study from the passage
box, choose your preferred Bible, and create

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.110
and access reading plans.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.250
The main area of the homepage, which has a
newspaper look and feel, houses what we call

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
"content".

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.510
Here you'll see the Logos blog, Morris Proctors
Tips and Tricks, and numerous links to Bible

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.260
study resources and tools in your library.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.969
The goal of the Logos developers is to provide
you with interesting tidbits of information

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.700
to jump start your Bible study.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.750
You may see a picture, graphic, map, dictionary
article or practically anything from your

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.750
library.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.130
As my good Logos friend Scott Lindsey says,
"Think of the homepage as your own USA Today

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.290
newspaper geared toward Bible study."

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.670
Now to follow through with one of the previews,
just click the 'more' button.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.630
You can turn the pages of the homepage using
the previous and next buttons in the lower

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.630
right hand corner.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.100
To show and hide or rearrange various sections,
use the customize button in the lower left-hand

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.100
corner.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.640
You can drag features in the ribbon to different
places, just check or uncheck boxes to show

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.740
or hide different content.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.730
Now, if you don't want the homepage to automatically
open when you launch your software, just uncheck

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.880
the box 'Show home page at startup'.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.200
Now please enjoy your Bible study with the
homepage.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.520
