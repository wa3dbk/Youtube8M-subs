00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.550
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
a balloon angioplasty.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.610
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.950
The heart is located in the center of the
chest.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.770
It's job is to keep blood continually circulating
throughout the body.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.350
The blood vessels that supply the body with
oxygen-rich blood are called arteries.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.930
The arteries that supplies blood to the heart
muscle itself are called coronary arteries.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.110
Sometimes, these blood vessels can narrow
or become blocked by plaque deposits, restricting

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.890
normal blood flow.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.550
In simple terms, a balloon angioplasty is
a procedure used to increase the amount of

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.500
blood flowing through the coronary artery.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.440
During a balloon angioplasty, a heart specialist
will insert a thin tube into an artery in

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.920
your arm or leg and gently guide it towards
the problem area in your heart.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.450
Once the tube is in place, a small balloon
is briefly inflated in order to widen the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.640
narrowed artery.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.080
During and after the procedure, your doctor
will take x-rays in order to monitor your

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.000
progress.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.440
Then the doctor will make a small cut over
the femoral artery in the upper part of the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.420
leg.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.830
A special needle is then inserted into the
artery itself.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.950
Then a guide wire is carefully passed through
the needle and gently pushed into the artery

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.640
and upwards towards your chest.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:07.100
A narrow tube, called a catheter is threaded
along the wire until it too has reached the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.060
coronary artery.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.810
Next, the doctor uses the catheter to inject
a dye into the artery itself.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.780
The die shows up on a TV monitor and is used
to pinpoint the exact location of the blocked

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.110
area.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.330
Once the restricted area has been identified,
a thin wire is inserted into the catheter,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.510
and is guided all the way to the blocked area
and then slightly beyond.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
This wire acts as guide for the balloon catheter.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.460
It allows your doctor to position the deflated
balloon precisely in the middle of the narrowest

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.400
part of the coronary artery.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.010
The balloon is briefly inflated.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.510
As it expands, it squeezes the plaque deposits
against the wall of the artery.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.280
It also stretches the artery wall and enlarges
the channel through which blood flows.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.280
Your doctor will continue to inflate and deflate
the balloon until normal blood flow has been

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.180
restored.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.560
Finally, after a thorough investigation of
the region, the catheters and guide wire are

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.530
withdrawn.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:44.560
The dye that had been injected will break
up and leave your body as waste.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:59.569
Slight pressure is applied to the incision
in your leg in order to prevent bleeding.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:10.849
