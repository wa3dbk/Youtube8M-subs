My reaction is that if it is true that we are having these high 
 profile visitations to foreign countries for care then I will be very disappointed.

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:23.984
That we are dealing with a government that gave the indication 
 they will ban such foreign trips by public officials

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:45.509
and their relatives for ailments best treated here - so while I do not have the full 
 details - if it is true, some of us may not find that very funny

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:48.968
it will show we are not walking the talk

00:00:49.278 --> 00:01:03.244
As long as it is public officer who wants to spend public money for medical care – then that public officer must be made to 
 either seek that care in the country or if they want to go out of the country because it is their fundamental rights

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.382
They must not do that at the expense of the 
 taxpayer's money - that is the bottom line.

00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:18.732
It is not a good idea to shroud such situation from the people

00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:26.581
If you’re the president you are the number one public servant in the 
 whole of the country and so you are now a public property

00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:43.210
I would expect that leaders at that level should now see themselves as open to public 
 scrutiny even as far as their health is concerned and personal relationships are concerned

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:55.190
What we're  experiencing now is – as the income gap is widening by the day – as the rich 
 are getting richer and the poor getting poorer – then access to healthcare is getting more problematic &amp;amp; difficult
