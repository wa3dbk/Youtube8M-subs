00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.080
LOOK UP when

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.360
they're searching

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.780
for inspiration. One

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.680
Hawaii woman

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.220
CLIMBS THERE!

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.820
She keeps a prayer

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.550
box at the top of the

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.080
Koko Head trail.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.980
Maybe you've seen

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.820
it. Now you can

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.290
see what happens

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.550
when you leave a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.130
prayer there ... And

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.960
all the people you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390
have in your corner.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.460
It's all new tonight

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.430

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.900
Every week...

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.760
HIKING NAT just

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.230
before the sun goes

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.380
down... NAT NAT

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.330
NAT You can find

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.770
Angela Tomiye

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.610
climbing these

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.240
steps. A tough hike,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.740
with a powerful

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.620
purpose. Angela

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.140
212 I SAW IT IN

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.940
A VISION, I SAW A

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.410
PRAYER BOX ON

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.850
A MOUNTAIN TOP,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.210
214 AND UM,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.010
HONESTLY I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.450
DON'T EVEN

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.520
KNOW WHY I PUT

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.880
IT AT THE TOP OF

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.880
KOKOHEAD,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.990
BECAUSE THIS IS

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.420
A TOUGH ONE

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.320
FOR ME. 224

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.290
She says along that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.720
vision, came a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.420
message from

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.460
above. 2135 I

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.890
HEARD HIM SAY

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.660
VERY CLEAR TO

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.960
ME, ANGELA,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.430
EVERYBODY

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.930
NEEDS PRAYER,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.890
BUT NOT

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.290
EVERYONE IS

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.690
WILLING TO

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.530
WALK INTO A

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.960
CHURCH TO

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.400
RECEIVE IT.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.900
2141 And so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.400
Angela brought the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.430
church to the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.880
mountain. It's in the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.400
form of her

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.630
grandpa's old tool

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.300
box, transformed

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.770
into a prayer box.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.070
2156 I DIDN'T

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.440
TELL ANYONE

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.800
ABOUT IT

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.310
BECAUSE EVEN

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.810
IN MY OWN MIND,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.670

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.410

week after week.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.980
Each trek up that

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.510
mountain validating

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.510
Angela's belief, her

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.050
vision was pure,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.580
Angela

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.820
2207JUST THE

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.250
FACT THAT I

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.020
COME UP HERE

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.790
EVERY TIME AND

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.190
IT'S

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.870
OVERFLOWING

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.290
WITH PRAYERS,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.790
NOT EVEN ON

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.790
THE PAPER THAT

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.220
I HAVE LEFT BUT

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.660

A LOT. 2218

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.380
Angela says feels

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.610
there's a need for

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.110
prayer elsewhere.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.470
Plans to put a few

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.200
