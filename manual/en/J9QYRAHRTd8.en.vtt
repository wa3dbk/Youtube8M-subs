Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village we're going
to start our filling for our stuffed cabbage

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:17.689
by preparing our onion and our garlic. Let's
first chop this into a fine diced first cut

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:39.700
the onion in half and remove the outer brown
peel,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.230
and to make a fine dice we're going to just
slice it, you want to leave the root section

00:00:47.230 --> 00:01:02.080
on and slice into the onion 3 or 4 times like
that. And then on the top in quarter inch

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:11.240
increments you want to slice across the top
this way so we're slicing this way about 4

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.909
times a quarter inch increments and then the
top. The root section is holding the whole

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.360
onion together and I only cut to here so that
the root section is holding the whole onion

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.110
together. And then with your fingers bent
so that the knife doesn't cut you your going

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:41.880
to hold the onion and slice across that onion
in quarter inch increments so you get a nice

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.439
fine dice. And then repeat that with the other
half of the onion, to prepare the garlic first

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.149
take the side of the knife and squash the
garlic that will help you remove the skin

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.689
so it comes right off and I'm going to use
a garlic press cause I want to get a fine

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.220
squash up garlic. So you put the garlic into
the garlic press and you hold it and give

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:23.420
it a good squeeze and cut off with your knife
any extra there, you can also open it up and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.390
with the knife just pick out any remainder
garlic in there and we'll mix all that in,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.420
next we're going to add the rest of our ingredients.
