00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.960
PUMA PHONE.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.470
Expected April 2010.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.630
We're always a little bit wary of "celebrity
brand" phones, as they are often just a big

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.619
name slapped on a cheap phone in order to
turn a profit. The PUMA PHONE (yes, it is

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.470
spelled all in capitals) is a little bit different,
because this phone is rather interesting in

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.829
its own right.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.330
The PUMA PHONE is a touchscreen device of
a fairly conventional design, until you turn

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.910
it over and come across the large solar panel
on the back. It is rather like the very rare

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.190
Samsung Blue Earth handset that was announced
last year, except that there's a good chance

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.090
that the PUMA PHONE will make it to retail
outlets.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.109
Before we launch into the dry technical details,
it's worth looking at some of the more offbeat

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.839
features of this phone. The PUMA PHONE includes
an "on demand digital cat" called Dylan who

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.850
is 81kg of.. err.. Puma. There's a "sarcastic
calculator" and a "scratching turntable" too,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.470
because we all like to scratch our MP3s don't
we? The PUMA PHONE also has a comprehensive

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.680
array of somewhat odd "icon messages" you
can use. PUMA also say that it supports "easy

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.960
peasy video calls" through the front facing
camera.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.090
The user interface makes heavy use of red,
white and black colours and very flat looking

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.659
white-on-red icons throughout, something based
on PUMA's corporate colour scheme.. we suspect

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.340
that these strong colours will be a little
bit tiring after a while. Everything does

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.469
look to be very simple to use though, and
that's always a positive thing in a complex

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.990
device like this.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.549
The display is a 2.8" 240 x 320 pixel TFT
unit, on the back is the solar panel plus

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:01.990
a 3.2 megapixel camera and LED flash. The
PUMA PHONE comes with GPS, 3.5G support, a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.119
multimedia player, FM radio and a 3.5mm audio
socket. There's Bluetooth 2.1 and USB connectivity.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.640
One major missing component is WiFi, but other
than this the PUMA PHONE is a fully featured

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.519
touchscreen device.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.160
The PUMA PHONE is designed for those who like
outdoor activities (although we also think

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.940
that it will appeal to couch potatoes) and
it come with a stopwatch, GPS speedo, GPS

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.780
run tracker, pedometer and yachting compass
plus integration into content from PUMA and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.019
social networking sites. Of course, there's
a web browser plus all the other usual features

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.340
built in.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.370
Inside is a smallish 880 mAh battery that
PUMA say can power the phone for up to 4 hours

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.569
talktime on 3G. The PUMA PHONE weighs 115
grams and measures a pocket-friendly 102 x

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.230
56 x 13mm.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.049
The PUMA PHONE itself is manufactured by Sagem,
a company not normally associated with this

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.769
degree of sophistication. Sagem and PUMA announced
a partnership in October 2009 to work together

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.459
to create something distinctive, and the PUMA
PHONE certainly is.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.470
We think that this is an interesting and innovative
device, and that the PUMA PHONE has a good

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.060
chance of being a surprise hit when it hits
the retail market in Europe in April 2010.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.799
