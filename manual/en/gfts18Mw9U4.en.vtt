Hi welcome to Earths Living Clay's
YouTube channel

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.589
Usually I talk to you about clay but today
I wanted to show you

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.849
a new toy that my husband and I got

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.519
for our 11th wedding anniversary this year. It's a Little Guy

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.440
trailer and we are here camping in
Potrero

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.730
California. We're about two miles from
the Mexican border

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.109
off State Route 94. So here's our LIttle Guy trailer

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.580
its a 5 wide. It is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.360
very cool. It's five feet wide.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.390
and inside you can see it's got a

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.200
queen size bed. Very comfortable. It's got
shades for privacy, There's a fan

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.670
overhead for ventilation.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
It's got cabinets which go through to
the other side. I'll show you the little

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.629
kitchen in the back.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.530
This is our maiden voyage with it in
preparation for a trip

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.680
that we are going to be taking out to the Sequoia National Forest

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.810
and Mammoth The doors have

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.610
screens on them which Is awesome for ventilation

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.160
It has a hookup in the back
here for propane gas so you can use

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.100
a big propane tank if you bring that with
you or the little canisters right here.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
And in the back here

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.060
is our kitchen which we love so we don't have to bring our camp stove.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.140
Two burner propane stove  CTO and then
water if you have water hookup.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.259
This is a pass through

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.020
where you can keep some of your camping
supplies which are in boxes.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.490
There's lights back here there's
also

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.530
outlets electrical outlets and then a
cigarette lighter

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.700
charger if you are staying somewhere
where there's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.790
electricity and today there is.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.979
There's water hookups which is
very cool thing so you can

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.300
do dishes and so forth.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.040
We're back around the other side and
same thing and what's really cool

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.060
that we like about this is that it's a pass-through so

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.760
you don't control over one another to
get out of the trailer. It's very comfortable.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.230
It's a queen size mattress

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.700
We really like it so far.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.730
It comes with this shelf

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.720
on it this model did and a window here

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.450
with the privacy screen so we can put
our coolers and other things here.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.620
My husband got this tool chest

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.130
to put a hose and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.320
electrical cable and bungee cords and so
forth. Of course it's got a battery that

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.440
charges off of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.239
the truck or the vehicle that you're
towing it with and it

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.110
would also charge if you're plugging it in if you have electricity where you're staying.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.570
There's also a solar

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.190
attachment that you could buy so that
you can charge from solar if you're going

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.769
primitive camping and you want some electricity.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.739
Really awesome. This is a 2014 model.

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.209
We're very lucky to get it. And these

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.590
Little Guy trailers are made by the Amish. So when they told

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.720
us that  - very excited about it because
the Amish

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.910
are known for making very high quality
items

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.370
and the dealer told us that when

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.919
they went from wherever it was being
manufactured to the Amish

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.079
the production time went up quite a bit
because the Amish take their time. So

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.190
something that might have taken I can't
remember exactly

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.850
27 minutes takes 27 hours because they
build

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.500
really high-quality things. So

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.209
that was a big selling point for us. Anyways just wanted to show you our new

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.970
Little Guy.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.750
