00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.210
Hey Vsauce, I'm Jake and ---

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.570
EXTREME FORKLIFTING.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.440
Cruise through the lot on your lift, picking
up pallets, putting down pallets and getting

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.449
BUCK WILD.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.490
While showing off your forklift skillz, take
lots of pics...

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.690
14px.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.830
A fast paced and extremely fun platformer.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
You play as a tiny inkblot on a mission to
save his friends, collect glowing sparks and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.050
in the process, inadvertently die..again,
and again, and again.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.480
Once you've bested the included 70 levels,
you can go online and build your own.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.230
Then share the death filled levels with friends
so they too can meet the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.230
Reaper.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.760
Reaper is an action RPG that finds you as
the black swordsman, travelling into the WIlderness

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.290
vanquishing enemies with your sword.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.510
You take on different missions given to you
by different people in order to gain XP and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.360
earn gold to purchase better weapons and armor.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.110
The game has a beautiful visual style and
really nice controls making it easy to slice

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.670
through your attackers.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.480
Especially giant wasps.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.009
Stupid wasps.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.110
If you find yourself stuck on a level, well
that is quite the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.030
Kunundrum, a puzzle game that seems easy enough
at first glance.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.980
You send the colored orbs into their corresponding
spots but if there is nothing obstructing

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.050
the orbs path, it will go right past the target.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.330
You have to limit your moves if you want the
highest score and things get hectic when more

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.659
colors, portals and directional arrows are
introduced.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.150
For something a bit simpler, try

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.150
Circa.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.290
Circa is a minimalistic news app that gives
you the facts and highlights of stories, providing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.240
a quick and easy way to get caught up with
current events.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.560
One of the coolest features is that you can
follow certain articles you're interested

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.990
in to be updated when more news occurs.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.460
If you get tired of what's happening in our
world go check out a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.540
Little Galaxy, a game where you jump from
planet to planet collecting stars.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.950
Each celestial body you encounter spins, so
you have to time your launch or else be thrown

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.100
into the vastness of space.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.539
As the game progresses more obstacles like
suns come into play that change the games

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.120
gravity entirely and you have to use them
to boomerang yourself to the destination.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.370
The game has a beautiful visual style and
once on a planet see if it has a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.020
Shufflepuck Cantina, an intergalactic air
hockey game.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.700
It feels like being inside the cantina from
Star Wars except you shoot first, with an

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.849
air hockey puck.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.200
The game is surprisingly immersive for one
centered around a table game but it is also

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
incredibly fun.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
The premise is that you've crash landed on
an alien planet and must earn enough to get

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
a ship that can get you back to Earth.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.359
The cantina is filled with a variety of characters
that you can challenge to a match.

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.290
As you get to know them, you can unlock their
bios which then enables you to play as them.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.010
The more matches you win, the better puck,
mallett, and special moves you can unlock

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.110
on your journey up the levels to supreme victory.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.150
If you aren't great at air hockey, at least
the planet you crashed on has

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.239
Nice Weather.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.249
Similar to Circa, Nice Weather is a very clean
and bare bones app.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.580
It presents the weekly forecast in a beautiful
way, and the background color will change

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.590
depending on time of day and temperature - making
it very easy to track what the temperature

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.060
will be like throughout the day.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.950
Now, take a seat a let me tell you a story...

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.969
of Choices.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.239
The Story of Choices is a pixelated choose
your own adventure game.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.409
You awake as the messenger for the king.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.060
Or you could just snooze instead of waking.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.249
Every decision you make affects future choices
and the final outcome of the game.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.709
Also, it has a pretty rad chiptune soundtrack.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.250
The game is a bit short though so let's continue
the story with this episodes app of the week...

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.340
Device 6.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.169
Device 6 is a...difficult one to describe...it
is a puzzle, mystery, interactive book game.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.450
Visually it is a mash-up of Mad Men and Sean
Connery era James Bond.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.239
You find yourself as Anna who is in a strange
castle and must find out why and how to escape.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.489
Device 6 has incredible sound design and almost
reads like House of Leaves where the text

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.640
becomes a character, splitting in different
directions and forcing you to decide which

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.700
path to follow.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.150
You will spend a lot of time looking weird
in public spinning your phone or tablet trying

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.959
to literally follow the narrative.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.760
I really don't want to give too much away
about this amazingly awesome puzzle mystery

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.749
book game so yeah, get it.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.260
Links to all the apps can be found in the
description below.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:22.669
I'm Jake and, as always, thanks for watching.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:36.870
BOO-nus APPS!

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.680
Dead Effect is a first person shooter on a
spaceship where you blow away zombies.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.840
There are hordes of enemies to mow through
and boss battles to be had but really, who

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.960
doesn't just need some good old zombie huntin
to make the day brighter?

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.530
After the blood bath, take a walk in

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.680
The Dark Meadow.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.250
Dark Meadow is a melee combat horror game.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.199
You wake up in an abandoned hospital not knowing
why with only a voice over the intercom slowly

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.419
filling you in and hinting at the terrors
you have to face.

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.550
As you search the hallways and rooms for clues
you will be greeted by monsters to defeat.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.230
Or just run away from them entirely in

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.650
Nightmare Runner, an endless runner that has
you escaping and shooting at Lovecraftian

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.330
creatures.
