00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:04.800
The cost of going to college
has more than doubled.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.033
And that means students
have to take out more loans.

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.133
It's now to the point where the
average student who borrows to

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:15.467
pay for college graduates
with about $25,000 worth

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:19.033
of debt -- $25,000.

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:23.500
And Americans now owe more for
their student loans than they do

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
on their credit cards.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.200
Now, I want to give you guys
some relief from that debt.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.467
I don't want you to start
off life saddled with debt.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.633
And I don't want your
parents to be taking on

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:36.934
so much debt as well.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.533
(applause)

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:42.500
So if you agree with me, then
I need all of you -- I see a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000
lot of cell phones
here and a lot of --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.033
(laughter)

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.133
-- all kinds of stuff --

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.834
(laughter)

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:50.633
-- I want you to send
a message to Congress.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:54.767
Tell them, "don't
double my rate."

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.233
You should -- "don't
double my rate."

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.233
You should call them,
you should e-mail them,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.800
write on their Facebook
page, tweet them.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.533
(applause)

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.367
Teach your parents how to tweet.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.300
(laughter)

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.834
And use the hashtag
#dontdoublemyrate.

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:22.000
Don't double my rate.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.834
Don't double it.

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:25.834
(applause)

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:29.633
I asked some students at the
University of North Carolina and

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.934
the University of Colorado and
the University of Iowa to do

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:36.133
this last week, and they got it
trending worldwide for a while.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.233
There were, of course -- there
were more of them than there

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.533
were of you.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.333
I had Jimmy Fallon's help.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.667
(laughter)

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:47.633
But what I do expect from each
of you on this and every other

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:51.333
issue that you come to care
about -- I want you guys to

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.967
realize your voice
makes a difference.

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:55.667
Your voice matters.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:59.300
I know sometimes it seems like
it doesn't, but I guarantee you,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.734
members of Congress,
they pay attention.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:07.433
And if they start getting a lot
of folks telling them they care

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:11.166
deeply about something,
it changes their mind.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.133
Sometimes, it
changes their vote.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.767
Don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.834
It doesn't matter how old
you are, what you look like,

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.967
where you come from, or how much
you have -- your voice can make

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:21.967
a difference.

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:30.533
(applause)

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:35.166
So tell Congress now is not the
time to double your interest on

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.667
your student loans.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:39.934
Now is the time to double down
on our smart investments in

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:42.033
building a strong and
secure middle class.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:44.834
Now is the time to double
down on building an America

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:45.867
that lasts.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:49.166
And if we work together,
I guarantee you we will

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.066
meet our challenges.

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.233
When I met your classmates,
when I look out at your faces,

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.834
it gives me confidence
about our future.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:58.667
(applause)

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.266
I believe in you.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:04.433
And I believe you're
going to do great things.

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:07.967
And I believe your generation
will remind the world just why

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.000
it is America is the
greatest nation on Earth.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.867
Thank you, everybody.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:11.600
God bless you.
