My Room Rules Anna

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.090
Hi my name is Anna, and welcome to my room.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.050
I love my bed so much because I have my great Pottery Barn cover.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.290
I have some pretty palm tree pillows and its really comfortable now sleeping on it because I got a special mattress. 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:36.120
Then next to my bed is my beautiful bed size table, I got it for Christmas the paint matches my favorite color.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:46.160
right next to my bed is my desk which has a good area so I can sit down and do my homework.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:58.020
It has books and my all of my stuff animals and some dolls. My Grandmother, my Grandparents have given me from their past trips. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:18.230
And then we have my vanity, well its not exactly a vanity. I kind of just made it from a table and I got a mirror and I put all my make-up on it.  And then I have my closet.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:31.230
Good thing about my closet it has these great hooks that I can use to hang up old towels and sweatshirts.  Then

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:49.200
I have this great shoe shelf that I can put on my shoes, some of my extra clothes and a weird thing about me, is that for some reason I love to collect shopping bags. I have a lot of bags that I have shopped with.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:59.190
Well another great thing about my closet is this nice fuzzy shag rug.  I can step on. On a rainy day I put my rain boots on and I'm out the door.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.270
Thanks for watching I hoped you enjoyed my room.
