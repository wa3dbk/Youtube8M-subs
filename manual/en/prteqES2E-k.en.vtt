Is all about using your phone

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.630
transfer data or have your data accessible from your computer or tab situated at home

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.250
So let's say this is one room at home with tab and PC

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.640
And here we are for example in the office or at home of someone else

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.110
And you want to run a video, which is stored on your home PC

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.540
You should go to SamsungApps.com, where you can download AllShare control App. It's for free.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.250
You should create an Samsung Account and synchronize PC with your phone... 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.680
... which acts as a mobile remote control

00:00:52.923 --> 00:00:57.235
Let's say you want to show video to your friend, which is stored on your PC at home

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:02.550
This PC could be on different Wi-Fi or other connection

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.930
But important is having your smartphone and TV, you want to show your movie in, on the same network

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960
You want to show video...

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.500
...You press AllShare

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.620
You choose PC

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.720
If you want to stream it only on your smartphone only press this icon

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:50.040
If you want to stream it to this TV screen, click this small icon

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:02.460
And press TV, now your smartphone is searching available devices connected to the same network

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.220
Now it is going to run on the TV

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.850
Via smartphone you can also adjust volume by side buttons

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.340
And same applies for photographs, music and other content, which is supported by AllShare.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.560
It works even with web storage via Sugar Sync

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.630
It works on the same basis, you should download SharePlay

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.790
Here you have it divided among categories

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.100
Then you choose, whether you want to stream photos from USB disc, camera or... 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.220
...web storage, which works the same way.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:14.960
Even the Samsung laptop is off, it can be turned on by application on your Samsung smartphone 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.510
And this is how it works.
