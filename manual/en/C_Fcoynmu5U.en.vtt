00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.266
- Ta  da!
- Whoa. Hey, what is that?

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.500
This is a list of everything
we need to buy today.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
Really?  All that?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.533
All that.  Broom's Mart's
having a sale right now.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.966
We'd better hurry
before they're

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.033
sold out of everything
we need.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:38.433
- Can I get a video game?
- I want a new teddy-bear.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.133
You guys, I'm afraid those
things aren't on the list.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:46.866
Okay, buckle up, you two.
Here we go!

00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.466
- Okay.
- Yeah!

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.300
Oh. All of these cars.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.466
Over there. Mom. Look.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:04.100
Huh? Yes!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.033
Goodness, are you alright?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.966
Oh, my, we're too late.

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.600
Mom, look. There's one.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.166
Where is it? Ah!

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.733
Oh! There's
already a car there.

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.633
Well mom, looks like
this isn't going to work.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:28.166
I'm not giving up. Huh?

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.000
- A parking spot!
- A parking spot!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900
Hooray!

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.066
O-kay.

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.733
Helly, so how's
traffic in town?

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.666
Actually, Broom's Mart
is having a sale,

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.866
and all the roads
around it are jammed up.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.733
Oh, no, I forgot
all about the sale.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.633
Oh, I was going to get
a new bathing suit,

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.933
but what if
they're all sold out?

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.933
Jin, don't you think
we should worry about

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:59.833
the traffic problem first?
Helly, let's move out!

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.200
Okay.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:11.333
Okay. Now, just wait
for me to get the door.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.400
Huh? Watch out!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.366
You should be
more careful, Mom.

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.500
I told you to wait!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.166
- Are you okay, Mommy?
- Yes, I'm okay.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.366
Stop! Okay, please go now!

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:34.933
I think it's
under control now.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:37.766
Helly, how does it
look over there?

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:41.500
Well, I've still got a lot of
cars headed to the store.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.966
Really? Okay,
I'm coming to help.

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.533
- Okay!
- So late! I am so late!

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:51.333
Huh? What's going on?

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:54.600
That car is
not driving safely.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.866
Hey, Mom.
I'll go put this back.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.633
Woo-hoo!

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:17.400
Huh? There's that car...

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.833
Oh, yeah. Full speed ahead!

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.000
Awesome! Yeah-yow!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.666
Oh. There's nowhere to park.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.100
Kevin!

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.533
Huh? Watch out!

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.600
No, stop!

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:45.500
Kevin!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.633
Oh man.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.900
Parking lots are
dangerous places.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.266
You should always
watch your children in them.

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:57.633
Oh, it happened so fast.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.866
As for you ma'am.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:01.666
You cannot drive that fast
when you're in a parking lot.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:05.866
I'm just so sorry. 
I was afraid I'd miss the sale.

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:09.500
Kevin, Suji, you both
need to listen to me carefully

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.400
and be cautious from now on.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.600
- Right.
- Right.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.033
You should not run or
play in a parking lot,

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:20.233
because you never know when
or where a car may pop out.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.666
It's very dangerous.

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:27.000
And it's easy to stumble over
a speed bump or parking block,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.266
so you should always walk slowly
and look where you're going.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.333
Also, remember before
you get out of a car,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.600
To make sure the car
has completely stopped,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.500
And make sure no cars
around you are moving.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
When you are
in a parking garage,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.900
It is very dark
and hard to see,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.166
So always be sure
to walk with an adult.

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:52.633
And also, Kevin!
You have got to know,

00:04:52.633 --> 00:04:54.966
It's extremely
dangerous to ride a bicyle

00:04:54.966 --> 00:04:57.033
or shopping cart
in a parking lot!

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:00.333
- Understand?
- Yes, I do, Poli.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:07.900
Listen, Mom, are we
ever going to get home?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.800
Almost done.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.266
Okay, maybe if
I put this over here...
