00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.170
I wish that I could tell you
how much I love you.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:23.870
I wish there were some way for you to see
how much you're treasured,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:32.590
but it can't be measured
that's an economic fallacy.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.510
You see value is subjective--
it cannot be expressed

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.100
in numbers that have meaning
anywhere but in my chest.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.630
So I can't say I love you more than
any other man,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:02.700
but baby know I'll love you
like only an economist can.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.460
I know it sound pedantic
and slightly unromantic.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.760
Sometimes I wish that I were Adam Smith
My labor's been accruing,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:32.060
all these hours that I've spent wooing,
a metric I could prove my lovin' with.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.860
But value is subjective
it cannot be expressed

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.240
in numbers that have meaning
anywhere but in my chest,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.820
so I can't say I love you more than
any other man,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:00.250
but baby know I'll love you
like only an economist can.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:11.939
Come on, weirdo, don't you see
it don't matter how much you love me,

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:17.730
you know very well it's not our fate.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.769
You can't just add your love to mine,
what would we get when they combine,

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.249
we'd have nothin' baby,
we'd have nothin' baby,

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.319
cuz love ain't something you can aggregate
Value is subjective

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.920
wait...are you talking to me?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160
Yes, I'm talking to you, you creep!

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.760
You've been following me all day with that
guitar singing that ridiculous song about

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760
how you'll love me like an economist, and
I've had enough of it!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:56.419
I don't want you to love me, I don't want
to be loved by an economics major, economics

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.359
majors are weird!

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.559
No, no you don't understand.

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.439
I'm not singing to you, I'm singing to Ron
Paul.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.439
Ron Paul?

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.590
Yeah, on your T-shirt.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.590
I really like your shirt.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.590
Oh.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.590
Well, thank you.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.590
I like it too.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.489
Bet you I like it more.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.489
Really?

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.489
Are you sure about that?

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.489
Don't you remember?

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.379
Oh, of course,
But value is subjective

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.799
it cannot be expressed
in numbers that have meaning

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.120
anywhere but in my chest,
so I can't say I love you more than

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.439
any other man,
but baby know I'll love you

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.719
like only an economist can.
