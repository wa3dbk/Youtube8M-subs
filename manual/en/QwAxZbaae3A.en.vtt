00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.900
welcome to wire guild this tutorial has

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.990
already been shown in the making jewellery magazine which is a

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.749
a UK magazine but the way I'm gonna show
you has a lot more

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:13.589
detail

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.150
so it's gonna be a slideshow tutorial
and this is the ring

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.900
gonna make and then towards the end I'm gonna show you how its versatile

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.070
so I'm gonna use about 16 inches

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.740
of 18-gauge or 1mm round wire and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.059
a piece about six inches long of naught point four mil or 26 gauge

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.480
I focal bead and then there are some little  accent beads just round the edge to make it

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.879
look

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.640
like flower.  Now I have taken centre of my wire and have placed

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.879
in the end of my ring mandrel and started
wrapping around

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.559
and I'm gonna keep wrapping this round until I've got 5

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.010
full wraps and you can see one wire is going out one way 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.780
one wire is coming the other way so it's 5
full-circles.  So if I take it off

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.940
the under side looks like that

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.409
now this is where you need your finer wire and what we're going to do

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.490
start now and wrap that finer wire

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.659
around your

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.740
your coils,  and I've gone
round about four or five times

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.090
there but I'm going to take that little end bit that I have got and just wrap it around the single wire

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.720
Can you see off there to the left

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.909
I have just bound it around a couple of times. 
and then what I will do is just trim that off 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.049
so it is nice and flat

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.929
Put the circle all the way on your ring mandrel. And wrap the wires around

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.460
I am going to show you this from
lots of different directions

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.630
and then you can take those two wires

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.020
once they come to the top.  Nd wrad them around the circles

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.830
As if that up-right circle was a bead. We are working it the same way.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.340
So you are wrapping around just one full time
around

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.640
so those rings are stood up. You can probably see 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.280
better from that picture not such quite good one
is that

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.720
once you've wrapped around should be
able to slide the whole thing off the

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.610
ring mandrel

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.390
and then using a pair of pliers just
carefully 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.730
get hold of one of your ends and feed it around

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.940
through the shank.   Now I'm supporting the
five

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.450
rings in one hand and I'm wrapping the wire

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.430
around shank trim off with the snips
close as you can get

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.490
I'm only going around once it only needs once and then what I'll do is press that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.930
down with my pliers onto the two wires that are the ring shank

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.260
Now I am going to do exactly the same with the
other side

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.220
So I have wrapped around once. I then use my

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.690
my and snips and I'll trim that off as close as I can get it.   Remember

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.250
cut side always on the outside of a ring
you don't want to cut

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.880
edge on the inside of a ring it could hurt. Then press that down

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.810
with my pliers

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.220
So what you've got is two wires going around the shank

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.459
and then these to five wires on the top

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.560
and your wire is still attached your fine wire

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.000
you only wrapped it around once so that's now
still attached

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.989
so what we're going to do now is to
start in to change the x5

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.560
loops that will happen top into five
petals

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.470
now the easiest way to do that is to start
with the fingers

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.600
and just gently  open up

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.220
the little rings, just the outside two

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.980
the others will splay slightly and you
can get your pliers

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.730
and just one at a time you can bring

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.080
the circle down

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.330
and then, so you can see now that one is
flat

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.550
the wires that we wrapped around the
inside have gone sort of 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.410
slant ways. Katie corner ways,  but don't
worry about that.  so I have then taken down the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.800
one at the other side

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.410
and then I'll take down

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.750
on to the next ones and I'm just easing
that out and bringing it down

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.020
so that's it lays flat.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.290
Now you  see how that one has gone a little bit out of shape

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.090
because I gave it a bit of a tug - a little bit too hard - I left that bit on purpose so that you can see

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.510
and then I can  get my next ring in and then

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.050
I'm just going to shove it with my fingers
because really a flower

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.070
does not have to be perfect

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.229
shaped a flower can be anything to be a
flower

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.250
just need to perfect circles so once
we've got them all flat

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.270
I can start then &amp; shove with my fingers

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.610
so that I sort of even them up a little
bit cos

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.729
you don't want them

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.169
missions not too bad uneven you know me
so now I've got

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.409
5 petals down and I've still got my fine
wire

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.009
and I'm gonna pass that up to the top
and add a bead

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.870
now I've had a slightly flattened, it's an emerald bead is this

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.610
and it's a little bit mis-shapen but it's rather nice.  So I have gone

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.879
underneath and back up to the top and
then what are probably do is pass it

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:11.729
through again

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.029
there you go, you can see it there.  You see how it's just proud

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:22.009
of the wire work and then the wire comes back 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.569
to the top again so you have sort of stitched it on
this if you are

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.719
you stitch in a button to place a
something now I'm threading my beads on

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.189
that are going to go around the edge. I have started with three

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.569
and I'm gonna keep going. until I have enough
beads to go all the way around

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.899
so you see I have got seven amber beads here and they a bit misshapen

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:48.309
Would probably need 8 if they were 4mm but these are just a bit bigger

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:53.810
and I've gone back down underneath the
ring

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.780
and I'm just wrapping around - If you sort of

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.610
loop the wire around under the beads in a circular motion

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.810
you can then go back through again to 
finish it off

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.100
wrap it round anywhere just can, a couple
times, you know just

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.630
loop it round.  I've gone through that loop that you can see them, now pull it

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.160
tight

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.830
and I'll wrap round 2-3 times and then just
using a pair of pliers

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.810
I can just snip that off

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.780
and sort of press it down to make sure it

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.630
now as you can see i've get three one looks
like a ring in the other two don't

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.970
what I have done is  one that looks
like a ring

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.170
which is great but then what you can do is get hold of the shank of 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.780
the ring and pull it apart to separate it

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.850
once you have separated it

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.380
keep going until its all away flat

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.420
so it's totally flattened the piece

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.790
out and you have what looks like

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.070
I'm an extra couple of petals

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.060
it's a slightly larger than the ones
we've got on the ring

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.450
not the more you can do she can

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.370
i'd to make yourself arm a bracelet like
this which is literally

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.310
a ribbon passes through those two loops
and then tied onto the wrist

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.980
Or you can make a pin.   this is the same
bead

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.340
and all I've done is a swirl around the top

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.020
and then rounded the end up and you see
it passes through the first two extra

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.490
wires

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.760
flattened out quite neatly and you will
sit through a

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.110
jumper or something like that tall a
scarf

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.669
and held on that way

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.280
so nice and simple very versatile

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.570
I hope you like it.   HAPPY WRAPPING!
