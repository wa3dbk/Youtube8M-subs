00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370
ALEXANDRA GREEN:
And 12 students pursuing a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.980
certificate in musical performance.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.780

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:13.280
[singing]

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.170
GABRIEL CROUCH:
Do I sing, as well?

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.600 position:58%
I sing during rehearsal all the time.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.680
I try to join in every part,
as well, if I possibly can.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.330
You know, obviously, bass and
tenor are sort of easy, but the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.430 position:61%
sopranos will tell you that I have this

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.680
squealy falsetto voice.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.170
[singing, laughter]

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.890 position:66%
I do still sing in my spare time, as well.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.790 position:56%
Before I came here, I was actually a

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.240
professional singer.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.050
You know, I came here because
I wanted to do this instead.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.700 position:58%
ARYEH NUSSBAUM COHEN:
To have the opportunity to sing under

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.390
a conductor who cares so deeply
about each and every

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.140
individual in the choir, and
every moment of music that we

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.780
make, is really, really inspiring.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.570 position:69%
EMILY SUNG:
I always learn something new from rehearsal.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.560 position:78%
Not just one new thing, but many, many new things.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.180
He manages to be interesting
for two hours at a time,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.290
without a break.


00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.780
And so people watch him and
they really pay attention.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.520
NATHANIEL FLEMING:
For those two hours, you're able to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.020
immerse yourself in something
else, and something that you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.830
all have in common.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.410 position:61%
That experience makes it much more fun.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:58.220
[singing]

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.570 position:69%
GABRIEL CROUCH:
The only thing that you really need to do to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.400
be in Glee Club is to have some

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.880
experience of reading music.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.720
EMILY SUNG:
We only have seven music majors,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.390
which I think is a testament
to how possible it is to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.770
participate in music here, even
if you don't want to turn

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.130
it into the focus of your life.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:04:06.000
[singing]
