00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.930
Aaron: Hi guys.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.930
It's Aaron ...

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.930
Christina: And I'm Christina.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.920
Aaron: Here again with Dance Time Square in
New York City and today we're going to be

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.719
talking about our turning basic action in
our Cha-Cha.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.480
So we're going to demonstrate this separately,
the man's and the lady's part.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.010
And I'm going to start with the gentleman's
part.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.040
And what we're going to do is start with our
basic action again, guys.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:32.340
We're going to start with our left foot to
our side, one, two, three, cha, cha.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.180
One, two, three, four, and one.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.329
Now as we rock back this time, guys, we're
going to turn as much as is comfortable to

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.859
our left.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:54.019
We're going to rotate this action, stepping
back, replace, side together side, two, three,

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.149
four, and one.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.109
Rotating again, two, three, four, and one.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.850
So, as we are stepping back on our right foot,
again guys, we are rotating to our left, and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.130
as we're going to see, Christina is going
to demonstrate for the girls as she steps

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.270
forward on her left foot.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.000
She's going to be making this same rotational
action.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.600
Christina: All right, so ladies, again it's
the basic pattern that we know, and we're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.120
just going to add some rotation.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.750
For the ladies, it's going to be as we're
stepping forward on our left foot.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.440
So if we start up here, we have one, two,
three, four, and one.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.219
Now as I take this forward step with my left,
I'm going to rotate to the left, two, three,

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:55.609
four, and one, two, three, four, and one,
two, three, four, and one, two, three, four,

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:04.759
and one, two, three, four, and one, two, three,
and so on and so forth, turning slowly to

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:05.759
the left.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.220
Aaron: Now something very important to pick
up and notice there too, is that as Christina

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.980
was turning, notice she wasn't moving her
arms or this upper carriage, this dance frame

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.730
that we've worked so hard to achieve up until
now.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.370
So what we want to do is notice that she was
just moving, again, her body, to turn and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.950
rotate this step, as opposed to trying to
steer the car.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.180
OK?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.659
So now let's try this with a partner.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:49.510
And one, two, three, four, and one, two, three,
four, and one, rotating as we step back, guys,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:00.450
three, four, and one, two, three, four, and
one, two, three, four, and one.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.459
Christina: Now let's try that to music.
