00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.690
I was on a high for about a week none of
my friends knew I was talking about

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.880
you're like what on earth are you so
happy for I just played in Symphony Hall!

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.040
After all the hard work and sacrifice the
opportunity to play for audiences and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.540
some of the world's finest music halls
is a great reward

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.660
I was pretty nervous

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.920
but at the same time I was excited
because it's not something you do every

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.320
day like being in symphony hall and I
thought it was really cool and amazing

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.520
I think they expect us to be like not
really talented but like since like some

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.020
of them are really young but then when
they hear us a like wow but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.400
Federico is

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.100
quick to give the kids the proper
perspective on their performance what I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.199
always tell the kids is that they need
to get it right at least once then if it

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.310
doesn't happen at the moment of the
concert it's fine even professional

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.160
orchestras even great orchestras make
mistakes. when it all comes together you

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.080
sit there and your hearts bursting with
pride because you see their pride and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.360
you see their accomplishment and it's
like nothing else

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.140
I really believe that there are many
places around where art makes so much

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.299
sense music makes so much sense

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.010
the Boston youth symphony orchestras the
future of classical music is here
