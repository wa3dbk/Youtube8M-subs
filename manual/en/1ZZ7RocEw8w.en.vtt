00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.640
While DoDonpachi Blissful Death (or Dai Ou
Jou) was the fourth title in the DonPachi

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.990
series, it was also considered the first true
sequel to DoDonPachi.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.380
For those on iOS devices, it's CAVE's second
release of the series for the platform, and

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.570
for those following the story of the series
this makes it an interesting release as it

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.520
puts you in control of the very ships and
dolls that went on to become your enemies

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.030
in 'Resurrection'.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.570
The tangled, weaving storyline of the DonPachi
series is not an easy one to tease apart if

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.980
you've not paid attention, but I'll try to
summarize.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260
The DonPachi Corps (of which you are apart
of) originally recruited its members by having

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.620
them slaughter masses of their comrades to
prove they were the 'best' pilots available

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.589
to stop a machine-invasion.

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.920
The commander eventually goes mad, attempting
to destroy Earth and is eventually thwarted,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.309
with the remaining crew locked away to rot
in caves on the moon.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.319
This is where Blissful Death kicks off as
they've rebuilt and you must defend the colonies

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.530
on the moon using your piloting skills, boosted
by 'dolls' (or slave AI's).

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.280
Cue a solid and subtly complex bullet-hell
shooter that provides you with several ship

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.550
configuration variations, including two base
types (fast ship, narrow fire range, or slow

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.720
ship, wide fire range) and three 'dolls' that
provide perks to either your ships bullets

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.800
or lasers.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.730
As usual you're thrown up against hideously
ridiculous odds, albeit with a lot of firepower

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.070
at your disposal.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.900
Chain-kills provide you with more points,
while a 'hyper' bar can be built up, resulting

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.530
in the ability to collect up to five tokens
that act as a form of ultimate weapon.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.700
Subtle touches such as bullets actually becoming
*faster* after activating the mode offset

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.460
any reduction in difficulty this weapon provides,
though players can reset things with a bomb

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.560
or two.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.560
So basically, it's everything you've come
to expect of a CAVE release, albeit without

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.320
the iPhone specific tweaks that made earlier
releases so much more fun to delve in to.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.580
Almost nothing is lost in this translation
of the title - the game is as smooth and beautiful

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.720
as ever - though as always the price for this
is a fourth-gen or higher iDevice requirement.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.560
If you love the DonPachi series, or CAVE games
in general, there's definitely no reason to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.720
miss this release - it's not as nuanced as
Resurrection, but it's no less complex or

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.970
insanely fun for being the older title.
