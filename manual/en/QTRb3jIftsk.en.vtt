00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.360
Hi, my name is Casey Wilcox. I'm the executive chef of Justine's, a French brasserie.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.460
Today we're going to talk about choosing the right knife. The knife is the most important

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.610
tool you'll have in the kitchen. It's something that you'll use in almost anything you make whether

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.660
you're cooking it or just making a salad. We'll talk now about the parts of the knife.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.780
This of course is the blade and tip.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.810
Here's the tang of the knife. It's the steel that runs inside the handle. Some knives

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.880
it's inside the wooden handle — you won't see it at all.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.920
And another part of the knife is the bolster. It's kind of an added weight to the end

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.000
of the blade. If you want to cut through some chicken bones or pumpkins

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.040
you can push through a little bit with the extra weight of the bolster. If you're going to look for

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.160
a knife, and it's going to be your only knife or your first knife, you're going to want to go with an 8 inch chef knife.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.250
A chef's knife is what you're going to use 90% of the time.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.360
When you hold the chef's knife, you're going to want to grip it with two fingers, just above

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.470
the heel of the knife, and then wrap the rest of the fingers in a relaxed grip around the handle.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.590
Feel how it feels in your hand. You should feel like you can be able to control every bit of the knife.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
An 8 inch chef knife is the most popular and also easy to maintain.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.740
And it's what I use in the kitchen most of the time. If you decided you're going to get your 8 inch

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.760
chef knife, the two choices truly are between Japanese and German knives.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.870
This is a traditional German knife. It's high carbon steel. There is stainless mixed

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.980
into it, so it will not stain. They're stouter and sturdier. Their edge

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.070
moves from a finer point to a stouter point.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.160
So they will dull a little faster, but because

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.260
of their even composition, they're easier sharpen, and they're less

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.440
likely to become damaged. The Japanese knives were traditionally made with a single

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.510
edge, and this knife here is a good example of it. You can see the blade edge is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
all on this one side and nothing on the other. It makes for a thinner blade

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.670
that is less damaging to food, but it's also a little more fragile.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.730
The next most common knife in the kitchen is going to be the paring knife.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.790
They're going to be used for smaller tasks — things in your hand. You're going to grip it with four fingers.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.820
I kind of leave one finger over the blade. The top finger kind of guides the blade and the thumb

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.920
is free. The other knife that you want to have in your kitchen for sure is

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.960
a serrated knife. It's what you're going to go to for bread, if you have something like a really

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.040
ripe tomato. It does a little bit more damage to the edge because you're doing that sawing motion, but you're not

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.230
smushing food that's easily smushed. I like to have something that has a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.260
curved edge, like a chef's knife, or an offset edge

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.450
like this. But if you have a knife like this that doesn't have

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.590
a curved or offset edge, you end up dragging your knuckles on the table and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.770
you can't get all the way through something because you end up having an angle like this

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.860
where there's a gap underneath. So what you'll do at home to keep your knives

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.930
sharpened between uses is you'll hone them with a steel. Hold the steel in your

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.020
left hand, if you're right handed, and the knife in your right. And you're going to hold the knife just

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.080
like you're going to cut with it. And the angle of edge is the angle that you would like to hold your

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.180
knife on the steel because what we're doing is restoring that angle. And you'll run it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.320
down the whole way and then the opposite side. And you want to get the whole

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.390
edge of the blade. And what the steel does is as you run it along

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.450
the side of the knife, it brings the whole edge back into a true

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.510
straight edge. Bottom line is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.590
there is no universally perfect knife. Go to a shop that lets you try them out

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.689
so you leave with something that you're happy with. I'm Casey Wilcox for Co+op, stronger together.
