00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.450
Make sure your skin reflect the best of itself

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.160
Apply your foundation with a flat brush

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.700
And apply your favorite foundation. Mine is Maybelline in color sable

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.260
Make sure that your skin is a little bit brown so I going to use the Soleil de Rose by Terry

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.530

Make sure that your skin is a little bit brown so I going to use the Soleil de Rose by Terry

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.480
and the eye and chicks and matify my T zone to make sure that my skin doesn't go wet if I am sweating during my interview

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:17.250
Take a flat brush which is the 150 from MAC and roll it all around the T zone. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.290
You don't need to use all the same products. I am using here the rose de rose by Terry.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.360
which I am going to use with a flat brush. This one is the 191 by MAC

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:43.930
Place that in the upper of my chick and on the temples

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.690
Make sure your eyebrows are perfectly prepare and perfectly done

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.120
I am using here the eyebrow pencil from MAC

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.050
Try to work with your eyebrow line rather than change it

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.040
Ok now you have finish your eyebrows. Now apply your base to make sure the eyeshadow stick on nicely

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.770
I am using Réserve Naturelle shadestick which I am blending with my finger

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.890
Pick your favorite eye lighter. I am using here the number 6 by terry which is really nice

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:31.490
Which I am placing under my eyebrow and in the inner part of my eye

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.580
Step two : Line your lash line

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.240
Brown pencil on the upper eyelid 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:57.960
After you've blend your eyes you will blend the line to make sure it is really nice with the same brush you used for your eye lighter

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.970
Next take some color. I am using here an apricot base color this is the n°10 by Terry

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:15.000
Place this on the top of the eye pencil and all along the eyelid.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.880
Ok for this interview day you want your eyes to stand out a little more so take a really nice deep color

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.500
I am using here a deep blue color, the n°11 by Terry

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.490
Place this color in the outer part of your eye and I bring it all over in the inner corner

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.940
I make sure I blend it with a highlighter so it is nicely smoked

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.110
and strench it towards the temple

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.940
Line up the waterline with the same pencil we used 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.330
and don't forget to blend under the lash line

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.430
Once everything is nicely blended you want an eye a little bit more sophisticated and trendy

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:16.720
Line up your eyes with some gel eye liner. I am using here Maybelline with a flat brush all the way between the lash line

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.160
This make up is perfect for brown eyes, blue eyes, green and grey eyes. So try up!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:37.220
Put your mascara on (Shock Volume from mascara vipera cosmetics) and finish with your lipstick (lipgloss dollymix Bare essentials)

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:18.060
