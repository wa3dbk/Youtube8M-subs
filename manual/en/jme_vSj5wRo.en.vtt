00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
The Brainiac Hall of Fame is a fitting tribute 
to some of the men, who have

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.500
pushed forward the boundaries of science.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.690
Men like Einstein, Sir Isaac Newton, 
???

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.439
and, of course, Jon Tickle. 
But today we're here to solve the problem

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.529
between two of the brightest stars of science:

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.999
Galileo and Aristotle.
They couldn't agree on one of history's most

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.239
burning questions:

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.769
do heavy objects fall quicker than light
objects.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.340
 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.350
This is a pillow and this is a cooker.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
Both household objects, but both used for
very different purposes,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.340
as I know from bitter experience. 
The cooker weights 400 times more than

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.460
the pillow. 
John, what do you think is gonna happen?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.769
Well, Aristotle will say that the cooker is
gonna fall

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.780
400 times as fast as the pillow, 
whilst Galileo will maintain that

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.540
they'll hit the ground at the same time.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.570
I'm with Galileo: the mass of the
object has absolutely nothing to do with

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.500
-- the speed with which it will fall.
-- I think the cooker is gonna land first

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.660
-- and the pillow will float down gently.
-- Let's find out. Come on, let's go and find out.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.190
(Noo! This is science! They're gonna fall exactly the same way!)

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.180
Myth has it that (???) 
Galileo proved that light and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.630
heavy objects fall at the same speed 
by dropping 2 cannon balls

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.600
of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Meanwhile,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.649
in ancient Greece, Aristotle thought light

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.340
and heavy objects fall at very different speeds.
But being a typical philosopher,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.470
he never bothered testing anything in the
real world

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.759
So it falls to us to winch a cooker

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.479
and a pillow up to a height of 60 meters
and finally answer the question.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.000
-- We'll see who's right now, Vic.
-- I think we'll find that it's me.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.340
--Goggles on. --Right. Yeah.
--Let it drop

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.020
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.420
 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.680
 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.320
And the pillow still floats! I think I won that round there!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460
follows leisurely in its wake

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.640
I I

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.060
leopold website gotta wasn't completely
right

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.390
aristotle was incompletely right was it
because if he was right they perform

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.050
four hundred times as boss

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.930
the pillow now clearly that wasn't the
case West 101st John

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.330
k big cookie landed first thank you so
much for the cooker in the pillow

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.270
the let's give galileo the benefit of
the doubt to drop two balls a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.060
differing white from 56 meters the same
height

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.069
Leaning Tower of Pisa well

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.980
its $1 mil to Aristotle but now we're on
girl allows home ground

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.940
with two balls up dramatically different
way to go cannonball

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.600
and the football was corrupt John well
make I'll be having a think

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.940
and I reckon the lack of aerodynamic
properties are the Paleo combined with

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.190
this relatively low mass

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.090
meant it was more susceptible to a
resistance now as you pointed out vastly

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.660
different masses on these bowls

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.239
the same aerodynamic shapes a resistant
shouldn't be a factor

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.550
so which ones gonna hit the gram for
gonna come for the same rate and hit the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.820
ground at the same time

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.160
I think you'll find it's a cannonball no
no no and no I'm not gonna prove you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.870
wrong

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.329
for the first time in four hundred years
two bowls a different way

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.450
dropped from the height of the world's
most famous 1p bell tower

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.489
I have absolute faith and I a friend
ally

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.670
a line-in cannonball yet Ross Campbell

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.630
but as a football field with their it
doesn't know that the same shape so

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.950
they're gonna hit the ground at exactly
the same time

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.950
I reckon let it drop

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.480
map

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.599
mind

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.880
saw another result that only a man who's
taking completely the senses

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.810
wouldn't describe as a total victory for
Aristotle

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.840
the which landed first well technically
the cannonball

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.140
got there technically it dead got a
theory about it though

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.620
yeah lie objects like the football will
only accelerate for certain amount of

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.440
time until

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.610
a resistance counteracts acceleration
due to gravity now reaches steady speed

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.269
known as the terminal velocity

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.770
with a heavy object like a cannonball a
resistance in such a factor it won't

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.900
reaches terminal velocity so do we know
about that would like to have the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.120
experiment in the mail us vacuum and
then a resistance wouldn't be a factor

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.350
well we couldn't arrange for analysis
vacuum out car park instead we've got

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.650
heavy Lori whale and an even heavier
Daewoo Nexia

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.900
to object unavailable to I the Kalalau

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.560
holler stop the objects have been as
well according to John

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.740
contract a resistance over the sixty me
to drop

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.880
and we showed finally know which if
they'll

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.520
poppins was right Friday way

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.780
so one let it dry up

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.840
Colin the a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.490
him well you Aristotle

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.220
take a resistance after the equation
that you get neck neck

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.050
freefall a both objects you can clearly
see the whales and a much heavier cop

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.730
falling

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.090
at the same right just as

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.390
galileo predicted a

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.980
I knew I was gonna happen you know what
your walls

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.140
no our store for more than a profit on
Thursday as a philosopher

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.630
yeah I'll own you you have to do
experiment arable just thought you

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.010
should know about will but thinking
about it job

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.730
yak yak yak conclusive proof that gotta
lay low

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.500
was correct absolutely yes all
