00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.060
Hi, I am Dk, and we are here together with

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.520
Artemis, Elektra and Annalina.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.440
In Dance Club school we are not only teaching social european/foreign dances,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.160
but also Greek traditional and folk dances.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.160
Today we are going to teach you,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.660
the basic step in Hasapiko.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.020
Generally, Hasapiko dance has 16 figures,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.140
but each of them,most of them actually,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.040
completed by basic step,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:49.000
which will be demonstrated right now.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.200
Basic step in Hasapiko starts

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.100
with our left leg free

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.280
we are doing a forward step

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.800
Then, right foot, which has no weight,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.960
pointing left foot back.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.520
Since has no weight,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.840
there is no transfer of weight,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.220
you lift it free forward.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.820
This is what we call a kick.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
A step back with right foot,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.840
so now left foot is free,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.980
to do the same lift, "kick",

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.540
and do a step back.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.620
Afterwards,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
we swing right foot,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.400
front of left foot.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.220
Due to the fact that right foot has no weight,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.460
we are doing a step forward,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460
left foot cross over right, transfer of weight,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.680
and flip, swing, this time left foot front of right,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.920
and heel point.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.920
Hasapiko's basic step,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.080
is a sequence of these steps.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.860
We are going to demonstrate it all together,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740
in order to be clearly specified.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.820
Left foot free and we are doing a step forward,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.000
right foot pointing back of the left foot,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.900
a free foot lift like a kick with right foot,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.380
a step back,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.680
a left foot kick,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.440
step back,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.640
cross right to left foot,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180
a step forward with right foot,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.960
a step forward with left foot and transfer of weight back to right,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.340
cross left to right foot,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340
and heel point.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.060
As a sequence to the music beat,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.680
is as follow,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.800
Left foot free,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.260
Forward step,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.040
point,

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.320
kick,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.320
second kick,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.460
step back, cross,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.420
step forward,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.000
step forward,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.440
step back, cross and heel.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.500
Ladies will now demonstrate it again,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060
hands hold,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.780
left foot free and forward,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.100
step, point, kick,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.660
and kick , back step, cross,

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.560
step forward and forward,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560
step back , cross and heel point.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.420
So let's dance our basic step in music.
