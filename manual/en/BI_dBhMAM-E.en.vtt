Hello my name is Graiano from restaurant Krizia
from Budapest Hungary on behalf of Expert

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.380
Village. I'm going to teach you how to make
Italian food.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:23.911
We are going to make the Bolognese sauce.
We have here the ingredients: onion, celery,

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:36.060
carrot, ground meat. We can use pork meat
or beef meat or both, mix it. We have tomato

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:57.500
puree, fresh aromas, red wine and nutmeg.
We have to chop the vegetables, half a onion

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:26.230
for this quantity of meat, which is 1 kilo
of meat. We chop the onion, also we chop the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:35.690
carrot the same way into small squares. You
can ground, of course, the vegetables if you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:44.350
prefer but the best way is if you cut them.
Crush a little bit of the celery then chop

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.450
it too.
