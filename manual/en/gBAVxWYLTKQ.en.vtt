Hi, Tim here with my Day 27 juice fasting plan update

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:10.600
Yes, I’m still going with my juice fast. Getting up close to the halfway 
 mark. Tomorrow is going to mark the halfway mark of my juice plan

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.167
I have lost, since yesterday, 0.4 kg, which is about 
 .9 of a pound, just about 1 pound

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:23.767
Overall my weight loss is now 12.7 kilograms, 
 which is pretty close to 28 pounds

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.400
So, still feeling good, still feeling fantastic, still feeling in control

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:29.333
I had a couple of thoughts today

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:35.733
Firstly, the word juice fast. ‘Fast’, to me 
 conjures up a negative sort of vibe

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.900
I saw someone used the word ‘feast’

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:44.533
I thought that was a good idea. Any other ideas? 
 I’m open to any other ideas to call it

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:50.200
Because it seems such a negative thing to say that you are 
 on a fast, because traditionally that means you’re ‘going without’

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.067
Whereas I think what we’re doing is actually 
 giving your body the nutrients it needs

00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:01.467
So I’m going to have a think and see if I can come up with a better phrase, 
 and see if we can get that phrase out there and being used in everyday life

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:04.500
Not a lot else to report

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.867
As I said everything’s on track and feeling 
 good, and everything is still quite easy

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.833
The other thing I wanted to talk about was 
 the number of drinks I’m having per day

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.533
What I have done in the past I have been 
 trying to have about 500mls three times a day

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.533
What I have done in the past I have been 
 trying to have about 500mls three times a day

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:24.500
Which is somewhere between 16 to 18 fluid 
 ounces I think, for you US folk

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:31.300
And what I have found in the past few days is that 
 I haven’t been feeling hungry at all during lunch time

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.133
So I have had something at breakfast, and then something in the evening. And I 
 have just found that I don’t want to have any juice at lunch time

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:44.430
So I have done that for two days in a row. I am not consciously trying to 
 avoid it. I just feel I don’t need it, so I’m not thinking about it

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.230
Anyone else out there having a similar thing? I would be 
 interested to know whether that’s happening for you as well

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
I am making sure though that I drink plenty of 
 fluid, because it’s obviously important to keep hydrated

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.170
So if you are cutting back your juices a little bit, make 
 sure you’re topping up with water and having plenty of water

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.700
And I do tend to avoid drinking low calorie 
 smoothies, since I’m focusing more on juices

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.600
Of course, the other thing is, if you try 
 and actively stop giving yourself too much juice

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.770
Thinking that perhaps you’re going to lose some more weight

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:14.100
Your body can go into a protection, survival type mode

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:35.030
But anyway, what I was saying was if you are trying to cut back, and 
 thinking, well, I’m only going to have one or two juices a day

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:41.470
And you’re trying to do without, your body goes into survival mode where it 
 actually thinks that there is a problem with you getting enough nutrition

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.830
And that hinders your weight loss

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.070
Make sure you don’t do that purposely. Also do avoid energy 
 drinks since they have a lot of energy drink dangers

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:51.970
So if you are feeling hungry you should be having something

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:53.430
Absolutely you should be having some apple juice or a substitute for apple juice 
 which is by far one of the healthiest drinks in the world

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.300
So, in my case, if I’m not feeling hungry, 
 then I don’t feel I’m going without

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.500
So the last two days I have only had the two juices

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:04.530
So I will see how I go today. If I feel 
 I’m getting a bit hungry I will certainly have some

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.570
I would be very interested in hearing about your experiences on that

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.300
Alright, well I’m going to go now

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:11.370
That’s all for today

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:14.670
And I will see you tomorrow for my Day 28 
 update, which is going to be a good one

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.530
Because I will be halfway through my juice fast, to finishing!

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.330
Cheers for now
