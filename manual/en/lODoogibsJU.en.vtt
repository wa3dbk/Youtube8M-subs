00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:10.233
James Cameron on the making of the
Rolex Deepsea Challenge

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:26.277
When the Deepsea Challenge 
watch was delivered 

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:28.707
right before we did the big dive,

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.166
I looked at it and while 
I can be appreciative

00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.045
in the abstract for what 
it must have taken

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:37.351
to create a new watch in five weeks,

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:40.034
especially one that was going to go to ultimate depth,  

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:42.715
it took being taken through the process

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.272
to really see what was involved 

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:48.412
and how remarkable it was 
that the team could do it so quickly.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:52.386
So I’ve always had a respect 
for fine craftsmanship 

00:00:52.405 --> 00:00:54.076
and engineering design.  

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.911
Going from essentially a new idea 

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.111
to finished “CAD” 
(computer-assisted design)

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:02.182
to machineable working programmes

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.982
that could go right on to
the NC (numerical command) machines

00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:06.235
and begin the prototyping process.  

00:01:06.355 --> 00:01:07.341
That’s phenomenal.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:25.688
What we see is the product of a small, 
highly motivated and experienced team 

00:01:25.808 --> 00:01:27.628
working in a very short period of time 

00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:30.643
to do something other people 
would tell you is impossible.

00:01:30.763 --> 00:01:33.966
And that’s what I see on the sub, 
and that’s what I see in the watch.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.038
It has been an extraordinary experience 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.387
because we seem to enjoy 
the same values,

00:01:57.507 --> 00:02:02.877
sort of a quest for perfection 
and precision and quality,

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:04.738
and at the same time,

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:09.130
an adventuresome spirit… 
a pioneering spirit.

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:20.156
I’ve had a Rolex on my wrist 
for over a quarter of a century 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.630
and I’ve looked at it tens 
of thousands of times, 

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.415
but I’ll never look at it 
the same way now.
