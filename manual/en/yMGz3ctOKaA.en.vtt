00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.440
One of the questions that we get from new
students is knowing when you can and cannot

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:27.330
code the diagnosis.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.050
I think a lot of students, as soon as they
learn how to look up codes, they are ready

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.339
to code everything that they see.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.030
And every new student does it.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.920
I remember I did it.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.570
I wanted to call myself a supercoder because
I wanted to code everything.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.690
Itís fun to code.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.949
But you canít do that.

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.459
You need to code only definitive diagnoses
and they can be hard to identify.

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:58.159
One of the things that you have to stay away
from is equivocal language.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.199
When we say equivocal language, that means
itís kind of on the fence.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.199
Itís not a definite.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.159
It can go one way or the other.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.539
You have to stay away from that type of verbiage.

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.280
Impending or threatened conditions, youíll
see that, but that can be tricky.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.140
You cannot code something if it has not happened
yet, in most cases.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.270
Now I know that sounds again, a little ambiguous,
but if your physician documents, for example,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:40.249
weíll scroll down here just a bitÖ impending
rupture of spleen due to enlarged spleen.

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:43.649
Okay, impending tells you itís going to happen.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.159
Theyíre pretty sure itís going to happen
but it hasnít happened yet.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.520
So you cannot code a ruptured spleen.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.889
You can only code the splenomegaly which is
an enlarged spleen, 789.2.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.009
Thatís the proper code to use.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.619
Now Iíve got some more examples for you,
so weíll scroll down and look at some of

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.619
these others.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.190
Okay if your physician documents something
like this ñ Mrs. Jones is seen today with

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.400
lower abdominal pain and spotting.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.269
I will admit her for a threatened miscarriage.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.500
So youíre now saying to yourself, ìWell,
she hasnít had a miscarriage.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.980
It hasnít happened yet.î But in actuality,
thereís a code for this because itís such

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.069
a common event.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.870
You can, however, code 640.0 and youíll need
a fifth digit.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.000
It does not matter that the miscarriage has
not occurred yet.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.019
There is a code for a threatened miscarriage
because that is a medical condition.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.260
If there had not been a code for that then
you would have to code the signs and symptoms,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.360
just the spotting and the abdominal pain.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.340
Okay, weíve got some more things to look
at here, words that you want to pay attention

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.340
to.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.180
"Possible, maybe, suspect, rule out, probable,
expect, apparent, perhaps, conceivably, plausibly".

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.010
Now if youíre coding and youíre coding in
an office that you have repetitious documents

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.090
from specific doctors and you see them all
the time, youíll learn what verbiage they

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.090
use.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.590
But if youíre doing something like remote
coding or multiple physicians, it may be a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.110
little harder and you have to kind of get
to know how they like to document, how they

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.590
like to word things.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.480
These are some words that just popped up in
one day of remote coding that I was doing

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.840
and it gets to be kind of humorous sometimes
where you have to do a second take and say,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.980
ìWhat did they say?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.610
They said maybe?î
So scroll down just a little bit more.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.159
Iíve got some more examples.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:50.120
Okay, these terms mean your physician does
not know or is waiting for more testing.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.970
If the statement is made, this is another
little case ñ Mr. Green has been feeling

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.819
tired, thirsty and is making frequent trips
to the bathroom.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.640
Itís apparent he has DM since his father
and mother both had DM by age 50.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.189
We will draw labs today.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.450
He is to return in one week for the results.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.920
Now, the fact that he said itís apparent
he has diabetes, he didnít actually say that

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
he has diabetes.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.860
He said itís apparent that he has diabetes.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.130
And then he confirms that heís not sure because
heís going to do a test and have him come

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.280
back for the results.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.800
You have to be very careful.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.960
If you gave this gentleman diabetes with the
way you coded, itís going to follow him for

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.500
the rest of his life.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.900
And he could have problems in the future,
maybe even getting jobs or life insurance

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.890
policies because they do look at your medical
information to determine stuff like that.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.200
So you have to be very, very careful.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.210
He might just have a bad cold and be real
thirsty.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.350
Okay so another example.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.130
Mr. White is seen today with some ascites
and a chief complaint of dyspnea.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.500
He stated that he had been waking up at night
with a dry cough.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.050
He has a history of CHF and microvascular
spasms.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.880
This is probable for cardiomyopathy.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.830
Physical exam reveals mild ascites, tachycardia,
peripheral edema and cool extremities.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:31.070
Previous diagnostic testing wasÖ scroll down
just a little moreÖ was reviewed, was confirmed

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.610
cardiomyopathy and tell, he said, which confirmed
cardiomyopathy.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.740
Youíre not allowed to code that because he
doesnít have it until he stated, he confirmed

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.990
why he was suspecting cardiomyopathy.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.120
But all the verbiage before that was all suspect.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.920
So pay attention to the details and your documentation.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.650
Donít ever jump to conclusions and itís
very hard when you first start out, not to

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.130
jump to conclusions.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.060
Itís going to get you in trouble when youíre
testing especially because some of those questions

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.370
are specifically written to see if youíre
paying attention.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.900
I know if I wrote a test question, thatís
like throwing in not in a test question.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.980
How many people are not feeling well today
or something like that?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.490
So pay attention.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.490
Those little words will catch you.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.490
Laureen: Alright.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.490
Okay, next one is for me.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.490
This hadÖ we actually had last month but
we didnít have time to get to it.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.490
SoÖ and then we got another question related
to it so we kind of put them together on the

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.490
same slide regarding E&amp;M guidelines for 95
versus 97.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.490
The first person wrote, ìI see EM guidelines
95 and 97 used in prep test for the CPC.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.490
Can you explain what these guidelines are?
Iím not sure what these are.î

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.490
And then number 2: ìCan some doctors in our
hospital like general practitioners and internal

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.490
medicine doctors document their outpatient
visits according to 1995 guidelines and at

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.490
the same time, general surgeons, urologists,
OBGYN, eye and ENT specialists document their

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.490
outpatient visits according to 97 guidelines?

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.490
So ultimately, when the external audit occurs,
how do theseÖ how these charts can be audited

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.490
according to 95 guidelines or 97?î

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.490
So letís take a look at the answer sheet
I prepared.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.490
Laureen: Yeah.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.490
So what I did is I took a screenshot of my
actual manual because I do like you know,

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.490
when I teach everything, to take you right
to the book versus just typing a whole bunch

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.490
of stuff on a slide.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.490
So you can really see things in context.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.490
So in your CPT manuals, you have this in the
E&amp;M guidelines and thereís this step here,

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.490
ìDetermine the extent of exam performed.î
I have it labeled number 2 because the first

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.490
step is figuring out the history.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.490
And thereís 4 levels in the CPT manual and
this way of doing E&amp;M came about in 1992.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.490
So if youÖ donítí really call it 92 guidelines
but just to give you a little history, thatís

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.490
when it started.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.490
So theyíve got 4 scores that you can have.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.490
4 scores?

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:48.490
Never mind.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.490
Problem focused, expanded problem focused,
detailed or comprehensive.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.490
Now, part of my technique when Iím teaching
E&amp;M is I teach you to convert these phrases

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.490
to one letter so P,E,D,C ñ problem focused,
expanded problem focused, detailed, comprehensive.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.490
So this is what doctors had to first start
with.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.490
Prior to that, they were just coded by time.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.490
ìOh, 10 minutes?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.490
Itís a level 1.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.490
20 minutes is a level 2.î The higher the
level, the more money.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.490
So they came up with these guidelines and
this is the problem.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.490
If youÖ problem focused is easy.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.490
Itís a limited exam of the affected body
area or organ system.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.490
So if they come in with pain in their knee,
well the doctor isnít going to do a full

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.490
workup.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.490
Theyíre just going to focus on their knee.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.490
So that will be problem focused.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.490
Expanded problem focused, itís a limited
exam of the affected body area or organ system

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.490
and other symptomatic or related organ system.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.490
So I call it a limited plus.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.490
So itís that one organ system, the reason
they came in, and maybe one more.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.490
For example, if a patient comes in with a
headache, it could be stress related or could

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.490
be something very serious like a tumor.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.490
So they might do a neurological type of questions
and look at a couple organ systems to try

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.490
and figure out what theyíre dealing with.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.490
Then a detailed level of exam is an extended
exam of the affected body area and other symptomatic

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.490
or related organ systems.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.490
This is almost word for word the same as expanded
problem focused.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.490
But the only difference is limited versus
extended.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.490
Thatís really the only difference.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.490
And then comprehensive is a general multisystem
exam or a complete exam of one organ system.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.490
So the problem focused is easy.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.490
The comprehensive is easy to figure out.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.490
But doctors were like, ìWell, how do I know
limited versus extended?î Thatís kind of

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.490
nebulous.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.490
So thatís when they came out with the 97
guidelines.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.490
So what we just read here is basically the
95 guidelines , without going into a whole

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.490
3-hour E&amp;M lecture.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:25.490
Youíve got your 3 key components: history,
exam and medical decision-making.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.490
The difference between 95 and 97 guidelines
is primarily dealing with this exam issue.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.490
There are a few little nuances of difference
in the history and medical decision making

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.490
but a bulk of it is what we just discussed.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.490
Okay so thatís kind of like the 95 versus
97.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.490
And when they talk about body areas or organ
systems, theyíre listed right in CPT for

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.490
you.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.490
So here are the body areas: head, neck, chest,
abdomen, genitalia, groin, buttocks, back,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.490
each extremity.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.490
So what you want to understand here since
weíre talking about it is these bullets are

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.490
kind of literal.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.490
So if you have each extremityÖ so the right
arm would count as one bullet or if you were

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.490
doing an audit, youíd have aÖ your little
check box.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.490
Left arm, one checkbox.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.490
Right leg, one checkbox.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.490
Left leg, one checkbox.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.490
So each extremityÖ so this could be up to
4.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.490
But chest, including breast and axilla, if
all 3 of them are looked at, this just counts

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.490
under this one bullet.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.490
And then organ systems are here, eyes, thatís
one bullet.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.490
Ears, nose, mouth and throat all count as
one bullet.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.490
Itís not 4 different things.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.490
It counts as one bullet for adding up the
exam stuff.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.490
So I just want to give you that little tidbit
there.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.490
Another website that I like to use a lot is
EM University and let me take you there.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.490
emuniversity.com and the link is /physicalexam.html.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.490
[Ed.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:52.490
Note. http://emuniversity.com/PhysicalExam.html
] And they go in and they talk about the difference

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.490
between the 95 and 97 guidelines.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.490
Now what happened with the 97 guidelines when
they saidÖ well, I donít know the difference

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.490
between the limited and extended.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.490
The 97 guidelines came along and for certain
specialty areasÖ I donít know if theyíre

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.490
listed here or not.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.490
Here we go, no thatís not it.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.490
But thereís a general multisystem exam for
97 and then thereís one for like psychiatry.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.490
Thereís one for cardiology.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.490
And so when youíre a physician in that specialty,
you could choose to use the 97 guidelines

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.490
very detailed.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.490
And you have to add up so many bullets and
get your score to go back to that.. to back

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.490
intoÖ was it problem focused, expanded problem
focused, detailed or comprehensive?

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.490
Now the questioner was asking, ìCan you use
both?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.490
Can you mix and match?î And the answer is
yes.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.490
Youíre allowed to use whichever guidelines
to give you the best outcome.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.490
Let me go back to the question real quick.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.490
So on the board exam; they donít go into
too much detail with the 97 guidelines, not

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.490
for the CPC exam.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.490
Now if youíre sitting for the E&amp;M Specialty
exam, yes.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.490
You bring your audit tools and you do all
those little check box thingies.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.490
For the CPC exam, the CPC-H exam, theyíre
testing you more whatís on the CPT in the

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.490
CPT manual.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.490
And they try and stay away from these real
grey areas so theyíll tend to use things

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.490
like the general multisystem exam so you could
go, ìOh okay, thatís comprehensive.î And

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.490
you can plug it in.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.490
But it isÖ you should understand generally
that there are these different guidelines

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.490
out there.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.490
Youíre allowed to use whichever one is best
for you.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.490
So if you get a higher level using 95 versus
97, you can go ahead and code based on that.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.490
And then for the second question, yes absolutely.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.490
You can have some using 95 guidelines, some
using 97.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.490
Youíre totally allowed to do that.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.490
The intent was to have the 97 supercede the
95 but that didnít happen.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.490
It didnít work out that way.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.490
And theyíve tried to come up with new guidelines
ever since and that kind of failed.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.490
But a lot of what really drives it is the
medical decision making.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.490
And they do want to come up with a new system;
I just donít know how long itís going to

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.490
be before they can do that.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.490
Okay so I think I covered everything on my
slide here.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.490
Oh and for those in the Replay Club, theyíll
get this answer sheet.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.490
You can go right to the official 95 and 97
E&amp;M guidelines just to give you an idea of

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.490
what it looks like.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.490
Itís cms.gov and theyíve got this outreach
and education Medicare Learning Network thing.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.490
And this is a PDF so you can print it but
itís very long.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.490
But what I did when I first learned this is
I printed out, I put it in a binder and I

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.490
had my 95 and my 97 guidelines.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.490
But these are the official guidelines on the
CMS website.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.490
In addition, theyíve got this Medicare Learning
Network EM Guide.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.490
So if youíre kind of new to learning E&amp;M
coding, this is a nice, detailed primer if

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.490
you will on E&amp;M coding given by CMS.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.490
And theyíve got some pretty good education
material.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.490
I donít know why this has taken so long.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.490
Laureen: So thatís the E&amp;M guidelines, 95
and 97.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.490
Thatís a real rush job.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.490
Someone in the chat was asking if we have
training on E&amp;M.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.490
Yes, we do.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.490
We have an on demand E&amp;M class.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.490
Itís 3 hours.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.490
Itís worth 3 CEUs and we kind of go into
this in a little more detail.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:51.499
So you can check that out on the website.
