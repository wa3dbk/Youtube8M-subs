00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.369
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Pool is a huge part of our
lives.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.790
Everybody in our family plays.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.929
Our pool table takes up the biggest room in
the house and we have a storage unit that's

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.000
full of furniture that we don't use because
we don't have room for it .

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.319
[CHEERS]

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:49.819
GRANDFATHER: We get together every week to
shoot pool.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.440
My dad shot pool his whole life, her dad shot
pool.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.260
All three of our kids got into it and now
our grandson.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.090
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I would play 100, 200, 300
racks of 9-Ball every day.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.989
Junior...I just put him in the highchair and
he would be one hand with the Cheerios and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.220
the other hand with the sippy cup and he'd
watch me play pool all day.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.890
COURTNEY O'DELL: That was his form of watching
the baby while I was at work.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.890
[LAUGHS]

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.220
KEITH O'DELL SR.:This pool table here is the
original and very old Keith Jr. pool table.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.070
And this kid started making shots and pocketing
balls like you would not believe.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.240
[MUSIC]

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.090
GRANDFATHER: The game's about physics and
geometry basically.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.850
GRANDMOTHER: You either see the shot or you
don't.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.420
GRANDFATHER: You need to be able to see the
angles on the table.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.580
You need to be able to tell how hard to hit
it and how fast the ball is going to move

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.580
after you hit it.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.270
GRANDMOTHER: And for such a young little boy,
he can do it.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.120
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I put this video up on YouTube
and it was picked up by a local news station.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.060
COURTNEY O'DELL: It went up.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.070
The news station came out the next day and
filmed.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:15.080
COURNEY O'DELL: Pool is much more of a daddy
Keith thing.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.549
KEITH O'DELL SR.: What's the matter?

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.549
Your pants coming down?

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.549
KEITH O'DELL JR.: Yeah.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.709
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I'll help ya.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.379
Just slow it down a little, okay?

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.379
1, 2, 3.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.760
KEITH O'DELL SR.: What didn't you do?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.670
KEITH O'DELL JR.: Didn't do 1, 2, 3.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.000
KEITH O'DELL SR.: 1, 2, 3 and you have to
hit it harder to get into the pocket, right?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.840
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I try to get him focused.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840
Slow down.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Concentrate.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.840
Me and Keith since he's been 2 years old we've
been playing pool together.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.560
And my job is to keep him going.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.989
Keep it fun, keep it interesting.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.420
KEITH O'DELL JR.: Hey, remember that one that
I keep shooting to hit the four balls?

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.569
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Yeah.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.569
KEITH O'DELL JR.: I like that.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.069
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I saw that Keith Jr. had
this talent and I saw that there was money

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.609
to be made here.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.430
And college these days is really really expensive
and I want Keith to go to college and I believe

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.430
he should.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.439
It's really important to me to utilize the
talent that he's been given and do something

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.689
positive with it.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.939
Helping a cue company sell cues or a piece
of chalk, that could put him through college.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.499
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Almost.

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:15.419
You're getting there.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.419
Easy.

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.540
KEITH O'DELL JR.: I wanna go play.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.780
KEITH O'DELL SR.: He's 5 so sometimes he gets
frustrated.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.269
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Take a break.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.519
Take a break.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.769
COURTNEY: Whether Keith wants to play pool
for the rest of his life or not, we will support

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.400
him in anything he wants to do.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.129
KEITH O'DELL SR.: If you can see this ball
doesn't really go in there very easily and

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.049
he jumps it um..from about 5 feet away.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.769
It's definitely one of the hardest shots in
the world.

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.540
There's a professional pool played named Mike
Massey who used to use a cowboy boot with

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.859
a big opening..um..and it was a huge deal
that he made that.

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.029
And we have our 5-year-old making a ball in
a shoe that is like 6 times smaller.

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.400
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Go ahead.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.749
Go ahead.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.749
Woah.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:10.749
[Laughs]

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:15.120
KEITH O'DELL SR.: I'm gonna wait until he's
8 or 9 until I allow him to compete.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.000
He needs time to enjoy the game and then he
can decide whether if he wants to be competitive

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or not.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.920
KEITH O'DELL SR.: You're almost there.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920
Get it.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
FAMILY: Woah!

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.200
KEITH O'DELL SR.: There's no question.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.480
Keith was born to play pool.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.480
KEITH O'DELL SR.: Get it.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.280
FAMILY: [CHEERS] [LAUGHS]

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.631
KEITH O'DELL JR.: I made it in the shoe!

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:40.681
KIETH O'DELL SR.: A little bit of work on
the table could change his entire life.
