00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.580
The MTAR-X submachine gun has good range and
accuracy, average damage and a low fire rate.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.770
This means it is best at medium range, but
the high mobility of the MTAR-X also allows

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.210
you to be effective at close range.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.680
Always push up to the next firefight and use
your mobility to your advantage.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.310
The MTAR-X is best suited for medium range
due to the lower fire rate.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.810
But the MTAR-X has good accuracy meaning you
can pick off enemies easily at medium range.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.390
At close range other submachine guns are better,
so use perks that increase your mobility so

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.649
that you can strafe and thus avoid enemy fire
effectively.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.120
Avoid long range combat with the MTAR-X because
your damage will be significantly lower than

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.140
other long range weapons.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.110
Instead move around the map so that you encounter
most enemies at medium range.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.780
If you do see an enemy in the distance, retreat
and use an alternative route to flank him.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.670
Use attachments that help you at close and
medium range to compliment what the MTAR-X

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.980
already is good at.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.760
The Muzzle Brake increases your damage at
range making it easier to eliminate foes at

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.269
medium range.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.720
Rapid Fire increases your fire rate making
you more effective close up.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.560
With it be sure to fire from the hip when
enemies are close.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.860
Select perks that increase your mobility and
make aiming down the sights better.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.920
So you can sprint more often use Ready Up
to bring up your weapon faster after sprinting.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.150
That said go around corners without sprinting,
especially if you expect to encounter enemies.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.280
Stalker increases your movement speed whilst
aiming down the sight, which is crucial to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.750
winning gunfights at medium range.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.620
In combination with Agility, which increases
your movement speed, you will be difficult

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.950
to hit.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.950
Since you need to be aiming down the sights
at medium range use Focus so that flinching

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.400
doesn't cause you to miss enemies.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.439
In summary the MTAR-X is a powerful medium
range weapon.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.720
Use the Muzzle Brake, Rapid Fire and selected
perks to increase your effectiveness at close

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.310
and medium range by increasing your movement
speed making you hard to hit.
