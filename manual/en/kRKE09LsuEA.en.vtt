A day ends though my dream is still far, and does not reach it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:18.000

Some time equal companions disappeared in the wind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:12.000
One person alone does not change even if lining with a new building high.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"woo" We keep shouting toward tomorrow.
