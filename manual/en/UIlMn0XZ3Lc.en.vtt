00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:09.276
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.780
Daler Rowney has been
making fine art materials

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.883
for over 225 years,

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.584
and Artists' Watercolours
are made

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.020
in that same fine tradition.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.356
Artists' Watercolours
are professional quality

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:24.591
watercolours with
the finest modern

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.727
and traditional pigments.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.796
They are precisely formulated
for unparalleled performance

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.565
and permanence.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:35.035
Daler Rowney has an extended
range of over 80 colours,

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:40.173
designed to create
washes of pure colour.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:44.144
Artists' Watercolours has both
transparent and opaque colours

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:44.845
in the line,

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:46.346
and you can create
opaque colours

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.649
by adding white or black.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.351
Transparency refers to
the ability for light to

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.854
pass through and show
the paper underneath,

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.256
while opaque refers to
a solid colour

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:59.793
where no light
passes through.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.930
Here is a wash
showing Prussian blue.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.532
Prussian blue is a
naturally transparent pigment,

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.534
and when applied directly
on the page

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:10.504
it shows
the paper underneath.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:13.874
But when Prussian blue is
added with Chinese white,

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:18.412
it becomes an opaque colour.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.781
Artists' Watercolours are
characterized by its rich,

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.051
free-flowing colour
which leave no hard edges.

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.355
When painting with
Artists' Watercolours,

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.124
you can see
when it goes onto the page

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.261
that you get
a free, rich colour,

00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.796
but it will not pull,

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:37.664
and it does not create
a hard edge

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.599
when you paint with it.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.436
Only the finest pigments are
used regardless of cost

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:45.305
and ensure the most brilliant
colours and tint strength

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.740
can be achieved.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.443
Artists' Watercolours contain
maximum pigment loads

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:53.013
and have a 3-4 star
permanence rating

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:54.581
that ensure artwork retains

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.219
bright, vivid colour
every time it is applied.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.225
