How to Minimize the Pain of Getting a Tattoo.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.340
Getting a tattoo will never be a walk in the
park, but it can be less painful if you take

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.400
a few simple precautions.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.920
You will need A licensed tattoo artist A morning
appointment Loose clothing A full stomach

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.810
A non-aspirin pain reliever Deep breaths Scrupulous
aftercare and a topical anesthetic.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
Step 1.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.309
Go to a licensed tattoo artist who sterilizes
their equipment and uses disposable needles

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.309
and gloves.

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.559
The discomfort of getting tattooed is nothing
compared to the pain of getting an infection

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.559
from it.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.559
Step 2.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.120
Schedule your tattoo for the morning.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.000
This is when your pain tolerance is highest,
thanks to peak levels of adrenaline, a hormone

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.979
that helps us endure pain.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.979
Step 3.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.179
Wear loose clothes, especially if they are
going to be covering your new tattoo.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.179
Step 4.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.690
Eat something before you go to reduce the
chances of passing out from a combination

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.389
of nerves and hunger.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:58.449
Step 5.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.039
Take a non-aspirin pain reliever like ibuprofen
about 20 minutes before the procedure.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.140
Don't drink alcohol or take aspirin in the
24 hours beforehand; it will thin your blood,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.729
increasing bleeding.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.729
Step 6.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.510
Choose an area of your body that has more
flesh and less bone and nerve endings, like

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.890
biceps, calves, and thighs, rather than bony
areas or nerve centers like the rib cage,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.229
top of foot, and abdomen.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.409
Step 7.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.729
Know what to expect.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.700
The pain is often described as a cat scratching
your sunburned skin.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.479
Breathe deeply, focus on your breath, and
try not to move.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.969
The post-tattoo pain will feel the same, minus
the cat.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.039
Step 8.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.200
During the procedure, if the pain is intense,
your tattoo artist can apply a topical anesthetic.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.719
Think carefully before you ask for one; side
effects include a longer healing time and

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.650
a loss of color in the finished product.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.079
Applying excess amounts of a high-concentration
topical anesthetic and covering up the tattoo

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.979
afterward can result in seizures.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:55.979
Step 9.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.670
Follow the tattoo artist's instructions regarding
aftercare.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.509
The tattoo should heal in about three weeks,
during which time you shouldn't swim or expose

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.789
it to the sun.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.789
After that, go ahead and flaunt it!

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.330
Did you know Democrats are slightly more likely
to have tattoos than Republicans and independents.
