00:00:03.144 --> 00:00:08.456
And the Recipe is for chicken cous cous, yes it's off to northern Africa for the inspiration behind

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:15.933
this fabulously simple to prepare dish which uses the worlds smallest pasta and the whole chicken.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.169
I take the chicken and I prepare it for the oven, this I do by removing the neck,

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.151
trimming off surface fat and then cutting down the back to allow me to open up the chicken.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:29.539
Now in the interest of hygiene it should be remembered that when your handling chicken

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.459
you must make sure that your hards are spotlessly clean and that the chicken stays cold until its ready to be cooked.

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:43.394
Now to some marinade ingredients, 8 whole cloves of garlic, yes this is one for garlic lovers.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:50.169
They're finely chopped or minced. Olive oli, a good 2 or 3 tablespoons, extra virgin olive oil

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:58.152
and about the same of freshly squeezed lemon juice. We could use limes but I would use slightly less juice.

00:00:58.152 --> 00:01:04.140
Lots of freshly chopped parsley, about a cup full and the same of coriander leaf

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.417
and for those that don't like coriander mint could be used. A little salt and quite a bit of pepper

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:20.858
and this mixture is spooned onto the chicken and rubbed over. It's then set aside in the refridgerator

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:25.578
for a couple of hours to allow all those flavours to infuse into the chicken before its

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:32.205
baked in an oven at about 180 degrees c for around an hour. Now while that's happening

00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:35.270
I prepare some ingredients for the couscous starting with onion.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.186
A little finely diced onion is sautaed in oil before I add yes, you guessed it, more garlic.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:50.233
Cook it a little alowing the onion to soften and then in goes some red capsicum

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:54.182
and some lemon rind, yes Yes!

00:01:54.182 --> 00:02:00.993
Now while thats gently cooking, I just lightly toast some almonds in a dry pan just so they brown a little

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:09.669
Now to the couscous itself. This is a semolina grain which has been processed to make very small granules.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.430
To prepare the couscous, it's usually just a manner of following the instructions on the packet.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.719
It usually just means adding couscous to hot water. However I like to add it to hot stock.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.517
Chicken or a vegetable stock. Then it's fluffed up and the sauteed vegetables and lemon rind

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:36.270
are stirred along with more corriander and parsley and if you like a little mint.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.599
Ahh there. Sensational, now that wasn't difficult was it. No, in fact the degree of difficulty low to medium

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.074
Preparation time about 30 minutes plus cooking time.

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:53.937
Keepability, well both the chicken and the couscous keep very well for a couple of days in the refrigerator.

00:02:53.937 --> 00:03:00.719
Time to serve and the jointed chicken is put on the bed of couscous, topping pan juices.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:12.231
final springling of herbs. Light sprinklying of almonds and possibly to finish off 4 slices of fresh lemon.

00:03:12.231 --> 00:03:14.719
Absolutely perfect.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.710
My wine choice for this dish something crisp and white, such as a sauvignon or a sauvignon blanc or a blend of the 2

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.519
From Consuming Passions, till next time bon appetit.
