00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.640
How to serve faster in tennis.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.610
I get that question asked of me all the time
by my students.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.750
And I tell them that it takes a lot of practice,
but the ingredients most important are the

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.790
legs, the grip, and the racquet speed.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.090
So one of the ingredients in learning how
to serve harder is using your legs as springs.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.149
That gives you a tremendous amount of velocity
on your racquet and thus, a harder or faster

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.149
serve.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.890
So, I'll let Kirk demonstrate.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.050
You'll see a lot of people when they don't
serve hard, they don't bend their legs.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.250
They're legs are very stiff and they swing
just from their upper body, so they don't

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.440
generally have a strong serve.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.690
So demonstrate a serve without bending your
knees.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.390
And they make that face too.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.530
Anyway, so that serve is not going to be hard,
but if you've learned to bend your knees after

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.990
you toss the ball, you become a spring or
a cat ready to pounce on its prey, then you're

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.520
going to have a faster serve.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.040
Watch how Kirk bends, and now he's going to
jump up and accelerate his racquet through

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.130
the ball, driving with the legs.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.740
Again, an analogy I use is baseball.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.940
In baseball, pitchers pitch at 95 miles an
hour sometimes, but most of the power in pitching

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.210
comes from the legs.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.820
The other thing, you will never have a fast
serve if you don't use a continental grip.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.000
You could probably hit it fast, but it's not
going to go in very often.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.159
So you must remember that on any serve, to
become a top tennis player, you must learn

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.710
the continental grip.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.780
That's an absolute.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
And the last thing I want to say about hitting
a faster serve is that most people think of

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.490
faster, so they think of stronger.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.430
So what they tend to do when they want to
hit hard is they squeeze the grip.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.780
It's not about squeezing the grip.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.939
It's the opposite.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.950
It's about holding that grip very loose like
a whip, so that you can snap it and then get

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.360
a much faster serve.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
Absolutely.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.599
I remember seeing footage of Pancho Gonzales
serving.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.720
Great server.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.650
He had one point in the serve only had his
thumb and his middle finger on the racquet,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.129
so he was able to get tremendous acceleration.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.549
He couldn't squeeze it if he wanted to.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.519
So the idea is, hold it looser than you think
you're supposed to, and let that whip give

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.310
you the final burst of speed.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.549
So remember, bend your knees, hold the racquet
loose, and make sure you learn the continental

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:42.579
grip.
