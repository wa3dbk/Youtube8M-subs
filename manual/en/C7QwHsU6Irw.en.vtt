00:00:00.277 --> 00:00:02.455
(Upbeat music)

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:11.187
- Hey friends it's Robert and today I am

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:12.723
excited to be coming together with

00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:15.157
some of the great Kin Community channels

00:00:15.157 --> 00:00:18.435
to participate in a bridal
shower collaboration.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.060
We're celebrating the upcoming wedding

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.052
of fellow youtuber and Kin
Community member Alex Garza.

00:00:24.052 --> 00:00:25.461
Now for my part I'm going to be

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.550
putting together the party favors.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.255
But you'll wanna stick around to the end

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.043
of the video to see all of the other

00:00:31.043 --> 00:00:34.337
participating channels and
their fantastic projects.

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.058
And you'll also want to see the video

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:39.518
here on Kin of the actual bridal shower.

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:40.702
What I want to show you how to do

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:43.725
is to make your own plantable paper.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:45.160
This is basically homemade paper

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.954
embedded with seeds that can be used

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:49.223
for all sorts of party favors.

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.709
Essentially what we'll be doing is

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:52.581
creating our own paper pulp,

00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:56.667
pouring it into a water bath
and screening out new sheets.

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.571
Once the paper is dry, we're gonna

00:00:58.571 --> 00:01:01.218
punch it down into different
shapes and include it

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:02.504
with a kit that we'll send home

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:04.523
with each guest so they can grow

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:06.475
their own beautiful flowers.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.636
First thing we'll need to do is

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:09.609
create our paper-making screen.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.310
And to do that I've purchased two

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.355
inexpensive picture frames.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.601
Now the one thing you do want to

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.413
keep in mind is you wanna select frames

00:01:16.413 --> 00:01:18.879
that have a flat face.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.335
Then go ahead remove the
backing and the glass,

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:22.960
and set them aside.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.632
Now you're going to need vinyl screening

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:26.281
from the hardware store.

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:28.145
This comes in a roll and we're gonna

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.258
cut out two pieces that are an inch

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:31.876
larger than each of our frames

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.873
on all four sides.

00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:35.914
Now take one of the empty frames,

00:01:35.914 --> 00:01:38.064
lay it down on a piece of screening,

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.302
wrap the screening around to the back,

00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:42.882
and secure it in place with a staple gun.

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.320
We're just going to attach the screen

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.675
to one of the frames.

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.596
The second frame we'll leave blank

00:01:47.596 --> 00:01:48.781
and that's known as a deckle

00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:50.568
when you're making paper.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:54.241
And then we'll also be using
that second sheet of screening.

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.489
Set these items aside and we're

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.796
going to begin making our paper pulp.

00:01:57.796 --> 00:01:59.420
Now you can make paper pulp out of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.225
almost any kind of paper.

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.080
Recycled newspaper, old envelopes, or what

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.929
I'm using today are a few sheets of

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.866
standard white copy paper.

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:10.118
But I'm also throwing in a bright pink

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:11.952
sheet of card stock.

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:13.498
Now I know that Alex really likes

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:15.226
bright pink and mint, and so those

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:16.619
are two colors that we're going to

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.731
try and incorporate into today's project.

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:21.077
Tear up the paper into little pieces

00:02:21.077 --> 00:02:22.633
and we're gonna fill the pitcher of a

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:26.046
kitchen blender about
halfway to two-thirds full.

00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:27.695
You don't wanna pack it in, you just wanna

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:30.160
place them in there loosely.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.526
Over top of the paper we're going to

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.221
fill the container with water.

00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:35.752
Again, about halfway to two-thirds full.

00:02:35.752 --> 00:02:37.360
And then we'll allow it to sit for just

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.936
a moment to soften up.

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:42.718
Now we wanna blend our
paper down into a pulp.

00:02:42.718 --> 00:02:44.180
You wanna check it a couple of times

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.550
to make sure you're not left with

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.292
any large chunks.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.383
What we're looking for is something

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:50.844
the consistency of oatmeal.

00:02:50.844 --> 00:02:52.377
And then we're gonna pour our pulp

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:53.839
into a water bath.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.466
And what I'm using today
is a standard dishpan

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.922
filled halfway full with water.

00:02:58.922 --> 00:03:01.339
To that we also want
to add our plant seeds.

00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:03.923
I selected a special mixture of seeds

00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:06.050
to grow plants that are known to attract

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.212
butterflies and hummingbirds.

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:12.062
Mix the pulp and the seeds
together in the water bath.

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:13.413
And then we're gonna take our screen

00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:15.192
and our deckle, we're gonna place them

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:19.023
flat sides together, place
it down into the water bath,

00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:21.321
and gently lift it straight up to

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:23.775
capture a sheet of pulp.

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:25.625
Let it drip for just a minute and you can

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:28.608
wipe the excess pulp off
of the sides of the frame.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.453
Now we're gonna transfer
it over to a plastic tray.

00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:35.216
Lift the deckle straight
up and set it aside.

00:03:35.216 --> 00:03:37.352
You can see it's perfectly
formed a rectangular

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:38.986
sheet of paper.

00:03:38.986 --> 00:03:40.695
Now we're gonna take that second piece

00:03:40.695 --> 00:03:43.812
of loose screen and set it over top.

00:03:43.812 --> 00:03:45.763
Using a regular kitchen
sponge, we're going

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.798
to try and soak up some of that excess

00:03:47.798 --> 00:03:50.401
water that's currently in the paper pulp.

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:51.724
Press it down gently.

00:03:51.724 --> 00:03:54.802
And then wring it out over
top of the water bath.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:56.763
Do this several times.

00:03:57.653 --> 00:03:58.946
Now lift up your frame and

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:02.085
wipe any excess water
off of the plastic tray,

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:05.261
lay down a paper towel,
flip the frame over,

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.119
and lay it back down.

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:09.115
We're now gonna sponge the other side,

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:11.321
soaking up any excess water.

00:04:12.413 --> 00:04:14.293
Now we'll lift the frame up gently,

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:16.798
releasing the sheet of paper.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.990
If the paper sticks,
add additional pressure

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.700
with a sponge on the back.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.238
Or try gently peeling
it away at the corners

00:04:23.238 --> 00:04:25.096
with your fingers.

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:26.855
Then transfer the paper to a piece

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:29.362
of felt to allow it to dry.

00:04:29.362 --> 00:04:31.174
Our handmade paper will take about 12

00:04:31.174 --> 00:04:34.680
to 24 hours to dry depending
on the climate you're in.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.096
You can speed up the process by

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:38.298
setting it outdoors in the sunshine,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.508
or indoors near a fan.

00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:41.994
You may find that the paper has

00:04:41.994 --> 00:04:44.299
warped during the drying process.

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.759
To flatten it out, place
it under a stack of books

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.379
and let it sit overnight.

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.024
Our dry handmade plantable
paper is really beautiful.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.717
You can see specks of all of the

00:04:53.717 --> 00:04:56.549
different papers we used
to make our paper pulp,

00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.222
and you can see the seeds
scattered throughout.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:01.539
Next I'm gonna take a large paper punch

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.771
and punch out a series of
sweet butterfly shapes.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:09.740
You can see that in addition to the pink

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.432
paper I've also created
some mint colored paper.

00:05:13.432 --> 00:05:15.373
To the back of the
butterflies I'm going to

00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:18.192
glue down a teeny-tiny clothespin.

00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.188
This is going to allow
us to easily attach it

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.070
to the packaging later.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.715
The idea with this party favor is to

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:25.796
send each guest home with a kit

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:27.619
that contains basically
everything they need

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.173
to grow their own beautiful flowers.

00:05:30.173 --> 00:05:33.888
So I found these really sweet
pink pots with cork lids.

00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:35.838
And rather than fill it with loose soil

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.709
which could be a little messy,

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.505
I went to the hardware store and found

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.709
these seed starter pellets.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:43.547
These are compact little rounds of soil

00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:45.504
that have been dehydrated.

00:05:45.504 --> 00:05:46.937
When you place them in your container

00:05:46.937 --> 00:05:49.375
and add about a half cup of warm water,

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.081
they almost instantaneously expand.

00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:54.976
Filling your container with
beautiful potting soil.

00:05:54.976 --> 00:05:56.944
Your guest can then remove the butterfly

00:05:56.944 --> 00:05:59.751
from the clothespin,
place it under a shallow

00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.639
layer of soil, keep it
moist, and eventually

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.978
it will germinate and sprout.

00:06:04.978 --> 00:06:06.857
So for the party favor we're going to take

00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:09.379
one pellet, place it inside the container,

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.758
close the lid and then tie a bow around it

00:06:11.758 --> 00:06:13.964
using some pretty satin ribbon.

00:06:13.964 --> 00:06:16.120
Next we'll take our butterflies and gently

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.739
bend the wings back so they look

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:19.188
a little bit more lifelike

00:06:19.188 --> 00:06:21.886
and pin them right on to the ribbon.

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:24.194
You might also want to
consider attaching a

00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:27.338
tag with simple planting
instructions for your guests.

00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:30.479
Now I do hope you'll
give this project a try.

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.936
It's highly customizable.

00:06:31.936 --> 00:06:33.491
You can create the paper in any

00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.028
color palette you'd like, add any type of

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:37.438
seeds you'd like, and obviously,

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:39.898
punch it into any shape you'd like.

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:41.316
Be certain to check out the playlist

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:43.218
