00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:07.270
We've just arrived in Tokyo, obviously we
need to make come local Cantonese street food

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.809
What should we makeĸ.?
I've thought about it for a long time, let's

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.259
make baked salmon over eggplant!
The ingredients are easy to obtain

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.240
It includes eggplant, smoked salmon
What, why are we using smoked salmon? I couldn't

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.250
find any Hong Kong fish paste!
Let's just use salmon

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.199
Prepare the eggplant
You'll see that the eggplants in Japan are

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.990
quite short
We have long eggplants in Hong Kong

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.120
Here's the salmon
Eggplants is different from Banana, you have

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.940
to wash it before eating it
Cleaning is easy. Complete!

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.940
We'll use the knife to cut the eggplant
Done. Putting the salmon on top

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.240
Beautiful piece of meat. Let's get creative
with this one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.820
Looks like sushi, look at how beautiful this
is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
The fish won't fall off if you press harder.
See?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.500
You can eat it raw. Smell it and try it out
Right, we're baking it. Let's put it into

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.260
the oven
Close. How should I use thisĸwhatever works!

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.350
180 degree for 8 minutes
I'm seriously the smartest person on earth

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.290
Complete!
Rinse over with some soy sauce

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:27.309
Spicy soy sauce
Let's clean up!
