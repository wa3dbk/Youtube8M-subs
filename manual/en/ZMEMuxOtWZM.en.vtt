00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.550
We're here today in Skywalker Ranch in Northern California

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.730
with Jonathan Rinzler, who is the author of the making of

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.360
Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith. Jonathan, thank you very much

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.000
for being with us today. -You're welcome, glad to be here.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.760
I read in the book that you say that the opening battle sequence

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.660
of this new film is the most spectacular in the entire saga.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.400
It is a pretty amazing opening six minutes, and I've seen it go through

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.980
concept art paintings of two Jedi star fighters are shooting at each other,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.520
to animatics, where George would sit there with the animatics artist

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.770
and literally direct how a spaceship was going to fly by a camera

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.660
for an hour. It goes by in two seconds for us, it is not happening accidently,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.000
it is the result of painstaking work. -Are the omitted shots in the book?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.600
No. Not all of them, but a lot of them. I think one of the things that

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.750
people will see here, reading this book, is just how organicly George Lucas

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.180
makes his films. He really, he doesn't start writing the script until

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.610
the concept artists have already worked for months.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.760
So once you read this book, you'll see that there are literally

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.660
dozens of major ideas that come to play and then get discarded.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.500
And the very important ideas that don't come in until very very late in the game.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.170
What can we find in the book that we won't find in the movie?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.440
Well, there's quite a few things. I think the fans, the one thing

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.910
that's in the book that's not in the movies is Han Solo.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.250
Jonathan, in the book you talk about how George Lucas and his

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.810
team created the new villan for this new film. How does one top Darth Vader?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.320
I don't think the idea was to top Darth Vader, because I don't

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.590
think that's possible. I think the idea was to come up with somebody

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.450
like Darth Mall, who becomes an iconic villan. And you'll read in the book

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.700
that George says it literally during the art department meeting,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.320
it's time to come up with another iconic villan.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.140
Jonathan, thank you very much for being with us today.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.910
The book is "The Making of Star Wars - Revenge of the Sith,"

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.420
and you can buy this by either clicking the link, which is a lot easier,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.200
or at your local bookseller. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.520
In this book you can read about an art department meeting,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.390
and then in this book see the actual art that was presenting.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.900
Basically, the books are designed to be complementary.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.590
