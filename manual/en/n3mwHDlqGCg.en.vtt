00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Ready Goes:  We are using nicknames for rhythms that will be used for the Twinkle Variations.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:45.000
They are specially chosen for their qualities of articulations using vowels and consonants.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Soon the children can imitate the patterns because                                                 they have labels for them.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We move from Tapping to the up and down motion they will need for bowing these Twinkles

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.000
We start with jestures that will be as large as their bodies before we

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
before we attempt the small
fine motor skills needed to play them with

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a violin bow.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Before using the real violin we practice using a box violin with our foot chart.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The child learns through trial and error how to issolate the muscles of his body to hold the box.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:00.000
He learns quickly because he is not distracted by all the exciting things a real violin has to offer,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:15.000
until he as mastered a comfortable sensei of ballance.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:44.500
Everything is a game.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:18.820
The foot chart is the launch pad for  both bow hand and violin and skills
