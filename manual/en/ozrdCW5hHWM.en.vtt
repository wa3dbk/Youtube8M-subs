00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:21.520
Let’s be honest.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.511
When this game was announced, if you weren’t
already doing it on some message boards, you

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:28.160
wanted to complain about it.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.170
“Oh, here’s another remake instead of
a new game.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.310
How thoughtful, Nintendo.”

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.139
Or maybe, “Wow, Nintendo wants me to buy
a GameCube game for Wii.”

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:41.710
You know, some quality Internet snark.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.249
But then you play it.

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.160
And you can’t stop playing it.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.809
And that’s when you realize, lazy and easy
as this game seems and may in fact be, there’s

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.429
also a certain brilliance to New Play Control!

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.429
Pikmin 2.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.949
It may not be the new Pikmin you wanted, but
now that one’s been announced for Wii U,

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.550
it’s a lot easier to appreciate a repackaged
Pikmin 2.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.159
In fact, this “lazy remake” is a great
primer for Nintendo’s upcoming launch title

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.790
for its new system.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:22.240
And a late testimony to the brilliance of
their current one.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.810
Like its New Play peers, Pikmin 2 is a faithful
remake of the GameCube original.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.229
The wider camera and widescreen support aside,
this is the exact same game GameCube owners

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.400
fell in love with back in 2004...along with
one other difference.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.939
The game now controls with a pointer and a
nunchuck.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.999
And freaking magic.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:49.759
But for those who missed the original, Pikmin
2 is a real-time strategy game with an undeniably

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.249
Nintendo feel.

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:56.289
Space freight pilot Captain Olimar returns
home to find his company has gone bankrupt.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.049
With a huge debt and no money, Olimar returns
to the Pikmin planet in hopes of finding valuable

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.619
alien treasures.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.270
Like soda cans.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:16.870
The story is not that important, but it has
all the charm and subtle humor that make Nintendo

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.900
games so appealing.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.190
Of course, it also has that characteristically
Nintendo focus on gameplay, and that’s what

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.400
makes it so good.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.989
Olimar and Louie will need an army of plant-like
Pikmin if they’re going to survive on this

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.159
strange alien world...an
army that’s easier to control than ever

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.459
before.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.760
In fact, I think a lot of the clamoring for
a new Pikmin game can be attributed to the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.459
existence of the Wii Remote.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.489
It’s just perfectly suited for this franchise.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.189
Pointing at the screen to command and mobilize
your Pikmin is an incredible improvement over

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.470
the original controls.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.810
Pikmin 2 is so intuitive on Wii, it’s an
absolute joy to play.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.970
And in a sense, that’s what makes Pikmin
so special.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.000
Unlike more daunting RTS games, Pikmin simplifies
things.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.310
Rather than flexing the muscles of complexity,
the game rubs you down with the Ben-Gay of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.310
accessibility.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:27.569
Uh, what I mean is...uh, it’s just...it
tries to be as fun as possible.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.750
People have short memories.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.760
That’s just the way it is.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.250
And it’s sad, but a lot of people think
of its late-life disappointments when they

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.329
think of the Wii.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.640
Given how things have gone in its home stretch
and the fact that it was all-but abandoned

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.110
in terms of quality software support, it’s
easy to forget how genuinely innovative the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.110
system was.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.349
How genuinely innovative the system is.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.660
But a game like this reminds you.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.610
You can spend hours playing Pikmin 2, and
it feels like minutes.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.239
It just plays so well with the Wii Remote,
offering the kind of breakthrough control

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.390
experience that make the system’s best games
so memorable and its potential, even after

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.459
six years, still seemingly unfulfilled.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.290
Pikmin 2 is a remarkable game.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:27.500
And as so many others should’ve been, it’s
even better on Wii.
