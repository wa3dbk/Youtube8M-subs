Hey whats going on guys, Kris here and today
ill be showing and comparing the different

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.100
grips in Battlefield Hardline that you can
equip on your weapons.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.480
Theres 3 main grips in the game including
the Angled, Stubby and Vertical grips.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.279
So first off is the angled grip, this postions
the shooters hand high on the centreline of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.279
the bore.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.640
It improves control by reducing first shot
recoil.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
So this is the same as Battlefield 4s angled
and folding grips, it reduces first shot recoil

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.150
by 33% so its only gonna affect the first
round that you fire, now as you can see in

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.750
the test, automatic fire of the weapon isnt
really affected with the grip as the bullet

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.899
pattern hasnt really changed, and it looks
as though its not much different to the no

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.309
attachment test, but it we fire in single
shot mode, without the angled grip, your shots

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.699
will bounce upwards quite a lot, but with
the angled grip equipped, the shots are a

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.539
lot more accurate, even when firing quickly.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.420
So this shows how the angled grip is better
suited for burst firing or tap firing, by

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.830
using the gun in this way you should be able
to control your weapon a bit easier at longer

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.970
ranges and manage the recoil to stay on target
better.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.550
Id recommend using the angled grip on guns
that kick a lot when theyre first fired.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.750
The next one ill be showing you is the stubby
grip, the reduced length of the foregrip makes

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.790
for a lightweight and strong point of control.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.080
It improves accuracy by reducing the rapid
fire penalty and slightly increases maneuverability.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.940
So the stubby grip in Hardline does the same
sort of thing it does in Battlefield 4, it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.520
reduces spread increase from automatic fire
per shot, but in Battlefield 4, it reduces

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.610
this by 15% per shot, In Hardline, it reduces
spread increase by 50%, now thats a crazy

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.770
difference to what weve seen before and as
you can see on this test, automatic fire is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.060
a lot more accurate with the stubby grip attached.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
Your bullet groupings are much closer together
with the stubby grip when firing over time

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.160
and for this reason, it makes the stubby grip
very useful in any situation when firing an

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.250
automatic weapon.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.340
If you plan on using any fast firing fully
automatics then the stubby grip might be the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.290
way to go in a lot of matches.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.200
But lastly that leads us onto the vertical
grip, it provides greater stability when firing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.500
your weapon while moving.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340
It also makes the weapon slightly more stable
in un-aimed fire.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.159
So in Hardline the vertical grip gives your
weapon 40% less spread whilst moving, and

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.409
also gives you about 25% less hipfire spread
too, now looking at my tests you can see that

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.849
firing whilst standing still doesnt really
do anything, so I did a test strafing to the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.310
right with and without the vertical grip,
I just basically moved to the right, emptying

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.849
my magazine into the lorry to show the weapons
bullet spread whilst moving, the test with

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.570
the vertical grip attached performed slightly
better but its hard to tell really as its

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.160
a bit tough to accurately show recoil patterns
on the move, the test doesnt look like the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.989
vertical grip made a whole load of difference
but the stats dont lie, and ive used the vertical

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.760
grip online and it does feel as though my
shots connect more with targets when im moving

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.230
around.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.150
So thats all the grips you can attach onto
your guns in Battlefield Hardline, youll have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.310
to first unlock the grips for a specific weapon
by getting enough kills, but it shouldnt take

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.959
too many matches, the grips in hardline dont
give the guns any penalties so theyre definatley

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.400
worth going for as theyll make your weapons
better and give you an edge in multiplayer.
