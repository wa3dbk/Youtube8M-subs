I’m Ekaterina Sorokotyaga, the coach of Moscow Parkour Academy.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.860
In our today’s lesson we’ll discuss balance and cat-balance techniques.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.260
So, balance is performed on a rail or some thin parapet.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:30.520
It’s pretty useful to train balance because it improves your equilibrium sense which will be helpful in other movements like precision jump, for example.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.320
Balance can be of several types.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.440
First of them is a usual one with your face looking forward.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.640
When you step transfer weight from your forefoot to your heel.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.760
Bend your knees a little and spread your arms to maintain equilibrium.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.820
Try not to look at your feet, look forward and you’ll see both the rail and your feet.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.640
One more mistake you can make is to strain yourself too much.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.480
Relax and it’ll be easier to keep balance.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.080
If you think you are going to fall, bend knees more and you won’t.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.880
Another kind of balance is a backward one.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.420
The technique here is almost the same as in the previous example.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.880
We also transfer weight from forefoot to the heel.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:18.400
But don’t try to look back or down between your feet here. Just try to feel the rail when you walk.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.720
And the last type of balance is a side one. It’s when you walk with you right or left side forward.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.640
When we walk sidewards we do it not on the middle of our feet but on the forefeet.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.580
Bend your knees more and you’ll balance much easier.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.980
It also helps when you think you’re falling. Straighten out your arms for better result.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.840
Now let’s pass on to a cat-balance.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:41.160
It also helps to walk along thin rails especially at high altitude, when it’s pretty scary or inappropriate to use simple balance.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.980
Cat-balance can also be divided into a front and a back one.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.240
Let’s take a look at the first type, when we move forward.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:20.980
We use all four of your limbs. You need to distribute the load between your arms and legs evenly.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:31.340
Move your diagonally opposite limbs at the same time. For example, right arm and left leg and then change: left arm and right leg.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.920
Look forward, hips and knees should be lowered.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.560
The lower they are the easier it is to balance.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.520
Another type of cat-balance is a backward one, take a look.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.760
This cat-balance is performed with the same technique as the front one.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:22.420
Tricks are the same: don’t look at the rail, don’t turn you head, just try to feel it.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.060
I hope this lesson will help you to learn the balance and cat-balance techniques better.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.540
Good luck, bye!
