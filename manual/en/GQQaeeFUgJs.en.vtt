00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.359
Hi.  I want to talk about Flex Seal.  
Now, we've all seen the commercial with the guy in the boat 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.170
with the screen door.  
But I want to do is, I want to show you

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.300
the correct way to apply Flex Seal.  
Now what Flex Seal is, it's a rubberized coating 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.689
that seals, coats and protects virtually anything.  
It's like liquid rubber in a can.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.449
Now before we begin, I want to make sure the work space is well ventilated.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.169
 If you have windows, open up the windows. 
If you have a fan, turn the fan on, get the air moving.

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.099
Make sure not to smoke around flex seal.
And also don't use the product around heat, sparks or open flames. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.850
A little common sense goes a long way.
As far as using the product,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.290
the first thing you want to do is shake the can vigorously
for about a minute.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.970
It has a variable pressure nozzle.  
And what this will allow you to do is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.240
either put it on in a light coat

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.700
-- maybe long, sweeping motions - 
and notice how much of an area this covers.  

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.160
That's perfect for maybe filling gutters, the roof line, 
around cabinets. If you just notice 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.969
the nice flow.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.820
Also,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.300
you can hold it in a concentrated area.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.100
and it builds up.  Notice how nice and thick this is. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.970
And this is perfect for filling larger holes and cracks. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.010
When working with Flex seal, heat and humidity 
have a lot to do with dry time.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.330
Obviously, if you're outdoors spraying in the sunlight, 
it's going to dry a lot faster.  

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.090
Several hours is good, 
but overnight is always a safe bet.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.190
Also, you can touch it.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.630
 If it's tacky or soft, it's not dry.  
And once this stuff is dry, it's going to work.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.960
Another way to check

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.030
is to hold it up to a light.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.370
If light passes through, 
it's not sealed and you're going to need to add 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.440
another coat.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.800
Once you're done with the Flex Seal 
you want to clear the nozzle.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.660
We do this by turning it upside down 
and giving it a few, quick blasts.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.110
That way, the next time you go to use it, 
it won't be clogged up.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.960
And remember: on bigger jobs you may have to use multiple coats.  
But always let it dry in between.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.460
It may take a little time, but if you do it properly, 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.120
Flex Seal does an incredible job.
