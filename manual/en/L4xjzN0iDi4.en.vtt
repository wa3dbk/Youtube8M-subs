00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi guys!

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.690
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.770
Today’s review is going to be on this LOreal
Magic Nude Liquid Powder foundation.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.269
This is the last product from my beauty haul
that I did.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.449
I’m in the color 328 Sun Beige, and this
is the size of it.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.789
I didn’t know how small it was until I saw
it in real life!

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.990
I thought I would show the comparison.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.940
I’m going to apply one side using a brush
and the other side using a sponge.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.439
Let’s start with the brush first.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.240
I always apply my foundation with my finger
tips Directly to my face.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.789
I don’t like to use brushes or sponges to
apply it because I feel like it soaks up a

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:37.789
lot of product.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.859
More than necessary, so I rather apply it
on my face and allow it to warm up so it can

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.390
spread and distribute evenly.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.769
I am using a buffer type brush and I’m using
stippling motions.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.359
To tell you the truth, I didn’t care for
the foundation when I used the brush.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.179
I prefer a sponge.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.179
I don’t know why!

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.820
I’m not sure if it is because it left streaks
in the foundation.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.110
But I do love the finish after it’s all
evenly distributed on my face and warmed up

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.110
on my skin.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.480
It looks beautiful and one of the reasons
why I love this foundation, is because it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.980
looks like my natural skin.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.610
I’m going to apply more foundation in areas
where I need extra coverage.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.370
I tend to do this using the brush, after I’ve
applied my first layer.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.220
So, I’m going to do that right here.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:43.220
Now, I’m going to use my beauty sponge for
the other size of my face.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.710
I did dampen it, and you can tell by looking
at the product, that it is liquid like.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.210
I love the fact that this foundation is runny
and liquid like.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.250
I tend to look for that in all of my foundation,
I’m noticing.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.960
The only foundation that I got was super thick,
would be the covergirl 3-in-1 foundation.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.360
But I love the way it looks with more runny
and liquid like foundations.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.390
I’m just going to pat this all in.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.349
And this is the first layer, I’m going to
go ahead and add a second layer after this,

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:23.220
so you guys can see the difference.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.329
This is the second layer, and I’m applying
it areas where I need it, and I actually added

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.349
a little too much, but I’m glad I did looking
at the footage now, because you can see more

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.190
product doesn’t make it look cakey.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.519
Now, I’m going to set my face like I usually
do with my city color flawless finish mineral

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.099
powder in the color tan.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.329
I’m using my Bdellium tools brush that I
did not like from my review, but it seems

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.870
to work really great by applying this powder
lightly, so it doesn’t look like it’s

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.210
been caked on.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.410
Now, I did get a request on the eye look that
I had in one of my videos, they were saying

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.170
it was very natural and super simple, so I
thought I would share that with this video.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.040
I applied an eyeshadow base and then took
the color peach smoothie from makeup geek

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.540
and just applied it with a blending brush.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.879
And then I took a bronzer.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.780
This is the be matte bronzer from City Color
Cosmetics, and I applied this directly into

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.780
the crease.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.049
And that’s pretty much all I did for that
look.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.470
I didn’t feel like it would be worth it
to share a full video of what I did with something

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.470
so simple.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.480
I did apply mascara to the upper and lower
lashes, this is the New YSL Mascara.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.010
