00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.200
 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.150
Hi I'm Patrick Olsen suburban dad for cars.com we're out here today with the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.820
2008 Toyota Sequoia

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.020
this current great that you're going to
take your family on a road trip and got

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.930
lotsa space

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.310
what's a row for people site including
adults in the third row

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.440
the SoCo is a big car very better like a
shape a little more squad than previous

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.260
generations

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.110
but as you see in the back there's a
little bit of room for luggage in the

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.340
maybe not enough if you're going on a
long road trip

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.379
still what you can do is take your
luggage pop down the forty percent in

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.199
the third row

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.719
and I've got a whole new world open to
you love SUV's today if you're an adult

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.309
he is shown in the second row

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.409
you have some dread about that because
often there's none at federal more leg

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.460
room in the Sequoia

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.010
is really what you want to space Vera me
from ahead burly for the way too I think

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.960
even a long trip adoption account login

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.699
now from appointed to a parent which
raise you can have to like captains

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.299
chairs in the second world

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.749
in the weather's divider between them
the keep those kids from getting to each

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.600
other knowing each other long hauls

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.240
and in many SUV's a third row is worse
even the second round

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.870
burns acquire local ever moved to see
all the way

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.860
when you can really crime in the back
very quickly if 6-foot-1

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.970
riot a that was incredibly easy and I
still find it very roomy

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.400
and when you pull the secular back you
find in there still funny and later with

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310
the first 25 years left some space

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.160
tell us apart from the typical amenities
one finds in a big SUV it's got the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.400
navigation system

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.070
it's not the tri-zone climate controls
it said the mp3 jack which entirely on

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.740
the open road in middle of nowhere I'm
going to Disney World

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.160
you're gonna want that well so it's not
this Jain or miss

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.790
strongmen in the center that you could
put a small child in their it up or

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.580
something said a lot of people are
worried when the drive big issues

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.930
because they're afraid those who feel
too much like a truck

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.960
the sky is very nice you feel very tight
into the road and in control

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.790
now this has got a great big engine and
it's got great acceleration fact much

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.510
better choice in unexpected

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.129
I missed a great big truck suggesting
while to warm up but this one is really

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.099
great SRA sure after stop

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.629
now with a great acceleration know you
gotta watch your gas mileage

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.569
I drove the soco referring more than 100
miles and use about half a tank gas

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.900
couch so I would say that you get great
power but you know when to pay for their

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.400
power

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.609
at the pump the soyuz got plenty room

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.930
for you other adults and your kids

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.420
but you gotta remember with all that
space in all a great acceleration

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.950
it's likely gonna cost in gas mileage
