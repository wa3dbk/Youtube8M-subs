00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It might be short, but this is definitely
not easy. Stage 19 takes the riders 139km

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.890
starting in Ponte di Legno, and finishing
up Val Martello. Whilst there's only three

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.130
mountains en route, they give a total of over
60km of climbing, and about 4,300 metres of

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.509
vertical ascent. And that ascent starts here:
on the 1st category Passo Gavia.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.300
The last time that this mountain featured
at the Giro was the last time that I rode

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.420
it in 2010 - it was the penultimate climb
on the penultimate day, and by this point

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.630
I was already in the groupetto, which featured
none other than Bradley Wiggins.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.110
There will still be a few sprinters left in
the race at this point, and they'll all be

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.820
thinking about that final stage into Brescia.
And to make matters worse for them today,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.560
the climbing starts almost straight away and
doesn't stop until they reach the Gavia almost

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.050
17km later.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.030
By the time they reach this stage, it'll have
been 21 days since they took the start of

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.360
race all the way back down in Napoli, so the
GC will be well established, but with such

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.430
a tough stage as this, you might see some
bigger name riders giving it a go right from

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.790
the start. With the climbing starting so soon
after that start, it'll be pretty tough for

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.280
the team with the Magglia Rosa to really control
things.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.280
Some of the most iconic images from this climb
came from 1988, when Andy Hampsten rode through

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.700
the falling snow and into the pink jersey
which he held on to until the end of that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.730
year's Giro. Whatever the conditions this
year on this climb, you can be sure that the

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.810
riders are going to have to wear a couple
of extra garments on the descent just to keep

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.810
themselves warm.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.670
We've gone over the Stelvio now, which is again
the highest point of this year's race.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.290
Last year, it was Thomas de Gendt who won
the stage which finished there, but whoever

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.950
goes over the top first today will win the
Cima Coppi prize, and it's that altitude which

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.450
could play a key role in today's stage.Some
riders just seem to cope better with the reduced

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.010
oxygen levels than others, and one rider who
does seem to cope well is last year's overall

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.150
winner: Ryder Hesjedal of team Garmin-Sharp.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.150
After some brief respite in the valley down
below here, it's not long before the riders

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.800
start the climb up towards the finish in Val
Martello. It's actually the longest climb

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.800
of the day: 22.3km at an average gradient
of 6.4%.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.000
The road is almost flat again now as we come
up towards this lake here which is actually still frozen

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.770
as I ride it today. I definitely think whoever's
in the pink jersey will really want at least

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.730
one teammate left with him on the upper slopes
of this climb, because it will be very difficult

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.430
for one person to control with all these constant
changes of gradient.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.490
Well that was a really tough stage and a really
hard climb up to the finish here and I think,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.490
having seen a few stages now, this is the
one I'm looking forward to watching the most.
