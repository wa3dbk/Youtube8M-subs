00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.850
Back extension on the fitness ball with legs
extended. If this is the first clip that you

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.160
are watching and you are having difficulty
with extending the legs please watch the one

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.080
where I show you how to do it in the kneeling
position. It is a little easier that way just

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.700
to get the move going before you go for the
challenge on the stability. Now when getting

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.310
to the extended position belly down on the
ball you are going to wedge the ball into

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.050
your lap, you are going to lean over with
your torso and then you are going to push

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.000
with your toes, with your feet, you are going
to push into an extended position. You may

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
want to do this against the wall if you are
sliding or use the sticky mat. Right now the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
floor is working fine for me. Now also beware
that if you are here you are not going to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.640
have much room so you really need to be where
your chest is out, your ribs are almost at

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.920
the edge of the ball so you have some room
to move. Beware of the position of the head

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.520
especially coming up that you are not looking
straight ahead that you are looking down at

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.920
the floor. Your hands are by your side, you
are going to take an inhale and relax and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.240
then exhale. I'm pushing my shoulders down
and I'm keeping my head, what I'm going to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.780
keep is not my eyesight over there but the
crown of my head over there. Inhale, exhale,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:30.189
inhale and just in case you are wondering
how high you should go. You should not round

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.369
your back like this you should go until you
are straight. If you are not sure what that

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.180
feels like, have somebody look at you and
tell you and give you some feedback until

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.920
you get the muscle memory. This is designed
to help your lower back. Your back extensors

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.360
are working as well but if you have back discomfort
this is going to help with that and I promise

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.340
you, do a few every week and before you know
it your back is going to feel better, be stronger

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520
and you are going to be much happier, I promise.
