00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.210
Is economical driving
something for Autoblog?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.671
It is. We discussed it. You're not going
fast, but fast through corners.

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:26.024
We'll be driving as economical as
possible in the Golf GTD outside.

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:32.656
We've selected it, because it can do
2 things: being economical and go fast.

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:37.994
It's up to you to write
down the best score.

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:48.450
You have to remember to drive economically.
- Yea, stupid huh?

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.129
It doesn't feel natural.
- No.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:55.938
I'm curious. Will the BMW
engine really get cleaner?

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:04.491
This BMW 125i is pretty and special.
It has two whole fuel systems.

00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:10.792
2 gasoline tanks, 2 fuel lines. 1 has
regular 98, the other has BP Ultimate.

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:17.024
3 cylinders run on normal 98
gasoline and 3 on BP Ultimate.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:22.872
On the screen you see the effect on,
for example, the carbon deposit.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:27.635
21.7. You get to do 50 mph here.

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:31.971
Here it comes. 24.4.

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:44.654
Don't hit the barrier. Coast it.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.561
It has start-stop.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.954
It has start-stop?
- Start-stop.

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:53.645
So, I won't have to
shut it off myself.

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:58.166
Put it in neutral and lift the clutch.
Keep your foot on the brake.

00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:01.999
See? There.

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:05.960
You're starting to get it.
- Yea.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.612
23.5.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.714
It's so exciting!
- Exciting, huh?

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:21.877
Was it hard to do?

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:29.052
Yea? We got 1:21, 1:22, 1:23 and 1:24.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.414
Yea, Michiel. Sorry, you're 2nd.
That's great! You got 2 DTM tickets.

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:46.699
Ronald, you did 1:24.4, so that's a
difference of 0.9 km/l with number 2.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.474
You get BP Ultimate for 1 year,
if you keep driving like that.

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:54.657
You can fuel up for 1,250 euros.
That's always nice.

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:57.627
I'll shake your hand.
A bit hard like this.

00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:03.400
