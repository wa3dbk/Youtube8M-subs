Since it was founded in 1985 Remote Area Medical, or RAM, a Knoxville-based organization has provided no-cost health care to about a half a million people, both in the US and around the world.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Craig Bleakney: "We have about 200 UT Knoxville students who are here volunteering with RAM who are doing everything from helping assist dentists to helping assist doctors and optometrists..."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
"... giving away free glasses, giving away free health care to about 1,200 Knoxville residents who don't have health care."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Stan Brock worked with "Wild Kingdom" for more than five years.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He was a real cowboy from South America and he liked to do things the old-fashioned way.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Stan Brock: "Well, my name is Stan Brock, and I'm the founder of Remote Area Medical. It's roots are actually down there in the Amazon rain forests where I lived for many, many years where we were 26 days on foot from the nearest doctor."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Stan decided if you couldn't take the sick to the doctor, why not take a doctor to the sick and so RAM did just that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Many times air-dropping volunteers and supplies to locations that are otherwise inaccessible.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Craig Bleakney: "Stan is RAM. Stan is the foundation. He doesn't quit. He will be out there at 2 o'clock in the morning..."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.000
"...One of the things about Stan was in the recent trip to Mador, Haiti, he hiked up the mountain faster than the people who lived there..."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
"...Faster than all the donkies. So even at sixty, seventy some odd years old. You can't beat him."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
UT is now taking an active part in helping Stan and RAM by sending its students to clinics that RAM puts on all over America.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Stan Brock: "Here in the United States there really are a lot of doctors. Something like 800,000 of them, I believe. But people simply can't afford the service. That's the problem."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Stan Brock: "When you see a patient get out of the dental chair that's been in agonizing pain, often for many, many years, and they hug the dentist and they hug the assistant..."
00:02:12"...or somebody who gets a new pair of eye glasses for the first time and they go outside and they say, 'Wow! I can see the leaves on the trees!' I mean, this is really a life changing experience..."
00:02:25"...And what we have here today is really a medium-sized operation for us. It takes many, many hundred of volunteers. So we're absolutely delighted that UT students are out here."

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Just as important, about 30 UT students have been helping out at RAM headquarters every week and they realize what they're doing is making a big difference.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.266
Jamisha Wynn: "It's great to volunteer at RAM. It feels good to give back and see people smile. Just to get free health care is wonderful."
