Hi beauties, today I have a basic dramatic smokey eye made with INEXPENSIVE products. Enjoy this video and don't forget subscribe gorgeous :)

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:26.000
As eye shadow base I'm using a concealer in light tone, apply a little amount and blend it perfectly , this is an affordable option to prime our eyelids . 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
First highlight brow bone and inner corner with the lightest tone from the 35C palette by morphebrushes, great pigmentation and perfect to blend . Use any flat brush to place it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Next as transition color I picked the light purple tone on the same palette which will prepare the skin for the following blending processes 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now place as dark base the jumbo pencil in black tone on outer mobile eyelid... because of the creamy consistency is perfect for any smokey eye

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And blend it out until get a smoother blemish

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Next get the black intensity above this dark base with the black eye shadow in same 35C  palette , we need blend it higher into the crease 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Add same color below bottom lashline too 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
As a tip... blend blend blend after apply each color .

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now adding a pop of color  choose any colorful tone from same palette. I picked purple ones to place them on inner mobile eyelid between black and white 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Again use our transition colors but with a flat brush this time to lose intensity below lower lashes

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This step is optional...line top lashes is not  essential but I love the cat eye effect on a smokey eye 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm opening the dimension of my eyes applying a pink tone on waterline 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Next I apply a pair of ICONIC falsies by House of Lashes which emphasize cat eye effect , love those gorgeous peaks

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Again skip this step if you don't want to much drama... in my case yes I add some individual  short lashes on bottom lashline just to magnify my eyes 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Finishing top level apply black mascara to integrate natural and false lashes ...upward direction works for me 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I always work my eyes an then my face to clean any fall out around , so I'm using a liquid foundation that cover pretty well my freckles, discolorations and scars . Using an cosmetic sponge you get a natural finish

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here goes another tip, If you buy or receive a too dark foundation product by mistake or what ever.....don't throw it out . You can still use it to contour your face in dosed quantities

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Using a moistened sponge is a easier way to apply the right amount ...underneath check bones, jaw line, nose and hair line ...now integrate the color to your base foundation in tap motions

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And do the same with lighter foundations to highlight your face ...like forehead , bridge of your nose, dark circles , cupid bow and chin if  your need it 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now you don't need use a huge amount of powder trust me. Just apply a sight coat over those problematic parts where your face liable to shine

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
To ease up this look I use a pinky tone on my cheeks 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
As well on my lips ...here I used  a creamy product by NYX cosmetics

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Last step... give a glowy look to your face using a soft highlighter

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:26.000
