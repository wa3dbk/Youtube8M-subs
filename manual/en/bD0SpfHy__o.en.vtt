00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.200
Our existence depends on the Sun.
When clouds get in the way or we rotate away

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.510
from it on the Earth and have our night time
- it's there, radiating light in all directions

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.230
and sustaining life on Earth.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.480
However you don't get something for nothing.
The Sun is shining bright,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.320
but how long will it last?
How long has it been there for?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.599
In astronomy most research is done with telescopes,
but this isn't always the case.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.760
Over 40 tonnes of material falls on the Earth
every day and sometimes the pieces are large

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.679
enough to survive their fiery journey through
the atmosphere and reach the ground.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.329
These space rocks, called meteorites, contain
the information we need to find out the age

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.879
of our solar system.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.530
If we wanted to find out the age of an ancient
Egyptian mummy we could use a technique called

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.339
carbon-dating.
However, meteorites don't contain life as

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:06.940
far as we know but we could use another method
to determine their age -- rubidium dating.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.290
We can study the decay of the element rubidium
and find out their age but how does this help

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.050
us find the age of the Sun? Well the Earth,
the planets, comets and moons all formed at

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.050
the same time as the Sun, so space rock rubidium
tells us the Sun is 4 and a half billion years old.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.070
But what does this number mean? Is our Sun

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.930
young? Is it middle-aged or is it collecting
its pension?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.800
To answer this we need to delve deeper into
the Sun itself.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.800
At the heart of our star the temperature hits
an unimaginably hot 15 million degrees Celsius.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.970
Here bits of hydrogen are fused together producing
helium and energy.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
In these reactions a small amount of the mass
is converted into energy.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.170
The conversion is outlined in Einstein's famous
equation: E = mc2. Here E is the energy released,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.030
m is the missing mass that has changed into
energy and c is the speed of light.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.840
The Sun does not have a limitless supply of
fuel, it will eventually run out of hydrogen

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.210
but when?
Well to work this out first of all we need

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.190
to weigh the Sun.
Set aside those cosmic weighing scales, we

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.920
need to bring in two astronomical heavyweights
-- Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.750
Kepler studied the motions of the planets
and didn't quite understand why they stayed

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.730
in orbit around the Sun until Newton came
along 80 years later and formulated gravity.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.480
Using Kepler's laws and Newton's laws of gravitation
the mass of the Sun can be calculated as being

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.810
equivalent to four thousand trillion trillion
hippos.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.810
So fast forward 200 years and we have E = mc2
and the mass of the Sun. Now we have the tools

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.010
to work out how much energy is thrown out
from the Sun.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.150
We have yet to obtain detailed blueprints
for the inside of a star but star models assume

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.870
that 10% of the Sun is hot enough to undergo
nuclear fusion.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.500
In each reaction 7/10ths of the original hydrogen
mass is converted into energy.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.020
That energy eventually spreads out from our
star into space like a balloon getting thinner

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.060
and thinner.
We don't feel the full brunt of this radiation

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.060
as we are 150 million km away. We can measure
the amount of energy that falls on the Earth

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.230
and if we know the distance to the Sun we
can work out how much energy leaves the Sun

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380
in the first place.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.120
Finally if we know how much fuel our star
has, we can find out how long it will last.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.650
It turns out the Sun is a middle-aged star
as it has enough fuel to keep going for another

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.069
5 billion years after which the star we know
and love will start to look very different.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.989
Hopefully by then we will have colonised another
planet and future humans from Earth 2.0 can

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
witness the next stage in the lifecycle of
our Sun.
