00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:11.578
Once upon a time, a Las Vegas Grand Canyon bus tour took forever. And 
 then there wasn't much to do once you got to the Grand Canyon.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.022
Now, three words have changed all that: Grand Canyon West!

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:21.362
Finally you can experience the Grand Canyon from top to bottom 
 and get back to Las Vegas in time for dinner...

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:23.870
...on the Las Vegas Grand Canyon Rim to River Expedition!

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:30.372
Your adventure begins with pickup from your Las Vegas hotel. After 
 a brief check-in and transfer to your touring motorcoach...

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:37.105
...you're on your way! Your first stop is Hoover Dam. You'll 
 enjoy a photo shop at this stately yet artful structure...

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:41.842
...responsible for the creation of Lake Mead, one of the world's largest man-made lakes...

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.093
...which was pivotal in making the arid Western U.S. livable. 

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:49.319
Be sure to get pictures of the Colorado River Hoover Dam Bypass 
 Bridge too! ***BRIDGE IS NOW COMPLETE, YOU WILL PASS OVER IT!***

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:54.660
After leaving Hoover Dam, you'll pass through the Mojave 
 Desert, where ancient Joshua Trees surround you. 

00:00:55.055 --> 00:01:01.277
Soon, you'll arrive at Grand Canyon West, a Native American Tribal 
 Park owned and operated by the Hualapai Indian Nation.

00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:08.336
Known in their native language as "The People of the Tall Pines," 
 the Hualapai Indians have occupied this area for over 1,000 years.

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:13.073
In the 1990's, they began developing their land holdings around the Grand Canyon...

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:19.157
...and have achieved significant success by offering Grand Canyon 
 visitors experiences that were once considered impossible.

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:26.123
At Grand Canyon West, getting to the bottom of the Grand Canyon 
 is easy: with an exhilarating helicopter flight to the canyon floor!

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:30.860
You'll get up close and personal with the 
 Grand Canyon's rugged cliffs and majestic spires...

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:36.549
...before touching down at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, where 
 pontoon boats wait to take you on a leisurely cruise.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:42.750
After your river ride, it's time to re-board your helicopter and 
 fly back to the rimside, where motorcoaches are ready...

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:50.340
...to resume your tour of Grand Canyon West. Your first stop is 
 Eagle Point, where you can learn more about the Native People...

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:56.290
...of the Southwest by touring replicas of their traditional dwellings or 
 taking part in a Native dance or cultural program.

00:01:56.286 --> 00:02:02.460
A hearty barbecue lunch is served at Guano Point, and every 
 single table has a view of the Grand Canyon!

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:08.870
Named for an unsuccessful attempt to mine guano from nearby bat 
 caves in the 1950's, remnants of the tram line...

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:14.820
...and other mining implements still stand and can be seen with 
 an easy and scenic walk around the promontory. 

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:22.150
Eventually it's time to head back to Las Vegas and what's so great about 
 this tour is that it's about 12 hours long, from hotel to hotel!

00:02:22.153 --> 00:02:25.680
So you'll get back around dinner time, instead of 'round midnight. 

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:28.790
