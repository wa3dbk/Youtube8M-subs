Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Panda
Cakepop Tutorial where I'll be showing you

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.520
how to make this gorgeous, little, really
easy, Panda cakepop. We've also got a Panda

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.830
cupcake tutorial on our channel so you can
check that one out if you love Pandas.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.800
For today's tutorial, the tools and equipment
that we will be using today:

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.700
I'm resting my panda in a polystyrene block.
I have just a regular zip lock bag.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.029
A pair of scissors.
I've got a cakepop ball. Now if you don't

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.190
have a great recipe for getting your cakepop
balls to this stage, ready to dip and decorate,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.110
we do have one on our channel and I will leave
a link to it in the description box below.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.290
I have pre-refrigerated that so that's really
nice and firm. That's been in the fridge for

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.620
about 15 minutes until it's quite firm to
touch.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.789
I've got 2 lollipop sticks.
I've got some desiccated coconut. So it's

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.380
a fine sort of sprinkle coconut. If you don't
like coconut, you could also use a white sanding

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.800
sugar or just regular white sprinkles or nonpareils.
We've got some melted white chocolate or white

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.260
candy melts.
Some melted dark chocolate.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.810
I've got a few quite large chocolate chips.
Now in the US, these are called Nestle Morsels.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.990
What you want is a chocolate chip that's the
largest ones you can buy.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.840
I've also got just a butter knife.
So let's get started.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.110
The first thing that we we're going to do
is we're going to take our lollipop stick

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.730
and just dip it a little way, about a centimeter
or so into that melted white chocolate. Taking

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.159
your cakepop ball, there will be slightly
flat bottom on one side. We just want to pop

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.950
that lollipop stick into the bottom about
halfway to 2/3 of the way up that cake ball.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.270
We're going to let that sit to the side until
that chocolate seal sets.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
Now I know my ball is really nice and cold
because it's been in the fridge. So that's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.480
going to set just sitting at room temperature
as it touches the coolness of the cakepop

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.439
ball but you can also put that in the fridge
if you're in a particularly warm environment.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.229
While we're waiting for that to set, we're
just going to prepare some of our little bits

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.810
for our Panda. So we're going to have 2 ears,
we're going to have our 2 eyes and we're going

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.840
to have our nose.
For the nose, you just want to take 1 of those

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.080
chocolate chips and just cut it in half. Beautiful.
You could eat ½ of that because you only

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.020
need ½ to make this cute little Panda.
For the eyes, we're going to complete those

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.430
once they're actually on the pop. And that's
just so that we don't make too much of a mess

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.580
with them.
So what you want to do here is you want to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.080
take your cakepop. I'm happy that thats set
enough, but you really do want a nice, firm

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.580
seal there. So taking your melted chocolate,
dip your cakepop ball in. Just give it a little

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.210
turn so that that white chocolate meets up
with that lovely chocolate seal and just give

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.930
it a few taps just to get any of that excess
chocolate off. Now don't be too concerned

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.110
about neatness here because he is going to
get a nice coating of that coconut.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.210
You want to work quite quickly here. You're
going to take 2 of those chocolate chips and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.880
put them into each side quite spaced apart
- you don't want them too close together.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.180
And then you're going to take his 2 eyes and
push them in. You really want to try and push

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.690
them into that melted white chocolate so they
sink in a little.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.440
And then you want to take your half choc chip
and you want it to be flat side up with the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.260
rounded side down facing you. Pop that on
for the nose. Still working quickly, as he'll

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.390
be starting to set, take your desiccated coconut
and just going to give him a nice coating

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.520
of fur. As I said, you do want to work quite
quickly here. If you do find that he starts

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.420
to dry, you can just sweep on a little bit
more of that melted white chocolate using

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.060
a toothpick or something like that in any
places that you find your desiccated coconut

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.650
is not quite sticky. You can also just take
your fingers and just pat it around. So wait

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.550
until you've got a nice coating of the coconut
on there. And as you pat it around, you'll

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.220
actually stick it to that white chocolate.
Alright, so just give him just a little tap

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.650
off and just wipe any spare coconut away from
his eyes and ears. And you do just want to

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.090
make sure your coconut's not too thick down
here from the mouth because that's where we're

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.370
going to be piping a little bit of our detail
work.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.480
Just sweeping some of that messy coconut off
to the side. I do recommend doing this over

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.350
a baking tray or something, because it can
get quite messy.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.500
So now that we've got our eyes on. You want
to take a little bit of that white chocolate

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.720
- and I'd like to use another lollipop stick
to do this because it's got sort of a bit

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.660
of an eye shape on end of it. And you want
to put the whites of the eyes sort of up the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.980
top. So you kind of want his eyeballs to be
up here so that he's got the big blacks of

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.340
his eyes coming down underneath and on a little
bit of an angle. So I'm going to pop my whites

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.310
of the eyes just here and just here. Lovely.
We can let those ones dry for a little bit.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.640
Now you just want to take your zip lock bag
and just pop in a little bit of that melted

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.071
chocolate. And you really don't need much
of the melted chocolate. It's just to do some

00:04:56.071 --> 00:05:01.650
fine detail work. You can see there I just
popped just a really little bit in and just

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.310
push it all the way down to the corner of
the bag. We're going to cut out really nice,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.410
fine, piping tip off at the end of that. So
just a really tiny little corner, so you fashion

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.650
yourself a bit of a fine piping tip. And we're
just going to draw the mouth, just a little

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:27.150
J on one direction and down in the other direction.
And finally to finish him off, we just want

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:35.390
his little eyeballs -- 1 eyeball and the other
eyeball.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:41.530
So there you've got your gorgeous and really
really easy little panda cakepop. I'm sure

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.610
you'll agree, he was incredibly easy to make
and I think he's just adorable.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.840
Thanks very much for watching.
