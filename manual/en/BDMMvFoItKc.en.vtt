00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.370
This is a video about the Santa Fe train by
Peg Perego I found next to a garbage can some

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.880
weeks ago. Unfortunately, it was missing the
tracks, the charger, the caboose, a proper

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.310
battery, and, worst of all, the front axle
and wheels. So I had to modify it slightly

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.640
to get it to work again. (20")

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.360
Here you can see my solution. As for a front
axle, we fixed a shopping trolly to the locomotive

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.739
so that it acts as a front axle. This works
reasonably well, though the rolling resistance

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.050
of that front axle is still remarkably higher
than that of the rear axle, which means the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.359
vehicle slows down if I lean forward and speeds
up if I lean backwards. (24")

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.329
This is a look into the Santa Fe's battery
compartment. As you can see, this is not the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.530
stock battery, but a newly bought 6v 10Ah
one, which happened to be fairly cheap (13

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.579
Euros) and fits into the compartment nicely.
The connector also has been modded: the stock

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.299
connector has been removed and two cable shoes
attached instead of it, which in turn are

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.930
attached to the battery. This corresponds
to the way the batteries are wired in my E-Scooter.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.060
(32")

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:31.750
Now let's hear the sound it makes without
a load on it. (4")

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.630
And here we go! This is my balcony. It's about
48 feet long, so a rather roomy balcony. The

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.799
Santa Fe has a no-load speed of 2 mph when
driven off-track, and 1.5 mph with me on it,

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:59.920
riding on the balcony. (16")

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.859
Now we turn it around and try a slightly different
pose, because with the previous pose, my legs

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:41.140
start to hurt after a while. This second pose
is more comfortable. (11")
