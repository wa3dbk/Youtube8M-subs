00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.210
How to Know the Difference Between Foremilk
and Hindmilk.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.190
Breastfeeding offers your child all the nutrition
they need in the first six months of life,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.490
and mothers produce two kinds of milk, the
foremilk and the hindmilk.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.160
You will need and breastfeeding baby.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.310
Step 1.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.600
Understand that foremilk has a thinner consistency.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.320
The foremilk is the milk that, when nursing,
a baby will draw first; it has a lower fat

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.790
content and higher lactose content.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.000
Step 2.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.480
Understand that hindmilk has a thicker, creamier
consistency.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.930
The hindmilk is the milk behind the foremilk.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.340
The baby will receive the hindmilk after drawing
the foremilk.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340
Step 3.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.210
Understand that the difference is in the fat
content.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.720
Your baby will receive the foremilk first,
and this will quench their thirst; the hindmilk

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.710
will come next and will relieve your child's
hunger because it is richer and fattier than

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.780
the foremilk.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.550
Your child instinctively knows how long to
suckle to get what they need.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.399
They will suck lighter if they are thirsty
and harder when they are hungry.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.399
Step 4.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.950
Understand the process of milk production.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.220
When the mother produces milk, fat clings
to the milk-making cells and the watery part

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.690
moves towards the milk ducts, where it will
mix with unused milk and become the foremilk,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.350
while the fattier liquid stays higher up in
the breast.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.500
Step 5.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.970
Recognize that while your body normally naturally
produces a balanced mix of foremilk and hindmilk,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.780
sometimes an imbalance can occur.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.470
If your child is not gaining weight or seems
fussy, it could be due to an imbalance.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.470
Step 6.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.340
Correct a hindmilk/foremilk imbalance if it
occurs by feeding your child on one side per

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.340
feeding.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.280
If your child wants to nurse again within
a few hours, try to feed them on the same

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.280
side.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.720
This way the baby will empty the breast of
both foremilk and hindmilk and can also help

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.549
to slow down your milk production.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.650
Did you know Research has shown that people
who were breastfed often have lower blood

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.420
pressure and cholesterol, as well as lower
obesity and type-2 diabetes rates.
