00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.930
[Michelle Obama] Hi, everyone. You know, for
me, one of the best parts about being First

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.180
Lady is that I get to meet people from all
across America and talk about what’s going

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.390
on in their daily lives. So, today, I’m
excited to get to talk to all of you and to answer

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.210
a few of the great questions that some of you have
sent to me over Twitter. So let’s get started.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.170
This first question is "What are your biggest
hopes and dreams for your daughters?"

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.000
As most people know, Malia and Sasha are
the center of our worlds. And we think about

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.569
what we need to be doing as parents every
day to make their lives full. Barack and

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.839
I, we know we’re blessed. We feel blessed
as a family. And we know that our daughters

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.609
are blessed too, and we try to make sure that they
know that. But more than anything else, I

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.479
want my girls to find the thing in this world
that will give them passion. I want them to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:56.549
find that path that’s right for them. And
I hope that they’re never afraid to take risks,

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:01.909
to make some mistakes, to trip, fall, stumble,
and figure out how to get back up. Because,

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.790
as I tell them all the time, that’s the
only way you learn. And I also hope that they

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.860
continue to find ways to give back to their
communities and to others who aren’t as

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.150
fortunate. That’s one thing we have always
tried to do as a family, is to always

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.180
do service, to find ways to continue to
reach out. And I want to know that my girls are

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.670
going to be those types of adults as they
get older. There’s nothing more important

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.150
than our children. Not just our children,
but our nation’s children. So thank you

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.530
for the question.
Another great question I received, “Who do you consider

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.700
to be your biggest role models?”
My biggest role models are real people that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.700
I know, people in my life. Umm, and, of course,
my parents stand head and shoulders above

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.909
the rest. My mom and dad didn’t go to college,
but they worked so hard, and they made so

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.990
many sacrifices, to make sure that my brother
and I had the opportunities that every child

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.990
deserves. And it wasn’t easy for them. My
father suffered from multiple sclerosis. But

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.469
the one thing that I remember about my dad
is that, no matter how bad he may have felt,

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.439
or how tough things may have gotten for him,
no matter how much he struggled – and he certainly

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.670
did struggle to get up and go to work every
day – umm, my father just kept on working

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.530
and doing whatever was within his power to
make our lives better.  And like my

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.010
father, my mother worked hard and sacrificed
and pushed us to succeed in ways that she

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.450
probably couldn’t have dreamed for herself.
She always put us ahead of herself. And she’s

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.819
still doing that today for our family here
at the White House. So I try to do right by

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.469
them every day. I wake up in the morning just
wondering whether what I’m doing that day

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:54.939
would make my dad proud and whether I’m
making my mom proud. Thank you for the question.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.590
So here’s a question I’ve been asked a
lot by young women I've met while travelling

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.590
around the country, “What is your advice
to young women starting their careers?”

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.519
Now, I would tell young women, first and foremost,
believe in yourself no matter what others

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.989
might tell you. I was raised in a neighborhood
where not that many people had the chance to

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.739
go to college. And as I was growing up, people
often questioned whether I really had what it took

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.180
to succeed at a school like Princeton, which is where
I eventually went, and later to become a lawyer

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.519
at Harvard. But, I was always lucky to have
parents who believed in me no matter what.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.799
And I also was fortunate to have some fantastic
teachers and mentors who believed in me too.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.029
What these people in my life did is that they helped
me keep all those doubts in check. They helped

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:47.340
to encourage me to pursue my dreams no
matter what was going on in my head. So, that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.579
would be my advice to you young women, and also
young men, out there. Believe in yourself.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.209
Don’t ever let anyone get into your head,
and make you doubt yourself. Know that you

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.609
can do anything you put your mind to, and,
as you get further along in your career, remember

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.559
to find ways to mentor others and to help
them overcome the same obstacles you that

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.299
you faced when you were just starting out. Thanks
so much.

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.470
The final question is on a subject very
near and dear to my heart, “When your girls

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.320
were younger, did you have any difficulty
getting them to eat healthy? Any tips for

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.920
the under-5 crowd?”
That’s a great question. Now this is something

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.010
that most parents, including Barack and I,
that we’ve dealt with. Our kids did

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.840
not come into this world as vegetable fans,
they were like every other kid. So it wasn’t

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.120
easy to get them really focused on eating
the things that were right for them. But there

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.220
are a couple of things that can really help
that we found in our household. And one is having

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.630
fresh produce around and available and easy
for them to access. It tastes so much better

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.150
when it’s fresh, which is one of the reasons
that we’re working to improve access to

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.900
fresh produce in communities across the country.
The other thing that helps kids is letting

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.500
them pick which fruits and vegetables they
like, and then making that food available

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.650
at home. For example, I like to leave a bowl
of fresh fruit in the kitchen so that it’s easy

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.440
for the girls to reach, and to have that more
available than cookies and other snacks. Now,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.470
I’m not saying that that always happens
– that they always go for the apple over

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.470
the, you know, the cookie. But it does help.
And, I also want to say that you’re definitely

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.820
on the right track if you're starting early.
So first and foremost congratulations to the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.240
parents who are getting on this when kids
are very young. Because it is much easier

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.440
to get your kids to healthier foods if it
has always been a part of their lives. It’s

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.610
a lot of work, but it’s well worth it.
So I want to thank you all for sending in

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.610
your questions and keeping in touch on Twitter.
I’m looking forward to continuing the conversation,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.270
so see you back here again soon, okay? Thanks!
