How to Do a Soccer Throw In

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.710
Hey guys, Matt here from Epic Soccer Training.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.029
I want to teach you a video that a couple
of you guys were asking for and that's how

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.809
to do a soccer throw-in.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.940
OK guys.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.900
I want to take you through the basics of how
to do a soccer throw-in, teach you kind of

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.539
what you can do and what you can't do.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.730
So you can get out there and start doing it
correctly.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.130
So again what we want to do is start out balls
in hand.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.000
We will just pretend that this is the sideline
over here.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.200
What you want to do is when you first start
out and you're playing Rec or you're playing

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.230
beginner soccer, what you're going to want
to do is put your feet behind the line.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.460
Your heels have to be on the ground so you
can't I'm sorry.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.120
You can move your heels but you can't lift
your feet at all.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.320
So you can't hop or anything like that or
you can't throw the ball like that.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.631
I hope nobody does that.

00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:54.170
That would be ridiculous.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.420
So again a lot of times, professionals as
well, they usually have they don't really

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.640
care.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.390
So again just ball has to be behind the neck
and it has to be released in front.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.390
OK?

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.440
So you can't actually bless you, Chas.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.710
You can't actually have the ball like this
and just kind of throw it forward.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.710
It actually has to be all the way behind your
neck.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.940
So this is an easy one to practice and you
really shouldn't even have to practice this

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.670
more than like five times.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.330
But again, so just feet planted.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.100
Arch your back because you want to get power.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.170
A good way that I like to hold the ball, it's
similar to a goalkeeper because I had to teach

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.200
goalkeepers how to play a lot.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.909
I'm going to do a video for you goalkeepers
as well.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.550
It's to make a W. So what you want to do,
that's what's going to get the most surface

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.550
area.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.600
Really cock back.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Boom!

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.190
Release it forward.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.460
Then when you're done doing that, you're going
to probably learn to do where you actually

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.070
step and go forward and then drag your foot.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.570
So again what I'm talking about, you can't
lift up your foot.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.610
Actually Chas, can you hop over here for a
second?

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.640
If this is a sideline, ignore the goal and
you're coming through like this.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.950
You have to put your foot behind the line
and then you're going to want to throw and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.180
then usually you will drag your foot because
you're going to be getting the reason you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.190
do that is you get momentum.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.050
So you're going to do a little hop and then
drag your foot and then you're off.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.720
That's something you're going to learn in
soccer too is your first step should always

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720
be moving.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.100
When you pass, your first step should be moving.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.240
It's the same with the throw-in.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.740
Again what I like to actually do is to get
even more power.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.830
As I do this, I do kind of like this hop where
I'm running and I'm hopping to get more power.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.790
So again and the reason to do that is it's
kind of torquing your body into momentum.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.550
But when you first start out, you might want
to just run up to the line, throw it, and

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.810
then drag your foot.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.709
One thing that you need to learn that I can't
stand when people don't do this is if you're

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.590
taking if you're Chas right now, where do
you want the ball?

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.970
Where would you want the ball?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.970
Chas: My feet.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:03.970
Matt: At your feet.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.030
So don't sit there and throw the ball just
anywhere at him.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.030
OK?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.990
A lot of people don't have the wherewithal
to be able to trap and bring it down really

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.920
quickly and even if they trap and bring it
down quickly, you're wasting time; and then

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.310
the defender is going to be on him.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.340
So maybe throw on like a quick fake which
will move the defender over and then boom,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.340
right at Chas' foot.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.560
See how quickly it is he can trap that?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.360
Very quickly.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.070
So again, that's something that you can do
as well.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.900
So I want to teach you the basics of how to
do a throw-in in soccer again.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.530
Keep your back leg down.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.030
Make sure that if you're moving up forward,
you're dragging it and you're not lifting

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.030
it up.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.720
You're going to get called for that unless
you're playing professional and you could

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.930
probably just jump in the air and throw it
because they don't really care anyway.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.780
So that's the basics.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.280
So comment, like, subscribe.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280
Do all that.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Let me know.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.069
Also, I'm going to be filming a video for
those of you that are in the Epic Soccer Training

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.810
members area, the guys that got the course
which you can check that out too of how I

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.810
went from playing just average, being an average
player to being a game-changing All-American

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.060
and professional player as well.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.090
I'm going to do my favorite trick throw-in
for you guys.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.090
It's so awesome.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.060
I love it especially if you're a game-changing
player and you actually want to get the ball

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.060
at your feet.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.169
It's a really cool trick that you can do.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.180
It's legal.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.340
So I will show you guys that as well.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.759
So thanks for checking out how to do a soccer
throw-in and I will see you guys in the next

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:24.809
lesson.
