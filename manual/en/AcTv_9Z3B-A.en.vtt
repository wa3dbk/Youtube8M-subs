00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:41.714
Now I got 2 pieces of new planks

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.300
So I am gonna redo

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.180
The floorboard

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.980
This piece is too thick and too heavy

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:51.223
Initially I am having 3 pieces

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.180
After putting up the 3 pieces of the...

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.800
Wood flooring

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.880
I found out that it's

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.520
Quite wobble

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.160
I decided to go for

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.040
2 pieces

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.920
45 inches (length)

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.820
A side

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.700
It's easier for me to transport and it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.400
 Well

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.320
More stable

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.574
So we're done here, now....

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.840
Based on

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.560
Previous

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600
One that I have made

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.500
I just using it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.660
To

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.160
Well, you know

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:22.954
Just trace out the line

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.060
So

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.080
To prevent wastage

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.340
We'll align it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.060
To the side

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.380
And 

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:40.455
Well might as well I increase a little bit right?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.820
This is the flooring

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.620
That I initially made

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.880
It's kind of just nice

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.014
But after it inflate (The raft)

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.640
What we can see is that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.780
There's quite a huge gap 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.460
there

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.920
On the both side

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.560
I'm not going to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.820
Make it to exactly (the same width)

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.631
Cause I am going to put some tubing

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.880
For

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.140
Holding it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.200
More stable

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.540
And then

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.920
I am going to put the PVC

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.100
The water hose

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.240
Which's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.580
yup

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.800
This is my rubber hose

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.604
So I am going to cut it open and 

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:24.780
Slide it in between just to protect

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.700
The boat

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.140
So I decided to increase by 1 inch

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.240
Alright

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.440
Here we go again!
