00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.960
Playing a nice hip hop groove

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.950
is really determined by how we approach it.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.720
We've got to create the right feel

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.400
in order for it to move the way we want it to.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.140
So we first got to understand where

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.424
it came from, so we can approach it the right way.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.520
Now hip hop

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740
is sort of an extension

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.160
of jazz music.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.140
Which is why

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.700
the marriage between hip hop and jazz

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.020
works so well

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.900
because they are sort of from the same family.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.860
So when we go

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.900
to play a lot of these hip hop grooves

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.100
on the drum kit,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.660
we can actually use

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
the jazz swing as a foundation

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:47.884
to create the right kind of feel.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.880
[demonstration of jazz swing]

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.320
[Voiceover] If you use the jazz swing as your foundation,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.860
it will actually help you to set the pace

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.260
and create the right feel for the flow of the groove

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.401
It's actually a pretty smooth and

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.177
and simple transition to hip hop.

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:23.232
Let's take a look

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.740
First, 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.277
we'll start with the swing

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.980
and we'll throw in that backbeat

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.240
we'll add that kick in, on the 1 and 3

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.540
We're gonna to take it over to the hats

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.460
Now the last step

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.820
is actually to switch from playing the jazz swing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.960
to just playing the straight 8th notes on the high hat.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.200
The idea

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.499
is to keep that jazz swing rolling around in your head.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.409
As a sort of a groove template

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.995
to help you to create a feel for the groove.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.520
But it's the feel of the jazz swing, 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.320
that really going to help that groove

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.204
move along and bounce real nice.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.720
I call this the "Philly Bounce"
