00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.000
The first idea that we had for our first tool 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
came from a rudimentary repair stand. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.420
Instead of putting it over on the floor and squatting down 
and having to pick it back up again, 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.000
then you could turn the bicycle over 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
— clamp it properly — 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000
so that the wheels and the crank and the chain were exposed, 
you could clean them 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
— and it was a sight to behold, but it worked! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.650
We started in the back of a bike shop. 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.560
My father, Howard Hawkins, and his partner, Art Engstrom, 
bought a little bike shop on the east side of Saint Paul. 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.970
So I stopped at his house one day and I said, 
"Lets buy the bike shop!" 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.500
And we looked at each other and said, "Do you have any money?" 
"No, do you have any money?" 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.500
No money, we borrowed it all and started in 1956. 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.000
My first unofficial job at Park Tool was 
test riding the bikes at the old bike shop. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.750
Well, I remember as a kid thinking that 
if your dad could be in any business, 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.310
the coolest one was to have a bike shop, 
and especially a Schwinn shop. 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.120
Very shortly we expanded into the next building, 
and we were the largest Schwinn dealer in the nation 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.250
— and we began to get interested in maybe developing some tools. 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.250
They came out with frame alignment gauges 
and wheel alignment things and, 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.770
you know, all these great tools 
increasingly started to look professional. 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.210
We sold our bike shops in about 1981. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
By that time we didn't have to think about bikes, 
we were thinking only about tools. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.240
It was the product to have if you were going to 
own a bike shop or wanted to do some home… 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.560
work on their bike in their home 
— Park Tool is the tool of choice for that. 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.170
Park would deliberately deliver on time, 
they deliver error free, they deliver everything we ask for… 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.830
Park Tool has always had a philosophy of creating 
quality, long-lasting products. 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.540
We've grown from two employees, Howard and Art 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.590
— two guys, two friends that just wanted to make a living for themselves and their family — 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.000
to now around 50 employees and we sell all around the world. 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.100
Today, Park Tool is the number one tool supplier in the world. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.250
Park Tool is synonymous with high-quality tools 
and with innovative tools. 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.350
Park Tool also has perhaps the highest fill rate of all our suppliers 
— we get between 95 and 100 percent fill rate from them — 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.350
and that makes it very easy to purchase from them. 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.550
There's no other brand that matches Park Tool in terms of 
the breadth of products that they offer; 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.740
mechanics enjoy, trust, and want to use Park Tool. 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.170
Hi, I'm Andy Stone with Team Type 1 
— head mechanic, Jelly Belly pro cycling 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.750
— and I love Park Tool — I like Park Tools — and I use Park Tools 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.750
— Park Tool is one fantastic company! 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.250
Park Tool is a fun company to go visit because, I mean, 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.620
they have their quality control people there, 
they have their engineers there, 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.340
they have their tool designers; they are a fountain of creativity. 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.850
Our foundation is people. 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:43.290
They jump in with both feet, 
offer suggestions, contribute, and have fun. 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.810
We're a very close family here at Park Tool. 
Everybody works together. 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.440
The employees want to show that, 
"hey, I built that stand, that stand has got my initials on it!" 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.000
I think there's an adage in cycling that after you pass 
everyone in the field you start racing yourself, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.680
and Park Tool's success over the years 
is based on always evolving a new standard of excellence. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.400
We help people make sure that they can get out and enjoy their passion as much as and when they want to, 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.750
and so having the right tools and being able to fix them quickly is really important to our customers. That's where Park Tool fits in. 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.440
We owe a lot to the bike dealers because 
they've been faithful in giving us feedback, 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.000
they've been faithful in helping us create a whole other market. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.250
We owe a lot to consumers and the fact that they are loyal to us 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.000
in buying our product to fix their bikes. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.500
When we started Park Tool Company, 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.790
we wanted to build tools that were market-driven, 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.500
tools that people would use, tools that would look good, 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.240
that would hold up, and also that would be guaranteed to do the job. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.750
I couldn't believe what was happening then, 
and now when I see this new building 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.000
and the 50 years that's gone by, I stand in amazement. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.600
I think that we all now have a responsibility 
to find ways to be more efficient, 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.950
to find new products and new ways to innovate and using technology. 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.450
We've been extremely blessed over the years. 
We have a successful business 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.190
and there's still a lot to do and there's a lot of things 
that we can do as a company to get better. 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.750
If you want to narrow it down and say this is our mission, 
I'd say it's to make the best tools we can, to be innovative, 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.000
to stay on top of the changes in a fast-changing industry, 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and to have fun doing it. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.800
We believe we're going to be around for another 50 years.
