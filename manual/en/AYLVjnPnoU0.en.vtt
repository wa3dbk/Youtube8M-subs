00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:26.859
I’ll admit, I’ve been jonesin’ for some
deductive detective work for some time now.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.020
After getting shivved by Capcom, who apparently
think we can’t handle the truth contained

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.920
within Miles Edgeworth 2, I’ve been looking
around for something to get my think on.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.440
And who’s there to save me in my hour of
need?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.940
THE FRENCH.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.719
lexisnumèreique, designers of the Learning
with the PooYoos series and zombie survival

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.899
misstep Amy, somehow managed to hit upon a
fairly entertaining and engaging Noir tone,

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.629
set within a mafia-run metropolis called...

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.629
Metropolis.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.329
So, wait, can’t we just get Superman in
here to fix everything?

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.570
And whose finger is this in my beer?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:12.750
If you haven’t played the original Red Johnson’s
Chronicles... well, the whole thing gets summed

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.040
up, quickly and easily, during the introduction.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.900
You learn that Red here, a private detective,
cracked one hell of a case in the last episode,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.189
earning a hundred-and-fifty-grand price tag
on his head.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.310
Seeking asylum in the hardscrabble dock district
of his youth, he’s approached by a pimp

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.750
who apparently deals more in spectral answers
to puzzles than human companionship.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.619
Which is optimal, because he’s got a number
of puzzles to solve... and women seem to be

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.500
throwing themselves at him anyway.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.880
Between the puzzles, you can investigate your
surroundings and interrogate bystanders, who

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.210
may have insight or eyewitness accounts of
any suspicious goings-on.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.039
Or you might get an economics lecture from
a hobo, who’s trying to drink the markets

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.170
back to health.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.049
If only it were that easy, brother.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:09.840
If only it were that easy.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.230
Most of your puzzles involve fiddling with
an object in 3D, using your powers of observation

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.250
and context-specific commands to interact
with things.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.880
And there’s such a diversity of crap you’ll
be called upon to do that “context-specific”

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.230
is really the only way to go.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.650
How else can you explain using a UV lamp to
illuminate hidden data for a picross puzzle

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.650
written on a tile bath-living-room wall, that
then indicates the station to which to tune

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.680
a radio playing a backmasked plea for help?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.790
It’s pretty Ooops, sorry, looks like you
didn’t press the button in time so you failed

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.060
a quicktime event.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.290
Honestly, things were rolling pretty well
up until this point, but failing the QTEs

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.680
means you get a lower grade for the puzzle,
which costs you money you need to pay off

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
your clue-pimp.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.019
Man, I hate when that happens.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.459
Still, Red Johnson’s Pretty Long Title is
off-beat enough to keep you entertained.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.410
And this is coming from a longtime Phoenix
Wright addict.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:10.270
Patience, patience, we’ll be getting the
new one soon.
