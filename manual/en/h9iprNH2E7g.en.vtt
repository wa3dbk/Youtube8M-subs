What's up, Rob here, Man Vs. Pin

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.220
So, the other week FruityMelody sent us in this pin, which received a crapton of likes

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.140
The good 'ole, "Turn your phone and an old shoebox into a projector."

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.280
Pin-O-Meter, whaddya think?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.480
Yeaah, it looks a little dicey, I've seen a couple of videos, a couple blogs, but, really?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.700
So, I grabbed myself an old shoebox, that's right we're keeping the 90s alive over here.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.640
I scored this magnifying glass, some putty, and an Exacto blade.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.420
I took apart the magnifying glass, placed it on the shoe box, and traced around it with a marker.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.540
Then with the Exacto blade, I carefully cut out the hole. 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.300
I proceeded to secure it on by taping both sides with some duct tape.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.480
Then I took out my putty and created this little, kinda putty stand for it which I can easily adjust

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.140
and move back and forth however I like.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.360
Next I took out my phone and in my settings, switched the auto rotate off

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.220
and made sure to turn the brightness all the way up.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.340
Threw on a quick episode of Game of Thrones and placed the phone to where the image was upside down.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.240
This is super important because the optics of the magnifying glass will reverse it on the other side.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.620
You'll see.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.060
I set up my  in front of a white wall, I just moved the phone around in the box until I found the right focus

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.000
Put on the top, turned out the lights, and bam. Phone, shoe box, Projector.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.420
Look at this *BEEPING* thing, huh? Nice and bright, not that crisp, but, oh, hold on

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.740
What, you can't see it?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.500
Oh, yeah, that's because it's barely visible.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.760
You may need the vision of a cat to possibly see this.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.680
Oh there it is. Oh and the size, in actuality? Yeah, the size, ah, is like maybe like 18x20 inches.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.260
Big *BLEEPING* deal.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.340
Oh hold on, wait, Game of Thrones is, Game of Thrones is backwards.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.200
Hold on, so the entire image is backwards?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.320
This isn't right, is this supposed to happen?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.260
Alright, I'm taking it back into the lab, maybe the magnifying glass is on the wrong way?

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.000
Alright, take all the *BLEEPING* tape off, awesome. And then I switched around the lens

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.380
Just flipped it over to the other side, and, let's give that a try.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.820
Alright, here we go

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.560
Aaaand, Ah..No, no that still doesn't work.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440
So I guess there's no way around that. Whatever you watch is going to be flipped-flopped.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.040
As long as you're not reading any subtitles I guess that's alright.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.380
But honestly it doesn't matter because you can't see much in the first place.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.300
And that's it, that's the whole..the whole thing. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.220
Way to go Pinterest! 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.220
If you've seen a pin out there that looks like a bunch of *BLEEP* I wanna know about it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.420
Leave it in the comments below and if you agree that it should be here on the show

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.360
like it up. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.340
I'll see you next time
