00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.940
People.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.570
People.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.760
People.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.390
Are you ready to get catified?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.616
I just want to point out
this nifty shirt right here.

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:21.990
If you know the story-- don't
know if you know the story,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.450
but Editor-in-Chief, or former
Editor-in-Chief, Ted Williams,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.890
from the "Audubon Magazine"
had written a story

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.270
advocating the
killing of feral cats

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.870
through means such
as painkillers.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.000
And saying that
they were a menace

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.020
to all wildlife and birds.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.670
One of the quotes
in that op-ed piece

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.970
was to call people who've
supported TNR as "the feral cat

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.680
mafia."

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.230
So as you can see, we are
proudly wearing our colors

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.945
as the feral cat mafia.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.030
Yes, unfortunately,
we would like

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.250
to save the up to 80
million feral cats walking

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.420
around our country.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.900
Call us bleeding hearts.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.660
But we love cats, right?

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.769
We love all cats.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.920
Show that you love cats.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.150
Go to voxfelina.org.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.330
You'll see the link
right down below.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.720
Great resource when it
comes to feral cats.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.400
You can buy one
of these suckers.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.680
And all of the proceeds will
go to benefit Fixnation.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.550
Fixnation is located
here in Los Angeles.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.990
And they do the most amazing
thing, which is what?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.880
They fix feral cats
for free, people.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.630
For free.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.640
They can only do that
with your support.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.200
Buy one of these bad boys.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.230
You will also support Fixnation.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.830
Talk about a win-win, because
it's also pretty stylish.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.940
