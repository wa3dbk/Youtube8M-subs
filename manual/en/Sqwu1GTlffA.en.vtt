00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:07.027
The weights don't change.

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:11.128
The muscles you can pull down or you can be tired.

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:14.158
The weight is always the weight anywhere and you have the same weight.

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.920
You just took the weight away and it's done.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.461
For this, eh?

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.055
And here also.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:23.066
I don't squeeze.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.678
I tug my hand.

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:27.455
la la.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:30.041
Here's my grip. Here.

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:37.120
I hold my weight of my arms and believe me, when you hold your weight,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.912
all your weight with one finger, it's like if you play **[0:43]**

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.390
All, because the quality of the song come when everything's,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.525
it's like if you have **[0:53]** everywhere.

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:05.202
Because it's very, I use my weight.

00:01:08.258 --> 00:01:09.260
I use the weight.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.217
ba ba ba ba ba.

00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:18.211
Why? Because it's so pressured, the weight, that if you want to do that, don't do it tomorrow.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:24.297
Do it, if you want to do it, do it two minutes a day

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:29.887
because then the night, you're going to hold all the weight.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:32.369
It's become different.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:39.683
So, I know, I have seventy on the twelfth of March.

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.590
Seventy-seven years old.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:51.464
[CLAPPING]

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:56.898
Believe me, **[1:52]** to allow progress because I use my weight.

00:01:56.898 --> 00:02:03.664
I, last night I picked one hour and a half concert without stopping.

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:07.582
We have some witness here.

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:10.564
[LAUGHS]

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.087
That means I give you a hope for all of you.

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:18.449
Seventy-seven.

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:24.980
Imagine how many progress you're going to make. Fantastic!

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.782
[LAUGHS]

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:29.394
The more I go, more liable.

00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:34.096
Weight. Weight. All use weight.

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:37.597
You show me when, you see me when I go up to **[2:38]**,

00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:45.407
I'm just, I just take the weight of my arms off and the weight of my shoulder and the bow.

00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:52.042
[WHISPERS] It's a **[2:50]** you have this.

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:55.909
The movement come from within.

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:03.327
Yes. You like that, I fess up?

00:03:03.327 --> 00:03:06.175
I can have some question, maybe.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:10.041
Not by Robert again.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.209
