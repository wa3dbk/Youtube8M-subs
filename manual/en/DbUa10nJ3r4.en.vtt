00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.502
(classical music)

00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:12.680
- Hey, Cristen.
- Hey, Ben.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.590
- You want to turn that cup of water

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.154
into a weight-loss tonic?

00:00:16.154 --> 00:00:17.608
- Do I?!

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:19.984
- All right, add some ice.

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:21.703
- Whoa, whoa, Ben.

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:23.843
- That's right, our bodies burn calories

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:25.827
by warming up ice-cold water,

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:27.534
but to understand whether ice water

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.391
can be an effective weight-loss tool,

00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:32.205
we first need to talk about
what calorie burning entails.

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:34.064
- That's right, it takes one calorie

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:37.061
to raise the temperature
of one liter of water

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:38.644
one degree Celsius.

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:41.979
So clearly, calories are burned off

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.360
during the process of our bodies
heating up that cold water

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.258
to our internal body temperature of

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:51.772
around 37 degrees Celsius,
translated, of course,

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:53.743
to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:54.605
- Oh, nice.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:56.007
All right, so let's figure out exactly

00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:00.335
how many calories we burn when
we're drinking a 16-ounce,

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:03.281
or half a liter, glass of ice water.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.731
- Well, let's estimate
that the temperature

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.003
of the ice water is zero
degrees Celsius, or freezing.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.469
- Yeah, okay, that's some cold water.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.074
- That's really cold water.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.422
- So, as we mentioned
earlier, our body temperature

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:18.174
is somewhere around 37 degrees Celsius.

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:21.666
- In which case, if you drink
a liter of that ice water,

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.325
you'll burn around 37
calories as a byproduct.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.845
- Boom, and considering that 37 calories,

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.131
in the context of a
2,000 calorie daily diet

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.850
isn't that significant of a portion,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.057
it means that even if you drink

00:01:35.057 --> 00:01:37.718
the recommended eight
glasses of water a day,

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:40.096
it adds up to just under two liters.

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.338
You're burning less
than 75 calories, right?

00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:44.720
- Oh, that's not that much.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.457
But, Ben, you can increase
that calorie-burning effect

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:51.465
by chewing on ice because
it takes 80 calories

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:53.495
to melt a liter of ice,

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:56.247
so if you freeze half of
your daily water intake

00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:59.470
and just eat that ice, you'll
burn an extra 80 calories,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.551
and possibly need to go see the dentist.

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.697
- Yes, for your new
ice-chewing habit, right?

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:06.698
But I'm sure the dentist will understand.

00:02:06.698 --> 00:02:08.608
The point is that adding iced water

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.830
doesn't really turn it into
a magical weight-loss tonic,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.663
right Cristen?

00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:14.463
I'm sorry, I should have told you that.

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:15.764
I should have said that in the beginning.

00:02:15.764 --> 00:02:17.906
- Yeah, but hydration from
that water is definitely

00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:22.622
necessary for a much more
effective weight-loss tool.

00:02:22.622 --> 00:02:26.592
- Are you talking about the
thing where you chase birds?

00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:27.637
Does anybody else do that?

00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:30.259
I feel like birds look at me, and-

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.427
- I was going to say exercise, but-

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:35.344
- Oh, yeah, exercise is definitely-

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:37.479
- Exercise, Ben.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.162
- But just, you know,
watching birds I feel-

00:02:40.162 --> 00:02:41.726
- You can jog after birds.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:43.027
- Okay, so ...

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:44.752
- But just be careful where you're going.

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:45.585
- Okay.

00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.502
- Keep your eyes, yeah.

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:49.694
- Did this get weird?

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:51.087
- It's a little ...

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.420
I think it's a little weird.

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.284
I'm going to go get some water.

00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:59.034
- But we're still ...

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.722
Thanks so much for watching.

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:06.061
