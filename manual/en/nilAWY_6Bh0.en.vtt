00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:22.970
Sure, the game’s fantastic, but you know
and I know those adorable inklings from Splatoon

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.289
have “marketable” written all over ‘em.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.589
It was a foregone conclusion there were going
to be Amiibo… in fact, if you’re in Europe,

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.640
you knew that you could get one of them right
along with the game itself!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.840
Well, unless you’re British.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.300
Some daft bloke nicked the entire lorry, or
for those of you who don’t speak limey,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.090
some jerk stole the entire truck containing
the GAME chain’s allotment of amiibo-bundled

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.570
copies, leading to widespread chaos, hysteria,
and preorder cancellations.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.300
Even finding these online was a challenge
near release, with most outlets selling out

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.839
in 15 minutes or less.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.090
But where there’s a squid, there’s a way,
and here’s three of ‘em.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.429
Two of ‘em happen to be kids at present.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:07.780
I feel we’ve covered this already...

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.590
While the girl and boy inklings are available
separately, the only way to get the Squid

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.360
amiibo is in this 3-pack or in the European
bundle.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.190
And while none of the amiibo are strictly
necessary, they do unlock some pretty sweet

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.190
toys.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.170
But soft, we’ll get to those in a sec.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.759
Firstly, the amiibo themselves, or “Man,
why hasn’t Nintendo been making these longer?”

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.180
These sculpts have a bit more panache than
your standard Smash Bros. amiibo, specifically

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
in the details like the rippling in the puddles
of ink at their feet (or tentacles) and the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.329
translucency on their ink tanks.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.450
All the models have a glossiness to them that
works well with the whole “ink” idea,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.750
and while there are some unsupported bits
like the girl’s hair-tentacles, everything

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.750
feels rock-solid.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.299
These things are crafted out of pure Nintendonium,
it seems.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:57.560
Enough about the physical world, it’s time
to get on a roller.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.070
Unlike the AI-training and portability aspects
of the Smash Bros. series of Amiibo, these

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.110
Splatoon figures just unlock 20 alternate
missions each for single-player enjoyment.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.940
I say “alternate” because they’re the
same as the regular single-player missions,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.319
but with altered weapons.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.819
I say “just” because that’s really not
all that much, truth be told.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.709
Sure, the rewards for clearing these challenges
are pretty sweet - each amiibo unlocks a mini-game

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.569
you can play in the matchmaking lobby, a cosmetic
alteration of one of the basic weapons, and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.010
a full set of gear - but some might claim
that this is exactly the kind of thing that

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.550
amiibo shouldn’t be used for.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.819
Part of me agrees.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.819
The functionality is quite limited, especially
since these things are just acting as a dongle

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.720
for content already on the disc - or, as it’s
becoming known, “the primary issue folks

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.680
have with Splatoon.”

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.590
On the other hand, if there’s one thing
Amiibo have shown it’s diversity: These

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.349
things work with anything that asks you to
simply tap to get stuff, including Hyrule

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.070
Warriors and, yes, Amiibo Tap.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.540
But instead of that train wreck, I’ll be
showing you content from a good game instead.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.390
One of the primary purposes of the single-player
campaign - the original mode, not the amiibo

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.319
challenges - was to teach you the game.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.720
Nintendo games are very good at this, after
all.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.620
And if said original mode is your introduction
to the standard, middle-of-the-road ink-slinging

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.390
arsenal, then the Girl and Boy figures will
give you a thorough training on the finer

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.819
points of Chargers and Rollers, especially
in the realm of using them for mobility.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.099
Or, in the case of the remixed final boss
battle - yes, that whole affair - using said

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.250
weapons in swiftly changing situations.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.340
I won’t spoil it, but those are the real
challenges - everything else is just a matter

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.670
of thinking a little bit further outside the
box.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.980
But what of our squid friend?

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.150
KRAKEN CHALLENGES.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.330
That’s right, you get to tear through stages
as the invincible, wall-climbing Kraken.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.480
And if that sounds like it’s not much of
a challenge… well, you’re right.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.849
It’s way too easy.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.990
Thus, these stages are under a timer and treated
as speed tests… and frankly, you’re going

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.780
to blow every one of them away.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.239
The real challenge lies in the Squid levels
that don’t feature the Kraken, as those

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.090
are ink-limited stages where once you’re
out, you’re out.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.280
It takes a try or two to appreciate just how
devious this really is, and it hits home once

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.500
you get to that one stage with the invisible
platforms.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.950
Hope you don’t mind leaps of faith!

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:28.860
So the question ultimately boils down to this:
Is it worth… well, started at $35ish but

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.510
now in the vicinity of $60 of your hard-earned
money for sixty remixed versions of old stages,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.850
three exclusive sets of gear, three mini-games
you’ll get to play for a few seconds at

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.570
a shot (since, let’s face it, matchmaking
in this game is pretty darn quick all told),

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.500
and three purely cosmetic reskins for your
arsenal?

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.050
That’s up to you to decide.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.860
Sure, it seems like a lot to pay at the present
moment, especially since it’s just unlocking

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.390
on-disc content and damn if that doesn’t
feel a little bit shady.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.420
Yes, there’s forward-thinking potential
to these admittedly nice-looking hunks of

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.320
plastic and NFC chips, but if you haven’t
already jumped in (and managed to snag these

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.310
for MSRP,) feel free to chill out and wait
until the market calms down… or further

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.180
utility for these amiibo are announced.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.380
I’m not exactly holding my breath, but that’s
because squids can breathe underwater.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.380
And in ink.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.500
Duh.
