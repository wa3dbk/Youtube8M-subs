-Thanks a lot.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.186
I'm getting real sick and tired of
being dragged all over the place.

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:18.715
-Whoa! You're the biggest
orange I've ever seen!

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.434

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:25.817
I'm orange, you're orange.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:27.277
We're both oranges!

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.304
-I'm not an orange, I'm a pumpkin.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.672
-Pumpkin?
Don't you mean "plumpkin"?

00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:34.830

You're huge!

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.533
-Hey, Plumpkin,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.508
-Not really.

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:49.180
-[burps, laughs]

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.363

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.078
-Hey, Plumpkin!
-What?

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:56.935
-Can you touch your
eyeball with your tongue?

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.654
-No.
-You haven't even tried it yet.

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:00.233
Try it! Errl...

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.022
-I don't want to try it.

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:04.523
-Errl... almost. Errl...

00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:05.666
-Would you stop that?

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.152
-I almost got it.

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:09.242
-Orange, knock it off!

00:01:09.242 --> 00:01:10.696
-You're not trying.

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.189
-Oh, my God, stop it!
-What?

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.284
-You know,
I'm a pretty relaxed guy most of the time,

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:16.626
and it takes a lot to get me riled,

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.716
but you,
you are driving me crazy,

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:20.620
and I've only been here--
what?--a minute.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.920
You don't shut up!

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.876
And it's Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:27.121
Not Orange, not Plumpkin,
and I'm not your brother.

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.607
What? What is it?

00:01:28.607 --> 00:01:31.022
Why are you mumbling
and making that face?

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.759
-Knife.
-Huh?

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.316
[screaming]

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:38.685
-Somebody should take
that guy's knife away.

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:40.728
Right in the head.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:42.446
Oh no, he's tearing your insides out.

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:43.933

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:47.741
-Hey! Hey, Plumpkin!

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.459
Hey, Plumpkin! Hey!

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.502
Hey Plumpkin,

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:53.592
somebody carved a face on your butt.

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:59.072
[laughing]

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:00.837
Oh...

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:01.914
Hey, who turned out the lights?
