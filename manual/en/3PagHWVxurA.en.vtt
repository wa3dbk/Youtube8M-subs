00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.900
BM: Yargh! That be a lot of apples!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.250
AJ: And they're all ours! We've got this town in our hooves now.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.400
I'll have these moved by tomorrow morning, but you get back to training,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.130
and don't forget, he goes down in the fourth,
so don't knock him out early this time!

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.300
BM: Yargh.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.900
RD: Uh oh.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
TS: Run everypony! It's dirty illegal immigrants!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.500
(crowd in disarray)

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.900
AJ: Oi, this is my town. Get your own!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.000
Cow: You may have won this time, Applejack,
but we bovines will return!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.100
AJ: Try it and die!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Cow: Bovine Boys! Move out!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
AJ: Ah, bugger me, that's a lot of cows.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.500
Oh, bollocks! I just remembered Big Mac's not here!
Maybe some of the ponies in town can help me fight.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.520
TS: And that's why we're giving this award to Snuggle Berry.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.000
For being a cutesy wootsy cuddle pie!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.400
RD: And for, like, showing up to my
birthday party when no one else did.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.800
FS: Kanye West!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
AJ: Wait a minute! Let me see that trophy.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
...for being a cutsy wootsy...

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Aw, damn I'm going to die.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.080
TS: What's the problem, Applejack?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.200
AJ: I need to collect all these apples if I'm
to use them as weaponry tomorrow.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.500
TS: Why doesn't Big Mac help you?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.900
AJ: He's got a big fight he's training for,
and no one, ever, interrupts his training!

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.100
TS: So you're gathering all these apples?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
AJ: Course I am! Why wouldn't I be?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.189
TS: Well I was just thinking maybe
you shouldn't collect all these apples.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.900
AJ: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't punch you in the face.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.790
TS: Well, shouldn't you have more effective weapons of war?

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.700
Also, why do you need weapons?

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.600
AJ: Oh, that reminds me!
The catapult!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.800
RD: So, like, you just want me to stand here?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
AJ: Yes that's right, you just stand there,
and I'll launch you at the cows.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.900
RD: Like, yay! I haven't been this happy since
Snuggle Berry came to my birthday party...

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.800
that you didn't come to...
you would have seen her there...

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
there's was no one else there.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.300
AJ: Ah, shut up. Here I come!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.400
RD: Like, wait! I don't want to do this anymore!
NOOOOOOOO!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.400
AJ: Try to deal as much damage as you can!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
RD: Ow, that hurt.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.700
Cow: Nice try, Applejack, but you will
not stop us with your measly catapult.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.400
RD: Hey you're new! Be my friend or I'll hate you.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.600
Cow: Get out of here!

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000
RD: Party pooper.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.600
AJ: OK, so that didn't work.
I know! Pinkie Pie!

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.700
Pinkie! You're the expert on cruel and unusual warfare!
What have you got for me?

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.100
PP: Aw bro, muffins!
AJ: Muffins.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.000
PP: Muffins!
AJ: MUFFINS!?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Derpy Hooves: Muffins!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.170
AJ: Ah, balls to you. I'll try Fluttershy.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.700
FS: How about a stampede of cute little bunnies?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.000
AJ: That's a terrible idea.
Let's see what they've got.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.920
(distressed crowd noises)

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.500
AJ: I can't believe how useless these ponies all are.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.800
Well, stick with what you know.
Apple warfare it is.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.700
TS: Hi, Applejack! It's me, Twilight!

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.200
AJ: I swear to God; do we even have gods in Equestria?
I don't know, but I swear...

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
WHAT DO YOU WANT, TWILIGHT?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.600
TS: I was just wondering if you're still collecting those apples.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.500
AJ: There's no reason for me not
to be collecting these apples, Twilight.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.000
TS: Look, just, please don't collect them!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.400
AJ: Like I'm going to listen to you.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.079
TS: Applejack you have to stop.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.700
AJ: What do you mean? What are you talking about?
Get off me!

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.400
TS: Applejack there's something I've been
meaning to tell you, but I just don't know how.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.700
AJ: Twilight...

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.600
TS: Applejack, I...

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.599
I accidentally poisoned all your apples! I'm sorry!

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.800
AJ: You did what!?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.669
TS: It was for an experiment and it... I needed...
it... went... well... things went bad.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.329
TS: Twilight, you daft ninny!
What am I going to do with all these poisoned ap...

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.200
Poisoned, you say?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.700
TS: Um, yes?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.100
AJ: And how good would you say this poison is then?

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.169
TS: I don't know, I haven't tested it yet.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.800
AJ: I see...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.519
Today, as good friends, I've decided to give you all a treat.
Cause we're all good friends here.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800
Try some of this apple poi... juice I got for you.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.800
RD: Like, that was so good!
This is so much better than my birthday party.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.400
S: Pinkie! Is everything alright?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400
PP: Oh no. I'm feeling something!

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.900
(unwanted regurgitation)

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.919
PP: The pain! It hurts, it hurts bad.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.900
AJ: Oh, yes! We'll be having steak for dinner tonight!

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.200
RD: Snuggle Berry was, like, my best friend...

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.100
And now she died!
She got run over by bunnies. Freaking bunnies!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.400
It's just not fair!
I know I have everyone but why does everyone hate me?
