Hello I'm Annie Brunson on behalf of Expert
Village. We are learning about making musical

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.660
instruments using everyday household items.
Today we are going to make a tom tom. The

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.210
best thing to do is to find a oatmeal container
or any kind of container will work. This is

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.250
a toilet roll holder from a office. This would
also work but we are going to use a oatmeal

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.880
container. The first thing you are going to
do is actually cover it so you could decorate

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.290
it. I have already put one sheet on here so
the next thing that you do is actually cover

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.900
it on the other side. So now it is covered.
If you want to you could go ahead and decorate

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:55.980
it at this time. Putting some strips or whatever
you want to do on the drum. Of course it could

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.860
take a longer to do some pretty patterns then
what I have done. The next thing that you

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:14.540
are going to do is punch out the bottom of
the container. So now we could look straight

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.800
through. We now have a cylinder and a little
bit of oatmeal. So that is what we do next.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.020
The next thing we do is take a balloon and
you are going to cut off the narrow part of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:42.320
the balloon. After you have stretch it over
someone else needs to put a elastic band over

00:01:42.320 --> 00:02:17.470
the top. That is one end now repeat with the
other end.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:29.910
Then you could get a pencil with a eraser
at the end of it and you got a tom tom. You

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:40.819
could make smaller ones any kind of sizes
you want as long as the balloon could stretch

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.650
over it. This is a smaller one.
