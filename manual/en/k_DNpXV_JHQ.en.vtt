ask them about reality television

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.849
and all of these students are thinking
that they're going to have to answer

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.299
questions

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.550
of a higher caliber so they're just like
wire we at being asked questions about

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.539
reality tv

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.279
you know they're assuming that they we
have a tv and be we watch reality

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.650
television right right summit region a
question ok ob that people who will

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.210
create the s_a_t_ edit pick the question
say that even if you don't watch reality

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.190
television you can still answer this
question some of the region a question

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.670
you tell me whether or not you agree
with them perfect except so reality

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
television programs which feature real
people engaged in a real activities

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
rather than professional actors
performing scripted scenes

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.249
are increasingly popular

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.339
these shows a pic ordinary people
competing in everything from singing and

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.000
dancing to losing weight

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.860
or just living their everyday lives most
people believe that reality that the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.860
reality tv shows perjury is authentic
but they are being misled how often take

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.460
any shows b_-one produces design
challenges up for the participants and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.259
then editors alter films scenes do
people benefit from forms of

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.810
entertainment that so-called reality or
are such forms of entertainment

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.300
the essay questions that ok than i think
it's a get request your gracious god

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.640
yeah

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.010
uh...

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.190
i think that's it

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.240
azzam i think that's a fair question

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.890
i think it's a fair question as well
because

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.640
here's the thing it even if you don't
watch reality tv it gives you a summary

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
of what reality television it's and they
ask you whether or not it's harmful to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.880
society

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.200
so you can at definitely answer that
question even if you haven't watched

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.440
reality television however if you are a
person who has watched reality tv you'll

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.660
have an easier time finding specific
answers to make your as say more

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.510
insightful yet another great uh... i
don't even think that that's ticket can

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.610
imagine that references to smoking

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.830
increases

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.349
no i i measured that knowingly if you've
eaten there's no way as smart kid

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.260
can't give a thoughtful answer that
question whether they've seen reality i

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.209
mean you know they personally i think
he's going to ask you essay questions

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.390
about which you're not an expert yeah i
mean that they're going to ask you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.489
questions about

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.279
any with the idea that you can't discuss
sort of important trends in modern media

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.029
because you haven't swatch reality tv
that seems ridiculous but i i feel is

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.599
that the totally legitimate question by
a head count on them

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.899
bogus best brother items you have a
question and you know that the most

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:42.259
important part out as soon as they
portion of the s_a_t_ is to show that

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:47.759
they you can spell and be you no grammar
you know you know how to construct an

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.769
essay and you know how to do it and
smart if you make an argument that he

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.699
backed up right exactly the back it up
by referencing

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:56.730
the situation

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.219
right exact and the students are super
upset about it though ed applecare

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.769
