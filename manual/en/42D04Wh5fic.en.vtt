- Hey guys, I'm Isaac. I play Eldon on The Next Step.
And today I'm gonna do a bit of freestyle.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.700
- [Victoria] In episode 1 of season 2, we're all hanging out and we're all freestyling

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.620
and we all have our individual styles when we freestyle.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.600
- [Jordan] The cool thing about freestyle is that
it can be anything you want it to be.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
My freestyle is going to be different than
James's freestyle, or Riley's freestyle,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.080
which makes it the coolest thing ever!

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.600
- [Isaac] When I freestyle, personally, I like
to do a lot of strong things, like jumps and turns,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.380
but then I like to slow it down,
do a bit of like, waving and popping.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.900
So I'm gonna go freestyle now,
and you guys... freestyle with me!

- So what I just did there was a mix of acro, contemporary, and a little bit of jazz.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.820
- My style is kinda like a jazz fusion, um,
with contemporary and that kind of stuff.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.700
- I like to mix a lot of styles and genres of dance.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.920
- Use what you have! If you're really flexibile,
then grab your leg and...

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.920
I don't know, do something you've never done before!
