00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.330
Telstra T165i.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.930
The Telstra T165i is a 3G phone made exclusively
for the Australian Telstra network by ZTE.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.090
The T165i demonstrates a completely different
approach to mobile phone design from most

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.050
mainstream handsets, and with good reason.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.130
Australia is a huge country, and most of it
is very sparsely populated.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.300
Mobile phone coverage in rural areas is not
great, but Telstra tries very hard to make

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.480
sure that as many consumers as possible can
get access to its "Next G" UMTS 3G service.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.710
The Telstra T165i is specifically designed
to be used outside of regional centres and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.589
towns, and one immediately obvious feature
is the large extendable antenna which helps

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.670
the T165i to pick up a 3G signal.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.390
The Telstra "Next G" network replaced their
old 850 MHz CDMA network, and one of the conditions

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.370
set by the Australian government to allow
the changeover was that the new 3G network

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.640
should have as wide a coverage as possible.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.010
One result of this is the Telstra T165i, created
as a result of these special market conditions.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.800
If you find that the standard antenna doesn't
quite give good enough reception, then the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.600
T165i can be connected to an external antenna
via a patch lead or a car kit.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.910
It seems strange to think that you might want
to use a mobile phone with a fixed antenna

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.710
on a building, but you can.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.400
Part of the reason for this is that the Next
G network can also be used as a relatively

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.750
high-speed way to access the internet in areas
"normal broadband" cannot reach.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.980
Underneath the chunky exterior, the Telstra
T165i has a 2" 240 x 320 pixel anti-glare

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:07.640
display, a 2 megapixel camera with autofocus,
A-GPS plus Whereis maps, an FM radio, MP3

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.590
player, basic web browser and an email client.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.670
Of course, the T165i also has Bluetooth and
microSD expandable memory.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.310
Telstra say that the T165i measures 117 x
51 x 16mm which makes it a little larger than

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.819
a standard phone.. what they don't tell you
is that this excludes the antenna stub which

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.290
makes it around 139mm tall, which is very
large indeed.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.440
Talktime is around 3.5 hours with up to 10
days standby time.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.630
It isn't an attractive phone, but in terms
of looks perhaps the best word we can find

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.230
is "purposeful".

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.000
The T165i is clearly designed to do a job,
and from the reports that we have seen it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.290
does this very well.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.760
Perhaps it would be nice to see phones like
this being more widely available, because

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.780
people in other countries often have coverage
problems.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.480
The Telstra T165i is available now.
