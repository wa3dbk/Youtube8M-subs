00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.350
After the base is on I've taken a bunch of
two-ply tissues and pulled them apart so it's

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.870
just one-ply like this.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.100
You want to do that with a number of tissues
and set them aside.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.349
Now I'm going to take clear latex.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.710
This is also a Ben Nye product, but there
are several other companies that make liquid

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.710
latex.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.900
This one comes with a little nail polish brush.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.780
I am going to paint his face with the latex
and then stick the tissue on top.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.850
So I'll just start over here.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.050
This doesn't have to be perfect because we
want it to deteriorate.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.670
We want this makeup to actually deteriorate.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:59.789
You have to work kind of fast because you
don't want it to dry all the way before you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.920
stick the tissue on.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:12.160
So, I'm just going to put the tissue right
on and then kind of pull away the parts that

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.010
aren't sticking.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.040
I'm just going to repeat this all over his
face.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.190
Latex has a little bit of a gnarly smell,
and it doesn't feel super good around the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.190
eyes.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.900
So just be careful around that area, or avoid
it altogether.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:44.030
I'm just doing a really thin layer, then putting
that tissue on until it sticks, then tearing

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.190
it off.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.390
These square edges you can just rip so that
they're uneven.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.490
We don't want any perfect shapes really.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.800
Okay.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.690
So, we're going to do the entire face with
the latex, just patting that in there.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.260
Work as quick as you possibly can so the latex
doesn't dry on you.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.299
Again, I'm going to avoid this eye area.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.519
I'm also going to avoid any hair like his
eyebrows.
