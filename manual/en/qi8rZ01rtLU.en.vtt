before you pulled up a gun

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240
together issue with the republican

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
who those are the through really

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.480
but the big

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.050
perhaps argent compare

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.960
and accuracy in this e-mail why do you
have

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.590

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.900
be in israeli spot

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.219
so uh... that is about as bad as it gets

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.919
mud that's because really russell walker
had claimed moron

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.349
was a syrian spot

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.190
score billing worthless is five course
in israeli spy but not only that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.140
uh... he also said he was a crime
politician which we assume and then

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140
uh... he etc work first

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.089
to what caused file

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.239
and as soon as you can

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.980
is a is the one thing is and corrupt
come up who wasn't really right

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.340
isabella examined inside you spy which
is pretty bad

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.919
your group level

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.259
here's my point

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.489
this to wish you throw in a moment

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.969
ordinary americans they threw her she
read books right

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.519
breed i wish you throw

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.769
this here's what does it happen

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.809
it doesn't intimidate or upon

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:50.689
okay

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.310
he is very issue at me

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.739
is on the one you're a clown

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.049
to you no longer have issued

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.979
but with critic pulling up a little bit
more intimidating but apparently not

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.939
from a riot police were going to go at
it anyway

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.789
to redeem politics

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.649
prudent serious

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.849
except for the shoot for which is pretty
damn ground
