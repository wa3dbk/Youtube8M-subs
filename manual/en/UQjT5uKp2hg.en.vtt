00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.320
Spring is here!

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.360
Now, instead of building snow forts and licking
icicles, we can skateboard and ride our bikes,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.610
and we don’t have to worry about Squeaks
getting rusty in the snow.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.090
[Squeaks squeaks]

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.900
Speaking of seasons—you know we have four
of them: Spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.000
But do you know why we have more than one
season?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.740
Well, we have seasons because the Earth is
tilted. Instead of standing straight up and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.540
down, it leans a little bit.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.500
Whoa! How’d that happen?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.519
A really, really long time ago—billions
of years ago—scientists think something

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.800
big hit the Earth. The impact was so strong
that it knocked our planet over a little bit.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.409
So now Earth is tilted.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.010
And our tilted planet travels around the sun,
completing one full trip all the way around

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.860
every year.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.030
I mean, that’s what a year is -- the time
it takes for the Earth to go around the sun

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.190
once.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.010
And depending on where the Earth is in its
journey around the sun, our exposure to sunlight

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.799
changes.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.049
That means the seasons change. That’s why
we have four seasons in one year.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.720
Sometimes during the year, part of the Earth
tilts toward the sun. Sometimes it tilts away

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.720
from the sun.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.330
When the part of the planet you’re on is
tilted toward toward the sun, it’s—you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.990
guessed it!—summer. When it’s tilted away
from the sun, it’s—yup!—winter.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.920
And when it's in between, well, the weather's
pretty much in between too. That’s when

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.750
we have spring and autumn. They’re both
a little bit warm, and a little bit cool,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030
and often windy!

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.120
But if the season also depends on where on
the Earth you happen to live, that means that

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.730
not everyone experiences the same season as
the same time.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.200
It can be summer in some parts of the world
when it’s winter in others. Because those

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.270
different parts of the planet are getting
different amounts of sunlight.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.520
When the Northern hemisphere is tilted toward
the sun and it’s summertime, the Southern

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.370
hemisphere, is tilted away, so it’s wintertime
there.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.120
So the tilty-ness of our planet explains a
lot.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.670
It’s why we have seasons, and why it’s
not always winter or always summer all of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.800
the time. And it also helps us understand
why different parts of the world can experience

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.680
different seasons at the same time.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.069
Thanks for watching, guys. Enjoy your season,
whatever it happens to be! See you next time.
