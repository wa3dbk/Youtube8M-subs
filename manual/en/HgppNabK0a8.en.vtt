00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.210
ladies and gentlemen

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.930
there are a lot of indicators out there
as to who is going to win this election

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.120
if you are liberal and a feat an
effeminate apparently made several sober

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.280
is your guy according to the right wing
who have been uh... attacking nate

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.910
seller for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.660
i don't know the way he speaks the way
he dresses and the fact that he does now

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.410
and uh... he is predicting some seventy
percent chance of president obama

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.339
winning maybe a little bit more

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.090
it varies on a day-to-day basis he
compiles averages paul's way to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.630
different polls uh...

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.010
just like

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.410
pollsters do it

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.360
they're constantly waiting different
factors as having more influence than

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
others

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.100
some people go to trade sports which
seems to me to be ridiculous i know that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.180
if i

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.770
had millions of dollars and wanted to
make it look like uh... my candidate was

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.230
winning i a think i would just buy a
bunch of deaths

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.810
to that effect but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.570
nevertheless i have my own

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.420
barometer of president obama's chances
of winning

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.030
one that is not

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.240
wispy or a feat

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
one that is not in any way shaved by
people placing bets

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800
it's name is chris christie

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.820
and uh... all you need to do is
basically

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.910
it's it's sort of like uh... when the
um... groundhog comes up out of its

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.800
sees it shadow is one of those things

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
what you do is involves doughnuts and
that's all i'm going to say

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.120
but then you wait and see what chris at
christie's says

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.900
following an emergency

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.860
and uh... chris christie has come out
and been praising president obama's

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.320
response

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.659
to at this uh... hurricane to this uh...
disaster on the east coast

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.650
he said he went on fox news as well to
the present three times yesterday comet

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.590
for the last time at midnight last night
asking what he could do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.270
i said if you can etc expedite designate
new jersey is a major disaster area that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.209
would help us get federal money

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.069
and resources in here as quickly as
possible to help clean up the damage

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.669
here

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.669
and allies on fox with uh... the disease

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:16.719
the do she said

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:23.499
asking him but but but what about mit
romney mitt romney's gonna coming visit

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.969
and chris christie says i have no idea
whether or not it is nor am i had a

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.949
lease bit concerned or ensure enter
interested

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.410
get a job to do here in new jersey it's
much bigger than presidential politics

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.949
and i could care less about any of that
stuff

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.129
architecture he

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.379
if there was a bone

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.180
are now it's inside of nato chris
christie that stock at mit romney was

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.009
gonna be the next president

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.379
he would be singing a different too

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.269
so chris christie

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.089
in addition to uh... in this case has a
broken clock

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.049
doing the right thing

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.349
praising president obama

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.429
him being out in front of of this
disaster which i'm sure a president

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.449
obama was for you know

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.129
being mindful of the political
implications of the state

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.369
but nevertheless is still doing the
right thing

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:23.589
chris christie a basically announcing i
think this race is over

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:25.919
i don't think there's a chance of mit
romney is going to be involved in

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.589
republican politics

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.329
as of november seventh

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.699
and uh... i'm runnin in twenty sixteen
cell

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.849
take that

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:36.639
steve do shit
