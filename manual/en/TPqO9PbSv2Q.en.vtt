00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:07.060
In this tutorial you will learn how to create
a Livescribe pencast PDF overlay.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.130
You will learn how to take an original PDF,
use it to create a pencast PDF, and then overlay

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.759
the image of the original PDF onto the pencast
PDF to create an interactive pencast PDF overlay.

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.640
A printable version of these instructions
is available at the Engaging Technologies

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.310
website.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.010
You will need the following software Livescribe
Desktop, Adobe Reader (10 or higher), and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.969
PDF editing software.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.350
For Windows we recommend PDFill PDF Tools
Pro which is free.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.230
Now you will create the Print on Paper activity.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.320
Use your computer printer to print your PDF
content out onto Livescribe paper that’s

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.170
been carefully torn out of a large Livescribe
notebook.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.210
Be sure to use the Actual Size option.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.780
Your printed PDF will look something like
this.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:17.380
Now add notes and audio to your activity using
a smartpen and 3D recording earbuds to go

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.409
from this ... to this.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.729
Connect your Livescribe smartpen to your computer
and upload the pencast to your computer using

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.469
the Livescribe Desktop software.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.829
Now use the Livescribe Computer Connector
to create a Pencast PDF.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.270
Locate the page with ink &amp; audio.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.250
Here it is for me.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.049
Then click and drag it over to the Computer
Connector.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.950
Click the Continue button.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.539
Then you’ll need to wait until you see the
messages “Sharing Data with Livescribe Connect”

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.430
and finally “Processing completed successfully”.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.469
Then you should see a “Save File As” box
appear but if you don’t then you’ll need

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.469
to find it.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.520
It’s usually “hiding” behind the Livescribe
Desktop software.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.520
Choose where you want to save the Pencast
PDF and rename the file to include “Pencast

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880
PDF” in its name.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.980
Then click the Save button.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980
Now open the pencast PDF that you created.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.980
Notice that it's rather incomplete.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.580
Next you will create an image from your original
PDF content.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.120
Open the PDFill PDF Tools software.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.160
Click Number 10, Convert PDF to Images.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.820
Browse to find and select the original PDF
content.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.910
Leave the Default values as they are.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.510
Make sure to select the correct page you would
like to overlay if the original PDF content

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.360
is more than one page.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.160
Click Save As Image.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.200
This will be referred to as the Original PDF
Content Image.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.310
Now we’ll finish up by Adding the Image
as a Watermark to the Pencast PDF.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.650
In the PDFill PDF Tools software, click Number
8, Add Watermark by Image.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.120
Browse to find and select Pencast PDF.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.260
Browse to find and select the Image of the
original PDF content.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.310
Change these values to 50%.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.120
Change Order to Foreground.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.570
Click Save As
Name your complete watermarked PDF and click

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.850
Save.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.130
Great!

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.180
Here’s our new interactive complete pencast
PDF ready for sharing!

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.230
