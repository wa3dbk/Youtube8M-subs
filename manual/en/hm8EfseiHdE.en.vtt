Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:05.158
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.158 --> 00:00:07.758
This week, the President urged
Americans to contribute to the

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:10.591
recovery effort to the
Northeast, met with governors,

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.124
mayors, and other
local officials,

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:15.058
as well as his Homeland Security
team to talk about the response

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:18.692
to Sandy, and address the
nation on election night.

00:00:18.692 --> 00:00:22.658
That's November 2nd to November
8th, or "Our Journey Forward."

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:24.692
The President:
We will continue
our journey forward.

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:27.558
Narrator:
On Friday, the President spoke
about ways that Americans can

00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:30.558
get involved and support the
recovery efforts underway to

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:32.892
assist communities
affected by Sandy.

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:35.491
The President:
In this country, we look
out for one another.

00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:38.591
We have each other's backs,
because despite our differences,

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:40.858
we are Americans first.

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:44.625
If we do our part, each of
us, then together we can make

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:45.625
a difference.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.425
Narrator:
On Saturday, following a meeting
with state and local leaders,

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.958
and senior members of his
Homeland Security team,

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.458
President Obama reiterated that
his number one priority is

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.925
making sure that all available
federal resources are in place

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:58.325
to support the recovery.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.625
And that red tape is in no
way stemming the flow of much

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:02.625
needed relief.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.091
The President:
There's nothing more important
than us getting this right.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.458
Narrator:
On Monday, the President
convened a phone call with his

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.758
senior staff to discuss federal
efforts to support ongoing

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:13.191
response and recovery
efforts from Sandy,

00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.124
while WhiteHouse.gov posted
new information for affected

00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:19.825
businesses and homeowners of
funds that are available through

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:21.124
the Small Business
Administration.

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:23.825
On Tuesday night, the President
addressed the nation after a

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:25.591
vigorous campaign.

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:27.591
The President said he believed
that the American people sent a

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:30.625
message that leaders in both
parties need to put aside their

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:33.991
partisan interests and work
with common purpose to put the

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.792
interest of the American people
and the American economy first.

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:39.124
The President:
America has never been about
what can be done for us;

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:42.325
it's about what can be
done by us together,

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:44.558
through the hard
and frustrating,

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:47.692
but necessary, work
of self-government.

00:01:47.692 --> 00:01:48.825
(cheering and applause)

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:53.091
America, I believe we can build
on the progress we've made and

00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.158
continue to fight for new jobs
and new opportunity and new

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.058
security for the middle class.

00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:02.825
I believe we can keep the
promise of our founding,

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.525
the idea that if you're
willing to work hard,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:08.892
it doesn't matter who you
are, or where you come from,

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:13.024
or what you look like -- you
can make it here in America if

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:14.158
you're willing to try.

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:17.024
(cheering)

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:19.758
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President and
his family traveled back to the

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:22.758
White House for a well-deserved
good night's sleep before

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:24.858
rolling up his sleeves and
getting back to work on a long

00:02:24.858 --> 00:02:28.625
list of priorities waiting on
his desk in the Oval Office.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:30.591

It is a great honor to meet you.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:43.692

Speaker:
Amazing.

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:47.692
The President:
Huh?

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:48.925
This is wonderful; you've got to
tell me your secret for staying

00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:51.058
married for 79 years.

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:51.892
I love that story.

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:53.158
Wilbur Faiss:
You should know what it is.

00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:54.625
The President:
You just do what
she tells you to do.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.024
Wilbur Faiss:
No; compromise.

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.825
(laughter)

00:02:57.825 --> 00:02:59.124
The President:
Absolutely.

00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:00.124
The President:
Bye-bye.

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:02.058
Wilbur Faiss:
(laughing)

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:03.058
The President:
That's a great story.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.058
Speaker:
It's amazing.

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.058
The President:
Seventy-nine years.
