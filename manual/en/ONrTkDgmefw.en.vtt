00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.700
The Presidente Intercontinental is more; 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.800
I would recommend it more for adults or corporate people

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.300
or people who are just looking to go for a quiet getaway.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.400
They do have three pools. One of them is a sanctuary

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.500
for adults only where they just have no noise,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.100
there is a no noise limit here where you just go,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.600
relax, do nothing, sit at the pool and be served your drinks all day long.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.200
Absolutely spectacular, and listen to the ocean.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.300
Then they have two other pools. One is an activities pool 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.100
where you can just go all day long and do your activities,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.700
be wild, be loud, get everything going

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.000
and the other one is more of a family pool where the kids are in

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400
and everyone’s playing volleyball and stuff like that.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.400
Customer service is great. The service is spectacular.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.500
The rooms are gorgeous, recently updated, clean, comfortable.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.800
If you get a ground floor Lanai room you actually have a hammock

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.100
on your patio and an ocean view and its gorgeous.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.100
Cabo is a different destination because it’s, it, it’s a desert

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.000
but it is very mountainous on the beach.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.800
Has the most amazing waves you could ever imagine.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.700
Cabo is not a place where you’re gonna go swimming in the Ocean.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.300
Cabo is a place where you want to go look at the ocean

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.800
and watch the waves take over the entire peninsula.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.200
It’s amazing there; it’s way to rough to swim in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.500
but it’s just the most spectacular picture I have ever seen.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.800
Five à la carte restaurants plus your buffet plus your snack bar.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.900
They do have room service at, at an additional charge,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.300
for four dollars per service, which is nothing

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
considering what you’re getting at this property.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.500
When we went to the restaurant

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.500
they set us up they had the linen table cloths with the napkins,

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.100
fine dining. It was fine dining a hundred percent, it was amazing.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.200
It’s all inclusive; you have your all inclusive option.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.500
The shuttle at this property actually costs you

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.800
ten dollars to go downtown to Cabo San Lucas.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.200
This is a great deal to go in and explore Cabo San Lucas,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.400
go into the markets, see the night life, go visit Cabo Wabo,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.300
do whatever you want, it’s a, it’s a great value,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.400
ten dollars round trip you cannot beat that.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.500
Great time, great service

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.300
perfect for somebody who’s looking for a quiet more mellow getaway

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.000
or even a corporate getaway. It’s an excellent incentive hotel.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.000
Absolutely amazing.
