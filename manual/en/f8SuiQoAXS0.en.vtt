00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
What's up everyone? In today's video, I'm going to show you how to unlock a Samsung

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.440
Galaxy S5 or S4 or S3, doesn't matter which Samsung Galaxy you have. This method will work

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.409
to unlock your phone for any GSM SIM card in the world.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:19.765
So it is very simple, I'm going to be using a Samsung Galaxy S5 Active from AT&amp;T but this

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:24.160
method will work for any phone. So in this case, I have my phone which I have purchased with

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.737
AT&amp;T as I said and I'm going to unlock to use it with my T-Mobile SIM card. Now it is very

00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:35.015
simple, we're going to do it together step by step. You will only need your computer, your phone

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.603
and a SIM card - a non-accepted SIM card -.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:42.916
Alright, so before we start with the video I have to mention that unfortunately, it is not possible

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:48.401
to unlock this phone for free. We will have to pay a small amount but trust me guys, it is worth

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:54.228
every penny to have your phone fully factory unlocked to use it worldwide with any GSM SIM

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:57.639
card. So with that said, let's begin with the video.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:07.558
So the first step is to open your phone application and you will dial: *#06#. As you will see, you

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:11.838
will get the IMEI number of your phone, this is a unique number. It is very, very important and

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:16.410
based on this number we're going to request the unlock code to unlock this phone. So for now,

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.510
we're just going to put it here to the side and we're going to switch to the computer. So once

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.618
you're in your computer, open your internet browser, so I'm going to open Chrome and we are

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:35.380
going to the website, Unlockriver.com. In this website we're going to request the unlock code to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.154
unlock your phone.

00:01:36.154 --> 00:01:42.190
So first you will have to enter the real carrier and country of your phone. So in this case, it is the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.208
placed you purchased it originally. So my phone is locked to AT&amp;T United States. Up next, you

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:54.923
will select the brand, of course we're going to be unlocking a Samsung phone and then you will

00:01:54.923 --> 00:02:01.062
select the exact product or the exact model of the phone. In this case, we're going to be

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:08.586
unlocking the Samsung Galaxy S5 and AT&amp;T has the active so I'm just going to select Samsung

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:12.101
Galaxy S5 Active from USA AT&amp;T.

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:18.607
Alright, then you will have to write down your 15-digit IMEI number. As you will see here, your

00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:25.584
phone will have 15 digits and then an extra 2. Just ignore the last 2 and insert the 15-digit IMEI

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:30.813
number. Up next, you will have to write down your e-mail address where you want to receive the

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:36.787
unlock code. Just make sure you get it correctly because if you have it sent here, you will not

00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:40.854
receive your unlock code. So just make sure it is right and if you scroll down you will see an

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:46.342
average delivery time and the price to unlock your phone. Then we'll click, "Unlock Now". In

00:02:46.342 --> 00:02:50.565
the following screen, you will see a summary of your order, just make sure everything is correct

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:54.965
here. It is very important there is information you need to read here before unlocking your phone

00:02:54.965 --> 00:03:04.729
and you will scroll down and click where it says, "Check out with Paypal". So as I promised, I

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:09.159
was going to show you exactly how to unlock your phone step by step so we're going to proceed

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.505
to the payment together.

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:15.113
So if you have a PayPal account, just login and make your payment. If you don't, you will have

00:03:15.113 --> 00:03:21.646
to create an account or just use any credit card, it is very simple as well. I have my account so

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:27.161
I'm just going to login and click where it says, "Pay Now". So I'm just going to click here, "Pay

00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:33.977
Now" and that's it we should just get the information of the payment. So yeah, the payment went

00:03:33.977 --> 00:03:39.895
through and right now we will see confirmation of your order with your number - order number

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:45.689
That's it for now, you just have to wait until they send you the unlock code. It can take 1 day, 2

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.653
days, 2 hours, it depends on your phone's brand, country and carrier. So I'm going to show you

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:56.060
how the e-mail will look like. We're going to go to my Gmail account - my personal e-mail -

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.830
and I'm going to show you the e-mail I received. So if you see here, you will get an e-mail just

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.016
like this saying your unlock code is ready and that's the e-mail I received from UnlockRiver and

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:13.851
if you open it, it says, "Your unlock code is ready!" And it includes short instructions on how to

00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:21.602
enter the unlock code and it also includes the unlock code. So that's the important part of course,

00:04:21.602 --> 00:04:27.102
in case the code is incorrect, you will have to enter the unfreeze code and then you will have to

00:04:27.102 --> 00:04:28.496
enter the unlock code again.

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:32.929
For now, I'm going to show you how to insert this unlock code into the phone. So let's bring it

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:38.071
up here and we're going to completely power off this phone. So I'm just going to the go to the-

00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:43.256
press the power off button and click and where it says, "Power off " click okay to confirm and

00:04:43.256 --> 00:04:50.980
the phone will now fully turn off. So in the meantime we're going to remove the back case and

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:59.090
we're going to remove the battery as well. So just remove the battery and insert-in this case my

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.770
phone is from AT&amp;T, so insert a different SIM card. I'm going to insert my T-Mobile SIM card

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.133
because I want to use my phone with T-Mobile. So just insert any SIM card of your choice

00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:15.579
except the original one. So just put back the battery and we're just going to turn it on, it's going

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.892
to take up to 15-10 seconds to power on completely. So in the meantime, we're just going to put

00:05:20.892 --> 00:05:27.335
back the case - the back cover of the phone - and once the phone powers on, it will ask you to

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:33.214
enter-there are 2 different codes. First is your password or your SIM card password, that's the

00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:39.225
personal code you know. It's a personal code, so in this case, it's asking for my personal PIN

00:05:39.225 --> 00:05:45.633
code. So if you don't know it, if your SIM is locked, you will have to check it on the back card

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:56.176
of your SIM card. So in this case, my personal password is 4-it's sorry, it's 4-4-2-4. So if you

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:57.798
don't have that, just ignore this part.

00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:05.888
And we're now able to ask you to enter the unlock code - the network unlock code -. That is the

00:06:05.888 --> 00:06:10.744
unlock code we received in the e-mail, alright? So we're just going to go ahead and insert it right

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:22.762
in here, so it is-let me see, I don't know if you can read it but there is 8-5-8-0-8-6-9. This is 9-

00:06:22.762 --> 00:06:31.154
3-5 done and if you click, "Unlock" now, you will see a success message. Network unlock

00:06:31.154 --> 00:06:37.255
successful, okay that's it guys, the phone is now fully unlocked. You can use it worldwide with

00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:44.600
any GSM SIM card as you can see all the way over here, you can tell that the bar is fully on. It

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:51.440
will take a couple of minutes until the phone gets your carrier signal and if you don't see it, just

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.629
turn off your phone and restart it. I'm just going to restart my phone right now and you will see

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:57.023
that we will get--

00:06:57.023 --> 00:07:02.023
Alright, so as you can up here, my new SIM card has been detected, T-Mobile and that's it. The
76
00:07:02,023 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
phone is now fully unlocked and thank you for watching. Subscribe to my videos. Peace.
