[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.630
Master, who did sin, this man
or his parents, that he was

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.080
born blind?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.440
Neither hath this man sinned,
nor his parents: but that the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.610
works of God should be
made manifest in him.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.980
I must work the works of him
that sent me, while it is day:

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.460
the night cometh, when
no man can work.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.110
 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.500
As long as I am in the world,
I am the light of the world.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.974
 

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:23.902

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:27.378
Go, wash in the pool
of Siloam.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:32.368
 

00:01:32.368 --> 00:03:39.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.200
Is this not he that
sat and begged?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.520
It is he.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.240
No.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.410
He is like him.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.856
I am he.

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:48.320
How were thine eyes opened?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.280
A man that is called Jesus made
clay, and anointed mine

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.620
eyes, and said unto me, Go to
the pool of Siloam, and wash:

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.890
and I went and washed,
and I received sight.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.950
Where is he?

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.510
I know not.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.320
How did you receive
your sight?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.670
He put clay upon mine eyes,
and I washed, and do see.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.330
This man is not of God, because
he keepeth not the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.430
sabbath day.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.410
How can a man that is a sinner
do such miracles?

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.480
What sayeth thou of him, that
he hath opened thine eyes?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.730
He is a prophet.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.552
 

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:27.802
Go bring his parents.

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:39.860
 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.810
Is this your son, who thou
sayest was born blind?

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.740
How then doth he now see?

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.780
We know that this is our son,
and that he was born blind:

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.490
but by what means he now seeth,
we know not; or who

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.170
hath opened his eyes,
we know not.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.120
He is of age; ask him: he
shall speak for himself.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.040
Give God the praise:
we know that this

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.170
man Jesus is a sinner.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.260
Whether he be a sinner or no, I
know not: one thing I know,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.310
that, whereas I was
blind, now I see.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.510
What did he to thee?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.090
how opened he thine eyes?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.940
I have told you already, and
ye did not hear: wherefore

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.950
would ye hear it again?

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.990
will ye also be his disciples?

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.400
Thou art his disciple; we
are Moses' disciples.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.970
We know that God spake unto
Moses: as for this fellow, we

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.850
know not from whence he is.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.570
Why herein is a marvellous
thing, that ye know not from

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.550
whence he is, and yet he
hath opened mine eyes.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.570
Now we know that God heareth not
sinners: but if any man be

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.540
a worshipper of God, and doeth
his will, him he heareth.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.290
Since the world began was it not
heard that any man opened

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.830
the eyes of one that
was born blind.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.410
If this man were not of God,
he could do nothing.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.940
Thou wast altogether born in
sin, and dost thou teach us?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:26.220
 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.140
Dost thou believe on
the Son of God?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:35.670
 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.536
Who is he, Lord, that I
might believe on him?

00:06:39.536 --> 00:06:46.154
Thou has both seen him, and it
is he that talketh with thee.

00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:51.064
Oh, Lord, I believe.

00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:57.840
 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.800
For judgment I am come into this
world, that they which

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.990
see not might see; and
that they which see

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.065
might be made blind.

00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:14.180
Are we are blind also?

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.060
If ye were blind, ye should have
no sin: but now ye say,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.480
We see; therefore your
sin remaineth.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.980
 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:47.140
