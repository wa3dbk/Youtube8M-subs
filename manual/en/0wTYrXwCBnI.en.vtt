00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.259
 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.009
 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm Mark Williams for pickup trucks dot
com

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.430
today we have the 2013 Toyota Tundra

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.270
and well there is a new generation
tundra coming there's still plenty of

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.279
value to be had

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.689
we'll show you why structurally and
cosmetically notta lotta change here for

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.079
2013 models

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.860
same wheelbase configurations there's
three same three cab configurations

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.120
same 3 bed links and same three engines

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.190
the four liter v6 4.6 liter v8 and the
5.7 liter v8

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.640
what does change is that there are three
trim packages that tender will have

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.690
the tundra the limited and the new
Platinum

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.280
top-of-the-line most expensive model
they make the range in price

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.559
from mid 20s to low 50s this particular
model

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.129
has the crew max cab which means a lot
of extra leg room

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.590
and a lot of extra cargo room in back
the only drawback is that you get the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.430
shortest

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.640
pickup bed so if you have to do a lot of
cargo hauling or towing

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.530
this might not be the option for you but
if you have to carry a lot of kids are

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.360
coworkers

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.650
this is a great choice couple things to
keep in mind with the 2013 model

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.560
old-style barrel gauges for tack and
speedometer and some of the other

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.910
important gauge if you have a break from
the steering wheel

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.190
depending on what kinda glare you have
it might be difficult to see a different

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.370
time periods in a day

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.280
also if you do any time if there's no
integrated

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.800
trailer brake controller so you gonna
have to go with an aftermarket option

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.250
what we do like there's a button that
takes the rear window

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.590
drops it all the way down if you decide
you want to be closer to the outdoors

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
drop all the other windows open up your
skylight you're basically camping so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.760
those are just some of the highlights
from the 2013 model year

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.540
but don't let the fact that a new model
is coming for 2014 scare you away

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.230
from taking a serious look at this truck
there's plenty of value

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.230
employees capability right here

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.750
bomb

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.250
you
