00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Episode 54: 22 years in pictures

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
On 24 April 1990, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was launched into space.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In the 22 years since, it has sent back more than a million observations.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Here are a few of our favourites: one from every year.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Among the first images to be sent back from Hubble after its launch in April 1990,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
this image of Saturn is good by the standards of ground-based telescopes, but slightly blurry.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is because of the well-publicised problem with Hubble’s mirror.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.005
Although not perfectly sharp, this early image of the Orion Nebula

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.005
nevertheless shows the rich colours and structures

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.000
of this bright star-forming region.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Throughout the region of the Orion Nebula are numerous streamers of gas

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that come from newborn stars, known to astronomers as Herbig-Haro Objects.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In late 1993, Hubble’s teething problems were resolved in the first servicing mission.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Before-and-after images of the core of spiral galaxy Messier 100

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
show how this dramatically improved the telescope’s image quality.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Soon after, comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A similar impact on Earth 65 million years ago may have killed off the dinosaurs.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Hubble’s image of the ‘pillars of creation’ in the Eagle Nebula is one of its most famous.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
These huge, dusty structures enshroud pockets of ongoing star formation.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This image from 1996 shows a planetary nebula,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which represents the other end of a star’s life from the Eagle Nebula: stellar death.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
NASA’s Mars Pathfinder probe was en route to Mars in 1997

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
while Hubble took this image.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Another planetary nebula, the Ring Nebula is one of the most famous.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The Keyhole Nebula, part of the larger Carina Nebula

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is another bright star-forming region

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
rich in glowing gas.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Not all nebulae glow brightly. NGC 1999 features a dark patch

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
silhouetted against a brighter background of reflected starlight.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This galaxy shows the dramatic deformations

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that can occur after collisions between galaxies.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Further upgrades in 2002, including a new main camera

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
increased resolution and picture quality again.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This ultra-sharp image demonstrates the new instrument’s capabilities.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This extremely long exposure was designed

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to observe the most distant and faintest galaxies in the Universe.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The dramatic collision of two spiral galaxies

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is visible in this image of the Antennae Galaxies.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This image of the Orion Nebula

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is one of the largest and most detailed ever made.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Globular clusters, roughly spherical collections of stars,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
contain some of the oldest stars in our Milky Way.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Hubble can produce sharp images of stars even in their crowded centres.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:13.000
This image was taken just before an electronic failure in January 2007

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
which damaged Hubble's main camera.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Although even its remaining instruments meant it could compete

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with the best telescopes on the ground.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In 2009, a final servicing mission repaired the damage and installed a new camera

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Hubble was back in business.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Using its new instrumentation,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Hubble peered into the heart of Centaurus A,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
a dramatically dusty galaxy.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Just published in April 2012,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
this image of the Tarantula Nebula combines Hubble observations from 2011,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with colour data from the European Southern Observatory.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It is one of the most detailed ever made of a star-forming region

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
weighing in at an astonishing 330 megapixels.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Most of Hubble’s data are only made public a year after they are made

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So what’s Hubble’s best picture from 2012? You’ll just have to wait to find out...
