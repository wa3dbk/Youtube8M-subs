00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.090
and what are the risks and
limitations of the rhinoplasty

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.150
there is really are very few

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.640
and a in terms of severity

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.060
on the five things that I worry bout
with any surgery than that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.800
I do basically other surgeon I
would say the same thing are

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.150
abdomen scarring, infection bleeding
asymmetry nerve damage

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.470
those are the five things that we tell
people

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.930
are universal to surgery and abdomen scarring after infection

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.070
after rhinoplasty can can happen but
it's extremely unusual

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.570
on the certainly not something that
would be visible

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.670
because the incisions are not visible
so that's that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.780
an issue that I've actually ever had to
deal with directly. Infection I've seen

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180
in over 25 years

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.180
I think I recall one maybe

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.180
there's mean it when I forgot about but
with thousands I've done over the years

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.130
and obviously that's pretty rare so
thats

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.150
because the midface especially face in
general administration general

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.400
aren't in specific is blessed with an
abundance blood supply in

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
and infections are just rare.Bleeding

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.820
the is something that can occur after
any surgery

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.710
I've only had one w or two patients that
I've had

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.410
take back to the operating room to stop
bleeding after rhinoplasty

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.520
1 I'm actually was a medical student who didn't follow directions

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.700
I so that's very very rare

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.130
everybody has a little bleeding
after surgery abnormal bleeding

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.990
when they start bleeding profusely with
klotz and we have taken back to OR

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.690
which is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.380
like I said extremely rare

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.430
asymmetry is is more of a given

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.659
everybody's I always put that in there
for the procedure I do especially on the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.019
face because most people don't realize
that

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.750
God made their face bigger on one side
and the other

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.120
perfect symmetry is almost

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.940
unheard of I'm certainly

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.100
asymmetric can increase in this here not
one here

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.490
and this chin's lower these ears
different matter

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.170
everybody's asymmetric so I always put
that in there so people

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.410
realize that they started asymmetric and
they can never

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.720
I can never promise perfect symmetry

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.780
nerve damage occurs anytime that you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.840
elevate the skin you're gonna have
temporary numbness the skin that you've

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.380
elevated

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.510
it's no different than rhinoplasty but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.660
permanent nerve damage is I've never
seen I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.730
so rare those those issues are extremely
rare

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.220
what's common unfortunately after
rhinoplasty is the need to go back

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.920
and tweak it what people call a revision
rhinoplasty

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.050
if you take all rhinoplasty surgeons
around the world

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.910
their vision rates approaches 30 to 40
percent

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.180
so I would consider that a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.530
risk of rhinplasty fortunately my
practice

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.989
my revision rates only about two to
three percent I

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.620
which is not because I'm Michelangelo but

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.190
it just is due to the fact that I've
been doing this twenty five years

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.079
and I specialize in this area so I'm

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.549
my numbers and experience are far
greater than the average plastic surgeon
