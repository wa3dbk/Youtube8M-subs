Gryphon I GD4400-B Barcode Scanner Product
Review

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:09.880
Hi, this is Camille with POSGuys.com.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.490
Today I'm demonstrating the
GD4400-B Gryphon I scanner.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.039
This is a hybrid barcode scanner,
it scans 2D and 1D barcodes.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.600
What makes it unique is it has an
automatic transitioning feature

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.600
between hand-held mode and
presentation mode.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:38.320
The GD4400-B is capable of scanning
1D barcodes, PDF417s, and 2D barcodes.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.290
it has pretty good range for
standard barcodes.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.429
Getting up to
about 15 inches here before it slows down.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.370
Some interesting things that the scanner
can read are cell phones, so this is a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.460
great new feature.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.710
[beeps]
No problem.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.070
And lower contrast, like
scanning barcodes on cardboard, or

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.700
light barcodes on light surfaces, or
curved surfaces.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.049
It doesn't have any problem
with that.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.779
It's also very good at scanning barcodes
in direct sunlight.

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:25.090
I'll show you an example.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.709
Put it under my bright light there, and scan,
and it doesn't have any problems at all.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.640
The GD4400-B has a very advanced scan engine,
and I'll demonstrate that with this test here.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.549
I'm gonna [scratching] run some lines through
this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.710
barcode.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.810
Just try and mess it up so that the scanner
won't be able to read it.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.189
[beep]
But it doesn't have any problem at all.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:02:01.820
The Gryphon I has a pivoting base,
so it'll tilt downwards, and upwards.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.979
It's free-standing no matter which way
you tilt it so you can leave it however

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.509
is most comfortable.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.360
One of the key features of the GD4400-B
is that it has automatic transitioning

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.010
between hand-held and hands-free mode.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.310
So in hand-held mode it operates just like
any regular scanner.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.920
That's hand-held.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.680
And then you set it down, without pushing
any buttons, or reconfiguring the barcode

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.400
scanner,
it automatically switches to presentation

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.519
mode,
where you can scan barcodes without holding

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.750
it.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.269
It also features an interesting and unique
targeting reticle.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.340
So you have a cross-hair,
surrounded by four dots to help you line up

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.150
the barcode in the most ideal position.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.950
So, [beep] like that.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.590
And if you noticed,
there is a green dot.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.260
That is your indicator
that the barcode has been correctly scanned.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.560
So you can hear the beep right now, but if
you

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.439
wanted to take that off, you'd have that
green dot, and you'd still be able to tell

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.120
that the barcode was scanned correctly.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.849
The best feature on the GD4400-B is its
ability to transition seamlessly from

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.019
hand-held and hands-free presentation mode.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.080
This is great because it means you
only need one scanner, you don't have to have

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.050
an omni scanner, you can just use this one.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.700
It is available in black and white.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.790
It has
optional USB, serial, or PS/2 keyboard wedge

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.790
interfaces.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.799
It has a 5-year manufacturers warranty.

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.609
