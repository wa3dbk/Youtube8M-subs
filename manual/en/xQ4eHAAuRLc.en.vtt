Alright!

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:11.959
This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com
through another exciting episode for this

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:12.959
another.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.840
Grown your greens in a minute or as close
as I can possibly state for a minute.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.930
So I want to share with you guys today the
secret of growing some awesome super large

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.250
or super-sized vegetables and what I want
to do for you guys right now is harvest one

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.410
of the beet growing in my garden and this
guy is going to have be like, oh here it is,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.100
check it out we grew a beet.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.890
Well yeah this is what most beets may look
like.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.800
You know your standard beat and all the beats
I am growing are the same or similar variety

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.800
you know, Iâ€™m not using any special genetics
to get my crops really large.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.010
But let's show you the real one, one I pull
for you guys, man check out this monster right

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.050
here.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:05.579
This beet, it's like half the size of my head,
look at that this thing is huge, the bottom

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:06.579
view, look at that.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.670
I mean compare that to your standard size
beet, you might get the market or that you

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.689
actually might be growing.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.719
So the secret to growing really large beets
like this is, I don't focus on growing large

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.420
beets this just happened right.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.780
Where you want to focus on to grow large beets,
you want to focus on building your soil.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.780
Right.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.009
Don't focus on growing large plants, focus
on building your soil, the more you could

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.579
build your soil, you know the larger your
crops will grow.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.579
Now the three tips.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.079
There are things that you should add to your
soil in my opinion to grow these crops based

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.469
on my research and based on this real world
experience here is number one, you want to

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.259
add the rock dust minerals that's very important,
trace minerals supplementation in your garden.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.880
Whether it's from rock dust , azomite, or
a different sea mineral products.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.049
Number two, you want to add the fungal dominated
compost.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.959
So this is something that I started adding
recently and literally it's taken my vegetables

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.899
from larger than normal to super-sized, right.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:08.899
Number three.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.650
The main critical component that may be missing
in soils of today is the biology right.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.650
I called my style gardening biologic organic
gardening.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.269
So you want to add the biology to your soil
and this includes different bacteria and fungi,

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.290
nematodes and earthworms and all this biology
in your soil because they are the driving

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.319
force that drives the trace minerals and the
fungus base compost into your plants and the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.890
regular compost for that matter.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.930
So that your plants could absorb the nutrition
when they get fed the most and get everything

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.930
they want.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.800
Guess what they respond by growing super large
jumbo plants.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.500
