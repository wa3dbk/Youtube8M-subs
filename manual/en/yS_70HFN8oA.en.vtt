00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:08.358
Thomas pushed his way along the overgrown track, Annie and Clarabel were not happy!

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:10.568
- Thomas! Please!

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:12.958
- Where are we going?

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:18.418
- Don't worry! This shortcut is going somewhere!
We'll be out of the woods soon and then...

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:20.168
Woooahh!

00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:25.918
Thomas had hit a rotten buffer in the undergrowth
and his wheels had come right off the track!

00:00:26.018 --> 00:00:30.568
- Oh no! I can't back up. I'm stuck!

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:39.228
The passengers were not happy. Now they were
going to be very late indeed!

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:43.158
Thomas felt terrible...

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:46.058
 &lt;BEEP BEEP!&gt;
...And then he saw his friend Bertie!

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:51.738
- Huh Hello, Thomas! What are you doing in there?

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:59.218
- I was trying to find a shortcut, Bertie,
but I've come off the rails. And now my passengers will be late!

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:01.578
- Oh dear!

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:05.938
...But maybe I can take your passengers for you.

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:12.498
Thomas' passengers thought that was a very

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:18.158
good idea indeed! But Thomas still felt very
silly...

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:25.598
It was almost dark when Harvey came to shunt

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:29.558
Annie and Clarabel out of the way...

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:32.898
...Before lifting Thomas back onto the rails again.

00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:41.258
Sir Topham Hatt was very cross.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.288
Your passengers don't like to be late, Thomas!

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:49.308
You have caused confusion and delay!

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:52.578
I'm very sorry, sir. I was hoping to find

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:57.268
a shortcut... but I will stick to my branch
line from now on.

00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:06.268
A few days later, Thomas was back on the track,
he arrived at Knapford station to pick up

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:09.017
Annie &amp; Clarabel.

00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:14.258
- THOMAS! Welcome back! We missed you.

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:18.018
- Thank you, Annie and Clarabel! I missed you too!

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:26.698
Thomas promised to stick to his branch line
in the future, he wouldn’t try taking shortcuts

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:27.658
again...

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:32.927
- See you later, slow coach!

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:42.618
...But he and Bertie still like to have races...

00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:46.938
...And sometimes…

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:54.018
...Thomas even wins!
