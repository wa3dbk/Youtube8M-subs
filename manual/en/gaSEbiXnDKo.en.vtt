Hi, My nick is Hiro at Fit Fans Club. 
Today we will make a DIY. Change 
Original Mirror to Aquaclean Mirror

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.349
Fit Fans and Hiro we not responsible about
any damage or lost material 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.849
when you make this DIY

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:28.960
Make sure that you understand the right 
procedures and if you have some dought 
please make a question.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.540
The Aquaclean Mirror has a property that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.690
prevents the formation of water droplets from 
rain or any other source that pier mirror  

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.280
preventing a clearer vision in the mirror

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.050
Unfortunately Aquaclean is sold only at 
Honda Access Japan
 
0:00:43.050,0:00:52.280
on the part number 08V11-000-TF0

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.470
LetÂ´s Go to DIY procedures

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.550
First, set the mirror be changed 
by adjusting fully to the upside

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:15.480
So you have a space at the bottom 
of the mirror to put your fingers

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.700
To detach the mirror

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.870
Avoiding damage to the mirror, 
or even the rearview

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.930
In this space from the bottom 
you'll use both hands

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.650
you will place your index fingers

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:51.990
Positioning the fingers in the bottom 
corner diagonally to the center of mirror

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.350
As shown in the photo indicate the dashed

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.630
Pull the mirror towards your body, 
So you draw the bottom hooks 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:12.679
Now pull the mirror down towards the ground

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.509
using this procedure in there will be not a 
failure or breakdown in the mirror or support

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:22.609
This is the base where it fits the mirror.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:32.648
Here's an indication of where are the places
where the hooks fit upper and lower

00:02:32.648 --> 00:02:41.729
This is the back Aquaclean
See the location of the upper and lower hooks

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:47.359
The Aquaclean has a protective coating to 
the mirror in the back of the mirror

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.199
To install is very simple Aquaclean

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:57.549
First you fit the top of the hooks 
fitting from the bottom up

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.619
You then fit the bottom of the hooks 
by pushing the mirror

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:13.519
Remember where the hooks are in place 
and press until you hear two clicks

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.580
Finish the procedure

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:25.550
Now a practical test by comparing 
the original mirror with Aquaclean

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.529
Simulating a rain on the original mirror, 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.449
there is the formation of drops 
in the mirror

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:42.449
This limits the vision 
for this mirror 
0:03:48.329,0:03:47.819
worsening the field of 
view back side

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.759
Now the test with Aquaclean even with 
a higher intensity of water 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:58.759
the formation of drops are minimal

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.629
With that vision is much better

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:11.139
improving safety while driving 
in rainy conditions

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.119
Some precautions to be taken with Aquaclean

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:18.759
To use only clean water and neutral car shampoo

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.449
Protect Aquaclean use any product near him, 
lest it stick like car wax

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.319
When Aquaclean begin to lose efficiency

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:33.819
remove the Aquaclean lipe it using water 
and shampoo neutral and let the drying sunlight

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.819
This will make their properties back to work

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.419
