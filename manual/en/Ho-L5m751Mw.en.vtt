00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.340
Are you ready to live the Kube life? With
Kube, an Advanced Water Filtration System,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.400
you'll discover all the wonderful benefits
of better-tasting water, water that's better

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.129
for you. Kube is loaded with unique features
you'll appreciate, too, like its simple, do-it-yourself

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.030
installation. If you're watching this, you're
probably one of those people who don't always

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.260
read installation instructions, but don't
feel bad: that's why we made this video. You

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.780
can see for yourself just how easy it is to
connect Kube to any existing household faucet

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.679
in a matter of minutes. "Wow, she looks familiarâ€¦"
Before you begin, please make sure you have

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:39.809
a few simple tools handy, as well as your
Kube installation kit and easy-to-follow manual.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.499
Then, check to make sure the fittings included
in the installation kit match your plumbing

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.339
configuration. If they don't, just take them,
along with your Kube manual, to your local

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.120
hardware store and purchase fittings or adapters
that will get your Kube up and running. Once

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.510
you have confirmed the fittings, clear a space
in your cabinet for your Kube. You won't have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.430
to clear everything out, maybe just some cleaning
supplies. Kube's compact size and shape is

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.180
intentionally designed to fit in any standard
sink cabinet. Now, let's get started. First,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.909
shut off your cold water at the inlet by turning
it to the right. Turn on your faucet to make

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.149
sure the water is completely off. Using a
wrench, disconnect the cold water supply line

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:29.149
from the shutoff valve. Two adapters are provided
in the installation kit. Thread the female

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.969
adapter onto the cold water shutoff valve.
Thread the male adapter onto the cold water

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.810
supply line. Hand-tighten only until they
are snug. Ten feet of plastic tubing is provided

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.789
for your convenience. Determine the length
of tubing required between the elbow fittings

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.299
on the back of your Kube to the two new adapters.
Just like the old saying: "measure twice,

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.640
cut once." Set the tubing on a clean, flat
surface, like a cutting board, taking care

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.999
not to kink the tubing. Using a sharp utility
knife, make a perpendicular cut to your measured

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:08.729
length for both sections of tubing. Place
a mark 3/4" from the end of the tubing. This

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.590
will help indicate how far the tubing gets
inserted into the fittings. Locate the elbow

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.170
connections on the back of your Kube. As indicated
by the graphic, connect the lower fitting

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.230
to your cold water supply valve adapter. Marks
should either disappear or be flush with the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.230
end of the adapter. Firmly push the tubing
into the fitting until it stops. Pull back

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.510
on the tubing to ensure that it is locked
in place. If correct, you will not be able

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.950
to pull the tubing back out. A simple tug
is all that's necessary to check it. Likewise,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.049
connect the upper fitting to the cold water
supply line adapter leading to your faucet.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.470
Next, insert the filter cartridges. Align
the tabs on the cartridge body to the tab

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.629
slots on the face of Kube. Then, insert the
cartridge until it stops. Twist clockwise

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.629
to lock in place. Repeat for the second cartridge.
The raised area on the cartridge cap should

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.750
be lined up with the lock icons. Now it's
time to put your Kube to work. Turn the blue

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.700
bypass knob until the white indicator points
to the in-service icon. If the knob isn't

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.280
turning, don't force it. The knob will not
turn unless both cartridges are securely locked.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.750
Slowly open the cold water supply valve. Cross
your fingers that you've done everything correctly

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.340
and inspect all connections for leaks. To
complete your installation, run cold water

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.319
for five minutes to activate your filter cartridges.
After five minutes, you can turn off your

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.319
faucet. Wait about ten minutes, and then turn
the cold water back on for another three minutes.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.019
After three minutes, shut off your water.
You may think this procedure is just a waste

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:06.019
of time or water, but it's not: it's letting
your Kube know it's time to go to work. Before

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.049
you congratulate yourself on a job well done,
we have a few more pointers. If your faucet

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.040
has an aerator or filter screen on the end,
now would be an excellent time to check it

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.239
for any possible calcium buildup or debris.
A dirty filter screen will interfere with

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.120
your water's flow rate. And last but not least,
if you ever use the bypass knob, or when you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.460
change your cartridges, always, always, always
remember to empty the tray located at the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.460
bottom of your Kube. Okay, now you can congratulate
yourself. Your Kube is installed. So grab

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.460
a glass, fill it up, and enjoy your first
taste of truly clean and refreshing water.
