00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello!

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480
On 20th March 2015

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.160
there will be a total solar eclipse.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.520
It's the first

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.480
total solar eclipse visible from

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.860
western Europe

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.860
since August 1999

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.420
and it's the last one

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.920
until 2026.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.160
A solar eclipse happens

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920
when the Moon passes in between

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.060
the Earth and the Sun

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.440
and because the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.940
Sun's diameter is 400 times

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.040
that of the Moon

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.500
but also

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.900
it's about 400 times further away

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.820
the Sun and the Moon appear approximately

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.400
the same size in the sky

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200
and so if the alignment is perfect

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.820
between the observer,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.780
the Moon and the Sun

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.860
then we can see a total solar eclipse

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.200
where the Moon just covers

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.040
the surface of the Sun.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.940
So, having said that,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.740
the Moon's orbit is actually elliptical

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.000
so at some points it's actually slightly

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.520
too far away to cover

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
the Sun's disc entirely

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.560
and when it's at its furthest point

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.780
in its orbit

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.660
we tend to see an annular solar eclipse,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.000
the so called ring of fire.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.760
The 20th March 2015

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.640
total solar eclipse

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.478
occurs when the Moon is just about

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.280
at its closest point in its orbit

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.060
so it's easily big enough to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.080
completely cover the Sun and give us a total

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.640
solar eclipse.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.920
However, the precise alignment

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.900
actually only makes landfall

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.800
in two places on the Earth,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.560
Most of the time its out over open ocean.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.400
These two places are the Faroe Islands,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.480
north of the United Kingdom,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.100
and on the Svalbard archipelago,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.800
north of Norway.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.475
If you're in the Faroe Islands

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.560
then the total phase

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.200
of the eclipse

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.460
will be at 09:41

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.740
Universal Time

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980
and if you're in Svalbard,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.460
depending on exactly where you are

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.900
on the islands,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.520
then somewhere around

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.680
10:10 to 10:15

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.340
Universal Time

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.560
which will be 11:10 to 11:15

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.980
local time

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.240
and the total phase will last for approximately

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.280
two minutes.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720
If you're

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.540
somewhere else in Europe

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.040
or North Africa

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.740
or north-west Asia

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.240
then more than likely

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.585
it'll be possible to see a

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:38.780
partial solar eclipse.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.140
Now the general rule is the further north

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.940
and west you are in Europe

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.813
then the deeper the eclipse will be

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.240
so the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.460
more of the Sun's light

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.540
will be covered by the Moon.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.400
Up in Glasgow

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.900
in Scotland

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.180
approximately 95%

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.120
of the Sun will be covered.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.148
Here where I live in Manchester

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:01.440
in the UK

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.200
then about 90% of the Sun will be covered.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040
That's about the same for Oslo in Norway.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.991
If you're on a line roughly connecting

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.240
Barcelona, Milan,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.120
Vienna and Warsaw

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.280
then you're looking at about 70%

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.880
of the Sun's light will be covered

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.136
and if you're somewhere around

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.940
Athens or Istanbul

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.473
in the south-east of Europe

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.620
then about 40% of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.880
the Sun's light will be covered

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.140
at the maximum point.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.480
So when should you go out and look?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480
So the eclipse occurs

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.020
in the early morning of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.860
20th March 2015

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.380
and what I'll do,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.600
I'll run through some timings

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.240
in various places in Europe

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.600
and then hopefully you'll be able to work out

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.660
when to look based on this.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.220
The general rule is the further west you are

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.460
the earlier the eclipse will happen.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.880
In Lisbon

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.980
the eclipse will start at 8 a.m.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.600
Universal Time.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300
In Dublin, London,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.820
Paris and Rome

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.920
it starts around 08:25

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.460
Universal Time

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.220
which is 09:25

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.860
Central European Time.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.540
In Reykjavik, Copenhagen,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.540
Berlin, Budapest

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.160
and Athens

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.600
it starts around 08:40 a.m.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.980
Universal Time

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.560
which is 09:40

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.840
Central European Time

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.000
or 10:40

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.920
Eastern European Time.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.780
In Helsinki, Kiev

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.020
and Ankara

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.520
it starts around 9 a.m.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.060
Universal Time

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.260
which is 11 a.m.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.380
Eastern European Time.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.286
And in Moscow the eclipse will start

00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:40.860
around 09:15 Universal Time

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.420
which is 12:15

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.040
Moscow Time.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.519
In most cases it will take

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.180
approximately one hour

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.440
between the first hint of the Moon

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.977
entering the Sun's disc

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.620
and the maximum point

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.600
and another hour

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.020
for the Moon to leave

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.840
the disc of the Sun as well.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.919
Now I must stress that you must never

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.660
look directly at the Sun

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.904
without adequate eye protection

00:05:06.904 --> 00:05:08.380
because doing so can

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.622
cause severe damage to your eyesight

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:14.380
or even make you go blind permanently.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.860
So first of all it's worth pointing out

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.440
that sunglasses are definitely not enough

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.853
and even standard strength welding goggles

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.420
won't give you the right level of protection.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.240
So make sure that you're using

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.740
correct eye protection if you do look at the Sun.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.868
A safer method will be to project

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:35.920
an image of the Sun on to, say,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.560
a piece of paper

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.400
and look at the piece of paper instead of

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
observing the Sun directly.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.340
So you might be able to use binoculars

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.040
or a telescope to project an image of the sun

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.980
or you can even use a basic

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.700
pinhole camera.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.440
And there is an even safer method:

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.040
I'm sure on the day there will be

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.380
plenty of live streams online

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.760
where you can watch the eclipse from start to finish

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.198
and you won't even have to worry about

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.220
clouds getting in the way.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.620
Now there is one really cool thing about

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.940
the partial phases of a solar eclipse.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.599
So if you hold up your hand

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.780
and then cross your fingers

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.820
making several holes in the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.160
gap in the hands.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.400
What you're doing is effectively creating

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.600
a pinhole camera

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.091
and in each of those gaps

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.260
there's a mini image of the Sun

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.407
so during a total solar eclipse,

00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:33.100
or during the partial phases

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.440
of a solar eclipse

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.780
you will see

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.380
little crescent Suns

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.020
in the gap.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.600
So, thanks for watching

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.160
and I hope you get to see the eclipse.
