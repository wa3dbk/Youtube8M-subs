MobileMe iDisk app

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:05.961
MobileMe includes a free iDisk app
to share files wherever you are.

00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:08.731
You can find the MobileMe iDisk app
in the App Store,

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.383
it's free with MobileMe.

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:15.138
Once installed, just tap iDisk to launch the app.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.641
Then just enter your MobileMe
login information,

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:26.858
tap "Go", and you will have access
to the files and folders on your iDisk.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.818
You can view media files,
such as photos and movies

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:34.115
or iWork, Office and PDF documents.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.785
Just tap to open this Pages document.

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:43.458
The file is downloaded from your iDisk
directly to your iPhone or iPod touch.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.961
You can view in portrait or landscape,

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:53.843
just rotate your iPhone or iPod touch
and your document rotates automatically.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.431
Swipe to move through the pages

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.991
and pinch to zoom in and out.

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:06.251
A single tap brings up the controls

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:09.150
where we can go back to your folder listing.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.286
Tap "Recent" to see a list of files

00:01:14.288 --> 00:01:17.825
that you've viewed most recently.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:21.996
You can quickly open one without having
to download it again.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.920
It's also easy to share a file with someone else,

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.300
just tap the share button to the right of the file,

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:38.178
then tap the + button to choose
your recipients from your address book.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:44.895
You can type in a personal message
just like any other e-mail.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:48.190
For added security, you can
assign a password,

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:52.318
and even set the number of days
the link will be available.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.321
iDisk then sends an e-mail
with a link to download the file,

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.740
[Mail send sound effect]

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.783
and since you're sending a link
instead of an actual file,

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.120
you can easily share a very large file
right from your iPhone.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:05.873
Your recipient gets an e-mail

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.041
and just clicks the button they download the file

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:10.241
whether they're on a Mac or PC.

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:13.381
[Background music]

00:02:14.883 --> 00:02:18.641
Tap "Shared Files" to see a list
of all the files you've shared,

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:20.930
when you tap the sharing icon

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:23.641
you can easily stop sharing the file,

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.685
or e-mail the link again.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.328
Now with the MobileMe iDisk app
and an iPhone or iPod Touch

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.526
you can easily view and share
your files from anywhere.
