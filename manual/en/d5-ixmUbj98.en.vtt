00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.820
HELLO PEOPLE FROM THE NEW GENERATION

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.360
I know we have taken a bit of time no uploading new videos

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.980
we may say we´ve been on vacation

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.160
but we didn´t. The truth is that we´ve been working to offer you a good service

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.180
today we will show you how to remove a dashboard from a Gol

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360
in the part below I will write the years

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.300
so you can remove it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.420
so, the first thing to do...we are going to open the switch

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.060
to be able to move the steering wheel

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.040
so it stays in this position

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860
we are going to put a screwdriver here

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.780
sorry!  so you will put the screwdriver here where you can see this line

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.400
you will set the screwdriver in the upper part

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.780
and push it carefully so you don´t scratch any of the parts

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.240
you are going to push it and with one hand pull the cover upwards

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.860
it should come out like this

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.900
now we will do the same procedure in the other side

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.160
but in this side you can do it simply with your hand

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.340
you need to do it in this way so you won't break any of the clips in the cover

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.240
because as you can see, this clip has previously been broken

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.940
but this one which was the one we removed isn´t broken, so that´s why you should be careful

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.760
once we´ve removed the cover

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.460
I hope we can focus this part so you can see well

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.720
in the part below the board

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200
we will find.... I hope we can zoom it

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.760
this part, here we have this piece

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.100
this plastic, and you will put the screwdriver in here

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.780
in the piece that is over this one

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.520
o.k. you will insert the screwdriver between them

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.560
and later on you will pull the board forward with your hand

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580
so it pops out in this way

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.180
we need to do the same with this side, but in this case it has already come out

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.000
now by the upper part

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.400
you will carefully insert the screwdriver

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.380
to pop out the clips fom the upper part  of the board

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.320
which is going to be this one

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.820
as you can see there are only two clips which are holding it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.260
and we will do the same in this side

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520
like this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.220
the only thing I did was to insert the screwdriver and slide it forwards to the clip

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.960
so this can open and we won´t have to be struggling and scratch the board

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.160
once they are out, we can see that we are almost done with the board

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.020
here we have two screws one in each side

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.540
let´s remove them

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.660
once we removed them, we may close the switch, because we won´t move the steering wheel again

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.220
and we will pull our board forward

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.700
we will remove the harness

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.280
we will pop this clip downward

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.600
so we can remove it, like this !

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.980
and in this way we will have removed our  dashboard

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.180
well this is it, I hope we have helped you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.240
In case you´ve got any suggestion, we´re back and we will try to have a video at least per week!

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.980
SEE YOU IN THE  NEXT VIDEO!
