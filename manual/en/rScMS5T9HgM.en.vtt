00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.199
Lasagne. Everybody loves it, I'm not sure if everybody knows how to make it, 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.580
so i'm gonna show you.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.170
It's affordable, it's simple, it's delicious.
Don't panic, i'm going to guide you through each and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.779
every step of the way. Here's the ingredients that you're going to need. Five-hundred grams of minced beef,

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.850
cheddar cheese,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.010
six dried lasagne sheets, butter, plain
flour, semi-skimmed milk

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.490
and some fresh basil. Over here 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.369
I've got some of my home made pasta sauce

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:40.719
that I had leftover

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.539
out of the freezer. I'm not going to show you how to make it today but if you'd like to see how it's done

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.590
click the link and that's will take you straight to the video and you can watch. Now

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.639
equipment. 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:51.650
We're going to need

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.540
a nice small pan, a medium to large shallow frying pan, a nice oven dish,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.589
baking sheet, wooden spoon

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.480
a whisk and a serving spoon. Let's get started. 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.000
We're going to put our pan 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.530
on quite a high heat

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.380
because we want to fry off our mince. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.970
Now we're not putting any oil in this pan 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.360
because

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.510
mince has got quite a high fat content. All the fat will come out and 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.540
it will fry in its own fat. Wash my hands. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.030
We're going to just chop it all up as it's frying. 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.700
Because we want this to go nice 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.500
and brown and cook it all the way through.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.600
If you've got vegetarians you don't have to use any meat at all. This sauce has got eight

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.000
different vegetables in it. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.350
So you could use that on its own it's not a problem. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.450
At the moment

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.820
it's cooked

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.900
but we want it to get a nice bit of colour. It's looking rather grey. 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.050
Could you imagine if we put any oil in there? It would be

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.970
swimming in grease. 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.620
No one wants to eat that. 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.380
We've got it to pretty much where we want it to be. It's cooked all the way through,  

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.310
going nice and brown.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.310
So we're going to drain this slightly and then I'll show you all the fat left behind.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.259
That's the last of it. Look at all that oil. You

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.239
don't want that.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.399
Let's give this a good old mix. We want to leave that to simmer for about

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:16.720
ten minutes or so.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.359
While that's doing, 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.639
we're going to make a bechamel sauce. Don't panic. I know it sounds a bit funny 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.319
but it's not. It's one of the easiest sauces to make. It's one of the first things I learnt at 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.469
college

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.769
and now I'm going to teach you. We're going to need our pan on a medium heat. We're going to take

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.719
a nob of butter, straight in the pan to melt,

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.200
and what we're making here is called a roux. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.230
Now the butter's melted. I'm going to put in two tablespoons of flour. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.980
Mix this in. That's what it needs to look like. 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.120
We're going to add probably just over half a pint of milk to this but we're going to do this 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.499
gradually

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.069
Don't panic. I know you might be looking at this and thinking 'oh no it's gone wrong.' 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.889
It hasn't.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.529
This is what it's supposed to be doing. Just trust me, stay with me

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.119
and I promise you you'll get it right. 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:07.689
When it's getting a little bit more
loose 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.529
you want to change your wooden spoon 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.319
for a whisk.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.499
It's come together.

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.259
and it's like a mayonnaisey kind of texture.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.389
We need to add a little more milk. 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.399
Bechamel sauce is the white sauce of the lasagne but you can use it to make macaroni

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:32.399
cheese, you can use it to make cauliflower cheese, so it's a great trick to have up your sleeve. 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:35.839
No lumps.

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.079
Just beautiful, beautiful

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.209
creamy, white sauce. Take that off the heat. 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.249
Season it and we just want a little grating of nutmeg 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:49.639
just to lighten it up. Mix all of that in. And there you go. You've done it. 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.559
Bechamel sauce.

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.589
Ready for your lasagne. 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:58.519
Our meat looks lovely. I think it's time to start building. If you played with Lego as

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.519
a kid or if you're like me and played with Stickle bricks. It's just building. 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.919
And we're going to grate some cheddar on top. 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.479
And a couple of basil leaves. 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.500
If you've got your friends coming round, 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.729
or if you're trying to impress a lady or a fella,

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.480
it just makes it look

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.419
a little bit special. A nice little pinch of pepper on the top.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.459
Then I'm going to put that in the oven 

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:56.809
at about one-hundred and eighty degrees, gas mark six, for about thirty to forty minutes.

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.440
Here is the finished product. Let's dish up. 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.879
Lovely jubbly. Don't you just want to eat that right now.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.139
Looking beautiful. 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.029
Smelling wonderful. Lasagne. 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:10.990
What I like to serve with mine 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.860
is a nice simple side salad and some homemade garlic bread. I'm not going to show you  

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.259
how to make that in this video but 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.399
if you'd like to see how i do it, click the link and it will take you straight to the video and you can watch how it's done.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.860
Have a go. Try it out and let me know you get on. If you do anything a little bit different, you got

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.119
any new tips or techniques that you'd like to share, comments box below. I'm waiting to hear from 

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:34.699
