00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.795
What's happening now is unprecedented in Earth's history.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.000
Why would we want to disrupt something that took billions of years to evolve?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.700
We need to fight it on all fronts.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
I think it's dawning on us now that this is the big one.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200
OPS is a group I formed.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.490
It uses covert operations to expose harm to endangered species.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.210
We're doing an order here.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.790
One bottle cam.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.900
Right there is the lens.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.300
Two buttonhole cameras.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.700
Check, one, two.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.500
Oh, that's good.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.300
Just about everything endangered in the world is for sale in China.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.500
Look at this stuff. Endangered. Highly endangered. Highly endangered.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000
The more illegal it is the more you have to go to the back rooms.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400
We're definitely not welcome here.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, my god.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.297
There's things going on that are probably not safe to talk about.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.740
We're dumping so much carbon in the oceans it can't take it anymore.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.400
Wow

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.400
Oh. Blahhh.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
We found this guy, Mr. Li.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.100
He's culling and processing whale sharks.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.100
Nobody had ever gotten a camera in there before.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.600
If we run into people with badges and uniforms,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
strip off all this stuff, and throw it over a wall.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
This is basking shark oil.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.000
Jesus

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.980
This world is absolutely insane.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.213
Wildlife trade is second only to the drug market in the world.

00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:24.980
It's that lucrative.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.790
We need a getaway driver and I knew one of the best.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.700
I love it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.530
To create a heist, to hijack the world's attention.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.800
I think we want to put in an order for a car today.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000
Excellent. We'll take one.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.900
Blow the lid off this place, right?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.600
We've got to go right now.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.500
There's been five major extinctions in the history of the planet.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.800
This may be the sixth.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800
When you're talking about losing all of nature,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.900
it's not a spectator sport anymore.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.000
Everybody has to become active somehow.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.300
The idea is to inspire people.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.100
Life wants to flourish. DNA wants to go forward.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.140
We need to be part of that.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.400
People that have been in the business said don't even bother.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.100
But better to light one candle than curse the darkness.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.500
There's so many people who sit back and say, we're screwed,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300
but, you know what?

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.000
That one candle maybe someone else with a candle will find you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.850
and I think that's where movements are started.
