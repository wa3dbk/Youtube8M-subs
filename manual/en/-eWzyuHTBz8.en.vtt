00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:04.617
Everyone’s talking about the fact that Marvel
might be introducing Civil War to the movies.

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:08.317
That is a rumor! What’s not a rumor: Archie
vs Predator.

00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:09.677
Chris: It’s finally happening!

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:12.817
Meanwhile, we’re talking about Aquaman!

00:00:14.777 --> 00:00:18.757
Aquaman: Don’t let your repeated and crushing
defeats get you down, old chum!

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.407
♪♪ Only your heart will win us the fight!
♪♪

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:27.657
NO, NO, NO. STOP IT. If you’re expecting
a musical number, you have got the wrong show.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:31.127
Seriously, people think that Aquaman is a
joke and this is what we’re leading off

00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:35.477
with… Guys come on, we are better than this.
Let’s show this fish talking bastard some respect, alright?

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:37.017
Megan: Respect the Aqua!

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.667
Respect the Aqua.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.667
Welcome to Meanwhile the show that introduces
you to the world of comics and connects it

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:46.427
to the shows and games you already know and
love. My name’s Nathan Faudree, let’s get started.

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:51.196
Aquaman was created in 1941 by by Paul Norris
and Mort Weisinger. When he first showed up

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:55.707
he was the son of a marine biologist who was
studying Atlantis. Of course Dad teaches him

00:00:55.707 --> 00:01:00.786
the atlantean way of life and he becomes Aquaman.
He could breathe water and he could communicate

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.097
with fish for a whole minute.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:04.497
Megan: A whole minute Nathan?!

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.657
I know!

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:08.317
His original origin was a little underwhelming.

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:12.517
The thing about comics is that many writers
contribute to a story over time, so this origin

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:17.587
progressively changed and grew. By the 1950s
and into the 60s, Aquaman had become Arthur

00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:22.017
Curry, the son of an Atlantean Princess and
a Lighthouse keeper. As the son of a princess

00:01:22.017 --> 00:01:27.907
he is also the ruler of the kingdom of Atlantis
and guardian of the Seven Seas. Ok, this is

00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:29.136
a way cooler origin.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:30.267
Respect the Aqua.

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:35.526
He was even one of the founding members of
the Justice League. But he was still the guy

00:01:35.526 --> 00:01:40.697
that could swim real good and talk to fish.
And he was married had the requisite sidekick

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:48.217
AquaLad, an octopus sidekick named Toppo and
he rode a giant seahorse… with his Aquababy.

00:01:48.217 --> 00:01:48.837
Megan: Aquababy?

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:50.036
Chris: Sounds ******* awful.

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:52.227
And people wonder why he became a joke, right?

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:53.657
Chris: I didn’t wonder.

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:58.176
The late 70’s brought a darker tone that
began with the murder of Aquababy at the hands

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:04.837
of his greatest enemy Black Manta. Then to
add insult to injury, his series was cancelled.

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.776
Chris: DUN DUN DUN!

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.707
Several attempts were made in the 80’s to
revive him, but it wasn’t until Peter David

00:02:09.707 --> 00:02:13.987
came along and revamped his origins by bringing
in some Atlantean history and intrigue that

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:18.677
the book finally took off again. Well, that
and they had his hand eaten off by piranhas

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:23.047
and replaced by a mechanical harpoon. He also
grew a beard to be really broody and regal.

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:27.747
It’s kinda like Game of Thrones but underwater…
No actually it’s a lot like Game of Thrones

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:31.497
cause then his hand got eaten off by piranhas
and replaced with a mechanical-

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:32.877
Chris: I haven’t seen that episode yet!

00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:33.377
MMM!!!!

00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:37.257
Aquaman has had a varied history in which
he’s fought all manner of villains from

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:37.946
Black Manta

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:42.957
Megan: Who is he?!
He’s some dude in a wetsuit who shoots lasers

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:44.526
from his eyes, ok?

00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:50.336
To Ocean Master his half brother. And he always
seems to be defensive as to why he is relevant,

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:56.336
even though he controls 2/3rds of the Earth’s
surface and he rules a super advanced world power.

00:02:56.347 --> 00:02:58.896
Megan: Respect the Aqua
Chris: #RespectTheAqua

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:00.176
Respect the Aqua

00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:06.657
American Tidal by Will Pfeifer. After the
90’s brooding beard and harpoon hand, Aquaman

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:12.036
came back in this character defining piece.
San Diego suffers a massive earthquake that

00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:16.127
causes part of the city to fall into the sea,
killing thousands, but not as many as everyone

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:20.946
expects, because it turns out that many of
the citizens can now breathe underwater. Unfortunately,

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:25.146
not in air anymore. Aquaman comes in to help
these people learn a whole new way of life

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:29.657
and it helps us get reintroduced to what Aquaman
really is. A king.

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:30.417
Megan: Respect the Aqua

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:31.217
Respect the Aqua

00:03:31.217 --> 00:03:32.556
Chris: #RespectTheAqua

00:03:32.557 --> 00:03:40.696
Brightest Day by Geoff Johns and Peter Tomasi.
So, Aquaman has died. A lot. And come back.

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:45.887
A lot. This mini series follows the events
of Blackest Night a huge DC event, which sees

00:03:45.887 --> 00:03:50.097
Aquaman resurrected from the dead. This is
another defining character piece that shows

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:54.456
how he fits into the DC universe as a whole
and again, and again plays with his origins

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:58.086
and reasons for being. It’s also written
by Geoff Johns, which will become important

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:01.146
in 3,2,1…

00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:07.557
Geoff Johns, DC’s Chief Creative Officer,
kicks off the Aquaman run in DC’s company

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:12.387
wide relaunch “The New 52”. This is the
place to start. Book one of the relaunch,

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:16.627
The Trench is the best version of the character
that has come along yet and it’s one of

00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:20.567
my absolute favorites of “The New 52”
as a whole. It really feels like after 70

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.727
some odd years, they have a characters stride.

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:26.817
Now, that you know which fish in the sea to
be picking with Aquaman.

00:04:26.837 --> 00:04:28.807
Megan and Chris: (Catching on) Ahhhhh!

00:04:28.807 --> 00:04:32.187

be eating up the next issue like a fat man

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:41.337
at an all you can eat seafood buffet. Without
that weird full, hating yourself feeling afterward.

00:04:41.357 --> 00:04:48.357
Chris: If you say, Meanwhile… I’m underwater,
I will put you underwater. Visual effects

00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:50.357
Nice! Meanwhile... I'm underwater!

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:55.917
You’re not gonna put us underwater are you.

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:56.517
Chris: Nope.
