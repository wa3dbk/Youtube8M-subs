00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:09.188
My PS4 loses WiFi connection.

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:14.767
This is a great time to tell everyone else
in the house to get off the WiFi so you can

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.347
play your game.

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.058
I would not think that would cause the problem
if I’m already connected.

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:25.568
It depends on the priorities given to various
downloads and internet connections by the

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:26.568
home network.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:31.058
I’ve heard there were other reasons it could
lose the WiFi connection.

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:35.037
That might happen if you mess up the configuration
really bad.

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:39.258
Or if you try to tell it to use an internet
connection that is not working.

00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:42.598
The PS4 internet connection is not working.

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:47.958
If you messed up the configurations bad enough,
you might have to reconfigure it by restoring

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.928
to factory defaults.

00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:51.958
After I’ve saved the data.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.248
If you restore to factory defaults, you lose
your data.

00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:57.648
This is not an iPhone.

00:00:57.648 --> 00:01:01.518
Yeah, it is more annoying and less user friendly.

00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:06.478
Try switching to a wired port, so you get
an internet connection even if a less convenient

00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:07.478
one.

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:12.198
A lack of an internet connection is more annoying
than using old fashioned cables.

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:17.677
And it is not my internet connection for the
house, because the PC can bring up sites.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:21.207
Try doing an open authentication on the WiFi.

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:24.077
Talk about leaving it open to attack.

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:29.247
If it does work, you know it is not the WiFi,
but more likely an issue with the router or

00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:30.988
PS4 site.

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:35.367
I might as well turn off some of the mac filtering
or turn off SSID.

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:40.247
I’m suggesting some of the security protections
may slow the connection down so much that

00:01:40.247 --> 00:01:41.847
it cannot connect.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:46.647
Then again, you may just be able to solve
it by resetting the router.

00:01:46.647 --> 00:01:48.937
If in doubt, reboot something.

00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:53.897
Reboot the PS4, reboot the router, all of
that may help.

00:01:53.897 --> 00:01:55.698
What if it is no help?

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.317
You could look at the encryption you have.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:04.488
If you switch WPA to WPA2 or vice versa, it
might work faster.

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:06.427
Or not work at all.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.658
How can I determine where the connection problem
is?

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:12.528
Set up your PC to ping the router.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:17.738
If there is no packet loss between the PC
and router, you know it is not the router.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.598
Knowing it is Sony does not help me much.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:25.408
Except that you know that rebooting everything
but the TV won’t help you, since the problem

00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:27.728
is not on your side of the connection.

00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:31.448
It makes me want to stick a boot into the
dark side of the PS4.

00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:33.878
I’m pretty sure that voids the warranty.
