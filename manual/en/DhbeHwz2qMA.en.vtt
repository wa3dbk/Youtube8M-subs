00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
Hi! I'm Alvin Maulana

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:01.900
I'm Ade Putri

00:00:02.059 --> 00:00:06.059
Welcome back with us to Masak.TV

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.789
Today's guest in Masak.TV is Ade

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.402
Ade, what are you going to make?

00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:35.832
I'm going to make Rice Anchovies Pepes

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:36.752
What is that?

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:38.572
Is it Fish Pepes with rice or...?

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.372
No, it isn't.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.032
What I brought is rice anchovies.

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:44.052
Okay, let's go straight to the process.

00:00:44.052 --> 00:00:46.072
What are we going to do first?

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:47.772
I'm going to dice the ingredients.

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:49.232
So, while you're dicing the ingredients

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:50.562
I'm going to put the necessary

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:51.712
ingredients into the blender.

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:52.412
Great idea!

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:53.102
Okay.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.810
I have finished blending the ingredients.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.900
We basically mix them all together.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.246
So Ade, what do you do?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:18.560
My work is related to digital and SNS.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.600
Okay. I think i better sear

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.694
the banana leaf.

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.398
to make it pliable.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.563
So, we use 2 eggs for 200gram anchovies?

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:29.923
Yes.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.723
You can use more eggs but it

00:01:31.723 --> 00:01:32.683
will get hard.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:37.694
I prefer it to be gooey.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.093
Do you put all of the ingredients in?

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:41.853
Yes, I do.

00:01:42.757 --> 00:01:45.207
Do you usually measure the ingredients?

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:46.257
I actually don't.

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.863
I usually use my feeling.

00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:50.773
Making Pepes is actually tricky

00:01:50.773 --> 00:01:52.413
Because you have to be sure

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:54.463
That you have the right amount

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:56.293
of ingredients from the start

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:57.423
Salt and pepper?

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:00.547
Why do you still add pepper when

00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:01.967
You already added chilli in it?

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:03.097
I like spicy food

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:04.907
That's what I'm talking about!

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:06.437
For those of you who are asking

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:08.327
why I put in pepper when I make sambal

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:09.847
It's because i love pepper.

00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:11.017
This is very simple.

00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:13.077
You just mix the blended ingredients

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:17.537
with eggs, wrap it up and done!

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:21.962
First, put bay leaf on the bottom.

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:26.407
Then I usually put in the garnish.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.457
I almost forgot this bird's eye chili

00:02:29.457 --> 00:02:31.737
I usually slice it into half

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:34.472
Oh, to add in the spicy flavor?

00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:35.022
Yes.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:39.501
Put in about 2 pieces of spring onion.

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:43.555
Lemongrass.

00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:45.495
I put some basil on the bottom.

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:49.513
I'm putting them on top as well later.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.460
Okay, add in more basil.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.380
I like basil so I add a lot of them.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.630
I'm turning on the steamer.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.630
Okay, thank you.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.426
We have wrapped them up.

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:27.462
Now, it's time to ...

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:28.418
steam them.

00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:30.226
Which I already preheat it

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:32.836
for about 15 minutes.

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:34.282
My mother likes to slightly

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:35.942
cut the top part.

00:03:35.942 --> 00:03:38.572
Oh, to make it nicer?

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:39.912
Usually it's a way to mark the Pepes.

00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:41.372
My mother usually makes different types

00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:43.262
of Pepes at once. She does it to mark

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:44.572
the filling. For example, if the cut

00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:45.642
is in triangle shape,

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.052
then it has tofu filling.

00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:48.822
One cut means it has mushroom filling.

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.112
What about these than?

00:03:50.112 --> 00:03:51.422
We have 2 in nice forms

00:03:51.422 --> 00:03:52.812
and 1 in a messy form.

00:03:52.812 --> 00:03:54.152
Mine is the messy one.

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:55.082
Okay then.

00:03:55.676 --> 00:03:57.646
How long should we steam them?

00:03:57.763 --> 00:04:00.113
I usually steam them for about 5 minutes.

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:01.533
Can we check the inside to see

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.823
whether it's cooked?

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:03.973
No, you can't.

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:05.413
So, you can only feel it

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:06.653
from the outside?

00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:07.903
Yes, just gently squeeze them.

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:09.883
I don't like to steam them too long

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.553
because they become too hard

00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:12.543
for my liking.

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:14.086
I think it's done.

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.816
Really? How do you know?

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.496
It's been 5 minutes.

00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:22.496
I'm opening the lid.

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:25.033
Let me check them.

00:04:27.987 --> 00:04:29.917
( Man in the back: Can you tell us

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:32.467
where does it come from?)

00:04:33.963 --> 00:04:35.773
I have made up story about it

00:04:35.773 --> 00:04:36.513
last night.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:40.513
Really? That's what I'm talking about.

00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:44.091
So, this is Pepes a la Ade then?

00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:46.337
Basically since you have eaten different

00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:48.903
types of Pepes. You can just choose which

00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:52.741
kind of Pepes you like.

00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.391
the one with chopped seasoning or

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.111
nicely blend seasoning one,

00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.191
Yellow or white?

00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:58.871
Then, you can just make up

00:04:58.871 --> 00:04:59.981
your own version

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.201
based on those things.

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.331
I'm opening one in here, okay.

00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:09.201
Okay, so we don't feel curious of it.

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.851
Gently open the wrap.

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:23.267
Wow, it becomes bigger .

00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:25.997
Of course because it has eggs in it.

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:27.957
Our Rice Anchovies Pepes is done.

00:05:27.957 --> 00:05:29.947
It's actually very simple and easy.

00:05:29.947 --> 00:05:33.559
Just like Ade said, how to cook something

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.759
that looks difficult simpler.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.669
As long as you have the right

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.859
ingredients and tools.

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:40.099
Now, it's tasting time.

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:47.392
I feel nervous.

00:05:48.272 --> 00:05:50.302
What you need is warm rice

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.560
and it's perfect.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.060
Personally, I will add more basil in it.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.350
You can absolutely do that.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.170
Because I love Basil so much.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.580
Then, to make it spicier

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.310
I'll use bird's eye chili instead.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.310
Or you can just blend the bird's eye chili instead.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.150
Of course!

00:06:08.683 --> 00:06:10.573
