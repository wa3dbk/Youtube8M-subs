00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.000
"Sorry for dragging you into this..."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
"This city is so busy."

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.000
"You think so? It’s convenient once you get used to it."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500
"Don’t run offfffff."

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
At the end of 2012,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Mercedes-Benz made an animated commercial called “Next A-Class.”

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This advertisement became a big sensation

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
due to it being created by Production I.G

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
along with the character designer of the Evangelion series.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.250
“Check out this special video online!”

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.800
GNU: In the end, wihat was Mercedes-Benz aming for?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.900
I tried to directly ask Mr. Negita from the public relations department.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.350
Daiba: Excuse me… Before this, how much is the Benz?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Mr.Negita: The average is from ¥6 million to 7 million,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
but regarding the new “A-Class,”

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.700
it’s completely different, although it has the same name.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.300
It’s a strategic sporty compact hatchback model.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.500
The price is also strategic, at from ¥2.84 million.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.500
We put emphasis on introducing the "A-Class" globally,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.850
and we were told to submit good ideas from each country.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.850
If the idea was good,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.650
we’d be able to conduct own own activities.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:24.000
We started this project because we wanted to do something that would make people excited about the “A-Class.”

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.500
The web advertisement which was broadcasted in November 2012 is a 6-minute short video.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.500
Beacause of its detailed story and beautiful imagery using 3D CG,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:44.600
it accumulated 1 million views after only six days!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.000
Eventually, we got over 2.7 million views.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.600
Our videos had never received more than 1 million views before,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.300
and we thought its KPI (Key Performance Indicator) was 1 millon,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.000
but it recorded much better results than what we had expected.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.150
Furthermore,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.100
it was seen not just by people in Japan, but people in 170 countries.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.300
I really felt the power of this content.
