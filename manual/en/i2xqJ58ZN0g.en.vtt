00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.720
In this step what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and attach our ribbon and

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.709
our cover to our squash book. So I took our
two top coasters that we had set aside so

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.609
they could dry with the Mod Podge. And they're
pretty much dry so we're good to go, and using

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.570
with them. And you're going to want a good
length of ribbon maybe a half a yard. You

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.050
don't need anything too much but you want
to be able to open and close fairly easy and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.329
tie a knot. So what we're going to go ahead
and do, take your squash book with our papers

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.500
and our folds, go ahead and square it up and
whatever way you want to do it. And now that

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.920
we have that squared, you're going to apply
a generous amount of glue directly across

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.471
the cover on, directly in the center as well,
pardon me. And feel free to add a couple of

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:56.740
layers of that. And then with that you're
going to take your ribbon, about half way,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.120
half of your ribbon folded in half, take half
that, pardon me, and then apply it directly

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.189
across the glue and there is our ribbon. Alright,
now that I have attached our ribbon to the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.880
front side of our squash book, you're not
going to want to glue the backside with your

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.880
ribbon, because what will happen is we will
not be able to open or close our squash book.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.819
You're going to secure it right there. So
that's going to be your squash book if you

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:30.759
were to apply it to the back. So don't do
that. So the next part of our squash cover

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.139
is I'm going to go ahead and apply our two
coasters to the front and to the back. O.k.,

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.119
so I'm going to go ahead and get that started.
And I'm going to glue right on top of my squash

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.030
book because this is a little bit bigger.
If I were to do it on those edges, they would

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.130
not line up. So again, I'm being very generous
because I want to secure my coaster to the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:05.670
top of my squash book.
Alright, go ahead and take your coaster and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.400
try to, well better yet, I'm going to put
that down. It'll be easier to take this and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.470
then try to measure that directly in all the
way around, I hope you can see it. So I centered

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.650
that right on top of my coaster. And just
apply some pressure there, make sure there's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.310
a good bond and that should be your cover.
So I'm going to go ahead and do the exact

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.870
same thing to the backside. And once again
I'm going to apply a lot of glue. Hope I don't

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.909
run out, or we'll have a problem then, apply
the pressure. Alright, add a generous amount

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.939
and again I'm going to put the backside of
the coaster down and I'm going to center the

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:07.620
entire squash book on top again. So that's
pretty good. So once again apply some pressure

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:26.030
so you have a good bond. Alright, we should
have plenty there. So, that is the coasters

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.359
and the ribbon added on to our squash book.
And in the next step what we're going to do

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.849
is we're going to go ahead and embellish our
cover.
