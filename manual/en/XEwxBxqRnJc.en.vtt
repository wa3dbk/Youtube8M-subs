00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.109
Montezuma needs to do some introspection and
find out who he really is

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.710
He just moved into a new neighbourhood

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.800
…there are too many neighbours

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.080
But the mountains are majestic as *bleep*

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.420
Gotta get violent once the Aztec army exists

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.010
Granaries come first!

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.180
The people gotta eat

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.080
Warsaw has Workers available for kidnapping

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.080
Montezuma and Casimir at the Cocoa Jungle

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.760
Suddenly there’s an Aztec labour crew - fly
away home!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.279
Sorry man - I don’t know what got into him

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
The Temple of Artemis has a foundation of
weaponry

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.790
Stonehenge manifests itself while the North
is claimed by others

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.970
The Hanging Gardens are also needed - why
so many wonders?

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.520
I’ll get to that later

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.780
Montezuma is the busiest!

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.260
A Great Wall… will be great -

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.260
Fast

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.700
Forward - so an Oracle

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.530
The thing is - Monty kept attacking Polish
workers

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.629
Then removed them from existence

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.160
Which angered this guy but he calmed down

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.000
Physics means Notre Dame which means that
Great Engineer was consumed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.500
It’s good to consume

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.270
It’s good to believe

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.250
It’s good to channel the Inca

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.970
It’s good to bathe

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
It’s good to rave - turn down for Wat - Angkor
Wat

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.290
It’s bigger than it looks

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.090
There’s some folks in that image

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.479
And homecoming is soon

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.530
Angkor Wat ain’t done yet

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.390
Gotta expand upwards

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.159
And another Great Engineer arrives - he’ll
become one with a tile

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.890
These Workers become one with their axes

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.939
Trade between red Civs is lucrative

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.369
Monastarize

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.759
Then Pagode

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.430
A Tower will be leaned for Great Humans

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.560
You seem pleased, lady

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.560
And Gems aren’t forever

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.159
This is Mr. Ethiopia - they’ll get his measurements

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.049
Mr. Morocco doesn’t mind deforestation - hammers
are sent home

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.100
Even with Great Engineers, the Forest must
go

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.670
Monty is glad to gobble-up Wonders

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.810
Hammer hammer

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.390
A Theatre Shaped like a Globe could be fun

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.540
And since the religion switched there’s
exciting new buildings available

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.430
Can’t afford not too

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.490
Open Borders means unclaimed trees are vulnerable

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.360
Soon there’ll be more science

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.609
Thanks for the Research Agreement sir - my
science tower will be done by the end

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.650
Then again it was put on hold so an another
Engineer could be utilized for an instant

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
Golden Age

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.200
More beakers next turn!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200
And there was an Ironworks

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.209
Never tell the lumberjacks about the Ironworks

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.200
Never tell the Gatling Guns they might not
survive

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.559
Hotels mean Tourism for T-town

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.829
Order too - it made sense

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.700
The efforts to move-on-up are a success

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.209
Open Borders before the real war means peaceful
music for Poland

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.900
Worker’s Faculties means more facts

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.340
Two things angered him:

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.569
A wild Citadel Appeared, and…

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.199
The Coal Mines polluted their lake - check
it out…

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.199
Enhance!

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.799
Enhance again

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.359
Enhance one more time

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.049
Enhance the Enhance

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.699
It was a pathetic lake anyway

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.480
Lame trees need to be felled too

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.889
It’s a Science Guy!

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.159
And an updated look - it’s a good change
but he still seems like a wax museum figure

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.029
AHH!

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.769
Chop faster - ignore the Jungle - and that
guy with the gun

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.569
The Aztec army also has guns

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.319
And there’s an Airport, you could fly to,
get this, Beverly Hills or some other place

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.419
Hurry the Hubble to get through to nukes

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.069
Things are great

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.999
There’s stuff to look at

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.029
Everyone is getting a rise

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.579
The Paratroopers are licensed to kill

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.519
Ironically the bombs aren’t

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.700
But they do anyway - the thing is - Siam looked
at Montezuma funny

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.310
Collateral diplomatic damage is dangerous

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.230
It’d be sad if this area was bombed

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.010
Not so sad to see Warsaw be obliterated

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.449
Seems there were some Austrians in Poland
that day

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:47.339
Everyone is so angry I’m not sure they could’ve
prevented what happened next

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.339
A Pentagon?

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.979
But won’t that lead to rumours of the occult?

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.809
Nah - the jeans are so comfortable no one
questions anything

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.609
Two Citadels are better than one - especially
if one’s on fire

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.180
So fighting is great when you have nukes and
sucks otherwise

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.449
The land is ravaged but Monty’s number one!

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.059
Gotta remove the threat

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.339
Everyone is a threat when you’re number
one

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:14.979
Good job troops - get it, paratrooper - and
I said troops - I like jokes

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.549
Surround enemy Settlers for maximum annoyance

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.859
Where’d all the friends go?

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.299
Two turns until victory

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.580
Can’t resist that fit!

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.270
Denim is here to stay

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.129
Goodbye cruel world!

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.830
End already!

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.740
Surely no one has been so incredible

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.370
These numbers do not please Montezuma

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.110
And don’t tell him he didn’t make the
first rank

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.360
Gr!
