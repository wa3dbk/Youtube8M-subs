Bud Light Platinum Review by Natalie Nightwolf

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.330
oh oh hello I am so excited because
today is like a life-changing day

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.340
possibly because I am as you might know
a Bud Light connoisseur

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.119
which means I drink like pound like 10
15 20 a night but there's a new product

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.529
on the market it's called the Bud Light
Platinum and it just came to the area

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.809
two days ago and instead of regular
beers having regular Bud Lights maybe

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.450
40.2%
for 24.5 this one has six so I only have

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.450
to drink like six beers instead of ten
maybe is the math work out I don't know

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.570
it's a good drunk or just a get wasted
on the floor well there's you know so so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.230
six of these might get me passed out on
the floor instead of 10 to 12 with the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
other ones but I'm concerned that it
won't taste as good as the other one and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:35.130
I'm gonna see if it tastes exactly the
same so this is oh it's good it does

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.509
taste a little bit different it doesn't
taste this bubbly yeah

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.360
it just takes a little bit different but
it's not bad Sean come on in

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:02.630
beard dude get the beard in here oh yeah
I'm doing a video about Bud Light

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.720
Platinum oh yeah do you want to try it
Marty you want to get the hell out of

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:24.200
here but wait video it's approved so
it's pretty good I mean I'm sure I can

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.310
get used to it I mean I'm already used
to it guys watching mom we love you

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.400
it's easier to drink it's just a little
bit different only people that probably

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:48.370
