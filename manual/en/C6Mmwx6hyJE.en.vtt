TALKS ABOUT SCHOOLS, MUSIC EDUCATION, AND

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.590
THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT Jay Chuong: I have a
lot of really good drummers in this city.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.360
They might not be successful in math, they
might not be successful in literacy or English,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.380
but sometimes they are extremely successful
in music. And I take that and I try to harness

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:27.380
it and cultivate something positive in their
lives. (Drumming) My name is Jay Chuong. I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.700
teach for the Philadelphia School District,
my title is class instrument music teacher.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.720
So I teach in seven different schools, seven
different public schools within the Philadelphia

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.550
School District, teaching drum lessons, teaching
all the instruments in some programs I run

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.070
the entire program I think there is only about
six of us or so, there aren t very many of

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.920
us. So, we are in high demand. So we get many
schools because there s not enough teachers,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.870
so we have all these schools in Philadelphia
that have no music and for that reason they

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.469
send someone like me to go into these schools
to teach them. You can still do better than

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.990
that. Try it again. It s eight-eight, four-four,
two-two, one-one. You really got focus. Think

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.220
ahead. Try it again. (Drumming) So in the
Philly School District, each of the teachers

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.170
receives a $100 allotment so I can spend up
to $100 for my different schools and I ll

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.950
be reimbursed for the $100. Anything after
that is out of pocket for me; I decided to

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.040
go with bucket drumming. Welcome to my office.
So, I go out and I buy Home Depot buckets.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.340
Each one is about $2.38 cents - 37 cents - and
I just buy as many as I can for the least

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.690
amount of money and sometimes I ll store them
at the school and sometimes I store them in

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.479
my apartment and travel around the city with
them. I think the average age of the Philadelphia

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
schools is 65 years. I just read it on the
news the other day and I think there are 26

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.110
schools over 100 years old in Philadelphia.
I mean we have so many schools in the District

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.549
that need renovation, they need central air
when it gets hot because when it gets humid

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.439
all the cockroaches come out and all the mold
start cultivating in the classroom. The American

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.479
Jobs Act could offer an opportunity for many
different types of people whether its construction

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.170
workers or teachers or opportunities, for
students even. President Obama: This is a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.760
bill that will put people back to work all
across the country. Jay Chuong: standing next

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.849
to the President. It was an amazing experience.
President Obama: Standing with me this morning

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.810
are men and women who will be helped by the
American Jobs Act. Jay Chuong: I was excited,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.096
but at the same time, his speech that he was
talking about all the subjects that he was

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:34.930
talking about is not something to be really
happy about. President Obama: We can't expect

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.650
our kids to do their best in places that are
literally falling apart. This is America.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.950
Every kid deserves a great school Jay Chuong:
So, hopefully, if the American s Job Act is

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.331
passed, we would hire more teachers, we would
put more money in modernizing schools, we

00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:56.160
would offer work for construction workers,
we would hire back more teachers, we would

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.400
do all kinds of things for the younger generation
of the cities. So right now I want you to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.980
make that equilateral triangle. when kids,
especially in low performing neighborhoods,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.930
are growing up in these broken down classrooms,
broken down schools, it sends a very mixed

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.500
message to them. mon you guys are going to
have to share this pad here. We have the teachers

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.450
saying you need to value your education but
then, at the same time, when the kids look

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.900
around the environment, it s not something
to be proud of at all. So it brings a mixed

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.959
message. Anyone want to try it by themselves?
Student: Me. Music has the opportunity to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.849
develop confidence in the kids, it gives them
something to take ownership of it develops

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.959
team working skills; it s all of these life
skills that they can apply to all different

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:53.470
parts of life. Take it back from the beginning.
I hope that one day they ll look back and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.620
say you know that that drumming that we did
in with Mr. Chung was pretty cool and we did

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.319
some pretty challenging stuff and he really
forced me to go home and practice, and put

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.740
in the work, and I had something very valuable
that I got from the lessons (Drumming) [Content_Types].xml
