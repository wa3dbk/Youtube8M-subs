00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960
Usually, Korean parents try to comfort and do whatever we can to soothe crying babies.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.420
But foreign parents never act in that way.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.240
A baby just becomes a cicada!

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.900
And this baby cries as if he/she were telling us "Come quickly and hug me!How dare you guys!"

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.900
But foreign parents didn't care about this baby and just watched television.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.340
They are trying to make this behave?/ Right!

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.640
But in the next day, that crying cicada baby got the huge dark circles under his eyes.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.320
And mother came to hold a bottle to this baby,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460
And this baby just refused it,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.120
Don't lie!/ It really happend!

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.260
I really saw my second nephew/niece(who is born in Germany) doing like that!

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
My nephew/niece was making a face like 'Are you really my mom?'

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.020
With resentful look!

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.520
That's too funny!

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520
And finally, he/she stopped crying!

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.760
Because he/she knows that his/her parents won't come to him if he/she keeps acting that way!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.740
I truly agree with you.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.900
When my daughter was very young, she was playing with something dangerous thing, a pointy foiled thing..

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.840
So I told her, 'No, don't do that! You'll be hurt if you play with it!'

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.080
And I took it away from her and she was crying like this!

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.600
Yeah, you should hand it back to her quickly.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.440
And so, I told her like, If you keep crying, daddy won't give this back to you! If you want it, you should say "Please give it to me!"

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.440
But she kept crying.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.420
And I didn't give her that thing back, either.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.200
So it's almost like she was forced to tell me '"Please give it to me!" with making tearful face, 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
and I gave her this thing.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.800
Of course, I can only give her this if she tells me like that.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.400
But as soon as she got it from me, she seemed to feel flat.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.220
So she did this all of a sudden!

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.800
'Don't lie! A child made sound like that?/

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.420
And so I took that thing away from her again.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.040
And she sobbed again, crying very bitterly!

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.480
And I didn't give this to her again.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.620
And I told her to say"Please give it to me!"

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.680
And somehow this repetition brought her down a bit, making her tell me "Please give it to me!"

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.360
And so I gave it to her, but then she expressed her 'high self-regard' in this way!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.660
And I took it away again!To fix her bad habit!

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.360
And she went panic as if the sky fell down.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.760
And I told her to say 'Please give this to me'.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.780
And she said "Please give it to me!"

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.280
And she knew that I will take her thing away if she expresses her anger or rage.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.820
But she wanted to express her rage somehow,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.780
so she said 'Ang'!

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.340
And she seemed to satisfy with that and felt better.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.340
Ah, she was so cute at that time.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.000
She's so cute.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.680
She didn't want to surrender.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.740
They cry as if they lost the country.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.380
And they cry and fall on their rear at the same time!

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
They were just standing there..

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.220
and they plunk down like this.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.160
They might lose their backbone if they sit down like that, but they really do that to express their sorrow!
