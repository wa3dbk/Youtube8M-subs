00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
To overcome a life threatening emergency, a surgical team needs 
 to be calm, well organised and above all, experienced

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.560
but how to theatre staff gain that experience without putting patients 
 at risk? Like any good team, they practice 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:25.170
"This is our simulator suite, its a room thats a mocked up 
 theatre, so we've got pipes, gases like you'd have in theatre

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.044
an anaesthetic machine, a theatre table and we basically run mannequin based simulations." 

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:37.570
"Some of the things we practice are quite rare, so the only way to 
 do it is to set up a simulation session like this 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.120
where you can simulate the effects of those things."

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.415
"I'm the anaesthetist who is anaesthetising at the moment and 
 the new anaesthetist will come in and we'll handover

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:52.756
and something will happen later on. The patient will become 
 unwell and he'll have to deal with it

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:55.403
So this is Paul, he's 26...

00:00:55.403 --> 00:01:03.437
Anaesthetists quite often handover mid case so its important 
 that we can manage it effectively 

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:13.004
There will be a critical incident which will be a drug 
 reaction which depending what information they've got out of me

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.400
whether they've managed to get the information that this patient has 
 an allergy to penicillin, so its then about 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.737
management of that particular reaction."

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.084
"Can I have some flucloxacillin?" 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.570
"He's allergic to penicillin"

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.985
"Well Ruth didn't say anything about an allergy"

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.353
"I'd just checked the paper, look"

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.561
"It should be alright"

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:29.397
"You sure?" 

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:30.397
"Yes"

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:37.245
Tom's made a critical mistake, he's injected the patient with 
 the very drug he's meant to avoid 

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.499
[BEEPING]

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:42.350
and sure enough the simulator starts to react accordingly 

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.260
"We seem to have some problems here."

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:50.850
"Yeah, I think this is probably anaphylaxis, can you call the consultant?"
"Yeah"

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:53.450
[BEEPING]

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:54.480
"Can I continue?"

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.840
"Just wait, I'll tell you when we can start again 

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:03.900
The situation evolves on the simulator just like it does in real life

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:08.640
the numbers on the monitors change just as they would in real life, 
 you start to behave like you would as if it was real

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.800
and I think does compare quite well to the real life situation." 

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:15.280
This simulation ends with the intervention of a consultant

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:20.480
"I think we're going to have to stop operating for a while 
 now, we're going to have to stabalise him first and 

00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:21.880
and work out what's going on

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240
"Oh, I don't think the patient will be happy about that" 

00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:32.970
"We're filmed during the simulation itself and then the whole point of 
 the debrief is to go back and you watch what happened

00:02:32.973 --> 00:02:35.880
and you can see in realtime exactly what you did and what you said

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.890
It allows you to look at your behaviour become aware of why 
 you acted in a certain way in a certain situation 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.800
and if thats not the ideal thing to do 
 look at how you can change it." 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.880
"OK, how did you think that handover went?" 

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:55.910
"Neither of us mentioned drug allergies, Ruth didn't mention any, I 
 didn't ask and I had looked at the chart

00:02:55.914 --> 00:03:02.510
and there weren't any mentioned on the chart, perhaps I 
 should've asked specifically, obviously in light of what happened

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.370
it would've been an important thing to know 

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.600
"Were you certain he was allergic to flucloxacillin/penicillin?"

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.870
"It was on the check list"

00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:10.320
"But you still went and got drugs"

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.560
"Yeah"

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:17.970
"So if you don't feel confident to challenge yourself, 
 maybe get a senior ODP or another anaesthetist

00:03:17.973 --> 00:03:25.120
and say look this patient has got a documented drug allergy, the 
 anaesthetist wants to give a drug I know they're allergic to."

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:30.600
"When you're on the ward, you can think back right what did 
 we do in the simulator, this is what we did

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:35.110
without that sort of mind numbing terror of you know 
 someone's dying and I don't know what to do

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.640
think, I've been in this situation before, this is what I'll do
