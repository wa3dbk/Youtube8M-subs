00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.649
In this video, I’m going to give you the
answer to the common question…

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.990
How long does it take to get a six pack?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
Let’s get started!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.150
Everyone wants a six pack!

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.369
But if you’re like most people, you probably
don’t have one…

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.770
And that’s OK, since I’m here to help
show you how to get one in the shortest amount

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.270
of time possible!

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.430
So stay with me…

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.890
Uncle Billy’s back…

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.160
Remember me?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.649
How to get a six pack, in just 3 seconds…

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.320
1, 2, 3… BAM!

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.300
Ohh, that was easy, wasn’t it!

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.240
If you need any advice, just ask uncle Billy,
he knows everything.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.450
Uncle Billy kills deers, he eats bears…
I even eat babies sometimes.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.870
Anything to get my protein!

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.309
Uncle Billy’s got a six pack… YEAH!

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.830
The amount of time it will take you to get
a six pack all depends on a number of factors…

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.320
But one of the main factors you need to know
is…

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.860
How much fat you will need to lose to uncover
your six pack abs?

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.610
And you can calculate that by finding out
what your body fat percentage is by a certified

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.479
fitness assessment specialist.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.439
It’s pretty simple!

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.350
Once you know what that number is, you will
be able to roughly calculate how long it will

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.530
take you to lose belly fat, and uncover your
abs.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.920
If you’re like most people, you are probably
above the 15-20 percent body fat mark, and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.500
that is why you currently can’t see your
six pack…

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.420
You simply have a layer of fat covering them.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.270
Once you start dropping your body fat however,
you will slowly start to uncover your abs,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.439
and also achieve more muscle definition throughout
your entire body.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.549
So you should at least aim to reach 12% body
fat or under, since that's usually the mark

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.020
where most people begin to uncover their six
pack.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.990
And if you follow a proper workout and nutrition
program, specific to your needs and goals,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.819
you can expect to lose a minimum of about
1-2 lbs. of body fat each week - on average.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.510
So the closer you are to 12% body fat, the
shorter it will take you to start uncovering

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.219
your abs.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.169
And the HIGHER your body fat percentage is,
the LONGER it will obviously take you to uncover

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.040
your six pack.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.730
It’s all relative at the end if the day…

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.900
The most Important thing however, is that
you GET STARTED TODAY!

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.279
I would personally suggest that you STOP counting
the days, and start following a good workout

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.230
and nutrition program instead…

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.889
If you dedicate a good 6-months to following
a proper plan, and more importantly, sticking

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:40.790
to it…

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.840
You will be AMAZED at what you can achieve…

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.510
In one of my last videos, I talked about the
power of consistency - and that is what you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.819
have to focus on!

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.219
Consistently taking the right actions every
week, and you will eventually reach all of

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.290
your goals, automatically.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.839
So the amount of time it will take you to
get a six pack is up to you…

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.540
How BAD do you want it?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.260
How HARD are you willing to work for it?

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.860
Are you gonna make excuses… Or are you gonna
take the necessary actions to make it happen

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.859
- and follow through?

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.379
YOU are in control of your destiny my friend,
and the body of your dreams is only a decision

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.889
away…

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.669
GO AND GET IT!

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.150
