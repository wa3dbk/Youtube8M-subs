00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.350
-Hi, it's Brooklyn and
Bailey and we both just

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.030
wanted to say happy new year.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.720
Today we're going
to be filming a book

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.960
review on some of
our favorite books

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.730
-From last year that we decided
to show you guys this year.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.770
-Yes.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.790
-So for our first
book, I decided

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.250
to show you guys, "The
Fault in our Stars."

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.890
I read this one just
little while ago.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.219
It's by John Green, who
is actually a YouTuber.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.010
Him and his brother
share a YouTube channel

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.580
called the VlogBrothers.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.740
And so this book is kind
of about a girl named Hazel

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.200
who has, I think
it's lung cancer.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
-Yeah, it's lung cancer.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.624
-She has cancer and she's
kind of depressed, you know,

00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:41.332
because she has to
carry around her tank.

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.890
And not a lot of people
want to befriend her

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.306
because they're like, afraid
to get hurt in case she dies.

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:47.010
-Yeah, and because
she's so depressed,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.922
her mom sends her
to this like, group.

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:52.365
-This like, cancer group,
where they're all like--

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:52.990
-Support group.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.290
-Hi, my name is Hazel and I have
such and such cancer, you know.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.010
And in this group
she meets a boy

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340
named Augustus Waters and Isaac.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
And Augustus Waters is the guy
that she falls in love with.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.180
He actually doesn't have
cancer, like in the book.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.880
Like almost halfway through
the book, he doesn't have,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.960
he's in remission.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.530
And so she meets him and
falls in love with him.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.345
And Issac, her friend,
he's actually blind.

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:17.850
-Yeah.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.410
-Because he had eye cancer.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.914
-And they had to
remove his eyes.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:23.080
-So Issac is the one that
brought Augustus and Hazel

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.670
together.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.250
And then Hazel like,
has this favorite book

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.350
and Augustus wants to
spend his wish on her.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.190
And so he spends his wish on
her and they go on vacation

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.380
to meet the author.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.450
And I'm not really
going to tell you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.073
the rest because that kind
of gives away the story.

00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:38.832
-Yeah.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.956
-But, basically it's about
Hazel and Augustus while

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:42.250
they're on vacation
together and--

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.920
-Fall in love.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.020
So if you want really like
a cute and sad love story,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.270
then this is the book for you.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.700
-This is the book for you.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.670
-And it's a New York
Times bestseller,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.440
so if that tells you anything.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.380
-Yeah.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.670
-You know.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.680
The book I chose was "Legend"
by Marie Lu and this book

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.802
is all about this society
called Republic and they test

00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:04.110
their children
when they're young.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.830
They test them on like mental
stuff, physical, academics.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.990
And all of this like, tests.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.970
And based on that
test, it basically

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.382
decides your rank in society.

00:02:15.382 --> 00:02:17.840
-Your job, whether or not you
have a good job or a bad job.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.385
-Whether or not you go
to college, et cetera.

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:21.510
-So you want to score high.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.140
-Yeah.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.120
So this book's about two
characters, June and Day.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.950
June is a girl,
16 year old girl.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.130
She lives with her brother
because her parents

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.338
both died when she was young.

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:33.310
-And she's the only person in
the Republic that's ever, ever,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.100
scored a perfect score.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.230
So of course, they're
like treating her well.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.720
-Yeah, she's like a child
prodigy to the government.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140
Yeah, she lives in
this nice house,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.830
went to the perfect college.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.130
Anyways, so she,
something happens

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.200
that enables her to meet
the next character, Day,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.380
who failed his test.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.410
And he lives like, he's
kind of like, in the slums.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.577
-Well, like, in this society,
if you fail your test,

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.076
they'll send you to like a camp
and the government is like--

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:01.710
-Basically--

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.635
-Killing you off.

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:04.420
-Scientific experiments
and kill you.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.920
-Yeah.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.072
You're basically,
if you fail, you're

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:08.530
a science experiment
until you die.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.840
-Yes.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.005
-So, he was sent to that
camp when he was younger

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.090
but he managed to escape.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.590
And then he grew up without,
he can't meet his family.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.630
-Day is kind of this like,
really widely-known criminal

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.650
because he doesn't like the
government because they don't

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.942
provide medicine and
his family is sick.

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:28.150
And so he wants the medicine.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.691
So he's really mad
at the government.

00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:32.122
So he's doing all these
like, rebellious things

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:33.080
against the government.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.270
Like, I don't know--

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.430
-Blowing up ships, Naval ships.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.260
-Taking supplies
or you know, things

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.840
that prevent the government
from getting stuff, I guess.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.380
And something happens again and
it enables him and June to meet

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.140
and it develops the story.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.000
So it's a really great book.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.240
-It's my favorite book.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.160
I love, love, love this book.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.660
-Yeah.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.493
There's three books.

00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:00.310
There's "Legend,"
"Prodigy" and "Champion.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.550
And they're all very good.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.770
So you should read this book.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.580
-So we're going to tell you what
we think that age appropriate,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.320
like, I don't know--

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.130
-Like levels.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.540
-For this book.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.380
I would say like 12
and up would probably

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.464
be the best for this book.

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:14.921
Just because it's
a little bit more

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.129
mature and it's kind of sad.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.420
-And it has some romance in it.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.290
-Yeah, so.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.292
-And for my book, I'd
probably say 10 or 11.

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:23.750
There's nothing really bad in
this book other than the fact

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.427
that the government
does kill people,

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:26.510
which is not a good thing.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.750
But you know, they
do do that, so.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.250
-Yeah.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.620
Thank you guys so, so,
so much for watching.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.151
Don't forget to read the
books that we recommended.

00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.650
-Yes.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.570
Even our mom read "Legend"
and she absolutely loved it.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.634
So, if that tells you anything.
