Hi and welcome to this first episode of 2015!
My name is Katharina and you are watching the Kate Show!

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:21.220
In this episode I want to talk about some of the upcoming games for the first three months. 
I will tell you which games I am excited about and why. So let's get started with Resident Evil: Revelations 2!

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:38.720
The story is pretty hard.
You start off as Claire or Moira in a deserted prison sector on a desert island.
You don´t know how you got there.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:51.480
Around every corner zombies are lurking and you have to survive with that little ammo you can find.
Claire has got a gun, Moira only a flashlight.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.480
I knew, which character I would play. 
Release date is the 18. of february for XBox360, Ps3 and Ps4.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.180
Fans waited for ages to lay their hands on it.
Final Fantasy Type Zero is released on march 19th. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:27.120
Fans begged for Square Enix to bring the game to the west when it came out on the Playstation Portable a couple of years ago, and most of them went as far to modify their PSP to play the japanese version. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.480
The fact that Square Enix believed in the product well enough to not only bring it to the west, but also remaster it in HD is a good sign.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.860
There are 14 playable characters with unique weapons.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.840
A lot of people will be buying the game FF Type-0 just for the FF15 demo that exclusively comes with it.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:09.260
When you like to watch formula 1 races and like fast cars, watch out!
In the newest racing simulator project cars you dont need to unlock lame rattletraps to drive the good stuff.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:21.780
bla bla technic stuff (Kate is too lazy to translate it)

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:36.960
You can drive on tracks like Nürburgring, Le Mans, Monaco, Monza or Silverstone.
Release date is the 20. of march, for Ps4, XBoxOne and PC.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeahh, GTA5 is getting released in march.
I like GTA. Driving around  and knocking over people. You know how it works: You can start as ex bank robber or small time criminal and complete orders.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:17.360
The open world is bigger now than ever before in a rockstar game. Whats new? More vessels, more radio channels, more weapons. Welcome to my hood . Yeah, she´s a gangster....

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.660
Turtle Rock Studios, maker of Left 4 Dead, bring us a new survival shooter : Evolve.
I played it before on Gamescom.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.800
4 player are the hunters.
the 5th player is controlling the monster.
The monster is growing during the game and it´s getting stronger.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:04:00.640
As a hunter you better find the monster quickly and kill it. Otherwise the monster is preying upon the hunters. You need to play as a team!

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.380
Like in Left4Dead :D
What I also love about that game: the jungle setting!

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.860
Saints Row 4 took place in space.
Gat out of hell is rocking the underworld.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.540
You play as Gat or Kinzie Kensington and you go to hell, to rescue the leader of the Saints.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.940
If you like GTA and you add some funny nonsense, you like that game.It´s an open world action adventure, which doesnt take itself seriously.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:49.100
Deep Silver made the trailer a musical!
Hilarious. Release date 23 of january for Ps3, Ps4, XBox360 and XBox One.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.640
Sexy, isn´t it?
Dead or alive 5 - Last Round doesn´t disappoint and shows some really cute girls fighting.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:26.140
If you preorder the game, you get bathroom poster of Hitomi and Kokoro. Whats a bathroom poster?
Waterproof poster for your shower. Typical Japan.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:37.820
Great fighting system, all characters of Dead or Alive 5 and Ultimate Version.
And you can unlock costumes, items and......hairstyles!

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.060
Toad is starring in his first own adventure:
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.040
He needs to collect coins, diamonds and stars to complete levels. A short and colourful game, which reminds us of Mario 3D World.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.800
The riddles aren´t too difficult, which is great (haha!!)

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.740
My favourite setting is the boohoo castle.
Release date was last week!

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.460
As you can see there's enough to still get excited about.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:40.180
Which of these games has your interest? Let me know in the comments and I will get back to you next week with a new episode of Die Kate Show!
