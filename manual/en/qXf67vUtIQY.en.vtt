00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:05.126
&gt;&gt; [Music] Purdue University
was uniquely positioned

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.776
to help usher in the Space Age.

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:10.606
As a leading educational
institution for technology,

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.776
engineering, and the
sciences, Purdue was ready

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.796
with the resources, expertise,
and intensity of purpose needed

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:21.516
to face the unknown challenges
of space, and what Purdue had

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.886
to offer in 1947 was exactly
what one young freshman needed

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:27.606
as he prepared for a journey

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:31.026
that would eventually
take him to the moon.

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:36.226
&gt;&gt; I remember going to
aerodynamics class taught

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:44.516
by professor Shanks, Merrill
Shanks, and the first day

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:46.206
of class he gave
us an assignment

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:47.976
at the end of the class.

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:52.476
He said to read pages
62 to 69, which happened

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:58.276
to be Bernoulli's Law, and the
assignment was to criticize,

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.166
and it was right
then that I realized

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:06.846
that they weren't teaching
us facts and information.

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.146
He was teaching me how to think.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.736
[Background music]
And that turned

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:15.976
out to be extremely
important in many

00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:19.156
of the situations I
encountered through my life.

00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:24.756
The time that I spent at
Purdue learning engineering was

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:26.666
absolutely critical

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:29.226
to everything I've done
throughout my entire career.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:34.486
&gt;&gt; The approach was analytical
and exacting, not just for those

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:36.776
who would soar into
space, but for those

00:01:36.776 --> 00:01:39.136
who were preparing the systems
that would take them there.

00:01:39.636 --> 00:01:42.306
&gt;&gt; Propulsion technology
got really started at Purdue

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.926
in the late 40's when, under
the direction of Maurice Zucrow,

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.946
when President Hovde had
the foresight to say,

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.576
"Hey Purdue really
needs to be involved

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:53.156
in this new emerging field."

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.676
Some of the very early work
at Purdue in the development

00:01:56.676 --> 00:02:00.546
of rocket engine technology
had to do with trying

00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:02.906
to find what the best
rocket propellants were.

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:06.466
Doc Zucrow and the researchers
at Purdue made a lot of,

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.526
you know, really
significant advancements

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:13.146
in burning these propellants
and rocket engines at higher

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:15.746
and higher chamber pressures
than had ever been down before

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:18.276
and literally wrote the
book that was used in a lot

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:22.046
of the design in the early years
for the big rocket companies

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:23.136
as they developed
their new engines.

00:02:23.136 --> 00:02:27.096
&gt;&gt; [Background noise]
So fluid facilities

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:30.476
at Purdue were pretty much low
speed facilities for airplanes.

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:34.496
Beginning in the early 50's
and running through the 60's,

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:36.206
we had some teaching labs

00:02:36.546 --> 00:02:39.696
with higher speed facilities
beginning in the early 60's.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.286
However, low noise, high
speed facilities existed only

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:46.006
at NASA Langley, and so
there was a lot of interest

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:51.526
if we could build low cost large
low noise high speed facilities

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:55.036
here, and the facility that's
behind me here is the only one

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:57.986
in the world which is the
result of a long effort

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.296
to develop such a thing.

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:03.256
&gt;&gt; [Background music]
In labs and classrooms,

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:04.786
Purdue's early aeronautics

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:07.986
and astronautics programs
quietly helped set the stage

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:12.096
for success in space,
and then in 1969,

00:03:12.346 --> 00:03:14.146
the world watched breathlessly

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.306
as Apollo flight crew
Michael Collins, Edwin Aldrin,

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.676
and Purdue graduate,
Neil Armstrong,

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:21.806
fulfilled President
Kennedy's dream.

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:35.166
&gt;&gt; [Background conversation] The
final descent is a power descent

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:40.486
to the surface of the moon was
indeed the most difficult part

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:45.186
of the flight for
Apollo 11, and I suspect

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:47.336
for other subsequent
flights as well.

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:50.266
The systems were
very heavily loaded.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.856
They hadn't been...this part

00:03:52.856 --> 00:03:54.816
of the flight had
never been done before.

00:03:55.216 --> 00:03:58.396
These parts of the systems
had never been used before,

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:02.766
and it was a very
demanding task.

00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:08.886
So, yeah, it was an
enormously satisfying to get

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:12.226
through that first one and
be able to successfully make

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:17.776
that landing, but we knew there
would be a low fuel situation.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:23.096
We had hoped that we'd have
when we got to the vicinity

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:26.176
of the landing site have
a couple minutes fuel left

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:30.286
to complete the landing, but in
our case because we were going

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.206
into an area that really wasn't
suitable for a landing and had

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.136
to extend our trajectory

00:04:35.136 --> 00:04:40.516
on to the west awhile a ways
a direction, maybe a quarter

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:43.946
of a mile further, it was
on a steep slide on the side

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:47.276
of a large crater with very
large boulders the size

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:51.296
of automobiles on it, and this
wasn't a place that I wanted

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:51.976
to try to make a landing.

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:07.966
It was certainly a concern,
but on the other hand

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:10.776
if we were going to make a
landing, it had to be a safe,

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:16.246
smooth one, and so we
were prepared for that.

00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:23.476
&gt;&gt; It's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:26.746
&gt;&gt; I'd like to go back.

00:05:26.746 --> 00:05:29.196
I had to leave some things
behind the first time

00:05:29.246 --> 00:05:31.246
because of our storage capacity,
so I'd like to go back

00:05:31.406 --> 00:05:33.216
and pick up those souvenirs.

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:38.046
&gt;&gt; Neil Armstrong and Eugene
Cernan have been followed

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:42.386
by 20 more Purdue graduates, and
the numbers continue to grow.

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:47.466
Purdue Pathways, the Space
Connection, will be right back.
