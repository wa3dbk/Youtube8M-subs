00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.433
The President:
Hello, hello, hello, everybody!

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:03.900
Hello, Blackhawks fans!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.433
(applause)

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, we have hosted a lot of
teams at the White House over

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.467
the last two years, but this
one is a little sweeter.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.700
It's pretty special.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.667
That's because it is the first
time as President I get to say

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:27.367
congratulations on bringing
a world championship to my

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.233
hometown, the city of Chicago.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:34.567
(applause)

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.467
I want to start by recognizing
Rocky Wirtz, John McDonough,

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:40.934
and all the folks who helped
make this team what it is.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:42.367
Give them a big
round of applause.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:46.834
(applause)

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.300
We're proud to have some
members of Congress here today.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.567
You guys didn't have anything
to do with it, but --

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:54.767
(laughter)

00:00:54.767 --> 00:01:00.300
-- I know you're big fans, so
we want to acknowledge you.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600
Finally, I want to
congratulate all the fans.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.300
We have a proud tradition in
Chicago of believing that no

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.266
matter how long it takes,
how much we have to endure,

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:15.400
it's only a matter of time before
our team finally wins it all.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.433
(laughter)

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:19.066
The waiting builds character.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.567
We have a lot of character.

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:22.367
(laughter)

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:26.367
Now, I have to say, even by
Chicago standards, 49 years,

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.800
that's a pretty long time.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.033
(laughter)

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.900
To put that in perspective, the
last time the Blackhawks won the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.800
Stanley Cup, a
movie cost 69 cents.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.000
JFK had just moved
into the White House.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.800
I was still in diapers.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.367
(laughter)

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:49.066
And when the legendary Glenn
Hall played goalie for the

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:54.834
Hawks, he did it with a
wooden stick and no mask.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.200
So you can understand why people
were a little skeptical when,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.166
after this team's first
practice last year,

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.600
Patrick Kane came
off the ice and said,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.233
"We want to win
the Stanley Cup."

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:08.467
We had heard that before.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:11.066
But this time it was different.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.767
This was the kind
of tough, talented,

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:17.567
selfless team that Chicago
had been waiting for.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.233
It was a team built around
people like Coach Q,

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.834
who brought years of experience
and focus to the bench.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:28.200
Players like 22-year-old
captain Jonathan Toews,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.800
who lit up the ice on his way
to being named playoff MVP.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.400
(applause)

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.300
There's Patrick Kane, who scored
the biggest goal in franchise

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.367
history in the overtime
to win the Cup.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:48.500
(applause)

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.033
And when Duncan Keith had seven
of his teeth knocked out by a

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.934
puck -- seven -- some
of you guys there,

00:02:55.934 --> 00:03:00.734
you're missing a few, he's
missing seven at one time --

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:04.066
but he bit down on some gauze,
took a shot of Novocain,

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.333
and headed right
back out onto the ice.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:11.066
(applause)

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.934
They did all this
for their fans.

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:17.734
And along the way, they helped
Chicago become a hockey town again.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:20.800
During the playoffs, even the
Michael Jordan statue had a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.166
Blackhawks uniform on.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.767
(laughter)

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:25.867
After this team won
the Stanley Cup,

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:30.367
2 million people lined Michigan
Avenue to see the victory parade go by.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.734
And when the Hawks visited
Wrigley Field during the

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.767
Crosstown Classic, they did
something even tougher than

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:40.667
winning the Cup -- they got
40,000 Sox fans and Cubs fans to

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.867
stand up and cheer
at the same team.

00:03:42.867 --> 00:03:43.700
(laughter)

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.300
Never happened before.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.300
You know, in the end, it was
about more than just bringing

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.000
home one of the biggest
trophies in sports.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.800
It was about a city coming
together behind one team and one goal.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.166
It was about a new generation of
players and fans understanding

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:05.400
what it feels like to be
the best in the world.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.500
It was about getting the chance to
share that experience with others.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.066
And that's why,
over the last year,

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.433
members of this team have been
taking the Cup on the road --

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:16.800
stopping everywhere from ice
rinks to hospitals to let people

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.867
have their moment with the trophy
and help spread some of the joy.

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.734
Yesterday, for example, they
took the Cup to visit wounded

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:27.033
warriors at Walter
Reed Hospital.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:32.834
(applause)

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:34.700
You know, so they helped raise
the spirits of men and women

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.166
who've sacrificed so much
on behalf of our country.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:41.667
Later today, they're going to
join Michelle in helping kids

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:47.033
stay active by trying out some
street hockey out on the South Lawn.

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:50.633
So I want to thank them for
everything they're doing to give back.

00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:52.767
And finally, because it's
almost playoff time again,

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:57.200
I want to wish these guys the best
of luck going into the postseason.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.734
I don't want to jinx anything,
but after winning eight of their

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:03.300
last 10 games, I think it might
be time for Patrick to start

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.400
growing that playoff
mullet again.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.433
(laughter)

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.533
I thought it was pretty sharp.

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:11.567
(laughter)

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:13.800
Because I want to see
you back here next year.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.033
And let me, yes, just say to
all the Bears fans, Bulls fans,

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:22.700
White Sox fans, and Cubs fans --

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.100
(laughter)

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.200
-- I want to see all of
you sometime soon, as well.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.467
So, congratulations, guys.

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:28.400
Thank you.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:37.266
(applause)

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:40.233
All right, I think -- whoa, whoa
-- what've you got for me here?

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:41.166
All right.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:46.033
Speaker:
Mr. President, on behalf of the
Chicago Blackhawks and the city

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:51.000
of Chicago, we are proud to
bestow upon you an official

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.667
Blackhawks jersey.

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:55.300
We appreciate the kind words
that you said about our

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.433
franchise, but we are truly honored
and humbled to be here today.

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:02.967
Thank you for recognizing our
Stanley Cup championship team.

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:03.767
Thank you.

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:04.800
The President:
Thank you so much.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.467
Thank you.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:10.266
There we go.

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:12.233
I think we've even got
some blood on here.

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.567
(laughter)

00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:17.567
It shows it's authentic.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:18.734
Fantastic.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:19.834
Player:
Do you want to put the ring on?

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:20.900
The President:
Oh, absolutely.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.166
I've got to try the
ring out and everything.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.867
That's what you call
some bling, right there.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.834
(laughter)

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:35.800
All right, there you go.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.967
Player:
We got this for you, too.

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:38.066
The President:
What else do we got here?

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:39.066
(laughter)

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.467
Player:
A mini Stanley Cup
-- there you go.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.800
The President:
Look at this, a
mini Stanley -- now,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.700
can I say that when I first saw
this I thought it looks so much

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.000
bigger on TV.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.133
(laughter)

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:54.467
But then it turned out
it was just a replica.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:56.867
But what a wonderful,
wonderful gift this is.

00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:58.000
Thank you so much, team.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.967
We are proud of you.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:00.200
Thank you.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.266
Appreciate you.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:02.166
(applause)

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.400
Go, Blackhawks!
