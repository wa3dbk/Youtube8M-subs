00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.320
So I'm going to show you how to play funk
almost like you would on bass, using your

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.520
thumb.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.270
So a bass player would thump with their thumb
like this so you got it, almost like you're

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.500
out to hitchhike, and you're going rotate
your thumb towards the string, like that.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.050
So I'm taking my thumb pick off and I'm hitting
the string right on top of a fret.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.410
You want to hit that large knuckle right on
top of the fret.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.270
And I'm playing the open E string.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.340
I'm plucking the D string open, nice and hard
with my first finger that's curled around,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.510
lifting it, really lifting it up hard.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.939
And I'm hammering on with my first finger.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:13.070
And then I'm moving up to the fifth position
with my first finger at the fifth fret, playing

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.810
the D note, hammering on to the E. And to
finish it off, I'm going G on the fourth string

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.749
with my first finger back to the E with my
third finger.

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:33.299
And you put it all together.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.320

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.829
Now there's lots of other little tiny things
in between what I explained to you already

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.119
that you're probably hearing that I'm just
kind of doing naturally that I can't really

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.170
show you that you'll probably end up doing
too once you really get into this style.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.010
And it's very personal so I can't really show
you that.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.319
It's just something that I'm feeling and I
can't really explain it to you.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:16.890
But have another listen and I'll play this
out and you can try it at home.
