00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.700
This is a Jaguar XF Sportbrake

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.240
that has been fitted with a Witter detachable towbar.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
Unlike the Jaguar towbar, this towbar does not require a cut

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.619
in the visible face of the bumper, though you can still see the break away loop

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.300
when the towbar is not in use. 
The electrical socket swings down from the left

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320
and then to fit the towbar neck,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.029
remove the protective cover,

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.660
raise the neck up into the receiver and it locks into place automatically.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.550
You can then secure the neck against theft
by inserting the key and turning it.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.320
To remove the detachable neck,
insert the key and turn.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.700
Press the locking handle in towards

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.930
the towbar neck,rotate as far as you can and the neck comes away.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.989
Finally replace the dust cover.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.280
Once again,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.230
lower the electrical socket,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.270
remove the protective cap

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.770
and lift the towbar neck up into the receiver

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.070
with a slight twisting motion it locks into
place.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.689
Inserting and turning the key secures against theft.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.990
To remove, insert the key and turn,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.770
press the locking handle inwards, rotate as far as you can

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.820
and the neck comes away.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.640
Finally replace the dust cap and fold away the electrical socket.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.810
