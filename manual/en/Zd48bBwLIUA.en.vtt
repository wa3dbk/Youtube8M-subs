00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.250
We have the bite valve and sticking out it.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.390
So what are we doing now,
Bob?

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.820
What we are going to do now is rather than
we will going to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.940
contain this in the pack so we will going
to stick this bomb in the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.109
pack and zip it shut.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.930
And then we also have loaded in there the
hydration engine.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.529
And we have everything ready and loaded.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.749
We have put
this in here.

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.069
We will going to let this blow and we will
going to take

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.069
a look at our zippers.

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.069
We are going to take a look at everything.

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:27.099
We
are going to take a look at the engines and

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.239
see how the engines
handled it and just another round of testing

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:50.190
of Geigerrig Hydration
Packs.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.060
Stand it up.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:23.240
What is that?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.420
No, never mind.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.670
It sounds a
little insulated so you cannot hear it doing

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.670
its thing.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.439
The pack on
pop and getting ready to explode thing.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:56.840
I can see the packs getting
tighter Bob.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:13.420
It is crackling nice and loud.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:03:23.410
And it is getting tight as
a drum.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.170
Yo!!!!

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.150
Oh let us take a look at the engine.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.900
The engine handled
it just fine.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.000
So let us take a look.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Go ahead and fil it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I am
filming.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.910
All right, so that is real testing, okey?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.740
Let us take a look
at the engine and how the engine handled that.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.880
That is the guts of
this pack.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.550
Let us take this out and take a look at how
she handles.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.620
We
will going to pump this out and see if we

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.660
still got a pack fully
functional engine after a bomb goes off inside

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.260
the pack.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.490
And see how
she did.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.311
We literally had to put inside a pack with
the bomb to test

00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:18.489
to see how well the Geigerrig Hydration Engines
handles pressure.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.210
We
are going to pressurize this nice little Hydration

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.210
pack.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.330
I should
drain some of the air out.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.490
Little air in there.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.330
Slide top off, someof
the air out.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.060
Slide top back on.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:42.820
And let us just test it out, and we
got much water and see how it handled it.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.300
Here we go.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.830
We got it all
pressurized up and see if we got leaks in

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.680
our engine.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.780
Do you see any
leaks there, Mike?

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.780
Not really.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780
Do you got to see any leaks?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.060
Like it is
looking pretty good.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.830
And I will see how she sprays and see if our
valves are turned out nice and if they are

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.520
working well.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
Still
spraying.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.540
The Geigerrig Hydration Engine.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.220
You can literally put it
inside the pack, a ballistic pack with a bomb,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.570
blow it up and your
Hydration Engine still works.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.250
Was it a close course?

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.250
Yes.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.250
Yes.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.010
Do not
do this at home.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.010
Yup.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.010
All right.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.341
This is the pack that has been thrown
out.

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:29.080
It was thrown out of a truck earlier today
two times in a hundred

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
miles an hour handled it.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
Just beautifully.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.730
When we put a bomb inside
of it with this hydration engine to see how

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.790
well our hydration engine
held on, of course it blows up.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.260
To give you an idea of the force that
was inside the pack with this Hydration Engine

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.210
that is still a fully
functional non-leaking hydration engine.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.490
Take a look at this heavy
duty ballistic nylon pack.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.330
It blew the front off, blew the zippers
off, blew off every stitch, blew off any back

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.990
frame padding that we
have put in there to kinda keep, it did it

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.490
all.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.830
And this Hydration
right here didnt took a leaking.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.199
It is just right here.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.060
Fully
functional, no issue, whatsoever.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.630
You have a good one.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.960
Take care.
