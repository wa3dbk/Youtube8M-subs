I'm Susan Ting I am a potter and welcome to
the Expert Village. Now I'm going to put a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:19.400
little piece of clay here just to keep it
from moving. I mix that I will I want to make

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.850
sure that this pot is not going to move cause
for beginner students sometimes they do move

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.910
and then you will loose your pot. So putting
those 3 pieces would be enough to keep it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.860
in place. Okay the next step I will be trimming
the pot. I have a trimming tool, I put my

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.500
finger right in the center and then have the
tool attached to my thumb. So make sure that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:07.229
the pot does not move. I will start trimming
the bottom which would always have excess

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:35.420
clay there and give a little finish look on
the pot. Then I can trim the center, from

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.419
the side and from the inside.
