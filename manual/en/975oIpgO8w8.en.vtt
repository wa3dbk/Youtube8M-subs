Hello my friends and welcome
to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.470
I am Leonardo Pereznieto
and today I´ll do a video collaboration

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.530
with my friend Domerelly.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
To see how she sketched this nice angel
please click on the icon or the link bellow.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.200
To shadow it I´ll use the graphite powder
that I collect when I sharpen my leds

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.509
if you use wooden pencils you can get
this powder by rubbing the tip of your

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.500
pencil with a sander.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.330
Spread some of the powder on the paper,
do this carefully because is a bit

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.300
of a dangerous operation. [laughs]

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.550
Domerelly, if you are watching this
you may want to close your eyes

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.500
for a moment because maybe
you are not going to like this [laughs].

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.730
Then spread it with a soft brush
to give a tone to the whole drawing

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.170
while doing this you can produce a design
for the background, in this case

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.200
I am doing some abstract lines.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.200
It is advisable to start with little graphite
and increase it as you need it.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.100
And now with a kneaded eraser
pull the lights.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
This is like drawing but with the eraser, it´s very fun!

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.700
Pull all the lights you want
I love doing this!

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
In this way the angel appears from darkness.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.800
You can give more shadows with a finer brush.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.600
And you may render the darker 
tones as usual with a pencil

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.569
but be very careful not to touch the paper
with your hand now and also

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.500
before you pour the graphite powder
because the grease would leave marks,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.000
that is why I am using a clean paper to rest the hand.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Let´s give more shadows to the dress and the body.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.489
I´ll do the detail of the face
trying to preserve the nice

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.310
features that Domerelly drew,
and sorry if I get on your way a little bit

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.300
but I can´t see the little eyes
from where I am sitting.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.900
The complete list of materials
is in the information bellow the video.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.300
Let´s give some texture with the eraser
and soften it with the brush.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Good! I like it how it is coming along.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let´s shadow a little bit further the dress and the wings

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.600
to give them a little bit more volume.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.500
The last details and it will be ready!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.079
