I'm Kelly on behalf of Expert Village and
I'm going to show you some tips and techniques

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.070
that I use when cantering and loping my horse.
Once you have your horse loping, you're going

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.779
to want to use some techniques to stop and
back your horse. So that we did by sitting

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:27.730
deep and pulling up a little bit. You can
also use a squeeze stop technique

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.360
which works when you put both your spurs in
your horse and it will cause your horse to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.910
shut down. Now this is something that you
want to make sure that your horse is trained

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.260
properly do. You don't want to just get on
your horse and jam your spurs in and expect

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.300
it to stop or you might end up going for a
wilder ride then you anticipated. This is

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.941
a technique a lot of Western riders will use
with their show horses, because it's a lot

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:10.360
more effective. You can see I'm not having
to pull up or jerk on my reins a lot. This

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:21.490
just shows a little greater level of skill
so it looks a lot prettier to not have me

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:31.820
jerking on my horse. Whoa..so once I have
her stopped and I ask her to back, now she'll

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.580
back just by me rolling my spurs in her and
picking up a little bit. You can also back

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.250
just by picking up and applying a little bit
of pressure. Now if your horse isn't good

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.350
a backing, or maybe fights you a little you
may find that you'll need to pull a lot harder,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.430
but once you get a little bit out of them
they took a couple steps just give a couple

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.049
of pats, say thank you, you did a good job
and eventually they will learn what your asking

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.500
of them. Another thing that you can do if
you have a hard time getting your horse to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.690
stop is if you say whoa and your horse doesn't
stop you can keep pulling until you get your

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.639
horse to stop and then actually pull your
horse until your horse actually starts to

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.670
back up. Horses like to stop a whole lot better
than they like to go backwards so eventually

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.840
your horse is going to get tired of backing
up and he'll just stop when you ask him to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:30.769
stop. So again, kiss, kiss when your in your
lope and you want to stop you just sit deep

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:43.269
and you can squeeze stop by putting your spurs
in on each side, whoa, or you can sit deep

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:51.620
and say whoa, but if you notice kiss she has
a much cleaner whoa and quicker shut down

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.819
when I squeeze stop her. So it is something
that you can definitely work on with your

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.359
horse to get your horse to stop a little bit
more efficiently.
