00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.103
"Protein and Heart Disease"

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:11.172
We know that the quality and 
quantity of fat is tightly correlated

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:13.703
with the risk of our 
#1 killer, heart disease.

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:16.663
But what about protein?

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:17.880
Out of Harvard recently:

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.040
Dietary Protein and Risk of Ischemic 
Heart Disease in Middle-aged Men.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.409
Independent of source, 
and independent of fat,

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.524
do you think total protein 
intake was associated

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.722
with more heart disease,

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:30.492
less heart disease,

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:32.092
or no difference?

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:33.189
And the answer they found was:

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.029
no difference.

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:35.897
The quantity didn’t seem to matter.

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:39.677
But what about the quality, 
the source of the protein?

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:42.857
They observed no association 
between total dietary protein

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:45.777
and risk of total heart 
disease in this group of men;

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:49.757
however, higher intake of animal 
protein may be associated

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:53.937
with increased rise of ischemic 
heart disease in “healthy men”

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:57.846
meaning those without hypertension, 
high cholesterol, and diabetes.

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.417
Healthy only in quotes, though,

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.177
given their higher risk of heart disease

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.547
due to their consumption 
of animal protein.

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:08.619
They’ve also observed a 
significant inverse association

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.179
between higher vegetable protein 
intake and risk of fatal heart disease.

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.649
So more plants, less heart disease,

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.733
meaning the more plants 
and fewer animals one eats

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.523
would appear to be better for the heart,

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:24.113
even independent of the fat issue.

00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:26.291
So the benefits of a plant-
based diet may extend

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:30.091
beyond just avoiding saturated animal fat.

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.408
But isn't protein just protein, though?

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:38.542
I mean, how does your body know if 
it’s coming from a plant or an animal?

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:42.200
Well, proteins are made up 
of a string of amino acids,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.140
and there are some amino acids more 
common in plants than in animals,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.820
particularly glutamic acid,

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.920
which a study published in the Journal of
the American Heart Association was found,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.960
for example, to potentially have

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.150
independent blood 
pressure-lowering effects,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.625
which may contribute 
to the inverse relation

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.725
between vegetable protein 
to blood pressure,

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:05.300
meaning high plants - low pressure.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.879
Their data generally reinforced 
current recommendations

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.990
for high intake of vegetable products

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.076
as a part of comprehensive 
nutritional lifestyle approaches

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:19.305
for preventing and controlling major 
established cardiovascular risk factors

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:25.124
and epidemic cardiovascular disease.
