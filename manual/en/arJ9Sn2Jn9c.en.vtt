00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.414
So today we're going to demo
an Eclipse inspired hairdo.

00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:07.080
For those of you that
have seen Eclipse,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.230
which I'm sure you
all have by now,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.067
there is a fight
scene where Rosalie

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.150
has a really cute hair do,
and as soon as I saw it

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.230
I knew I needed to
come home and try it.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.690
So here we go.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.700
So I have brushed her
hair, and wet it down

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.770
just a little bit, and then
parted her hair on the left

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.420
where her natural
part line falls.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.000
So now I'm going to part from
that part line on the left

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.190
down to about her ear,
and just take the hair,

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.570
and I'm just going to braid it.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.990
So there were actually two
hairdos from what I could see,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.640
but they were kind of the same
hairdo, and I'll explain that.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.420
So I'm just braiding it.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.470
They were both cute,
and I'll show you both.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.600
Just got a little fly away.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:14.550
So I'm just going to braid
this all the way down,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.980
and security it
with a rubber band.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.400
Now I'm going to go
back to the other side

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.390
and do the same thing.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.420
I'm going to part
from that main part

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.180
to the left down to her ear,
wet it down a little bit,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.100
and braid it.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.390
OK, so the first scene I noticed
was when they're practicing.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.140
Getting ready for the
army to come of vampires.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.080
So this is the first one.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.690
You're going to just braid
it down again to the ends.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.840
Now, it was really
quick, but from what

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.270
I could see she had just
left the two braids like this

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.205
with her hair down.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.900
Exactly like I'm about to do it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.080
Her hair had a little more
curl added in, but essentially

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.390
the same thing.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.480
So you can just do this
with the two braids

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.790
coming down and loose--
that's style one--

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.160
and then when they actually
fought the vampires,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.493
she had her hair-- will you
just hold those braids out

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:40.136
of the way?

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:45.570
Pulled over into a side
ponytail with the braids.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.110
So we're going to pull
this over, and just

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.155
add those braids in like so.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:09.786
Put another rubber band on,
and giver her a cute side pony.

00:03:09.786 --> 00:03:11.660
Now, if you don't like
the braids hanging out

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.640
you can just simply pull the
elastics out at this point

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.525
and let it loosen back
up into a side ponytail.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:27.810
And you can do a looser side
ponytail too if you need to.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.930
So that's style number two.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.090
Now, another fun way to--
give it a little bit more

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:40.930
finished look, in my opinion, is
take your little TopsyTail tool

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.530
and stick it under there.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:56.930
Get another piece of hair and
add the little hair wrapped

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.530
ending just to finish
it off a little bit

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.560
so that you don't
see the elastic.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.750
And then do the side
pony, which is very cute.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.160
And there you go--
The Rosalie 101.
