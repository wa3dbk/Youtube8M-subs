00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.280
I want to get to the yesterday but we
didn't have enough time a

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.390
Bill Maher waitin on Syria and I think
he had some great things to say

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.450
and finally new rule twelve years after
9/11

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.969
admits yet another debate on whether the
bomb yet another Muslim country

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.820
america must stop asking the question
why do they hate is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.820
forget the serious debate with heated
debate on why we're always debating

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.900
whether to bomb someone

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
because we're starting to look not so
much like the world's policeman but

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.920
more like george Zimmerman

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.980
it's going to use force and then
pretending it's because we had no choice

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.030
now against chemical weapons and I don't
care who knows it

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.250
and I do understand the appeal love
putting the world on notice that if you

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.739
use poison gas the United States of
America will personally

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.840
personally fuck you up we will seek out
the council in support of the entire

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.949
nation a family's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.990
and then a matter what they say will go
ahead and fuck you up

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.000
however valid

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.850
that argument maybe it is I believe
outweighed

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.530
by the fact that we have to stop bombing
muslim countries

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.590
if we ever want to feel safe from
terrorism in our

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.340
own the chemical weapons treaty is
important

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.690
but to the jihadi on the street it just
looks like we're always looking for a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.210
new

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.300
reason to bomb them even worse

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.890
bombing seems to be our answer for
everything since 1945

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.890
when Jesus granted America air
superiority

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.230
up we have bombs Correa

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.610
Vietnam Laos Cambodia lebanon grenada
panama iraq serbia somalia bosnia the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.260
Sudan

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.120
afghanistan-pakistan Libya and Yemen and
%um in only because the tenth one was

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.660
free

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.210
how

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.870
we inherit this moral obligation to
bring justice to the world

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.959
be a death from above are we so choose

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.700
it doesn't make any sense our schools
are crumbling and we want to teach

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.700
everyone else a lesson

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.920
I am no fan other side and I say that
openly I don't care if it cost me jobs

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.530
in Hollywood

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.530
I think he is the worst kind of
sociopath the kind who commits

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.800
unspeakable acts

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.160
but it looks like a shoe salesman at
Macy's I'm just pointing out that

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.970
we're the only country in the world that
uses out loud

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.430
about who we might bomb next Iran

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.430
we by me thinking about it maybe it
depends on my mood

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.400
we did this with iraq after 9/11 even
though they had nothing to do with 9/11

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.790
we do it with Iran every day and now
it's serious turn we're like a

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.470
schoolyard bully use got every kid in
the class

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.650
nerve is there gonna be next and I don't
know if anybody should

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.820
that kind of power can you imagine going
to work and sitting at the table with

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.510
the one church

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.080
with 10 different people in front of you
and saying a

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.080
you think we should killed bob

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.480
well it would send a message to Steve

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.550
acts like this

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.160
its other countries don't talk like this
probably because if they did

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.160
we bomb for the only nation as we have
seen in the Syrian fiasco

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.990
who threatens to drop bombs on you while
telling you we don't want to get

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.780
involved

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.780
or just bombing please don't get up just
boots on the crackdown no allied bombing

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.150
will be out here

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.590
I remember being on the Howard Stern
Show twelve years ago this week

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.400
right after 9/11 and howard said that in
retaliation for 9/11 America

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.840
should bomb a Muslim country any Muslim
country didn't matter which one and yet

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.370
somehow

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.370
I was the one on trial for talking crazy
I remember thinking to myself

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.500
really Bob any Muslim country that's the
policy just got a map of the Middle East

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.320
and throw a dart at it well apparently
George W Bush was listening

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.310
has exactly what brilliant

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.410
absolutely nailed it are so many great
things he said there

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.520
first of all a comparison america's like
george Zimmerman

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.530
staying you and yeah that's kinda true

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.570
and then he says it we have to stop
bombing people

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.729
if we want to be safe over here now look
up I can't stress this point enough

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.940
that is inorganic it that's actually
been

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.860
shown via data so what I mean by that is

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.780
when you look at the raw number I'll
terrorists that exist in the world today

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.910
and you compare it to before we started
the war on terror

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.169
there are more terrorists today now
think about what that means the about

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.690
the implications about you know that
means

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.880
the war on terror has been in epic and
complete failure

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.570
why because the opposite if the goal was
to either limit terrorism or eliminate

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.419
terrorism slash terrorists well you
achieve the opposite call

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.289
you actually flared up anti-american
sentiments and made more people join al

00:05:59.289 --> 00:05:59.919
Qaeda

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.300
enjoying radical groups now why did that
happen was actually very simple reason

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.680
turns out if you invade Iraq are you
invade Afghanistan are you do but

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.140
indiscriminate drone strikes in a Yemen
and as somalia and

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.940
a other places you know what happens
when you drop a

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.229
a drone on top over Taliban funeral

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.669
and there are women and children at a
funeral and you don't knowingly

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.430
turns out you might recruit some people
were rather moderate to store joining

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.140
the Taliban to fight back against your
ass
