00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.960
Hey, brother, Ben, it has been a crazy day for the Harry Potter fandom, and in case you missed it

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.160
Let me bring you up to speed. First, J.K Rowling tweeted this: Cry, foe! Run amok! Fa awry! My wand won't tolerate this nonsense.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.120
She then revealed that this otherwise bit of nonsense was an anagram and challenged the internet at large to crack the riddle. As ever the

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.900
internet was over the task and quickly decide for the following phrase which, take a deep breath for it cuz it's awesome

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.260
Harry returns. Won't send the details now. A week off. No comment.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.740
Did you get chills? Bunch of chili bumpkin Horseman right Ben? But like oh?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.349
New Harry Potter? Are you serious?

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.439
Sadly, no. After a few more hints from Rowling,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.840
we learned that the anagram was in reference to the new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. And the answer was finally

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
revealed to be Newt Scamander

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.549
Only meant to stay in New York for a few hours.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.729
I know, it doesn't quite have the same effect, but either way, well-played Rowling. Fun game and interesting tidbit, just

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.489
not as interesting as Harry.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.190
Siriusly

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.780
Case you're wondering. It looks like crazy over there. Which is why we have this different view today. Ben today

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780
I want to speak in defense of my house

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.639
Slytherin.( woop woop)  When I tell people I'm a Slytherin, I'm almost always met with a look of Concern and it's not the J

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.949
I'm a little concerned that you're identifying with the school house

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.229
It's part of a series thats  been over for a couple of years now

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.589
Kind of concerned. Because I totally got it under control. Look at my pants!

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.299
It's more of the "are you evil?" kind of concerned. No, I am not evil. And frankly,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.949
I don't even see where this is coming from. Okay, yes, the greatest Dark wizard of all time was in Slytherin.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.320
But here's the thing, we're not happy about that either. I mean, I'm on Harry's side.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.880
I don't know why the assumption

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.710
is that most Slytherins are on Voldemort's side just because you sat at the same lunch

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.140
Or dinner table of someone in high school or middle school doesn't mean that you owe them any kind of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.009
respect, or

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.629
loyalty or support of any kind for the rest of your life.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.219
I mean, that's ridiculous! Now, to be fair, in the books, the Slytherins do make up the largest majority of Voldemort's followers.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.549
But you have to remember that the books in which Harry Potter takes place only makes up about 20 years or so of all

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.930
Wizarding history. Everything leading up to that point and after that seems to be pretty peaceful.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.170
this means that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.420
Historically there wouldn't really be any natural inclination or reason to dislike Slytherins or any other house other than maybe just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.670
Friendly school rivalry. That said, even in the books there are plenty of Slytherins who are fighting against Voldemort.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.209
Regulus black abandons the death eaters and attempts to destroy a Horcrux.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.460
Horus Slughorn leads reinforcements, including Slytherin students, back into the battle of Hogwarts.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.060
Narcissa Malfoy

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.140
deliberately lies to Voldemort's face about Harry's death to save her son! And the greatest of them all,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.260
Severus Snape

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.740
The best triple agent of all time, gives his life to give Harry the chance to kill the man who killed the woman he loves!

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:57.820
Always

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.820
Always

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.660
Now you might be thinking, okay fine,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.930
There are some good ones

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.239
But it's like Hagrid says, "There ain't a witch or wizard who went bad that weren't in Slytherin."

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.809
And I think it is this line in particular that trips people up because it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.899
opens the door for them to be some good Slytherins, but it protects all other houses. But here's the thing

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.630
Hagrid is wrong. 2 examples in particular come to mind: First, Peter

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.710
"Wormtail" Pettigrew, a

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.710
Gryffindor, who turns on his best friend James Potter, reveals his location to Voldemort,who then proceeds to kill them. And two, Quirinus Quirrell, a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.450
Ravenclaw, who lets Voldemort inhabit his body and helps him almost steal the sorcerer's stone. Now some account to Salazar Slytherin, the man himself's,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.369
desire to only educate Pureblood Wizards as the source of Slytherins bad

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.550
reputation. Fair point. That is not okay. But I think you have to remember that kids are sorted into their houses by an old

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.010
Wizarding hat based on the personality traits

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.100
they have when they are

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.219
11, which may, or probably don't align, with that of a prejudiced old wizard who's been dead for centuries.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170
And I don't think we should hold it against the kids.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.939
But with that said, the house is still named after that crazy old Wizard and Voldemort is a

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.609
descendant of that same Wizard. So maybe the name is not the most appropriate thing ever.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.830
Anyone for house Snape? But a name is only what you make it. And since

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.439
I doubt that we can change the name, it will be up to us

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.200
fellow Slytherins to use your resourcefulness, your ambition, your cunning for the betterment of all and

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.110
redefine what the word and not the name

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.430
Slytherin means.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.840
and if you are not a Slytherin,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.950
ask yourself this: Have you judged someone who is a Slytherin in the past? And is it not that

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.009
exact kind of judgment that is precisely

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.799
why you claim not to like the Slytherin house? Food-for-thought. Ben, my question of the day for you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.310
and everyone else is do you think Slytherin is getting an unfair deal and would you rename the house and if so what? Let me

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.489
know down in the towel section below and I will see you in another life, brother.
