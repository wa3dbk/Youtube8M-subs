Play Doh Magic Swirl Ice Cream Shoppe Food Maker Toy Review by Mike Mozart of TheToyChannel on YouTube

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.290
This is Mike Mozart of "TheToyChannel" and 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.620
"JeepersMedia" on YouTube with the amazing

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.820
Play Doh "Sweet Treats Cafe Magic Swirl Ice Cream Shoppe"

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.080
Hours of pretend ice cream and food treat making fun.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.200
That's a U.S. quarter for scale.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.600
These ice cream treats are like "American Girl Doll" sized.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.070
The large center piece is for extruding the fun

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.460
ice cream treats. The square cut-outs on the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.560
bottom of each one of these ice cream cones 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.830
and ice cream dishes goes over this rotating peg.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.400
It actually spins as it fills to create that wonderful swirl effect.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
The Play Doh ice cream extrusion template has three settings.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.000
This is the one for soft serve ice cream.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.700
The center square cut-out is for easy clean-out

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650
and the one on the other side is for toppings.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.350
Take some of this Play Doh, put it in the top of the extruder.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.500
Now we bring down the lever.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.200
I have to say it requires quite the adult push

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.600
to get that lever to work.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.180
You better have a really stong "Incredible Hulk" like kid. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.450
But the ice cream extrudes pretty nice.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.500
Here comes the ice cream.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
There is a problem....see when you're extruding

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.230
the Play Doh comes out on the side past the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
templates, but don't worry, look how beautiful

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.610
the ice cream is.You have to use your fingers to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.100
guide it into the cone a little bit for perfect cones.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.300
You see how perfect that Play Doh Ice Cream Shoppe cone is if you use your

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000
fingers to guide it just a little bit

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.200
This is a lot of fun with the help of a parent or

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
an older sibling to help push down that handle.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.500
The ice cream comes out beautiful

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.100
Make certain that you nead this dough thoroughly

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.400
before you put it in the ice cream shoppe machine for

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300
much smoother swirls.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.300
This set includes beautiful rainbow sprinkle ice cream Play Doh.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
This fun handle on the side is for adding 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.900
sprinkles to all your treats.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
You put some Play dough, or your sprinkle mix

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.700
inside there and it covers your confection with sprinkles.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.100
This last shoppe station you put toppings on your ice creams.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
It doesn't twirl here, you have to sort of guide it with your fingers. 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.340
Don't forget to top your creations with a bright red Play Doh cherry.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.600
For some reason this glorious Play-Doh ice cream making

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.800
set has a "Cake Makin' Station" here that creates 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.350
it's own candles when you push down on the Cake.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.200
How much fun is this?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.000
Look at all these fun food treats made with these

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100
built in molds, even a little miniature bear.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.100
The pumper and the base are loaded with little 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.400
molds so you can mold all kinds of fruits

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.800
confections, flowers, cherries.It's loaded with fun

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.000
Inexplicably there is a pretzel makin' station on

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.400
this ice cream set, but I love pretzels so it's o.k.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.000
Nom Nom Nom

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.550
I actually think this set is a bargain, but if you 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.000
don't want to blow so much "dough" you could 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.400
buy this cheaper one at Wal-Mart.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
It does everything except extrude the ice cream.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.400
This has a bonus ... you could even make waffle cones in it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.100
It does'nt make swirled ice cream, but it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.900
includes a popsicle mold.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800
 This is a lot of fun, half the price, and has 30% more Play Doh.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.300
I'll do a review of this too. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400
[ Mike Doughzart ] You know you really can't eat

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.300
this stuff, but I'm made of Play Doh so it's O.K.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.500
Nom Nom Nom Nom 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.800
