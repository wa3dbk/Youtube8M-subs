00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:26.390
Laureen: Q: This next question is about preventative
E/M coding with a regular E/M and whether

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.950
or not a modifier is needed.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.500
This reply was actually started by Alicia
so I'm kind of stealing it.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.850
She might jump in and help me a little bit.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.960
From Amanda: Please help me understand how
to properly code for a routine well-woman

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.579
exam (preventative yearly check-up) for an
established patient under 39 years AND a separate

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.649
issue, like depression.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.469
(The primary reason for the visit is the preventative
care, but during the visit the second reason,

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.660
depression is discussed and patient issued
prescription for meds and/or counseling).

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.729
Wouldn't it be 99395, 99213-25?

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.410
I'm SO confused with modifiers.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.430
Thanks for helping.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.250
I just have to say whenever I do this in class
and we talk about preventative visits, I said,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.040
"You know well-visits and the well-baby check,
the well-woman; ever noticed there's never

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040
any well-man?"

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.540
But it's true, we never say that.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.530
Boyd: It feels like it's true on this side
too.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.950
Laureen: Preventative medicine is basically
your not-sick codes.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.450
You're not coming in with a diagnosis because
it's a well-visit, it's a checkup.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.690
But oftentimes, they come in and sometimes
a patient save up a problem that they planned

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.220
on talking about; and other times, it comes
up during the course of the evaluation.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.980
So keep that in mind.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.130
A: Here are a couple of definitions for you
99395 -- Periodic comprehensive preventive

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.030
medicine re evaluation and management of an
individual including an age and gender appropriate

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.270
history, examination, etc.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.040
So, it's important for this, this is not based
on your typical HEM (history, exam, medical

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.180
decision making), it is based on the person's
age and whether they're a new or established

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.340
patient.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.700
Then, for example, if they're just a young
teen or whatever, the physician is going to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.750
start talking and counseling the patient about
STDs and safe sex and all that kind of stuff,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.600
even though they'll swear up and down, "No,
no, no.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.319
I'm not sexually active and I don't plan on
ever being," they will still go over because

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.120
that's just part of what's included in that
comprehensive well-visit, if you will.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.380
A 99213 is an office or other outpatient visit.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.380
Now, for the sake of discussion could be any
regular E/M or HEM-based E/M. She just happened

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.880
to pick a level 3code based on the scenario
that she was trying to code.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.510
Then, modifier-25 is significant, separately
identifiable evaluation and management service

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.820
by the same physician.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.851
So, this comes into play because we have to
almost treat a preventative medicine E/M code

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.930
as a non-E/M code.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.230
If we want to code that in addition to a sick
code -- so we've got a well code and a sick

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.820
code, we're going to need to put that 25 on.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.500
This is my rule; it's how I teach it in class.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.910
Remember Laureen says, "You can't bill an
E/M unless you have a HEM!"

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.350
So, you got your preventative medicine visit
code, that's what they came for, that's what

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.350
is documented.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.130
Now, you're going, "Hmmm, can I bill the regular
E/M too?"

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.770
Well, do you have a HEM?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.879
Do you have a clearly separate documentation
that says a history, an exam, and medical

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.030
decision making was done related to that depression
or whatever the case maybe?

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.030
OK?

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.980
If you don't, then that E/M is more than likely
just bundled into the preventative medicine

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.980
code.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.829
You'll see that if you turn to the Preventative
Medicine section of E/M and you look at the

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.970
guidelines, it will say, if it's something
minor, throw it in.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.040
If it's significant and separate, go ahead
and bill it with a 25.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.350
So, significant and separate, you mentally
want to picture seeing a separate note for

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.490
that problem -- which in this case is depression.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.990
Now, I've heard it in conferences and I think
it's a good advice where consultants have

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.030
instructed offices to literally have separate
notes.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.220
One that is a preventative medicine note,
it's actually headed preventative, and then

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.260
a separate one for the problem visit even
though it happened on the same day.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.450
Keep them truly separate.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.150
Then, if the documentation is separate, it's
very easy to code and bill it separate and

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.000
you protect it in case of an audit.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.260
Alicia, I think you pulled some people on
this; Vanessa, Christina and Diana, right?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.540
Alicia: Yes.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:29.000
Vanessa is a compliance officer for a multi-physician
facility, and Diana she is doing remote, but

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.460
you know what I mean?

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.370
She is coding for several doctors in a company
that she worked for.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.460
They were both able to give some information
about this that I took from there and it's

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.669
exactly like you said.

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.540
It's got to be separate.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.770
And I even gave advice to a podiatrist this
week that he inquired about modifier-25 usage

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.030
and told them like you said make a separate
note.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.270
If you have to turn around and give an injection
that's not what they came in for, make a separate

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.270
note.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:16.349
Then, there's no doubt in anybody's mind that
it wasn't proper usage.
