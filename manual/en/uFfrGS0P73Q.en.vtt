&gt;&gt; ANNOUNCER: From your breaking news and
weather authority, this is 13WHAM News at

00:00:08.357 --> 00:00:09.357
11.

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:11.460
&gt;&gt; ANCHOR: Good evening, I'm Rachel Barnhart.
An RIT graduate who realized his dream of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.691
being a police officer was gunned down in
the line of duty. Tony Wallace was one of

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:22.390
the few hard of hearing officers in the country.
13WHAM's Evan White tells us what happened.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.580
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Authorities say Wallace and his
partner were shot in the small village of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.010
Hoonah, Alaska. Officials are not saying what
sparked the shooting, but say there is a standoff

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.050
that continues at this hour. Meanwhile, Wallace's
Rochester friends are mourning his loss. The

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.890
loss of Tony Wallace has rocked the RIT community,
especially longtime friend Tom Mancarella.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.570
&gt;&gt; TOM MANCARELLA: I was shocked, you know,
very disheartening to hear that, and the first

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.810
people that I thought of were naturally his
daughter, his mom and his father.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.489
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Before leaving for Alaska police
in 2008, Wallace made a name for himself at

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.289
RIT where he was an All-American wrestler.

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:14.279
&gt;&gt; TOM MANCARELLA: Just as big as he was physically,
he was probably 220, his heart was even bigger.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:18.719
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Wallace, who was hard of hearing,
joined campus safety and even taught a class

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.420
on safety and the deaf. 13WHAM News interviewed
Wallace in 2003.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.540
&gt;&gt; TONY WALLACE: I think they did not expect
what we would give them, what we would provide

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.540
for them.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.849
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: When asked how he would remember
his dear friend, Mancarella tells the story

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.119
of their first encounter.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.840
&gt;&gt; TOM MANCARELLA: We met here at RIT. We
were on a traffic post together and it was

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.429
about 95 degrees out, and he was this big
hulk of a man trying to get shade from a light

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.420
pole, and I pulled up and said, 'What are
you doing?' And we talked for 3 hours.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.729
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: RIT President Bill Destler had
this to say about Wallace's death. "In Tony's

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.069
memory, I hope we can find time to appreciate
all the members of law enforcement who put

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.680
their lives at risk for us everyday." Friends
say Wallace was aware of the dangers of becoming

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.290
a police officer but was driven to do it to
no end. A campus memorial is being planned

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.200
at RIT to honor the memory of the Hall of
Fame wrestler and, friends say, a hall of

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.480
fame person, Tony Wallace. Rachel?

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.340
&gt;&gt; ANCHOR: Very sad story. Thank you, Evan.
