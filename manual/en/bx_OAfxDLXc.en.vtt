00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.290
In this video

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.609
I will be making a mini spud gun that shoots bb's 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.700
or anything that fits in the barrel with
power and precision

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.429
I first started by taking an empty
supplement bottle

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.810
that I think would be strong enough to hold the
pressure of the combustion created while firing

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.070
I then drilled a small hole on the cap

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.570
that will make a small straw fit in perfectly. The straws I used 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.900
where about 10 centimeters long and I taped them together

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.510
I didn't want any pressure to escape
anywhere but from the truck maximum

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.050
power

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.910
like distraught to the Catholic issue
since I will be using them

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.490
of Beebe's around that is a small new
demanded

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.490
the bottom this trial prevent the BBC
falling into chambers when loading after

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.260
that

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.180
are at some duct tape around chamber
reinforces defending bad

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.510
that and also for deluxe then I thank
you for reading

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.430
nighter included to the chamber as a
source in English

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.430
and made two holes on the side with the
wires

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.130
after putting the wires in

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.800
gluing them in place you consider when I
press on the igniter

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.210
makes a nice lose straws were a little
bit care

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.740
so at some people straws to make them a
bit straighter

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.360
and also some tape on the bottom up the
ball

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.890
to reinforce it then added

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.890
the red dot sight better aiming and make
it look tactical

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490
after spring some axe in the chamber

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.490
loading it with a BB with ready to shoot
I was surprised to see how powerful

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.490
the BB easily passed through a cardboard
box

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.920
and also through can like that thing was
even there
