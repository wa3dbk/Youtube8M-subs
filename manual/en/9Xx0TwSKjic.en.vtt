00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.049
In this section of freestyle swim--this is
the sixth step. I just finished explaining

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.150
to you about the hands, having them closed,
and the reason you have them closed--now I'm

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.000
going to be showing you the form you'll be
using. So, what you'll be doing is, you want

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.320
to come out of the water, and when you place
your hands into the water, you don't just

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
slap the water. You don't ever just slap the
water. You want to make sure that they come

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.470
in at an angle. So, good example, this is
the water, you want to come in at an angle,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.710
and then reach as far as you can--as far as
your arm can go fully extended--and then you'll

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.620
form an S and pull back, when you're doing
freestyle swim. So, let me show you the other

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.809
side. Hand closed. Always remember, hand closed.
This is what's going to be pulling you towards

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.960
the water. If you wonder why someone's faster
than you, this is definitely one of the main

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.109
reasons why. So, you bring your arm out, your
elbows up. When you reach for the water don't

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.640
slap. Just make sure you come in at a slightly
angle, about a slight forty-five degree angle,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.020
and once you enter the water, then you're
just going to completely stretch. Fully extend

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.490
that arm. But, remember on your shoulders,
not to be moving them side to side, so they're

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.149
just straight. Always keep your shoulders
straight. So you'll stretch full, stretch

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.830
the other one full, and you'll pull back with
each arm. So, that's the sixth step of freestyle

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.500
swimming. All right, for the freestyle there's
some continuation with step six. So, your

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.369
hands are closed, and now--here's the water--instead
of slapping the water, which is what a lot

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.560
of people do, you'll see people swimming,
and they'll slap the water. No, you don't

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.759
want to do that. You actually want to come
in at a slight angle, and you can see how

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.770
my hand reaches all the way, and then pull.
Slight angle--so like this. Now let me show

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.450
you real quick. Watch how my hands go at a
slight angle.
