00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
Hey kids!

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.590
Today we are making macaroni salad.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:10.809
A couple of people have asked for a Hawaiian
style macaroni salad and there are as many

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.839
ways to make macaroni salad as there are ways
to make chili.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:26.710
So all of it is pretty much dependent on your
tastes, as well as where it is that you have

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.000
had your macaroni salad at, you know?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.370
Like, I made the macaroni early this morning.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.100
Zippy's makes theirs really al dente, so it
is very snappy.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.070
If you go to somewhere like Tasty's or some
kind of Korean barbecue, they totally, totally

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.579
overcook theirs until it is really soggy,
kind of.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.820
But what that does it does not absorb the
mayonnaise and stuff, so you know, like I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.920
said, it all depends on your tastes for this.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.610
So, I am following a recipe that I have decided
I am going to try almost every one of the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.620
recipes in this local cookbook.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.650
So it calls for six ounces of uncooked weight
elbow macaroni.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.890
I don't know what that was, I just put in
what I thought that we would eat without a

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.930
whole lot of leftovers.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.970
She has a lot of different things added in
this that we prefer not to have, so I guess

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.970
what I'll do is I'll type the recipe in full,
and then I will just put in the stuff that

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.410
I know we are going to eat.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:54.390
So that was a cup of mayonnaise and oh crap,
here it is, Best Foods.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.520
Best Foods is what it is called west, I believe,
of the Mississippi and east of the Mississippi

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.530
it is called Hellman's.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.790
This is the rest that the macaroni salad is
so good, okay?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.660
It is probably nothing else, it is just the
mayonnaise.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.739
Anyway.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.560
This is a fourth of a teaspoon of sugar, a
fourth of a teaspoon of pepper, which I think

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.299
is actually quite a lot, to tell you the truth,
so I think I'm going to go a little less.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.799
Oh, you know why, I have been using the half
teaspoon, so I put way too much.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.049
Okay.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.049
Half a teaspoon of salt.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.769
So I put too much sugar.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.849
Half a teaspoon of salt.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.610
And, let's get rid of some of that.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.280
We don't need all of it.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.389
And then the last thing it asks for, it did
ask for minced celery and minced onions and

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.740
since I am making this for Scott and it is
his birthday and he doesn't like that kind

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.290
of crap up in it, I do, depending on how I
feel.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.749
The last thing that it is asking for is one
eighth teaspoon of Hondashi.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:16.090
Hondashi is Japanese bonito fish soup base.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.340
I hope that can be seen.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.959
There were go.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.279
It is one eighth of a teaspoon, so I don't
know that that will make an entire difference

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:35.849
in the way that this ends up tasting, but
I went out and got it anyway, because I believe

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.910
it is in a couple of other of the recipes
that I am going to be making from this book.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:50.980
Anyway, you wanted to make sure that the macaroni...you
cook it until it is soft and you drain it

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.829
well and you have to cool it completely.

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.529
When it is not cooled completely, it will
just suck up your mayonnaise.

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:04.349
Anyway, you combine all of this, you mix it
well, and you refrigerate it for four hours

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.599
before serving.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.010
If you have to add more mayonnaise before
you serve it, then there you go.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.780
But yeah, Hawaiian macaroni salad usually
has a lot of mayonnaise and that's what makes

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.320
it taste so good, people.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.590
So there you got, macaroni salad, Hawaiian
style.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.419
Enjoy!
