00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.550
Thank you, Yael, for inviting us to the ecosphere 
 to learn about various animals and plants

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.910
What actually is the ecosphere?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.210
First of all, the ecosphere is a unique structure 
 in the form of a dome as you can see.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.480
It is constructed of glass triangular base units 
 that make up hexagons

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.930
but – we don’t have only hexagons here. 
 If there would be only hexagons - we would have created a hive.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.820
How do we build this round shape?

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.750
We also have some pentagons, creating the shape 
 just like in a soccerball.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.080
If you observe a soccerball, there are both pentagons and hexagons.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.630
The word ecosphere 
 is composed of two words: eco and sphere

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.680
Eco - is the environment, or a home 
 and sphere means a ball - like this building we are in.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.340
Is the ecosphere a greenhouse?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.590
The ecosphere is not a greenhouse 
 although the sun shines in it all the time.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.950
We actually have an air conditioning system 
 that merges the air here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.950
The conditions here in the ecosphere are fixed and controlled.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.110
The temperature here is 25°C 
 and the humidity here is 50-60%

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.740
These conditions are conditions that are suitable 
 for the plants we grow here.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.180
They need the conditions to be like 
 the conditions in their habitat.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.400
This is a Stick Bug.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.180
It doesn’t live here normally; 
 it came here from the East.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.150
The Stick Bug is an insect.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.030
As you see, what does it resemble? 
 - A stick.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.990
It is very similar to a stick, why? 
 - He does it for camouflage.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.470
For camouflage. Who could devour him? 
 - Larger animals.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.990
Correct! Larger animals such as birds of prey can devour them.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.640
So in order to protect from predators, 
 he disguises himself.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.400
äIt can change its color to green as well? 
 - Er ... No -

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.400
This insect does not change its color, 
 its color varies during its life.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.260
But it does not change like a chameleon 
 you know that changes colors.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.700
This is its adult color.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.970
But, as you see, is very - very similar to these branches. 
 It is brown.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.370
It also feels – Here, you can touch it 
 – like a stick 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.490
Yes, it's rough like a stick.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.430
Sometimes, as you see, they do not stand. 
 They don’t walk around, the just stand on the branches

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.400
without moving – so that their predators do not see them.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.810
Hey, Yael, you found one that isn’t moving 
 - very nice! Very nice! You see how it is similar to the stick here?

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.840
Wow, it is really disguises itself, and a bird flying above

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.400
cannot see it!

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.000
If he escapes from the ecosphere can it live outside?

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.180
It probably would not survive 
 - out here he has a lot of enemies.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.310
Here in Israel we have a different stick garden bug you probably know. 
 It is small and green.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.960
It's a different kind of stick bug that lives here.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.730
He cannot live here in the wild.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.000
What does it eat?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.430
This kind of stick bug is very picky 
 – it eats rose leaves…
 
00:03:47.51,00:03:50.78
Rose leaves, eucalyptus, raspberries

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.990
But it is vegetarian, not a predator.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.910
As you can see, 
 he has no wings so he can’t fly

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.580
He doesn’t have jumping legs so he does not jump 
 like grasshoppers for example.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.010
Here we have different types of carnivorous plants.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.690
Oh .. Where do carnivorous plants come from?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.930
Carnivorous plants come from ... 
 especially from tropical areas of the world

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.770
They can also be found in Eastern Europe - in different places.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.790
Does Israel have carnivorous plants?

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.980
Israel too has carnivorous plants. One of them is called the floating bladderwort.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.070
It is a water plant, and is a carnivorous plant. 
 But these plants do not grow wild in Israel.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.170
Are they always so small or do they have larger size than those?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.360
These plants, here you see them small 
 but they can grow to a larger size.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.930
People are much stronger than carnivorous plants 
 so that even if you put your finger, you can easily take it out.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.390
A small and delicate insect can’t escape.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.280
Do all of them have the same method to devour?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.820
No, each one here has a different method. 
 Let's explain it.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.670
This plant is called the Venus Flytrap.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.660
It’s snare is actually a close trap as you can see, 
 its leaves are in the form of a mouth.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.860
It has teeth (spikes) in this “mouth”, 
 on each side there are three hairs.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.460
These hairs are sensory hairs, 
 they can feel motion.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.800
If a small insect, for example a small ant, comes, 
 it thinks it has a good meal inside.
 
00:05:22.08,00:05:25.62
She enters, these hairs sense the movement.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.680
Then - the plant closes these leaves.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.630
After a while, the plant does not chew the ant, 
 it has no teeth.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.750
It actually secretes substances. 
 It secretes proteins, enzymes, acids

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.990
like the acids we have in our saliva and our stomach 
 that help us digest food.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.740
So this plant secretes these substances 
 and they break down the insect

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.280
and it absorbs the ingredients it needs. 
 So this is a closing trap.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.030
This plant is called a sundew. 
 If you observe it well, you'll see that it has

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.790
kind of dew drops. 
 These dew drops are actually very, very strong glue.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.940
And that is its trap: 
 insects that come to the plant

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.470
stick to it. They start to panic and move around.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.270
Gradually they become entangled and the plant closes on them 
 like this

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.630
and then devours them: it secretes the same substances 
 that decompose and digest the insect.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.970
This plant has a different kind of trap. 
 It is called Sarracenia.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.950
The trap here is a falling trap.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.750
Insects, especially flying insects 
 go inside

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.350
it gives off a very very nice odor 
 and they think that there is food insite.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.070
They go inside, and at the bottom of this trumpet 
 there is a small pool.,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.420
In this pool, the ... insects fall 
 and fail to get out.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.270
Then, again, the same materials digest them.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.790
This lid does not close 
 but it prevents the insect from exiting the flower.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.390
(This lid also prevents the entry of rain into the flower.)

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.030
That was amazing! Thank you for letting us visit here! 
 - It was my pleasure!
