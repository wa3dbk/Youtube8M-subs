"This place has known magic.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.600
Very dark.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.900
Very powerful.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.030
This time I cannot hope but destroy it alone."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.100
"Times like these.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.640
Dark times.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.210
It can bring people together."

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.360
"Take my hand."

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.550
"They can tear them apart."

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.920
"These girls - they're gonna kill me, Harry."

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.630
THIS YEAR

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.080
"Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission."

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.130
EVIL WILL PASS THROUGH

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.910
FROM THEIR WORLD

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.870
IN TO OUR OWN

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.640
"These are mad times we live in, mad!"

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.540
AND THE DARKEST HOUR

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.440
"This is beyond anything I imagined."

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.790
IS UPON US ALL

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.280
"In my life I have seen things that are truly horrific.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.610
Now I know you'll see worse."

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.160
"You're the chosen one, Harry."

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.700
"You have to realise who you are!"

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.700
"Without you would leave the fate of our world to chance."

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.670
"You have no choice."

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.020
"Harry, no!"

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.190
"You must not fail."

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.790
"It's over."

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.600
FROM WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.480
"Ginny!"

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.480
"I have to do this!"

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.860
"Fight back, you coward!

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.320
Fight back!"
