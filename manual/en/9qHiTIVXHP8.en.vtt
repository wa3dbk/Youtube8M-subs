00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.059
the republic governors asked for that
change it actually makes it

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.970
you know how obama is it makes it more i
think the wit

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.200
requires a better work requirement and
which i don't oppose to satisfy right

thanks at

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.070

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.440
backpacker effect itself that is true
and cheap is being sent back genes in

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.109
china

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.470
because this sign them

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.240
in china they're not moving them from
the u_s_ their ac getting rid of any

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.810
jobs here if i get out of jobs

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.000
so it's too early that resisting it
peace ronnie is like

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.980
all i am the savior of although it is

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.430
but

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.430
that way if you are the same time us and
let me go bankrupt

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.930
is not remotely true

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.430
and you know what

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.780
big papa joe biden has had an over this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.049
go head to regulate

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.270
in the last hours of this campaign

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.869
if you could believe it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.330
there are running the most scurrilous
had no higher

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.230
will be in a system which in this

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.010
almost flagrantly this town is and like
in every member of mine political career

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.049
said so dot says so in general

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.250
serotonin

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.130
bought so now as a just job im

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.260
it is in fact the fact checkers it is in
fact those companies themselves puller

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.940
fact rated the ronnie had

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.270
pants on

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.320
info way go

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.079
and of you know this that means it's a
really really big ally you might want to

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.380
japan soft

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.229
because you get all burned

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.879
which by the way would be unfortunate
with republicans that off into some

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.470
trouble so then let's go to actual
companies now korva communications

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.059
had a chrysler says quote

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.349
less of the record straight jeep has no
intention of shifting production of its

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.729
cheap models out of north america to
china

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.049
in other words and of this

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.569
what ron you say is not true at all now
this is very unusual companies away end

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.619
of week before an election a seller
except they're using these companies

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.779
they're lying about these companies so
they said well i gotta set the record

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.399
straight in fact here's greg martin and
general motors spokesman because in the

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.130
latest the radio ad ronnie had inclusion
tomatoes along with chrysler sis

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.259
that is cynical campaign politics at its
worst

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:52.169
bereft of any

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:57.709
fundamental understanding of a global
all import of industry our love them

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.339
this is look below

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.929
all global manufacturers whether general
motors ford chrysler or v_w_

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.649
build historically in the markets which
we sell

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:10.859
so in other words your dumbass we make
the jeeps in china that we sell to china

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.129
we make a james that we sell to america
in

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.230
america uh... birthday

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.830
we didn't change any of that that's
always a weight is in fact he should be

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.549
really happy

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.800
all these different american companies
are going at

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.819
their sales are growing at ten thirteen
fourteen percent

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.889
and now we're selling american cars in
china that that's not a bad thing it's a

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.709
great day as long as one of moving the
jobs are brought and we are not

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.999
rotated through that wasn't clear it up

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.279
the gentle uma resposta rescind
continues quote

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:44.019
with cooley entered some parallel
universe during these last few days

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.480
no amount of campaign politics in a
cynical worse

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.589
will diminish

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:51.569
a record of creating jobs in the u_s_
and repatriating profits back to this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.809
country

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.530
they just call them out for living in a
parallel universe

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.059
with the facts don't matter

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.169
and they nailed 'cause that's exactly
what the republic's too

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.059
and when challenged on this of course
they all said and med

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.719
giant said that uh... you know the side
up

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.209
but are not

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.919
all right and it was asked about it
today is why it was a bad a lot of comes

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.149
iowa delirium agassi while you're in
favor of it what i have it

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:28.439
wait wait wait wait

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.900
but

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.899
all right

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.210
the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.330
what we really have to deal with these
guys for six more days
