00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.860
When I wear a flower crown I feel like a springtime
princess, not only does it make any outfit

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.270
girly and beautiful, flower crowns are just
really flattering and a perfect accessory

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.570
to any selfie or photoshoot.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.739
Imagine yourself playing in the garden with
a flower crown on.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.390
That's perfume commercial material isn't it
:)?

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.750
Today I'll be teaching you how to make this
beautiful flower crown

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.570
Let's get started!

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.570
You'll need

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.610
Bunches of fake flowers that you want to use
for the flower crown.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.890
I like to have a variation of maximum 5 flowers
on rotation in complimentary colors.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.090
Thick green ribbon, mine was a see through
type (2-3cm wide and at least 3 meters)

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.640
A pair wire cutters (my plyers had wire cutters)
A pair of scissors and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.630
Pipe cleaners or thin bendable wire, with
enough length to go around the circumference

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.830
of your head.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
Step 1.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.070
prepare your flowers

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.580
Start off by using your wire cutters and scissors
trim off all your flowers, leaving a 4-5cm

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.320
"stalk" that you will be using later to attach
to your base.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.040
Trim off any bits of leaves to reveal the
stalk if you need to.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.810
Usually the stalks are made of wire, which
is why you need wire cutters.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.720
Sometimes you can cut off the tip of the bunch
and slide your separate parts out first before

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.920
you separate, this makes things a bit easier.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.360
Step 2 create your base

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.520
Take your wire or pipe cleaners and shape
the pipe cleaner around your head and twist

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.810
to close this is the base of your crown.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.649
You want to make sure you get the circumference
of where you want it to sit.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.970
I like my headband to sit towards the middle
of my head on a diagonal, so I made it a bit

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.530
bigger than just the circumference.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.580
You can put it together and test it until
you are happy with it.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.130
Step 3 Put it all together

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.039
Before you start, work out the order you want
to start attaching your flowers in.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.770
Then, start off by leaving a tail and start
attaching your flowers to your base by wrapping

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.760
your ribbon tightly around your wire base
and the stalk or your flower.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.890
Do this 2-3 times to secure it tightly.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.200
Doing this loosely will mean your flowers
will fall off.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.481
You don't need to get this right first go
so practise this a few times before you do

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:27.280
the real thing.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.819
Continue adding and wrapping alternating your
flowers in the order you previously decided.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:44.790
I added these small white flowers to break
up the rose pattern and add some variation.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:58.200
Your flower crown will start to form as you
keep wrapping and adding flowers.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.019
A tip is to add them close together in the
same angle so your crown looks full and thick.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.700
Sparse flowers don't look good.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.659
If you want to get creative you can also add
leaves or other bits that you like, but try

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.010
it first as sometimes adding too much can
make it too bulky to wear.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.340
Use smaller flowers if you want a thinner
crown and bigger flowers for a thicker fuller

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
crown.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.380
Keep wrapping tightly using your thumb to
keep the tension as you go, till you get all

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.780
the way around.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.829
The end will be tricky as you want to wrap
it so that you are leaving no gaps between

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.829
your flowers.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.109
This is a bit fiddly, but not too difficult.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:49.370
Once you have covered your whole base you
can tie up your ribbon with the tail you left

00:03:49.370 --> 00:04:00.950
and you can choose to trim it or leave it
flowing like I did.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.989
And now we're done!

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.359
You now have a cute flower crown that will
make any girly outfit shine.

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.780
You can also make a variety of styles and
colors so you can match them to your outfits

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.129
. I love wearing them to add interest to my
videos and photos and they are a perfect accessory

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.410
to wear to high tea or a picnic!

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.030
Don't forget to wear this accessory with a
smile!

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.030
What is your favourite flower?

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.640
I really love frangipanis because of their
fragrant smell and simple beauty!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.340
