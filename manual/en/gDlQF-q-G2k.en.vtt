cars.com auto reviews

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.950
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com we're at the 2011 Detroit Auto Show checking out

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.870
the redesigned

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.460
Volkswagen Passat it's gonna be a lot
more accessible because it's cheaper

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.150
than the old one by about six or seven
thousand dollars Volkswagen says

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.220
it helps to make it to family car
shoppers less

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.849
alongside cars like the Toyota Camry and
the Honda Accord will take you through

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.349
everything that's different

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.390
the sort of glaring headlights and
downward slope to the grill

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.330
this was a little bit like the Honda
Accord actually it also looks a lot like

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.329
volkswagens

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.800
redesigned Jetta Sedan not necessarily a
bad thing is that an upside both are

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.120
pretty sharp looking cars the Passat is
a lot bigger

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.690
about 10 inches longer overall at about
four inches longer

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.719
then its predecessor Passat in back

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.780
see a lot of similarities with sedans
from outie

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.620
again not necessarily a bad thing
overall pretty clean pretty sharp design

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.119
cabins been completely redone it's
simpler

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.930
little more angular then the preceding
Passat York have

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.160
swooping angles qualities okay it's not
necessarily as good as the outgoing

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.830
South that's what happens when you make
a car

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.590
a this much less expensive and more
accessible seal is a few things you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.429
don't have things like

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.709
your ratcheting up armrest here that was
height adjustable or

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.590
upholstered B&amp;C pillars but i wanna show
you how much room there is nothing

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.090
this is where I would sit to drive I'm
about six feet tall

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.050
this is where maybe an NBA player would
set to drive

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.060
and this is like where

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.550
Andre the Giant what's it to drive that
is it on a broom

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.340
sum up SI's might also be able a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.830
fed back here that's where I'd have to
see to drive as you can see the six or

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.420
eight inches here before my knees are
gonna have to front seatbacks

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.679
um just tons receipts incisive high off
the ground

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.140
and I've got this and had her just
really exceptional in all directions

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.170
because the Camry both start under
twenty two thousand dollars

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.689
and so besides the price point with put
it right in the thick of things

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.520
can make up lost ground Volkswagen well
when it goes on sale this summer

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.709
I think there is some potential way for
more car-related new Skoda cars dot com

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.620
or block

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.050
