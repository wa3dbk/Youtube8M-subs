00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.060
Can we produce handbags
from garbage? These women can!

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.000
And they are very beautiful,
stylish and trendy bags.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.320
The women living in Ayvalık, a district
of Balıkesir, give life to different

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.700
kinds of packaging and other materials
that would otherwise be thrown away.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.600
They are called "Garbage Lady".

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.250
In the fall of 2009, when Sabancı
Foundation Changemakers program

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.600
first visited the center of
Garbage Lady in Ayvalık,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.900
Tara Hopkins presented with enthusiasm

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.450
her social entrepreneurship project
targeting the women in the district.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.350
It has been nearly 3 years since Tara
Hopkins shared her work on the Sabancı
Foundation Changemakers program.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.600
Since then, women in Ayvalık continued
to work, to produce and succeed.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.300
New products such as aprons were produced

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.050
as well as the famous handbags.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.580
Their reputation exceeded the country.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.520
The Garbage Lady bags are now sold
in the Netherlands, the United States,
Spain and Germany.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.800
Having started with 50 women
employees, the Garbage Lady project

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.240
has now reached 600 women.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.720
The Garbage Lady team was
invited to Moldova

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.300
to deliver training as part of
a civil society project in which

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.220
disabled children and their
mothers will produce handbags.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.020
- People ask us: "How do you
measure your success?"

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.080
These women are more self-confident now.
You cannot gauge the amount of success.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.900
But they feel better.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.200
It is very difficult
to show the difference,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.000
But some of these 60 women
can be good examples.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.480
They used to be more timid before.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.580
Now they can stand on their own two feet.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.880
Last year, Garbage Lady
was selected as the best

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.160
social entrepreneurship project 
n Turkey by the United Nations.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.900
Until now, they have sold 10.000
products, 8000 of which are handbags.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.920
The women earn 700-800 TL per month

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.630
in return for the handbags they produce.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.420
However, the difference she has made
in the lives of other women is priceless.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.120
- A woman is earning money for the
first time in her life. It is the most
beautiful and difficult achievement.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.200
We pay them at the beginning of each month.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.360
When we first pay a newcomer,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.150
we thank and congratulate her.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.380
Then everybody starts to cry
without any exception.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.600
It is an unbelievable feeling.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.250
A woman who is 40 or 50 years
old is earning money

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.120
for the first time in her life.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.480
It is incredible to see and feel it.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.860
When Tara Hopkins and her business
partner Melih Özsöz first
established Garbage Lady years ago,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.360
their purpose was to make a difference
in the life of these women in Ayvalık.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.240
They put their hearts in this
purpose and made a difference

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.040
in these women's lives who wanted
to stand on their own two feet.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.940
- Garbage Lady is a place,
a platform for them.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.550
Normally they don't have such a place.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.000
It is something that you
cannot buy with money.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.940
Now they own this place and they
fill it with their hearts and souls.
