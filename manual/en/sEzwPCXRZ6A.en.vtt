00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.150
One of the ways a man steps up to be a patriarch
is by beginning to use his experience and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.090
his influence to have an impact beyond his
family.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.230
He wants to leave a mark on his world.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.400
I want to tell you about a friend of mine.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.630
A man who became a mentor.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.300
A man who I think of as a spiritual patriarch.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.610
He was my boss for more than thirty years.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.480
The co-founder and president of what was then
known as Campus Crusade for Christ.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.160
Today it's simply known as Cru.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.210
His name was Dr. Bill Bright.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.750
Bill was in his 20's living in California
and had just launched a growing candy business

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.300
called "Bright's Delights" when he came to
a spiritual turning point in his life.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.560
He went from being a self described happy
pagan to becoming a follower.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.320
A committed follower of Jesus Christ.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.539
In fact He took his commitment to Jesus so
seriously, he and his wife Vonette both signed

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.250
a written contract pledging they would become
bond servants of Jesus Christ for the rest

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.860
of their lives.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
They would do whatever he wanted them to do
with their lives.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
Bill lived his life with a singular purpose.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.790
He wanted men and women around the world to
know Jesus Christ and to experience the same

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.520
spiritual transformation he experienced.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.780
In 1996, Bill was awarded the Templeton prize,
which honors a person who is, what the late

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.520
Sir John Templeton calls entrepreneurs of
the spirit, outstanding individuals who had

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.479
devoted their talents to expanding our vision
of human purpose and ultimate reality.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.000
The award comes with a cash prize of one point
one million dollars.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.170
You know what Bill Bright did what that money?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.290
He held the check for just a moment, so he
could say he had once been a millionaire,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.810
and then he signed the check over to promote
the benefits of fasting and prayer around

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.530
the world.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.320
There was bible that Bill had commemorating
his award for the Templeton Prize.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.819
He gave me this Bible and he wrote in it a
couple years later the following statement.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.580
Now as I read this, what I want you to hear
is how an older man's belief is being passed

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.150
on to a younger guy and how meaningful it
is to me today.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:38.470
My dear Dennis, beloved friend, you are are
a key player in the greatest spiritual harvest

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.400
in history.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.879
The family is the major pillar of the foundation
of society.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.910
You and Family Life are without peer in emphasizing
the importance of the family.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.690
The truths contained on these pages, including
the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule are

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.909
divine answers to every problem of human kind.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:08.940
I rejoice and give thanks with you to our
great God and savior for his unprecedented

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.340
blessings.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.200
On the presentation page, he signed it to
Dennis Remy from Bill Bright, with deep gratitude

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.849
of Christ's great love, January 17th, 1999.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.940
In a phone call a few years later, in fact
on May 24th, 2003, just a few months before

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.620
his death.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:38.019
Bill quoted to me his favorite verse, Galacians
two twenty: "I have been crucified with Christ.

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.160
And I no longer live, but Christ lives in
me.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.230
The life I live in the body, I live by faith
in the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.069
for me."

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.080
That's how Bill Bright lived and that is how
he died.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.569
Bill Bright's life was focused on advancing
the cause of Christ in our world.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.159
From the very beginning he was a leader and
influencer of men.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:11.379
At the time of his death in the summer of
2003, he was known around the world as an

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.220
ambassador for Jesus Christ.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.580
A true, spiritual patriarch.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.549
Most of us will not be called on by god to
give leadership to a large ministry that has

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.620
global impact.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.880
But I think god calls every man to ask the
question "How can I use my gifts to advance

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.620
the kingdom of God in my community and in
my world?"

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.800
The question for us is, how will we respond
to that call?
