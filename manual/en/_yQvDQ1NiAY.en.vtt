00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:03.557
- Okay, the first thing
we do is we apply alcohol

00:00:03.557 --> 00:00:06.036
to our hands, that way we
can kill all the bacteria

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:07.554
that we might have in our hands

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:10.061
that might affect the grafting.

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:13.978
And second, we apply
alcohol in a little napkin

00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:21.491
and after we do this,
we're gonna cut the grafts.

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:28.359
For this one, we're gonna
be doing a cleft graft

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.192
which is done in a V, in a V form.

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.633
And this is done both for
the root stock and the sand,

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:43.843
the reason why we do
this is because it gives

00:00:44.872 --> 00:00:48.712
us more surface area to work
with whenever we're grafting.

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:52.879
That way the both plants get
to touch a little bit more.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:58.711
So for this one, we go ahead
and take off the little axis,

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:02.234
think we have.

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.110
Something like that.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.693
You can narrow this
down a little bit more.

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.239
Which we get here to fit, so might have,

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.656
make a little slit down here.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.133
Once they're touching, we get the Parafilm

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.529
and we go around it.

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:55.258
The reason why we use
this Parafilm is because

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:58.647
it helps us keep oxygen out of the cuts

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:02.480
and that way they can
survive and grow as one.

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:14.239
Go around there.

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:48.047
And once we see that we have enough for it

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:52.214
to keep the oxygen out, just
go ahead and cut it off.

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:58.752
You get two tags, except for this one we

00:02:58.752 --> 00:03:01.169
could just add black into it.

00:03:11.037 --> 00:03:14.954
And there we go and that's
how you make grafts.
