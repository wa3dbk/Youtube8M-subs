00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.569
In this section, now that we got the wheel
off, we're going to take it over here and

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:16.699
put it on a little work area.
So, now we can check out the wheel, make sure

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.380
nothing's, you know, super bent or anything,
check the rotor, make sure it doesn't look

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.609
bent or, you know, what you like to do is
run your fingernail across it and if you run

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.550
your fingernail across it and your fingernail
is, is actually falling into little divots

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
in there, then the rotor's bad. Because what's
happening is little pieces of dirt and rocks

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.710
and everything are getting in there and it's
grinding these grooves in there, and that's

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.120
going just cause heat and friction and it's
just not good for brakes. So, these ones look

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.310
pretty good, but we're going to go ahead and
replace them. We're just going to take these

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:09.290
off real quick and get them switched out.
Now you got to be really careful because when

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.790
you work with the front brakes, when you work
with rotors on any motorcycles I've come to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.630
see that the bolts right here are really temperamental.
You don't want to torque them real hard or

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.862
anything, because they do tend to strip out
really easy. So you just want to kind of get

00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:32.660
in there and wiggle it loose. Just like that.
Because, if, if you're unbalanced wand you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.040
just yank on it, you can strip it out and
you're never getting that thing out. So I,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.510
I like to just go around and get them all
loose. Just so I know I'm not going to have

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:57.659
any problems with any of them, and
normally when you work on bikes, unless it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.799
comes to like internal parts or anything,
I, I use all hand tools. Just do it all by

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.979
hand, just start, because a lot of the bikes
are aluminum and you start using air tools

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.069
and stuff, you're, you're going to strip something
out. So just try to keep it to just hand tools,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:25.230
unless you really know what you're doing.
And

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.500
then, bam, that's the old rotor right there.
So, we'll just get ones that are, now you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.300
have a couple options when it comes to rotors.
You could either get the same factory replacement,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.720
which would be something just like this, or
you could step it up to a, you know, Wave

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.880
Rotor, or a Cross Drilled Slotted Rotor, lighter
rotors, a lot of different companies out there

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.680
make, and specialize in brake rotors for bikes.
Because this is very important on the bike.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.950
In this case, we're just going to switch them
out with some factory-style rotors and what

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.430
you're going to need is basically the new
rotor and you're going to need LocTite and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.090
in this case, we're going to use blue LocTite,
and that's pretty much all you're going to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.980
need to do a rotor change.
