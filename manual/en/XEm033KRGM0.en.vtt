00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.533
- HAPPY SEASON 11, EVERYBODY.

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.366
[cheers and applause]

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.966
IT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.966
THIS IS OUR FIRST SHOW
OF OUR BRAND-NEW SEASON,

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.700
AND I HAVE A PROMISE FOR YOU
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.900
RIGHT UP FRONT,
I'M GONNA SAY IT.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.033
THIS SEASON, I'M GONNA WORK IT
WHILE I TWERK IT.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.700
[cheers and applause]

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.633
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.700
AH, DID YOU HAVE A GOOD SUMMER,
EVERYBODY?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.400
GOOD SUMMER, YEAH?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
GREAT.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.866
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.333
[laughter]

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.033
ALL RIGHT, MY TURN.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.500
I HAD A GREAT SUMMER.
I HAD A WONDERFUL SUMMER.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900
I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO BE BACK, THOUGH.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.266
BUT I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF SUN.
I RELAXED.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.500
I READ A LOT OF SANGRIA RECIPES.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.066
AND I WENT
TO TWO DIFFERENT WEDDINGS,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.233
WHICH ARE ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:48.966
I LOVE WEDDINGS.
MY BROTHER GOT MARRIED.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.466
MY BROTHER, VANCE, GOT MARRIED,

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:54.500
AND THIS IS, UM, HIM.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
THAT'S THEM.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.000
WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200
AND IT WAS A SURPRISE
FOR EVERYBODY,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.566
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW--
10, 12 YEARS.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.500
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
A LONG TIME, SO...

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.700
I FORGET HER NAME,
BUT SHE IS A LOVELY WOMAN.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.033
STARTS WITH AN R OR A Q,
BUT SHE IS SO SWEET.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:16.000
SHE'S, UH--NO, IT'S JOANN,
AND I LOVE JOANN,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.300
SO SHE'S MY SISTER-IN-LAW,
AND THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.400
I'M SO HAPPY FOR THEM,
AND IT WAS FANTASTIC,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.666
AND WE DANCED FOR HOURS
ALL NIGHT LONG.

00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.700
THIS IS A PHOTO I BROUGHT
OF PORSH AND I DANCING.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.933
AND IT WAS--I KNOW.

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.433
I KNOW.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.933
I HAVE TO PHOTO CROP HER--
I DON'T KNOW WHO--

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.566
[laughter]

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.866
I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.166
BUT IT LOOKS ROMANTIC.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.800
WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING, "DO I HAVE
BROCCOLI IN MY TEETH?"

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.066
"NO, DO YOU HAVE"--

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.400
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BROCCOLI.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.433
SO THAT WAS
MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:46.466
AND THEN WE WENT TO--

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.000
MY FRIEND JIMMY KIMMEL
GOT MARRIED,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.500
SO WE WENT TO JIMMY'S WEDDING.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.166
[cheers and applause]

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.400
THEY GOT MARRIED THE SAME PLACE
MY BROTHER GOT MARRIED.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.433
THEY GOT MARRIED
AT THE OJAI VALLEY INN.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.200
AND THAT'S MOLLY, OF COURSE.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.633
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, OJAI.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:02.433
LET'S PAN OUT, IF WE CAN.

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:03.966
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW PRETTY IT IS.

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.266
OH, THERE SHE IS AGAIN.

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:10.600
HOW DID SHE GET--BOTH WEDDINGS.
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.766
WE HAD A GREAT TIME
AT THAT WEDDING AS WELL.

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.466
WE HUNG OUT WITH OUR FRIENDS
JEN AND JUSTIN,

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.766
AND SO THEY WERE...

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:19.100
[cheers and applause]

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.100
NOW...

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.833
NOBODY WAS IMPRESSED.
THAT WAS OUR TABLE CARD.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.200
I PULLED IT OUT OF JEN'S EAR,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.766
AND NO ONE WAS IMPRESSED
AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD'VE BEEN.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.733
I WENT THE HAMPTONS,
AND I HAD FUN IN THE HAMPTONS.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.466
I DID SOME DANCING
AND SOME SINGING.

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.366
HERE I AM WITH JAMIE FOXX
AND PHARRELL RIGHT THERE.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.600
[cheers and applause]

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
YEP.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.133
THAT'S ME IN THE MIDDLE.

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.333
AND...

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.600
WE WERE SINGING PHARRELL'S
HIT SONG "GET LUCKY."

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.866
AND THEY WERE ALL UP ALL NIGHT
TO GET LUCKY.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:51.400
I WENT TO BED AROUND 8:30, SO...

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.633
AND I ALSO--IT WAS
A STAR-STUDDED SUMMER.

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:54.733
I HUNG OUT WITH OPRAH,

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:56.700
BECAUSE I MOVED
INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD--

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.066
I'M RIGHT DOWN THE STREET
FROM WHERE OPRAH LIVES,

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.600
AND SHE KNEW THAT I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.833
SHE WAS SO NICE, SHE BROUGHT
OVER A BEAUTIFUL BASKET

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.666
OF, LIKE, FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
FROM HER GARDEN.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.333
AND THAT'S HER BRINGING US--

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.366
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
BAD ABOUT OPRAH,

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:10.433
BUT WHEN I EMPTIED THE BASKET,

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:14.233
I FOUND A TRADER JOE'S RECEIPT
AT THE BOTTOM.

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:16.566
SO I WAS LIKE,
"OH, I WANT TO SEE THE GARDEN."

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:19.000
SHE GOES, "NOT TODAY."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.800
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS A GARDEN.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.500
IT'S GREAT TO BE FRIENDS WITH
OPRAH, NEIGHBORS WITH OPRAH.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500
IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.433
ONE DAY SHE CAME OVER,
SHE DID MY HAIR,

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.166
WHICH WAS REALLY SWEET OF HER,
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.100
THANKS, OPRAH.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.100
[cheers and applause]
