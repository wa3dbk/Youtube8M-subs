00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:13.091
Straight and low stance, change of hight and speed of movements,

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:16.157
kicks with legs, energy outbursts --

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:19.528
and 45 people that attentively watch every move and word

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:23.099
of Master Fu Nengbin, a 12th generation

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.817
successor of chen style taijiquan.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.415
Moja dlan je hitrejša od roke..

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.944
in vse skupaj se giblje ... skupaj, takole..

00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:36.353
ne, da gredo vsi deli naenkrat...

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:40.962
giblješ se sproščeno, vsi zglobi se premikajo...

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.231
Taijiquan combines movements, relaxation of the body,

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:47.567
concentration of the mind, flow of inner energy

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:52.355
and breathing. And what is most important?

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:57.104
Master Fu: (...in Chinese)

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.847
The most important are teachers,

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:04.179
talents and practice -- so, hard practice.

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:09.383
We practice the forms with persistence to obtain correct method,

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:13.298
relax the body and feel strong dantien --

00:01:13.298 --> 00:01:17.304
the center of inner energy, bellow the navel.

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:21.439
..Ok! Tukaj je yang, tukaj yin...

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.855
Tu se sprostimo... in tu...

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:27.910
...dantjen, to je 'š' (kitaj.); imamo 'ši' in 'š'.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:31.326
Večja teža je tu... in tule manjša.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.487
That teachers are important, we can see from Isabelle,

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:40.226
who came for the seminar from France.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.178
She started taiji after she had got some injuries and stopped aikido.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.277
In chen style we can find two ways:

00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:56.062
The first is healthy - which attracted me in the first place;

00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:01.091
the style is soft, slow and it also includes Chinese medicine.

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:04.369
The second is martial art.

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:09.506
Tu naredimo takole...

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:13.352
In ko nas kdo zagrabi, naredimo enako -

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:17.604
in tudi v figuri 'Budove dlani' naredimo tako --

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:21.082
ne dvigujemo se navzgor.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.404
In ko naredimo tole... daj, še ti naredi..

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.217
če se dvigujem, je tole - zdaj pa še enkrat..

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:37.366
no, zopet...

00:02:39.244 --> 00:02:44.060
ostanem odprt, telo ne gre navzgor...

00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:47.934
moje roke ostanejo odprte in telo spuščeno...

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:51.231
kolke moramo sprostiti...

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:55.438
če jih ne moremo - in gre qi (či) navzgor..

00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:59.538
potem ne moremo obstati (vkoreninjeni).

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:05.799
Če pa ohranimo qi v dantjenu.. lahko kadim, pijem...

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:08.773
Daj..

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:14.894
Potisni!

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:25.224
(Isabelle) Master Fu is my teacher because

00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.870
he is really excellent and in his teaching he combines both aspects.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.600
He emphasizes relaxed body and mind and upright posture

00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:34.647
which we often forget in our stressful life.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:39.126
When you look at him, his body speaks by itself.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:43.701
Master Fu also masters martial aspect of taijiquan - it is very dynamic

00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:46.415
and it also gives importance to breathing.

00:03:46.415 --> 00:03:48.109
According to him, breathing and relaxation provide

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.804
an opportunity for increasing inner energy

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:54.285
with which we perform martial applications;

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:57.953
it is also good for the body.

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.391
..kot kača...

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:08.617
...a nekateri ljudje, ko to vidijo

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:11.605
na računalniku ali DVD-jih in želijo posnemati...

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:17.220
in potem naredijo takole...

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:18.550
qi

00:04:19.027 --> 00:04:22.464
qi gre navznen, jing (sila) je zunaj...

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:28.441
Can this art of moving be performed by anyone?

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:30.892
Master Fu: In taijiquan

00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:36.019
there are no limitations; regarding age, sex or colour of the skin.

00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:39.868
Anybody can practice it and it helps to all.

00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:43.995
The only condition is that practice is correct.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:08.879
A forty-three years old Chinese guest has been practicing

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.177
this art for more than twenty years.

00:05:13.177 --> 00:05:16.089
And which style or form he likes the most? (in Chinese..)

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:21.119
Undoubtedly chen taijiquan, because with it my body has become stronger,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.971
I easily perform my obligations and face the stress that life brings.

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:29.475
Chen style is very important in my life.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.920
I have a very good teacher, Master Chen Zhenglei.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.143
Because I am his close disciple, it is also my duty

00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:39.674
to teach and distribute chen taijiquan.

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:47.410
So, there is also a social obligation and not only personal benefits ok knowing the art.
