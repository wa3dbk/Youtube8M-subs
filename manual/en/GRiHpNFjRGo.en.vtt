Motorola DS9208 Product Review POSGuys.com

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.270
Hi, this is Camille with POSGuys.com
Today we're reviewing the Motorola DS9208

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.400
omni-directional hands-free presentation imager.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.750
This is the upgrade to the LS9208, and it
has

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.660
some improved features which include not only
the ability to read 1D barcodes, but also

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.710
the
ability to read 2D barcodes, and to be able

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.230
to
read off cell phones.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.570
Some improvements on the new model are that
instead

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.820
of scanning with a grid of lines, it scans
with

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:51.250
a field of light, so you can then take a picture
of the barcode from any angle.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.900
It also has a pick-less mode, where you can
pick

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.110
it up, hit the button, and the target will
change

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.110
to a dot.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.600
So you can scan off a list, and then you
just click the button and it'll scan it.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
Set it back down, and it'll just reset to
hands-free mode.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.570
It also works really well in bright light.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.149
[beep]
It scans just as easily.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.079
It supports all the standard interfaces including
USB, and when you have a USB cable you do

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.640
not need
an external power supply.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.560
You can use the DS9208 to extend your customer
loyalty program, and as an example I'm going

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.070
to
show you how to enter a customer into your

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.070
system.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:45.609
So I'm gonna go into CRE and get a new customer
by adding them.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.909
So you just come and scan the
barcode on your loyalty card.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.899
Come back into your program and fill out your
necessary information, John Doe.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.469
Save it into your system,
and then exit out of there.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.220
So one of the things that makes this more
convenient

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.099
for your customers is that they can scan the
barcode,

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.500
and store it on their phone.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
And then when they come back in, even if they
don't

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.030
have the card, they can still scan the barcode.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.500
For example, we're gonna find that customer,
John Doe.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.930
So we go into quick find, then I come back
down,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.879
go to my cell phone to find that picutre of
the barcode.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.769
And then just scan it back into the system,
and as

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.930
you can see, John Doe is now logged in and
his

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.849
information is down here, and he didn't even
have

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.610
his card on him.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.520
The DS9208 is the newest scanner and has the
ability to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.569
read off cell phones.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.930
That'll allow you to send out coupons,
and to extend your customer loyalty program,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.290
as well as
accept electronic payments.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.500
It comes in two modes, standard and drivers-license
parsing,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.930
so when you purchase it you'll need to specify
that.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.590
Drivers-license parsing is where it only gives
you the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.810
useful information off the drivers license.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.041
You would also need to specify the interface
cable, and

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.510
purchase that separately.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.269
The scanner comes with a 3-year
manufacturers warranty, lifetime POSGuys support,

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.630
and has an
optional service plan.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.849
