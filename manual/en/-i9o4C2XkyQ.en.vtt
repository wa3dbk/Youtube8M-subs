There are 2 common part number patterns for
Sharp Power Supply Units.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.460
Part numbers for Sharp Power Supply Units
are 13 characters long and begin with the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.570
letters RDENCA or DUNTKD.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:56.490
Part numbers beginning with RDENCA can be
found printed or stamped on the board.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.440

find a compatible replacement.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.810
Typically, your part number will match the
ShopJimmy Item Number.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.110
Part numbers beginning with DUNTKD are a little
more difficult to piece together.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.460
Please note that the letters DUNT are not
always printed with your part number.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.330
If you do not see these letters on your board,
look for the partial part number beginning

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.190
with KD followed by 3 characters.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.590
Now look for your 4 character suffix, which
will be printed near your KD number (sometimes

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.590
on a label).

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.800
Write these 9 characters down and add DUNT
before it to complete your part number.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.250
Search the part number on ShopJimmy.com to
find a compatible replacement.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.300
