00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.870
This is a Bosu Ball.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.430
It's basically a half ball, but it has a flat
bottom so it doesn't roll or anything.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.520
And it's so versatile.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.570
You can do a million different things on it.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.510
You can get an entire work out just with a
Bosu ball.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.901
It's really great because it works your core
because almost everything you do on it, you

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:25.610
have to use your own core to stabilize yourself.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.000
So there's things you can do where you're
standing on it this way.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.030
There's things you can do where you're going
down on it, so like push up kinda style.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.160
You can flip it over.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.160
That's whats so cool about it.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.620
And you can do things this way, too.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.610
So you know, I could even do push ups here,
or mountain climbers here.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.940
Or I can stand on it.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.280
So you would just stand and then you can do
things with weights or you could do squats.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.600
So you can do such a variety of things.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.899
And there's definitely levels.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.310
So you know there's basic levels.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.100
This might be a little more advanced for someone.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.440
But you work your way up.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.941
So even just standing here, some people, when
I put them on it for the first time, they're

00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:07.920
shaking like crazy because they don't have
those little muscles stabilizing themselves.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
Whereas someone who's more accustomed to it,
they already know how to balance on it.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.180
They can come on it, they can easily come
off of it.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
Just like that.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.470
And so there's plenty of things you can do
with this.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.530
And we'll get to them.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.740
I love using this cause I like for the most
part I like to use their body weight and not

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.189
a lot of equipment.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.380
Maybe some weights involved too, but for the
most part, I want them to use their own weight

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.950
and body because if you're there on a machine,
they're stabilized already and they don't

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.580
have to use other muscles.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.580
Whereas if you're doing bicep curls on a Bosu
Ball, you're using your entire body, not just

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.260
your biceps.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.850
And the other reason that I love this is it's
fun.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.330
You know, it's something different, it's fun.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.320
People don't wanna stand there and do a bicep
curl.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.330
People don't wanna stand there and do a shoulder
press, or sitting on a machine.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.479
But when you're jumping around and you're
doing different coordinated movements, you

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.530
kind of forget that you're working out, and
it just makes it a little bit more fun and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.060
more efficient.
