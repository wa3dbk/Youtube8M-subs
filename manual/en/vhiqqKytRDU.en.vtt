Guillermo del Toro: "That was fantastic"

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:06.950
My wish was always that the Haunted Mansion
ride would break down and you could get out

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.069
and walk around...

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:20.260
and that's what ScareHouse feels like.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:33.880
Singing: I'm so afraid of you...

00:00:33.880 --> 00:01:13.250
Because I know that you know how I love you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:29.860
Hi folks!

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.700
My name is Margee Kerr and I know what scares
you.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
If you want to find out more about the science
of fear check out the SCARE U web series

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
For those of you who had last year's ScareHouse
shake

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.640
this is the man behind the magic
Brad, the executive chef at Burgatory,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.910
And he's going to make us a milkshake.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.880
Hi, my name is Mollie Stofan
I'm a makeup artist at ScareHouse

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.800
And today we're going to do a makeup tutorial
on how to do a sugar skull

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.660
(singing) We're Best Friend Fight
And we don't play nice

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.519
We rock these costumes
So y'all can sleep at night

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.810
We're fighting zombies
And other bad guys too

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.780
So try not to get bit
Or we'll be coming for you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780
You do the world a lot of good
