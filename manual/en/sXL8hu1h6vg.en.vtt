00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.850
My name is Don Bonnette wildlife biologist
for the Fish Point Wildlife Area located 22

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.930
miles to the East of Bay City, MI, on Ringle
Road approximately 3 miles north of M25. Michigan

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.750
Department of Natural Resources purchased
this land using hunter license dollars. Fish

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.590
point was originally acquired, started acquiring
their land back in the 1950's and managed

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.480
hunting began in the early 70's. This area
has historically been a funnel for migratory

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.980
waterfowl. Fish point kind of sticks out into
the Saginaw Bay a little bit and this is kind

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.720
of a natural area for waterfowl to use. There
is about 2,500 acres that comprises the wildlife

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.780
area. About 2,300 of that in cropped areas
and of marsh zones. Each one of these yellow

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.560
strips you see right here represents a corn
strip typically on the back side of that we'll

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.260
have a food plot of buckwheat and/or millet.
The refuge is a natural marsh, basically a

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.770
cattail marsh. The wildlife refuge is a refuge
365 days a year, you can't hunt it, you can't

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.280
go in it. Peak waterfowl numbers here will
probably peak out somewhere around 20,000

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.510
ducks. Basically where the corn strips are
all around and the marsh units, we flood these.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.490
Water level conditions we try to keep it somewhere
around the 2 ½ foot range so expect conditions

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.310
maybe around knee deep. Fish Point, of all
the managed areas, is probably one of the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.021
easier ones to hunt. You can walk in. If you
want to bring a boat, a small boat, you can

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:44.119
certainly do that. Typically what guys will
do is they'll park wherever what zone they

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.039
have and they'll just walk in. We offer goose
hunting here also. A lot of guys will set

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.100
up for geese. Mallard is the number one duck
here, we can shoot divers here, teal, widgeon,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.829
gadwall, redheads; you name it we got it.
I recommend scouting the area, you know well

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.880
in advanced if you can do that, to see which
zones are producing the best. Hunters will

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.170
come in through the side entrance and have
their licenses ready to be checked when we

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.140
start registering you at the desk. Drawing
times are 5:30 and 11:00 am 7 days a week.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.901
Once the hunters come in and we check your
license you get the registration card. Make

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:24.230
sure that's filled out properly. All members
of the party, make sure they fill in all their

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.600
information. You can have up to 4 people in
a party. Singles can hunt by themselves obviously;

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.320
parties have to have between 2 and 4 individuals.
Single hunters are limited zones on the outside

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.891
basically, zones 39 through 77. Parties can
go anywhere on the area. Single hunters, if

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:44.000
they pass in the draw, they are eligible to
pick party zones after the draw. Once the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.330
drawing occurs at either 5:30 or 11:00, we
will call your numbers off randomly and then

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.950
we will call you up to the desk, call your
number, and then you're able to pick a zone.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.880
Once you pick the zone it is yours for the
hunt period, you have either the morning or

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.630
the afternoon. It is your zone. You have to
hunt between the stakes that are located on

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.690
either end of your hunting zone. You have
to hunt in the corn, marsh zones out here

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.280
you have to hunt in the blinds. Hunting begins
for the morning hunt at regular shooting hours

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.450
and your morning hunt ends at noon. For the
afternoon hunt you can enter the field at

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.140
noon but you cannot hunt until 1:00. For shooting
times and bag limits consult your waterfowl

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.790
digest. Also for your convenience at the check
station we have shooting times and bag limits

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.390
posted. If you don't make it to either the
morning or afternoon draw you can come in

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.820
the morning and pick a leftover zone up until
10:00. In the afternoon you can pick a leftover

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.970
up until 1:00. The daily use fee is $4 you
can do that at the time you register your

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.680
annual permit you can purchase right here
we have a license terminal right on site.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.791
On the Fish Point Wildlife Area you are limited
to 25 shells no larger than BBB. At Fish Point

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:02.630
Wildlife Area we have 63 zones available should
you choose not to get in one of the draws

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.291
or be unsuccessful we have areas that you
can hunt without a permit on the Fish Point

00:04:06.291 --> 00:04:10.440
Wildlife Area. Plus there is Saginaw Bay very
close by. There is the Waterfowl Bay State

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.049
Wildlife Area just to the east of the area.
There is the Quanicassee Wildlife Area just

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.280
to the west of the Fish Point Wildlife Area.
For new hunters I would suggest that you do

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.539
the afternoon hunt. Get in the 11:00 draw,
get here a couple hours early, and do some

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.900
scouting on the area. After the hunt hunters
here at Fish Point Wildlife Area must turn

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.290
in their cards at the mail slot at the front
of the building. You do not have to register

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.370
your birds. However we would like to take
a look at your mallards and black ducks. Dogs

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.460
are allowed on the area throughout in every
zone, there are no restrictions on dogs. The

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.580
use of spinning wing decoys is allowed on
the Fish Point Wildlife Area. Please park

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.039
in designated parking areas. You can get a
map here at the check station, all the parking

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.870
areas are clearly indicated on the map. If
you are unsure about where those places are

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.550
please see one of our employees at the office.
Information regarding the Fish Point Wildlife

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.610
Area is available on the DNR website and also
at the Fish Point Wildlife Area office. You

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.039
can call the office for up to date information.
Also within the check station we have an information

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.729
board that provides you up to date information
as far as the number of birds harvested, shooting

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.069
times, season dates, and bag limits. Fish
Point Wildlife Area is a great place to bring

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.800
kids. It's easy to hunt. We offer several
youth hunting opportunities. Please consult

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.849
the waterfowl hunting guide. We offer 2 easy
access blinds. Those wishing to use those

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.460
blinds indicate that they would like to use
those blinds when they register in the morning

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.831
or afternoon hunts. For bird watchers we have
an observation platform located about ½ mile

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:42.271
north of the check station. It gives you an
excellent vantage point to see much of the

00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:46.860
area. The Fish Point Wildlife Area has a nature
trail. It provides excellent wildlife viewing

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.580
opportunities, however it is closed during
the waterfowl season. We offer camping in

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.699
two locations. The Fish Point Wildlife Area
is maintained and managed with hunter license

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.310
dollars. Some of the other partners involved
in the area are the Fish Point Wildlife Association,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.370
Ducks Unlimited, Michigan Duck Hunters Association.
These organizations are important to the Fish

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.029
Point Wildlife Area because they provide help
on the area with maintenance and provide funding

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:15.509
for various projects. Please come out to the
Fish Point Wildlife Area and have a safe and

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:15.539
enjoyable hunt.
