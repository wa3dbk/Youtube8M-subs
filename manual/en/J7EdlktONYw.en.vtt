the pups were outside the lookout

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.790
playing while Ryder was up inside the lookout doing some work when he looked outside

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.259
and saw something that was really
interesting in the middle of town

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.220

know if you can see this but there's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
something really weird going on the
middle of Adventure Bay

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.189

Marshall to take your fire truck to go

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.460

police cruiser along with him

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.460
middle of town

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.559

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.980

really neat

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590

Marshall it could be anything until we

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.019

what it is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.590

odd. What was that?

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.420

drives around Adventure Bayl lot and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.890
giggles and laughs and has all kinds of
fun but that wasn't what was really odd

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.390
that over there is what's really odd.  Oh
is that sooooapp!!

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.700
yes it is rocky and we're all gonna take
a giant bubble bath in the pool

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.850

bath

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.210
I don't want to take a bubble bath. NO!!!

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.060
oo oo last one in is a rotten egg well i guess I'm going to be the rotten egg then because I'm

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.180
not taking a bath. Oh boy this is lots of
fun

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.830

it's really lots of fun we're all going

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.600
to have fun getting cleaned up

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.140
it does look like fun okay i'm getting
in the pool. And Rocky decided that

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.100
taking a bath wasn't such a bad idea
after all

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.370
and all the pups got really clean and
went and got a really

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.370
nice meal at the lookout

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.180
they have lots of fun today and learned
a great lesson in staying clean using

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.040
soap!
