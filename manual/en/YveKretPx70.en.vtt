00:00:08.483 --> 00:00:12.213
What do you think of Lubuntu vs Ubuntu vs
Xubuntu?

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:15.632
This makes me want to shout back X-ray Zulu.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.243
I don’t get it.

00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:21.723
They take the existing name Ubuntu and add
an extra letter as a portmanteau that is even

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:24.032
harder to spell and pronounce.

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:26.543
Aside from that, what’s the difference?

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:32.833
Lubuntu has a light Linux LXDE desktop, while
Ubuntu has the Unity desktop.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:37.503
So many people hated Unity that they went
with Mint instead, making it the new, number

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.843
one desktop.

00:00:38.843 --> 00:00:44.993
Lubuntu wants to use less memory and CPU than
Ubuntu, too, so it has lighter apps as well.

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:51.523
So Ubuntu and Lubuntu use different applications
for photo editing, spreadsheets and etc.

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:53.453
What about Xubuntu?

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:59.943
Xubuntu uses the Xfce desktop environment,
instead of Lubuntu’s LXDE desktop.

00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:04.663
So that’s where the X comes from, instead
of something like Extreme Ubuntu.

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:08.533
I think the X for extreme was old in the 1990s.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.453
Ubuntu is still one of the most popular Linux
versions, though.

00:01:12.453 --> 00:01:16.153
Sure, ranking up there with Debian and Mint.

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:20.393
Xubuntu is around 15 to 20, while Lubuntu
is 12th.

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.593
What is XFCE?

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.623
It is an desktop environment, and the name
comes from Xforms common environment.

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:31.323
No wonder they shortened it to X in front
of Ubuntu.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:36.873
And at least Xubuntu sounds a lot like Shaka
Zulu and other related words in that language.

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:38.913
Ubuntu comes from Bantu.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:42.933
What are the benefits of Xubuntu versus the
other Ubuntu versions?

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:48.093
Xubuntu uses less application memory and takes
up less space of the buffers and cache, though

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:51.033
it doesn’t run quite as good as Debian.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:55.783
But Debian is so hard to install that there
are jokes Ubuntu is African for can’t install

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.103
Debian.

00:01:57.103 --> 00:02:01.773
Which is why all the variations of Ubuntu
together probably exceed downloads of Debian

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:01.973
today.
