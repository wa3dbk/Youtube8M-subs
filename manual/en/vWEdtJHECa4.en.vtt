00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.339
The sixteenth territorial regiments
heroic resistance of Cosell helped to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.780
stop the German army breaking through
French lines and Paris remained in

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
French control for the rest of the war
Loui recovered from his injuries and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
went on to serve as an army interpreter
he continued to write regularly to Lizzy

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.619
and his children so it's just incredible
to look at all these letters from Louie

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.590
to the family in England there's a
letter here from 1918 that must be

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.180
getting towards the end of his service
he's maybe about to be dmort

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
and then he went back to London I know
that and he worked at the Savoy for all

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.750
those years and then he reappears in
France the addresses Minh area called

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
Maison Lafitte's I have no idea where
that is but this is where he seems to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
have lived in this later part of his
life so I would love love to go there

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.059
I'd love to find out where Lewey is
Barret

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.180
in the early 1930s Louie left England
and his family for good retiring to the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.490
quiet town of Missoula feet just outside
Paris he died there on the 17th of

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.470
September 1949 at the age of 72 Joe has
contacted the local cemetery and Maison

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.979
Lafitte who have a record of her
great-grandfather's burial there

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.360
cemetery attendant max Wiedemann has
agreed to show her Louise resting place

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:58.830
oh is the first member of her family to
visit Louise grave wallah EDC well this

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:08.250
year we will offer pores are better for
schooners ha ha whoo - afternoon whoa

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.209
Danny come here personally person to
manifest a pile a family to recall so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.820
thanks Jimmy with office Karuna peltier
a decoder clue over it okay dear enemy

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.510
doesn't know she was in the first
communal she knew he was put in a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.260
communal grave which is a horrible shock
idiot compelled accompli on the path so

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.140
sudden all the exactly nobody officer
seen for school meal I said no she get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.920
off it
I asked him how many people are in this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.680
grave because immediately I think well
fine you know I want him out of there

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.739
and I will make sure that he's buried
properly but they literally don't know

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.580
how many people have been put into this
communal grave so finding Louise remains

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.930
could be very difficult

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.870
Louie was originally buried in a single
plot but as the cemetery became

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.819
overcrowded and none of his relatives
could be traced his remains were moved

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:29.690
in 1968 I must be honest part of me is
very angry because he had family and

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.860
until relatively recently he had he had
quite close family in that he's the last

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.060
of his children didn't die very long ago
and certainly my mother who was so keen

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.640
to know where he was buried
kind of had no idea what had happened

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.269
it's such an unfitting end for a really
extraordinary man

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.750
you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.440
I've always been most impressed with
bravery against the odds

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:17.080
you know bravery when it looks like
you're beaten bravery when okay we're all gonna die but let's go down
fighting that's what he did.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.260
JK Rowling Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.140
here at the river restaurant
yesin which is where drew you won't

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.190
between 1919 and 1927 and this is the
restaurant in action Wow I love this

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.230
whole in 1920
