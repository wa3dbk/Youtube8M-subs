00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.920
It's a chandelier
and it's from Paris.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.480
It originally came from a hotel.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.600
I don't know how much
you know about the Vietnam war, -

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.640
- but in 1973
the Paris Peace agreement was signed.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.160
This was an agreement
between the Vietcong, -

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.760
- the North Vietnamese, the South
Vietnamese and the Americans.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.160
The Americans were to withdraw,
and the North Vietnamese couldn't -

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.440
- attack the South Vietnamese who
were helpless without the Americans.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.960
Here we see the four parties
sitting around the round table.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.000
The peace agreement didn't last.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.880
When the North Vietnamese saw
that the Americans wouldn't return, -

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.120
- they attacked the South Vietnamese
and seized control.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.680
The French government recently sold
off a lot of their historic buildings.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.440
We found out who
the new owner of the hotel was -

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.200
- and were able to acquire
these chandeliers.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.320
The project could easily
become cultural souvenirs -

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.560
- which you assert
are art objects.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.320
There's nothing wrong with that,
but it's also a very common method -

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.320
- and it doesn't really interest me.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.400
Of course, I had my own personal
fetish about these objects, -

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.600
- but one of the things which
really formed the project was -

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.560
- when I took my dad there.
My dad visited me in France.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.360
I took a cab with my dad to the hotel
before they took down the chandeliers.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.200
Of course, he was cursing and swearing
during the cab ride -

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.280
- and talking about
going to the room of death.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.080
He was South Vietnamese
so he was brainwashed -

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.440
- by American propaganda.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.680
You can see that the chandelier
was designed for the room, -

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.920
- so it's quite spectacular.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.920
What happened was that
when he stepped into the room ...

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.640
Imagine that he was complaining
all the way there.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.080
The only thing he could say was
that the Queen of Denmark -

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.120
- should have one of these
in one of her castles.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.040
I think that's really important
because ...

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.000
... that's what chandeliers are.
They make you forget things.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.720
It was a remark which really ...

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.280
... articulated the concept
of the project for me.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.720
I've never thought about
why it would interest other people.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.080
It's not my agenda.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.280
The only thing you can do
as an artist is to be very focused.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.000
The fantastic thing
that can happen is -

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.840
- when a stranger somewhere
out there can actually participate.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.640
I wanted the National Gallery to
have it because I wanted my dad to ...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.040
As he had talked
so much about the Queen, -

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.760
- she should be able
to look at it once in a while.
