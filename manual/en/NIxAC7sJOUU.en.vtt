00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.651
When you first look at the

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.125
Costume Shop it doesn't look like

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.722
it belongs at MIT. But then you

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.042
realize there are so many

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:25.453
students on campus who are

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:26.740
interested in art, who want to

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.268
learn to draw, or have already

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:29.865
drawn all their lives and want to

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:31.057
explore it here they just don't

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:32.857
know how. The Costume Shop it is

00:00:32.857 --> 00:00:34.598
a hidden gem. It is a place where

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:36.917
MIT students an explore what

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:39.562
they know already or what they

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:42.256
learn at MIT but in a humanistic

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.356
form. So the very first day of

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.893
class we go to this building

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:47.988
that I had no idea existed, and

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:49.526
I walk in and its just crazy

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.312
because there is art everywhere.

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:52.941
There's pastels and oil-paintings

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.376
and everything all over the

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:55.818
place; the walls are covered with

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:57.600
artwork. And its just all student

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.259
generated work.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.808
I'm a designer and I'm trying

00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:05.780
to teach them how to approach

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.318
figure drawing and costume design

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.686
as a designer, not so much as a

00:01:11.686 --> 00:01:14.349
technician, I mean that from a

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:16.255
conceptual point of view. And

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:17.924
those guys are perfectionists,

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.572
you know, and its what makes

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:21.304
beautiful about them. So they're

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:23.043
going to keep going until they

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:24.790
get it and I'm very proud of them.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.764
Sometimes I feel like if I'm not

00:01:27.764 --> 00:01:29.390
doing something technical or

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.957
something homework related that

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:33.801
I'm wasting my time. Whereas

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:36.370
with this one (class) you realize

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.684
actually how important art is.

00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:40.718
Its just a different part of your

00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:42.719
mind that you're using and you're

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.219
not sitting in a chair coding or

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.130
doing math. You're standing up

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.952
and making grand gestures. And

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:49.806
then kind of looking at things

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:51.686
holistically, "This is going to

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:53.506
be the underside of it and then

00:01:53.506 --> 00:01:54.819
I'm going to have a white. . ."

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.637
At the end of the semester I'm

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.048
very interested to show their

00:01:58.048 --> 00:01:59.670
work. Not just for the MIT

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.922
community to see what they're

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:02.374
doing, it's also for themselves.

00:02:02.374 --> 00:02:04.716
So there's two rooms. One of them

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:06.160
has all the figure drawing

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.105
exhibitions and the other has

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:10.797
costume design. And the dresses

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.867
that people created where amazing.

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:14.674
I mean, its definitely something

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:16.055
I would buy, these dresses were

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:17.336
gorgeous and they were made out

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:18.031
of paper.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.826
When the exhibition started it

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.441
was crazy because I didn't think

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.006
that many people would come. I

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:27.571
had invited some friends and

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.224
they actually came because they're

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:30.795
really interested in something

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:32.106
like this.

00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:33.676
Probably just because there

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:35.172
aren't a lot of things like this

00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:36.870
on campus. And it was a great

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.717
feeling because its something that

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:40.535
I had put a lot of time into and

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.099
looking at people look at my

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.446
artwork and being like, "Wow.

00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:45.018
This is so great!" It was just a

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:46.770
great feeling. It's really

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.589
wonderful to see where they

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.784
started and where they are right

00:02:50.784 --> 00:02:53.051
now. I think they are very

00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:55.121
competitive in a very good way.

00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.721
And they have big ideas and they

00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.445
try to translate them through

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.668
their drawings through their

00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:06.067
painting, through objects which

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:08.405
is the costume they tell stories.

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.411
And I heard them telling me

00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.163
stories. And it can't get more

00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.706
human than this even if its at MIT.
