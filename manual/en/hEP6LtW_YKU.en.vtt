00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:07.380
It's time for our tuning special from Geneva.

00:00:07.577 --> 00:00:12.317
We start off with the car
BMW doesn't make yet; the M5.

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:14.371
We're at AC Schnitzer.

00:00:14.404 --> 00:00:21.243
This car is based on the 550i,
but this one has 540 hp and 700 Nm of torque.

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:24.537
Its top speed is 200 mph. Insane.

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:30.291
It's nice to know that its carbon emissions
are the same as the 550i.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.655
This car isn't very subtle.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:37.345
But there's another tuner taking care of this car.

00:00:37.728 --> 00:00:42.981
If you want a more tasteful alternative
to an M5, I'd immediately call Alpina.

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:45.726
This is the B5 BiTurbo Touring...

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:48.450
...in typical Alpina blue.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.292
It's got a V8 with two turbos,
like the one in the 550i.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.885
It's got 507 hp, that's the same amount
the previous M5 had.

00:00:57.078 --> 00:01:00.038
But I think this one is cooler.

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:03.253
This is a very unique an exotic car.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.290
And at Alpina you can combine
every body type with these engines.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.490
The customer is king.

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:21.438
If you want something big and radical,
there's really just one contestant.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:25.056
Or maybe two, there's probably
also a tuned G-Class somewhere.

00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.853
But there are so many of those,
all driven by tasteless people.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:34.450
This is the Invader,
it's based on the Lexus 570.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.227
But they've heavily modified the engine
and added a turbo.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.962
It now has 600 hp.
It's got huge wheels.

00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:43.848
The interior is stuffed with leather.

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:48.919
You're guaranteed to draw
a lot of attention with this car.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:54.354
There's a lot to choose from at Brabus.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.404
You can basically combine every engine
with every body shell available.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.483
Here we have an S-Class,
a G-Class and an E-Class...

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:06.297
...and they're all fitted with
a twin turbo V12 with 800 hp. Nice, isn't it?

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:09.919
But there's more to see
at Brabus, much more. It's incredible.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.204
Since Brabus tunes every Mercedes,
they've also done the SLS.

00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:18.673
This is one with two turbos.
The special thing about them is that...

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.169
...one of them turns clockwise
and the other one turns anti-clockwise.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:27.373
And according to Brabus, that provides
a better flow of gas in a V-engine.

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.994
It's got 700 hp and 840 Nm of torque.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:33.200
Its top speed is 211 mph.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.426
It does 0-120 in 10.2 seconds.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:40.114
They didn't change the exterior radically.

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:42.770
It's a bit wider and is fitted with
typical Brabus wheels.

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:48.309
I do prefer the shiny ones,
they look just a bit better.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.569
But there are many more SLSes.

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.492
This one is from FAB Design.
The paint job is fantastic.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.631
I really like the matte blue
with a little sparkle.

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:03.893
They've made it much wider and striking.
It's not very subtle, though.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.201
The interior is full of blue an white.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.582
It's got a couple more horsepower,
but it's mostly about standing out.

00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:14.961
Pimp Momma wants this SLS.

00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:21.549
The color is quite feminine of course;
matte pinkish copper with some carbon.

00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:26.257
This is the Hamann Hawk with 636 hp.

00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:30.019
It's mostly wider; 2.8 inch at the back.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.165
They've added lots of stuff.
But this certainly isn't the last SLS.

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:40.537
Last but not least; the Mansory Cormeum.
It's also based on the SLS.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.912
They've bolted a supercharger to its V8.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:50.256
It has 660 hp but they also say
that they've tested an 800 hp version.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.865
The carbon is just a wrap
so it's just a sticker.

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.960
But they have made the car lighter, they've
developed the roof and doors themselves...

00:03:58.028 --> 00:03:59.879
...and they're 90 kg (198 lbs) lighter.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:04.957
If you like to stand out, this is the car for you.

00:04:07.765 --> 00:04:11.520
The idea is OK,
but the implementation not so much.

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:18.062
Carlsson doesn't have an SLS,
but they do have this creation; the C25.

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:22.321
You've got two seconds to guess
on what car it's based.

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:25.205
Indeed, the Mercedes SL.

00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:31.434
It's got a bi-turbo V12 with 753 hp.
And it does 219 mph.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:35.370
It's a lot lighter than the regular SL,
it has a carbon roof for example.

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:38.076
In total they've saved 180 kg (397 lbs).

00:04:38.205 --> 00:04:42.927
And for people who worry about
their neighbor buying the same car...

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:46.461
...they will only make one per country.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.000
So be quick.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.803
Novitec primarily tunes Ferraris
although they do make exceptions.

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:03.950
But Novitec Rosso only does prancing horses.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.642
This is the new 458 Italia.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.569
It's got a different exhaust,
is much lighter and has extra power.

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.225
Just over 600 of them.

00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:14.852
The combination of carbon and white
doesn't look very stylish.

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:17.520
But the car next to it
is the real party piece.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:21.302
It's a 599 GTO fitted with superchargers.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.212
888 hp and it does 0-120 in 9.2 seconds.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:32.564
Think about that; by the time
you're doing 60 mph with your little diesel...

00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.228
...this one is already doing 120 mph.

00:05:41.437 --> 00:05:45.205
I'm not sure why they're all
taking pictures of me.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:49.882
We're at Irmscher and as it turns out...

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.960
...the Opel Astra Sports Tourer
is one of the most tuned cars at this show.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:59.922
This one is from Irmscher with a very nice...

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:03.230
Well, I say it's nice,
but I don't actually mean that.

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:07.100
They add a lot of goodies
to make it look a bit different.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.445
They don't really tinker with the engine...

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.393
...they've only converted it to LPG
so that you can save some money.

00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:18.687
But Irmscher also
has something bigger on show.

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:22.130
I'm not talking about those models,
they never eat at all.

00:06:22.204 --> 00:06:24.759
I'm talking about
the car behind them, the Camaro.

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:29.070
I know you want to see the models,
but you'll have to make do with me.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.279
I want to tell you about
this Irmscher Camaro i42.

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:39.541
6.2 liter V8 with a supercharger
so it has over 500 hp.

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:43.035
It has a top speed of only 171 mph...

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:45.901
...but it does do 0-62
in a little over 4 seconds.

00:06:45.954 --> 00:06:50.079
They made it look even cooler,
as far as a Camaro needs that.

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.964
Because everytime I see one,
I still check it out.

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:57.637
It looks nice, these are cool cars.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.594
It's not a standard choice like an SLS
or a Porsche, there are so many of those.

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:05.002
There are a couple of manufacturers
whose cars get tuned very often...

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.062
...but Porsche is definitely the tuner's favorite.

00:07:07.143 --> 00:07:09.427
There are Panameras, Cayennes and 911s...

00:07:09.454 --> 00:07:11.226
...with the most striking designs...

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.615
...by a range of tuners.

00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:34.221
I've had quite enough of this show
and the tuners.

00:07:34.363 --> 00:07:36.691
So I'll be driven home again.

00:07:36.868 --> 00:07:40.023
I've got a nice screen to watch. You might
wonder what's up with the weird glasses.

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:47.232
It's a 3D screen, so I'll need
these glasses to relax in this ultimate Brabus.

00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.977
There's a fridge, an espresso machine.

00:07:51.188 --> 00:07:56.699
With lots of screens and lots of space
for some pleasant company.

00:07:57.292 --> 00:07:59.435
Patrick, could you find someone for me?
