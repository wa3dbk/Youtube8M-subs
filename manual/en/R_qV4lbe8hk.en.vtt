DOUG JENKINS: Hi, I'm Doug. I work with twenty
great guys in St. Louis at Doug Jenkins Custom

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.980
Hot Rods, and we're going to do some work
for you today on Expert Village. Now, Mark

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.560
has snapped a good chalk line on the floor.
He took a straight edge, laid it up with--was

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.869
apparently parallel to the rear tire, you
know, with a hot rod like this, the whole

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.880
body is curved, there's no fenders, there's
very little to measure off of, so Mark reckoned

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.180
off the rear tire with a straight edge and
extended that with a chalk line, and now he's

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.110
got himself a nice straight line that he can
measure the caster off of. Caster measurement

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.390
is taken when turning the wheel, you start
the base measurement when you turn the wheel

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.379
15 degrees out. So we've made this template
here out of cardboard so that we know where

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.940
to, you know, how to line up the tire. So
we line up the tire 15 degrees out, on the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:09.320
side you're measuring the caster with. Then
Mark will install the gauge on the wheel

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:18.550
and then using that level again at the front
there, the side to side--he'll level that.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.070
And then zero the bubble for adjusting the
caster. So here's the zero mark he's going

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:33.040
to align the bubble up with. And then we'll
move the cardboard template so that we can

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:49.990
turn the wheel 15 degrees the other direction.
So if you take a look at the bubble on the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.380
caster, by measuring this, Mark has made himself
a bunch or work for himself. We've got like

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.170
a degree or a degree and a quarter, negative
caster. And remember, negative is bad, it's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.470
like a shopping cart. It turns real well but
it won't go fast in a straight line.
