00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.049
What's up, guys?

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.049
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.730
An ATHLEAN XPRESS Tip for you I think you're
going to find helpful if you are Deadlifting.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.859
Deadlifts can be a complex movement because
it's definitely a complicated movement because

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.779
it requires a lot of different joints to work
in sync with each other.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.009
Guys will always ask me, 'How much contribution
is it from the hips and how much contribution

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.269
comes from the knees?'

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.780
There's a very easy way, I feel, to sort of
master that and make sure that you're getting

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.190
the right amounts and the proper amounts in
each and every rep that you do.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.440
I have an empty bar here, and then I'll demonstrate
on a full bar.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.030
You go and you sit your hips back as if you're
into an RDL, like a stiff-legged RDL.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.030
You sit your hips back.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.030
You sit your hips back.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.090
You sit your hips back.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.289
So here we haven't had any real knee bend
at all, alright.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.430
All the contribution has been from the hips.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.210
As soon as our hands are at knee level here,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.699
as soon as we're at knee level, now you can
allow the knee to break which brings you straight

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:00.789
to the ground, ok.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.641
So, the bar will stay nice and close to your
shins and again, now on the way back up, you're

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:07.990
just reversing that.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.540
You're using your legs.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
You're here.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.660
Remember I always say, the Deadlift is a push
movement, ok.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660
It's a push movement.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.050
You've got to stabilize through your pulling
muscles.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.860
And you have to drive through at the top **as**
they push through the ground exerting force

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.200
into the ground.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
You drive it up and then from here, as soon
as it gets to knee level again, now it's a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.550
hip movement, ok, where you drive your hips
up as you stand up to the top.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.500
So, if we demonstrate that on a real bar.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.950
Bar goes over the laces, ok.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.500
I bend down this way, ok.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.860
Hands down.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.120
Ass back.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.400
Hips back.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.770
As soon as my hands get to my knees, then
I just break my knees and you can see the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.680
bar is right up against my shins in perfect
position.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.940
Once I'm here, I start by pushing through
the ground, getting it up to knee level, ok.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.110
Here, pushing through the ground, knee level
and then drive the hips.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.910
On the way back down, let the hips drop, let
the hips drop, let the hips drop, right there.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.970
Bend the knees, k.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.550
Push and then come up.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.660
Let 'em drop, let 'em drop, let 'em drop.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.890
Bend the knees.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.300
K. One more time.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.700
Push, drive 'em forward.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.250
Drop, drop, drop.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
Bend the knees.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.690
So there you have it guys.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.330
There's a tip that you can start instituting
the very next time you do that.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.040
Now remember, the Deadlift, there's a lot
of different variations.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.090
There's Sumo Deadlifts.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.830
There's different types of grips that we can
use.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.420
There's different stances we can take.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.710
I prefer a narrow stance.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.600
Some guys prefer a wide stance based on their
anatomy.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.150
Others will do something called a Jefferson
Deadlift where they actually straddle the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.150
bar.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.150
Lots of different variations.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.600
Lots of different goals.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.460
Some are looking for personal records on them.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.980
That's not what we're talking about here.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.930
We're talking about putting it into your overall
athletic training program.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.560
Getting you to function the way your body
prefers to function.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.300
That's really what ATHLEANX is all about.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.670
Getting you guys to be more athletic, ground-based
movements.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.690
Building up strength from the ground up so
you can become more powerful, bigger, faster,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.440
stronger, from the toes to your fingertips.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.970
