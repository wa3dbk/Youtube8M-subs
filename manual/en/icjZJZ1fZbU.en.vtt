My name is Roger Rivera. I'm a Regional Education
Executive for Clinique.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.960
What I'm here to show today is that contouring is absolutely easy, and it can be done with just a few simple steps.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.830
We need to start with a flawless canvas,
and the best way to do that is with our new

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.100
Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer in one.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.689
So just apply a stripe on the cheeks, and then you can turn the wand over and dot it anywhere that you need a bit of extra coverage.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.000
It's beautifully, easily blendable.
Now let's move on to sculpting those cheekbones.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.760
We created these Sculpting Highlight Contour
Sticks. It's a mistake-proof crayon that you

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.370
can use just to add definition, highlights,
or depth wherever on the skin that you want it.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.500
Just apply the highlighting stick
along the top of the cheekbone, right on the forehead, down the center of the nose,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.700
anywhere that you really want to create more emphasis on the skin.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.600
Now just go ahead and take your
finger and blend that right out. Perfect!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Now if you want to really create that sculpted look, we're going to use the Contour Stick just in the hollow of the cheek.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.000
That looks great! You might want to amp it up with our new Sculptionary Cheek Contour Palette.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.800
We're going to take the deeper color and just apply it right under the hollow of the cheek.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.100
The next step is we're going to take that lighter color and just blend it right on top.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.140
Look at how fresh and radiant that is! It's really luminous.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.500
There's going to be some times when
you want to maybe create a little bit more definition,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.100
so I'm going to teach you a few
tricks for some other areas that you can contour.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's say you wanted to create a little bit
more of a chiseled jawline.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You could take the Contour Stick, the darker shade, and run it just underneath.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Then taking your finger, just blend it down. See what that does? You get more of that chiseled look.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, we're going to use this as a blush. We're going to swirl the color together, tap out the excess,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.700
and just sweep it right onto the apple of
the cheek. Perfect!

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.400
So let's just finish the look off with a little bit of Chubby Stick for the lips.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.840
This is a beautiful color balm that's going to help hydrate, and add a nice juicy wash of color to the lips.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.000
Go ahead and blot that for me.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.900
What do you think? --It's amazing!
