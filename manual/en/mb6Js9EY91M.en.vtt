Hi my name is Sarah and Iâ€™m coming to you
from Petland in Pinborough Pines, Florida

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.010
today and on behalf of expertvillage.com,
I am going to speak with you today about how

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.670
to buy a pet bird. While you may save some
money in short term by purchasing seeds as

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.730
they can be less expensive, you will end up
paying more money in the long term due to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.039
health problems in your bird. It is always
better to feed pellets versus feeding seeds.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.530
There are some premium pelleted diets out
there that are certified organic, have no

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.179
artificial flavors, no artificial colors,
no preservatives and these are excellent diets.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.480
You may choose to use one of these premium
diets. However, even your least expensive

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.269
pellet is still going to be a 100 times better
for your birds health than your most expensive

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.890
premium seed mix. You must understand that
even seed mixes that say they are fortified

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.869
with vitamin and minerals do not end up giving
your bird those vitamins and minerals because

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.631
these vitamins and minerals are sprayed on
the outside of the seed mixes which your bird

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:24.409
picks them up, holds the seed, eats the inside
and drops the seed. The outside of the seed

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.960
that has all the vitamins and minerals falls
on it to the floor of the cage so all that

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.499
extra money that you are paying for the vitamin
and mineral enriched seed mix ultimately does

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:40.619
not help out the health of your bird at all.
