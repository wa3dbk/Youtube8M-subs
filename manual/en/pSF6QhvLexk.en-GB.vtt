Hello guys….Welcome to urban School. This
is Satya and in this video I am going to show

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.840
you an image slideshow with navigation facility.
You can switch to the next image or previous

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.680
image. This slideshow also have a Play and
Pause button. All this cool transition effects

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.550
and navigation facility, is developed with
HTML and JavaScript only.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.280
Usually these types of transitions are developed
with jquery or LavaLamp. But the best part,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.401
which is why I am making this video, is the
fact that this slideshow is working with only

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.770
HTML and JavaScript.
One of the striking features of this Image

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.150
slideshow is the easiness of modifying the
code according to your need. All you need

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.809
to do is to put your images in Image folder.
And replace the name of images in HTML file.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.450
And it’s done.
Okay now I will demonstrate how to replace

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.970
existing images with your new images. Step
one; we need to put our images in “Images”

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.420
folder. Once that done, we have completed
half of the job. I have 5 additional images

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.170
in my image folder. Now next step is to append
the HTML code. Open the html file “Style2.html”

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.039
with some file editor like Notepad.
Here you need to change the name of images.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.719
Make sure that the extension of images is
right. Sometimes people are having hard time

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.119
due to this tiny little error. Anyways I am
sure you are not going make that error. Okay

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.799
now that we have changed the images name,
let’s run it.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.209
Working great. One more additional note, If
you notice the first image of the slide show

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.790
is having a link with it. Meaning if you click
the first image of slideshow, this will open

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.540
a new webpage. This link may be some section
of your website or video or your blog. Now

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.819
if you want to put links on rest of the images
too…Here is how to do it. Just type this

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.750
code with the image and it’s done. Okay
