00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.565
It's all my life

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:36.200
For me it's the best GT car of the nineties

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.602
especially with the turbo

00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:42.100
While the NA versions are already quite cool

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.300
But they are a little short in power

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
The 944 turbo is a car that can do it all

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Go on vacation with your family, a really quiet car

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.329
It's true that the sound it makes is not great

00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:55.713
but that's what it does best

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:58.000
The car has a really distinctive look

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I have always beloved

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.287
The 944 turbo cup Trophy has always been for me

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.700
the model to collect as soon as possible 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
In the best shape possible

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.000
That's why I decided to do it myself

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800
So we find the bonnet equipped with pins

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:38.294
Air intake is made out of magnesium

00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:42.000
That's why it is painted to last longer

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:50.400
The "Telefon" wheels in magnesium from the era

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.300
They have exactly the same shape

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.800
that those of the Turbo 220 version

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.300
But they are wider with 9inch at the rear

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.500
And 8inch at the front

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.000
Inside we find the Matter roll cage 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
made out of Aluminium

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
Which did not exist for a very long time

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:20.000
A manual brake balance from Tilton

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.700
which enables to limit braking at the rear

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:33.300
There was also a button to disconnect the ABS

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300
which appeared in 1989 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
After the drivers requested it

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.900
which was never really used

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.100
according to people from the period

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.000
Since the drivers were looking for saving their tyres too

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.300
knowing number of tyres was restricted by races

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.080
In 1990 Sonauto decided to keep on the 944 Trophy

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.180
for one more year

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.800
while other countries were going for the 964 Cup

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.900
They ask to dany snobeck some modifications

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.980
Engine went from 250 to 290bhp 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.300
Rather 300bhp in reality

00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:11.732
Brake hoses and the antiroll bar 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.780
They were all specific from 1990
