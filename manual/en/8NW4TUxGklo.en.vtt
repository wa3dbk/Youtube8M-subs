00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.440
hi welcome to how-to-repair.com this video
is on a Beko a washing machine that's

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.150
not heating

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.610
I will be showing you how to test the
heating element and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.790
also the NTC sensor, and also show you
how to change them

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.820
now we've got a Beko washing machine
here that hasn't shown

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.380
an error fault, but is being stuck on
the wash cycle for over two

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500
hours, and basically

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.760
it's not heating. I´ve tested it with my
Amp

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.890
meter already, and its not drawing any
current, I´ll show you that at the end of the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.330
video.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.630
So what we're gonna do, is let the machine
empty, switch it off from the power

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.230
supply,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890
and then undo the back panel to gain

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.969
access to the element. Now this video
can be used on

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.910
other makes, as a lot of washing machines
have NTC sensors fitted,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.969
and all washing machines nearly have a  heating element fitted.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.390
Now just

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.160
at the bottom there, we have the heating
element and NTC sensor,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.149
so as I said earlier, for safety always make
sure you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.850
unplug the appliance before working on
it from the electricity supply.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.100
Now we're going to remove

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.560
the two cables which go to the heating
element,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.689
setting the meter to continuity

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.720
and we´ll test for resistance across the
element,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.790
and as you can see,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
we have resistance, so therefore the
element is good.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.799
And now we're going to test the

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.609
NTC sensor.

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.700
There´s links on the left hand side of
this video, and also in the description

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.539
below for mobile users,

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.850
and these links will actually take you
to the website

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.619
and on the website we have a detailed
video on how

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.179
NTC sensors work. I've actually got a
little test

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.630
connection block which allows me to get
onto the terminals without messing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.170
around

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.689
because the terminals are very small and
very hard to get your

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.959
probe on.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.920
Got the two probes onto the actual
sensor,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.120
but we are getting no reading at all.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.239
Your meter must be set on the
ohms (Ω) to do a test on an NTC sensor,

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.530
but this is open circuit.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.900
Now I'll just do a test on the new one.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.090
All NTC sensors have a tolerance
level which is only given out

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.430
by the manufacturer of the NTC sensor,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.959
and also the appliance manufacturer, they onlyonly usually distribute it

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.819
to the engineers, but this NTC sensor I
know has a tolerance level

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.010
of around 6,000 and,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.220
as I was holding the NTC sensor,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.299
the value was dropping, which means it's
working correctly,

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.290
as the NTC sensor gets warmed the
tolerance level drops,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.380
but you can see all this in the more
detailed video,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.760
and as you can see as I'm not touching
it now,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.760
it's going up slightly, and I know this
new NTC sensor is perfect anyway,

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.130
so to fit the new NTC sensor, you need

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.870
to remove the nut in the middle of the
element

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.850
but not all the way of the thread, you
just need to leave it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.390
on the end there, and then

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.850
with a screwdriver just tap it in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.140
and that will release the pressure

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.550
of the seal allowing you to get the
element out,

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.890
sometimes these are very sticky and you
might have to use a small

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.470
dumpy screwdriver to prise it out, and
there we go

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.670
we have the element, a little bit of clothing

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.080
rapped on it, now here's the NTC sensor

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.680
now we've taken the pressure off the
seal we are able two prise out the old NTC

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.310
sensor

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.690
we can discard this,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.700
and we´ll fit the new one, I always
recommend just putting a touch of fairly

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.780
liquid or something

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.310
on the end of it, and it will help it
slide into the rubber easily, 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.720
and then it's a good idea

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.460
to clean up the surface of the seal
get all the limescale

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.919
of it, and then

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.250
again, just dry it of and then put a
little bit of fairy liquid

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.250
on this seal before reinserting the
element.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.810
As I said earlier, there are links to

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.360
all Beko parts on the top left hand side
of this 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.650
tutorial, and also in the description
below.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.830
There is also some links to the
tutorials and the FAQ section

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.400
on washing machines for more information
on Beko´s, we have all the test

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.319
procedure on all components

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.919
and the diagnostic videos, and please
remember to subscribe to our channel:

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.219
or subscribe on the YouTube channel as
that's what keeps us going an able to

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:25.460
make these free videos for you. Just showing you how the seal locks up here,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.659
as you do the nut

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.360
it brings that piece of metal down onto
the seal which clamps the seal to the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.879
tub.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.139
And there you go! Now before we put the
machine on test,

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.039
just make sure you get the wiring on
correctly,

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.990
if you are ever unsure about working on
machine

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.560
its always worthwhile taking a
photograph before starting the job,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.979
of the wiring, but on this machine it's
straightforward 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.979
there are only three wires, a live, a neutral and an earth, 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.710
and then of course, the jack plug for the NTC sensor.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.240
So now we've got it all connected,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.409
I will just put the machine on test for
you,

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.510
and i connect it up my Amp meter,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.250
and as you can see, when the machine as
stop turning in a second,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.350
we´re drawing

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.020
just over 7 amps on the heating element.
And there you go!

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.150
