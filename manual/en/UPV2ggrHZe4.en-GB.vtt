Hey, kids it's me PDRsan

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.060
Recently there has been another murder by a young kid

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.740
and yet again the media blames the internet and video games

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.840
Here's what some respected(???) professor had to say about the murder

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.220
The reason for the boy's actions

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.540
must have something to do with the fact that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.260
he played violent video games and was exposed to the internet at a young age

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.500
How do you know for sure

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.940
It could of been Disney's fault

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.798
What?

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:34.618
A few years ago I went to Disney Land

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.880
and I was in line in Mickey's House to take a photo with him

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.700
There was this girl in her 20's in front of me

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.260
she seemed fine while she was in line

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.980
and then it was her turn to take a photo with the mouse

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.280
I can't help crying whenever I see you Mickey

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.740
From that day I knew that Disney was some kind of cult

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.280
I bet that there are tons of murders who are huge disney fans

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.340
The only reason you don't know about it is because the media chooses not to tell you

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.980
Dude, I'm not really sure about

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.220
So according this professor

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.600
the kid was into violent video games form a young age

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.560
so I'm guessing he must have been playing 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.014
Mario

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.160
or Sonic

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.120
Dude!!!

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.180
Yeah yeah

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.580
I'm guessing he played Grand Theft Auto

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.900
GTA has sold 150 million copies world wide

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.180
and I'm pretty sure that 99.9% of the people that bought the game

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.300
haven't gone out and killed people

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.100
I've played GTA and I haven't killed anybody

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.100
So maybe there's some other reason this kid decided to kill

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.340
First of all if you can't tell the difference between a game and the real world

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.120
there might be some kind of mental issue

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.980
I said this in a previous video

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.580
People who have mental issue or are just fucking psycho

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.920
will probably end up doing something bad whether they play violent games or not

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.480
A lot of them need help (and we all know how good the world is at dealing with people who have mental issues...)

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.740
Also can't some of the blame go t the parents who didn't realize their kid had issues

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.528
The same parents

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.320
who let their kid play violent video games from a young age

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.320
the same parents who don't monitor what their young child is doing on the net

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.200
or should we just blame the internet and video games

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.200
Last of all

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.520
if I ever lose it and go on a killing spree

00:02:46.953 --> 00:02:48.953
I would like you to blame it on the following things

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.080
Do you thing video games are to blame?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.860
Do you think the internet is to blame?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.740
Let me know what you think in the comment section

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.560
Also 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.720
I put a video out on my second channel yesterday

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.540
