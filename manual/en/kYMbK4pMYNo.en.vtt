00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.511
"Diverticulosis &amp; Nuts"

00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:09.068
Still, nuts are the best source of fat—

00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:13.360
but what if you have diverticulosis?

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.911
Doctors typically tell 
patients with diverticulosis

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.897
that they should avoid nuts.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:25.928
Diverticulosis is a disease caused 
by inadequate dietary fiber intake.

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:30.988
Just as if you don’t get enough 
vitamin C, you can develop scurvy,

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:35.728
if you don’t get enough fiber,
you can develop diverticulosis—

00:00:35.728 --> 00:00:40.460
which are outpouchings from your colon.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.761
When we don’t eat enough fiber every 
day to soften and bulk up our stool,

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.239
we may have to strain 
during a bowel movement.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.198
And after a lifetime of straining,

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:55.963
you can literally blow out 
these pockets from your colon.

00:00:55.963 --> 00:01:00.960
More than half of older 
Americans have diverticulosis,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.440
because people don’t eat 
enough whole plant foods—

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.481
the only place fiber is found.

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.781
This is what they 
look like on the inside.

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.940
This is what they look 
like on the outside.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.369
This should be a smooth round tube.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.559
And if one of these offshoot 
blow-out tunnels gets inflamed,

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.570
it looks more like this,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.462
and this.

00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:28.529
You don’t have to be a doctor to realize

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:33.289
that’s not what our 
colon should look like.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.913
And if we keep it up, 
it can eat right through,

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:41.681
and we can blow a hole 
in our colon and die—

00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:45.808
all because we ate too many 
refined foods and animals,

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:48.828
and not enough whole plants.

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:52.970
But, back to the original 
question, though.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.477
Sometimes, on autopsy, 
you can find nuts, seeds,

00:01:56.477 --> 00:02:00.500
or pieces of corn or popcorn 
stuck in those pockets—

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.250
which led to this theory that they may 
be what triggered the inflammation.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.298
So the conventional wisdom has been

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:11.809
to tell elderly folks to stay 
away from these foods.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.909
But at the same time,

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.661
the lack of plant foods caused the 
whole problem in the first place—

00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.359
so do we really want to 
tell people to cut down?

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.740
Well, what does the latest research show?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.468
Stay away from these foods:

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.690
fact or fiction?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.738
According to a landmark new study

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:35.816
in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association,

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:38.187
not only fiction,

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:41.049
but those with diverticulosis 
eating nuts and popcorn

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.559
had lower rates of inflammation.
