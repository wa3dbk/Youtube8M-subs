00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:20.706
Like that girl in the office, she’s like,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.608
“I could unbutton these.”

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.010
- Well, you unbutton ‘em?

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:25.578

00:00:56.578 --> 00:00:57.011
- Okay.

00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:58.845
Just a splash, or what?

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:00.246
- No, I can tell you when to stop.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:02.448
Just want to break up some of the alcohol.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.916
Little bit more.

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:04.918
Okay, perfect.

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:19.500
- Amazing.

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.268
And full of calories.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.905
- Shake it, and keep it sexy!

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.740
Make sure to get that cake mix dissolved!

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:28.508
Don’t let it bust all over you, okay?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.976

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.818
- Look at chunks.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.688
Chunks still in here, man.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.590
- That’s what my boyfriend says!

00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.823
(whimpers)

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:46.458
- Steve calls you chunky?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.293
To your face?

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:48.328
That is bold.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.895
Steve...

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:50.065
Watch out now.

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.165
- I’m just kidding, he doesn’t.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.500
He’s a gentleman.
- Really?

00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:55.935
- My dad, on the other hand,

00:01:55.936 --> 00:01:56.501
calls me fat.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.036
All kinds of fat names.

00:01:58.038 --> 00:01:58.738
- Really?

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.468
Is your dad slim?

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.641
- Yes.

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.610
He’s an asshole.
(Skyy laughs)

00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:05.078
- But he’s actually slim?

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.680
- Yeah, cause he’s a tiny Filipino guy.

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.615
Mm, sexy.

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:09.648
- [Skyy] Leave a little
space for whipped cream.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.418
Perfect.

00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:13.286
Excellent!

00:02:13.288 --> 00:02:14.086
- Yay!

00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:16.121
- Way to spill it every-goddamn-where!

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:17.323
- That’s your fault.

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.660
(both laugh)

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:21.928
When shit goes wrong this show,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.763
it’s your fault!

00:02:23.765 --> 00:02:24.631
- Whipped cream.

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:34.773
♫ You can’t stop the feeling ♫

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:35.508

early in your childhood,

00:02:45.553 --> 00:02:46.820

00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:09.210
You just kind of pour it down.
