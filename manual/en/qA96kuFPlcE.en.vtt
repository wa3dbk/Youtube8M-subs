00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:03.376
Everybody's getting on Facebook,
lots of people are Twittering.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:03.996
It's true.

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:07.216
In case you haven't heard,
social media sites like Facebook,

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.946
YouTube and Twitter are kind of a big deal.

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.266
And they're having a big impact
on the athletes who use them.

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:18.346
We've seen, in some cases where athletes
are using Twitter to reach directly

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:21.626
to their audiences, bypassing
traditional media altogether.

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:26.326
Having access to an unfiltered channel to
their fans can be a great thing for athletes.

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:29.986
But, depending on how they use
it, that can also be devastating.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.226
Journalist Rachel Blount, with
the Minneapolis Star Tribune,

00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:35.366
has seen her share of both examples.

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:39.926
We've seen other cases where athletes maybe
have made a misstep with these things.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.586
They've said something they shouldn't say

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:44.336
or they've tweeted during
a game and upset the coach.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:48.106
Those potential missteps are one of the
topics Blount and two other panelists;

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:52.416
Sports Journalism Professor Marie
Hardin and US Olympian Angela Ruggiero;

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:55.686
will cover during the Tucker Center
for Research on Girls and Women

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:58.186
in Sport Fall Distinguished Lecture series.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.686
I think it's going to be a great
give and take among the three

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.626
of us, because all of us are different.

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:07.876
Specifically with regard to women's sports,
Blount, and Tucker Center Director Mary Jo Kane,

00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:11.326
say the opportunities to
use social media are great.

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.646
We know that with respect
to the amount of coverage,

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:16.586
female athletes are significantly
underrepresented in the media.

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:20.466
But in social media forums like Twitter,
where the majority of users are women,

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:23.986
Kane hopes that female athletes will
take control of their own image,

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:28.156
not only to increase their popularity,
but also to improve what is being said

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:29.966
when women's sports are discussed.

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.216
An advantage social media
provides, because of the control

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:35.176
over the message it gives to athletes.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:40.936
The more that female athletes can
emphasize their athletic competence,

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:44.896
I think the more that that
message is communicated to people,

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.436
the more female athletes
will be taken seriously.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:52.366
Angela Ruggiero has taken hold of her social
media image with tools like her Twitter account,

00:01:52.516 --> 00:01:57.406
Facebook page and YouTube channel, all places
where she can speak directly with her fans.

00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:01.556
You can interact with your fans in so many
great ways now, because of social media.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:05.016
So, I'm wondering, how do you guys use it?

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.696
Does it help you, does it get your
brand out, does it get your name out?

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:08.776
Does it promote your sport?

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:10.856
What are the ways that you
guys use social media?

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:15.696
Ruggiero, a graduate student at the University
of Minnesota and three-time medal-winner

00:02:15.696 --> 00:02:20.396
for the Team USA Olympic hockey squad,
uses social media to banter with her fans

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:25.066
about tough practices and gearing up
for big games; a social media model

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.526
that Kane hopes other female athletes will copy.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:34.336
That this isn't just some whimsical,
pretty-girl, sexy-girl activity in life.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.106
And if you're talking about your nail polish,

00:02:36.536 --> 00:02:40.576
rather than the three-point play you were
just engaged in when the buzzer went off

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:43.976
and you won the Big Ten title,
I'd rather have you be doing that.

00:02:44.306 --> 00:02:48.326
The Tucker Center's Fall Distinguished
Lecture takes place Monday, October 19.
