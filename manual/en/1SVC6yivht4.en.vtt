cell on i think he made that decision a long
time ago

and is this is just one way of exhibiting
that decision

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.329
uh... is latest way

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.199

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.350
one russell crowe

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.340
a sum of money comes from the locational findlay
accent you couldn't americans to me of irish

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.460
but most of you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.820
what what do you think you are the most times
you but that is not seriously but that is

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.260
if the rest of our system

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.720
but he's a little bit brooks

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.880
uh... but it's solar

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.320
in other ellen but for him is that he has
been the strength really never since transfers

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.420
from if problem com he has

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.330
you know a march from

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.220
the south of france tata post's front and
back east in the great implies it is tom but

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190
he's been surrounded by other englishman

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.409
the english armies been polled greatly from
the bounds of the panels to the families of

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.719
and depending on which to star in the new
morbid

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.669
the leaders of boys will be going men between
weather is good for us is not a homeless person

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:22.900
supposed on style

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.720
and we just took the attitude that whatever
you understood about would be a bee sting

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.100
cure no about robin hood it was a previously
understandable mistake

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.810
so take some of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.610
the other people's narrative ideas and we
customer himself the nine lakhs leaf for example

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.720
has become synonymous with with robin hood
but we show you

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.420
wire that was

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.939
a simple mistake to actually say that isn't
he really was this men looks like you know

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.440
thereof

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.000
i'd just on the little dumbfounded he could
possibly fault and any alterations in that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.230
character that's

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.470
conduct ridiculous but it's just that we don't
have a woman on his own you're going to move

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.820
in english

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.920
how is gone from italian

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.770

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.430
button

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.989
and funny either as a serologist becomes the
desired at the moment he knows that sam

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.989
thus yes she didn't want to say the famous
line and gladiator in this book is come up

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.559

across the great awaits cigarette instrumental

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.589
robin hood can be seen from

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:44.299
hot stagnant had a good day and i love those
carriers why people get upset or whatever

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.179
greeted me that it was only a million times
better than if they decide on a little bit

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.730
about

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.869
where robin hood was problem whether he was
locklear box lee who cares right

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:56.720
with their is something

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.830
obviously in definitively

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.140
of russell crowe's that nowhere lavender praising
even ask anything offensive ballymena hard

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.520
question viewed any idea how quickly walked
off the set

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.110
he would have lost had walked and walked out
but the fact that happens i don't have a look

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.680
at a broadway you do it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.829
inappropriate lots of love

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.849
unleash hell but they are idle thank eager
to running down leads now right

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.779
reasons as for those that i wish and friends
are

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.379
into what was the palace pocket

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.629
as a guard policeman pilots are chart was
getting and that this witness at he sent a

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.129
follow up so that he covered i've done

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.150
your part

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.929
but at crazy copy

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:44.439
serbs twitching and shit way combat russell
building the robust growth one might be redacted

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.329
that there will come in as he is

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.370
unloved anybody there

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.419
and i love to for the first three-quarters
of robin hood

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.159
she walked out before that that's awful but
typically you'll really like the movie uh...

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.610
so i really cannot amused by all this stuff

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.970
but if you know i feel bad for interviewers
i guess who do care about this and i got probably

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.289
follicle what i'd right

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.099
that look here let me back up into a damn
thing it's russell crowe you could have said

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.719
to me

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.829
based outside the u dot dot

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.419
josephus anything it's obviously ready today

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.019
jason objected

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.100
partly about with a diesel

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.110
as low as a baby girl friend

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.559
look as though that since that day dot it
use them

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:29.600
was that you make it

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.410
jamaican

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.620
dot exploited afropop me

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.669
the fact that

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.189
etc like a of course i don't really care about
that they really i don't care that he was

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.719
still routes so that reporter but it's irritate
me like listening to it when he was rambling

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:44.650
on and on

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.729
about irrelevant things

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.309
assistant

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.430
isn't having so unbearable

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.110
latest answer the question or say something
about the comment about the irish accents

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.260
and i i think i was going for it this access

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.639
if you're an irish that's a little strange
but that's ok it's just that

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.800
outlook excel every

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.310
excel i can treat people however i want i
can stand that attitude then and if that's

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.909
the key part of the school bus not loose track
of what is it fair because

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:18.019
it these guys are so on a pedestal they've
sold loading a plannin on million miles above

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:19.000
the sky

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.780
that if you like for you know that's actually
not a million models like nine hundred ninety

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.739
sells the most important thing

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:29.419
pacts right value out value on russell crowe

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.529
why did you look at the kind of side where

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:32.320
okay

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.710
and it's like look you know what its

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.160
in sometimes when you keep doing this over
and over does affect our people the it doesn't

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.809
take your movies and so you know uh...

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.300
in some ways it was room for the bidyut and
vitamin that's on it

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.460
this is such an unbearable guy

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.030
but at the same time like said a real sectors
of the over the next movie anyway

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.849
if it does get off my ass

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.620
but yes anna did definitely unbearable and
it's definitely because everyone around them

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.930
is on pins and needles trying to please them
twenty four seven yes
