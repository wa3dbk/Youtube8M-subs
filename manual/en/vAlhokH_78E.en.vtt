"I'm Lisa Butterworth sometimes known as Kenzi
and I'm a henna artist and the owner of a

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.500
henna supply business, kenzi.com.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.240
Today I'll unleash your inner henna artist
and have you drawing henna designs all over

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.160
your friends and anyone else who will sit
still.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.890
Once you've mastered the basics of lines and
curves and start putting them together into

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.349
a variety of shapes then you can move on to
more fun stuff, like drawing vines and leaves

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.349
and buds.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.280
So that's what I'm going to show you how to
do now.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.289
So you start with a simple line, just laying
it down and then fixing any little breaks

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:44.289
like that.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.069
And then one of the simplest leaves to draw
is like this.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.639
And all I'm doing is squeezing and holding
the bottle in one place and then letting up

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.309
on the squeezing and pulling it out.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.389
And it gives you a really nice little leaf
shape very simple.

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:04.479
You can do a variation of this by having a
little stem then squeezing the bottle and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.530
holding it to create the body of the leaf
and then this just creating the tip of the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.530
leaf.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.220
So again create the stem, hold the bottle
in one place and then let up on the pressure

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.220
and just pull it out.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.300
And you can just kind of play around with
this and do a lot of different, little shapes.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.030
You can also do a line long, squiggly leaf
by squeezing it as you wiggle it.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.280
And then you can also do an open leaf.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.560
So you do your stem like that and just taper
it off and then you can create the outside

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.950
of the leaf like this.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.970
And you can do an empty leaf, just going like
that.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.409
So that's how you draw leaves and buds on
a vine and then also you can change things

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.840
up by creating a kind of curved vine like
this and then creating little leaves off of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
it.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.869
You can alternate them or have them right
across from each other, however you like.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.990
It's a really easy and really quick.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:22.779
This is the next thing that you should do
to practice to be a henna artist.
