00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:09.443
- (laughs) Don't try to be all sexy,

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.978

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.112
- Oh-kay kay kay!

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.247
Hi guys!

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.582
So, today we're making this,

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.451
this swimming pool.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.954
- (laughs) Alright,
okay, alright, alright.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.389
And can you guess with this right here?

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.057
This actually a bathing suit, okay?

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.592
It's awesome, it saw it down there.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.860
- So what?
- Got down.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.462
- It matches my heels.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:29.529
- It changed my life.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.932
Let's make this drink! (laughs)

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.468
Vodka, rum, you ready?

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.136
- Ready.
- Same time, same amount,

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.740
we're making babies, go!
(girl giggles)

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.209
Stop! (laughs)

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.477
- That was fun.
- Magical.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.078
- Magical.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.480
- That's love, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.914
It comes in a lot of forms

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.318
but alcohol helps. (both laugh)

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.822
- You don't even have to touch each other.

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:56.590
- Okay Inna hit that with some of this

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.958
condensed milk, okay?

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.259
Don't go crazy because I--

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.894
- As a child I used to eat--

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.895
- Okay stop!

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:02.662
Damnit.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.230
- Damnit.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.998
- We pour all in, gonna be sweet as hell

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:05.999
but it's gonna taste good.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.766
- Mmmm.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.768
- Okay.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.436
Now I'm gonna hit that.

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:13.106
I'm gonna nipple shake it.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.009
- Here you shake, let's see it.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:16.410
Go ahead.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.013
Let me see you shake it.

00:01:18.997 --> 00:01:20.147
You gotta shake your lower body.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.414
Look at this okay?

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.349
- Okay lower body.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.519
- Yeah go ahead.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.653
Body, body bod.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.488
That Russian twerk, okay?

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.190
Shit's global.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.161
- He thinks that (mumble)

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.295
- Pineapple juice.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.330
- Okay.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.732
- Ice.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.501
- Wooo.

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.636
Double the main ingredient.

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:43.570
Aaand.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.905
- Blend!

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:52.168
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:55.782
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.204
You have something wrong
with your metallics.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.689
(laughter)

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.125
And now we pour.

00:02:07.386 --> 00:02:09.362
- Now I want you to take this Blue Curacao

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.264
and just go around, okay?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.432
It's gonna sink, it's gonna sink.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.800
Okay stop.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.935
Stop.

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.570
We gonna let that flow.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.871
And you gonna watch it go down.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.472
- Wow, it's pretty.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.174
- And what you can do if you really

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.911
wanted to go is just push.

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.814
You see?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.617
So now we garnish this.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.553
- Alright.

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:34.421
- With our little pineapple.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:35.288
- And a cherry.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.923
- And a little cherry,
drop a cherry in there.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.592
And there you have it!

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:39.492
The Swimming Pool.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.261
It's all messy because
she wanted it like that

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.696
so I was like okay fine.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:43.363
You ready?

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.698
Go ahead girl, taste.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.850
- Okay.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.168
- I know that's sweet as hell.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.104
You can't taste by just because
of all the sweetness in it.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.039
Okay?

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.974
A diabetic delight.

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:55.108
- Mmmm.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:55.776
- You like it?

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:56.510
- Mmmmhmm.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.043
- It's good.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:58.345
- It's kinda like Pina Colada mixed with

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.846
like Sex on the Beach.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.049
- It is a Pina Coladaish thingy.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.252
Notice anything different?

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.086
Hah!

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.187
That's right homeboy.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.756
This is actually Inna's wet--

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.825
You wanna make a spin or
you don't wanna make a spin?

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.827
This is actually Inna's wetsuit, okay?

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.963
Now I was gonna have her do
the whole episode in it, right?

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.031
But then I was like wait a minute.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:19.466
If you walk out here in that,

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.834
haters are gonna hate and be like

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.836
"Oh my god she only
doing that to show off."

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.437
- And I was scared too.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.039
- Right but I was like okay whatever.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.575
We can end the show with you wearing it

00:03:27.575 --> 00:03:29.242
because it's your body and it's fine.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:31.077
- But you know there's
nothing crazy about it.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.846
You can see me like that
on the beach, you know?

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.380
- Yeah which beach exactly again?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.782
Where is the beach?

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.451
- It's all the Malibu beaches.

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:40.020
Sometimes Santa Barbara beach.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.788
- Okay why don't you tweet
it out before you go?

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.290
Just text me.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.357
- I'm not a tweeter.

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.492
Okay text, okay.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.493
- Just text me, you know?

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:47.861
And I'll tweet it out and we'll go to it

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.895
just so we can learn surfing.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.863
- Do you surf?

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:50.997
- I can surf now.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.700
(laughter)

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.502
You should ask me do you swim?

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:56.536
Bit like I swim now.

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:57.838
- Okay.

00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:00.307
- Tipsy Bartender!

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:01.574
Way to keep it sexy girl.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.976
That's an awesome wetsuit okay?

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:03.977
- Thank you.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:05.512
- I got a wetsuit drawer that same color.

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:06.480
We should go out on a date.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.381
That'd be awesome, okay?

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.983
- I don't think people will understand.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.117
- Tipsy Bartender!

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:11.952
- Bye!

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.119
- I look good in a thong.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.021
It brings out my eyes and shit.

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.256
Chicks tell me that.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:16.990
Yeah.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.058
- Left.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:18.692
- Go ahead.

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:19.459
- Right.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.794
- Go again.

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.096
(laughter)

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.197
- Very little, very little.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.166
- Brittney tell them
what we're making today!

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.134
- White Christmas Martini.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.502
- Exactly homeboy, okay?

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:30.470
Perfect for Christmas.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.705
Vanilla vodka.

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.474
Fireball, Amaretto all at the same time.

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:35.508
Go.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:36.543
- Oooh.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:37.711
It's like egg nog.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.125
And I feel like Christmas is home.
