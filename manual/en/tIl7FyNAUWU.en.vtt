VW 2.0T Audi R8 Ignition Coil DIY (How to
Install)

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.910
How are you doing? Paul from Deutsche Autoparts.
Today we're going to be going through installing

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.910
red Audi R8 ignition coils on a 2.0 TSI engine.
We're installing them on a 2013 CC. This would

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.630
also apply to any TSI engine which would include
Mark 6 GTIs, Mark 6 Jetta GLIs, Tiguans, Passat

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.230
also bunch of Audis that also have TSI engines.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.530
So we start by removing the engine cover on
a 2.0 TSI engine by pulling the corner. Any

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.530
corner will work just pop them up. If you
see here, each corners held on by a grommet

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.149
that mounts on to a bolt stud. It pop up and
pop on really easy.i

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.030
Alright, on a TSI engine you have 4 ignition
coils. Each one is held on by a connector.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.290
Each connector have a tab at the back of the
D, that's the push to release. Each coil has

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.540
a locking tab that this snap on to. So, what
you do is you push back on the locking tab,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.409
a lot of times you have to give a little wiggle,
and you slide it off, and you do that on each

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.409
coil, and you pop them off. Now, sometimes
this can get a little bit difficult. Once

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.229
you get that done you can slide all 4 off
and you can pull the ignition coil on its

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.900
off.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.830
After you've removed all the connectors, you
can pull the ignition coils out. Very simple

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.100
they just pull straight up. There are some
tools out there that you can use to remove

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.909
this. It will make your life a little easier
but it isn't required. You basically can pull

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.040
your fingers in between and its kind of pop
them up. You apply pressure even like in the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.350
top. You will often times end up with some
of these on ignition coils. This is pretty

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.320
standard that you'll find on an original equipment
coil that's being a car from the factory.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.320
So, that's where you'll remove them. And now
you've taken them all out.

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.959
I am going to go through and install them
into the vehicle. There are guides that will

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.079
lock in the place on the valve cover and there
are either side. So basically, you just slide

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.829
it down in and you are going to have to make
sure you apply a pressure to get them pop

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.829
over the spark plug. It will sound audibly
sometimes and they snap on to the plug like

00:02:53.169 --> 00:03:00.169
that. Now, we can put our coil harness back
on. When you're doing so, get them wind up

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.930
on to all the coils and then snap them into
place.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.510
You're all set. Now, you just have to grab
your engine and set them back in place. Pop

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.069
it on on 4 corners and you're all set.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.400
And that's how you install red Audi R8 ignition
coils on a 2.0 TSI engine.
