00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.009
In this video, we're going to take a look
at three different examples of how to preserve

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.649
skin tones while adding saturation to a photo.

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.330
so this first one's pretty easy because this
girl's pretty fair skinned, so there's not

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.560
a lot of orange and red in her skin so this
gets more difficult when people have darker

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.450
skin or have a strong tan.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.250
But let's take a look here, I'm going to bring
up a little saturation and some vibrance,

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.070
so if I was trying to really get this background
to be really strong, you know I might do something

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.579
like that so we've got these really strong
greens in the background, and we're starting

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.989
to get some red in her face.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.269
So the way to take care of that really quickly
is to go to hue, saturation and luminance;

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.070
make sure you're on saturation here, and then
click this little selector tool and click

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.870
in a part of the skin - I'm going to choose
this part because it's got a little more red

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.870
in it.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.010
I'm just going to click there and drag downward,
and see how it's selected the red slider for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.679
me and on some faces it's going to do red
and orange together.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.840
It may not do them at the same rate, but we
can see without that I've got a little more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.440
red in her face, and without, we've kind of
gone back to how it was to begin with.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.720
So in this photo I've already increased the
saturation and vibrance and you can see these

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.340
ladies have more of a tan and the skin here
is more orange, and over here is more red,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.450
so I'm going to again, come down to hue saturation
&amp; luminance, and I can either grab the selector

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.570
tool and just drag down.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280
Well here it's dragging red and orange together
equally, so I guess that would be fine.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.140
Um, if you have different people that are
very different, then you may want to do them

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.750
individually, but ah, that's, that seems to
work pretty well here as well.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.890
Here's before and after so just kind of helps
tone that down a bit.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.860
This last example is a little more difficult.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.270
We have a very warm skin tone and there was
a gold reflector on her.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.300
But the background is not very saturated.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:11.379
If I do the same thing here I could just increase
this and come down again; hue saturation luminance,

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.800
and we'll just pull that out.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.099
And that gets us pretty well back to normal.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.840
It's a little different here because this
post and the board is the same tone as her

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.959
skin so it's hard to decide how far to go
with that.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.640
I'm going to go ahead and reset that.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.090
There's another option we could do, and that
is to look at the image and decide what do

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.920
we want to increase, rather than just increasing
everything and then trying to tone down the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.920
skin.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.980
So again, Hue, saturation, luminance; I'm
going to increase blue and green, and maybe

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.980
yellow.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.510
I don't think we've got yellow in the skin
there.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.780
So let's try that.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.230
So here goes blue, so we get a strong sky
and we've made her jeans stand out a little

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.230
more.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.959
Green, we've got the grass.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.319
Here's yellow, so that adds a little more
in the grass.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.739
And now the only other thing I would do probably
is go to hue and just tweak the target of

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.980
blue a little bit so that we've got it a little
more of a true blue there.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.209
I like that better.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.219
So let's see before and after.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.209
So we made a really big difference and we
didn't even touch her skin at all in this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.209
case.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.590
Now the only other thing to finish this off
I would probably do a radial filter with a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.420
negative exposure.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.550
Just put the attention where we want it.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.299
