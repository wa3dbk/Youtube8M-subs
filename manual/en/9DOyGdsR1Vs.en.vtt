00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.220
Detective Yellievoicer

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.940
Once more, I was there!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.260
Detective Yellievoicer

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.160
At the "Ethereal Blue"

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.820
That place was a den of crime.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.560
Like a brothel disguised as a church...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.540
For me, the world has always been a dirty warehouse of cockroaches.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.620
A man like me in a place like this was always synonymous of bad luck for someone in the room.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.380
But they couldn't hide their discomfort with the presence of a man with an old hat and an overcoat.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.800
As I walked I beheld the human degradation...

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.880
Half of those young boys certainly weÂ´re addicts.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.220
The other half were dealers.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.060
Some of them were only night lazybones...

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.760
And I, as well, a common client.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.700
Anyway it wasn't because of that bunch of miserables that I was at that pub...

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.540
...it was because of Trevor, that dirt rat.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000
I starred at the barman and thought of ask for the good old whiskey.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.320
Please, a Bla...

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.800
I should have been going too much to that place.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.320
Trevor!

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.356
It was him.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.840
I though he was at the backroom with his gang planning their next dirty business.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.520
But there was no need for despair.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.800
He hadn't noticed that I was there.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.500
I pretended, quietly, that was putting my hands on the pocket to pick a lighter...

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.760
...when I was actually picking up my gun and my badge.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.120
Trevor, your arres...

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.800
PRIVATE EYE

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360
How did he recognized me?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.600
Anyway I've finished to take my drink to go after him avoiding arousing suspicion.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.180
Pandora.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.020
The gorgeous lady that corruptly hearts.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.700
Hardly she knew that I eavesdrop her from my office's window.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.940
Half of the cases that I picked had some relation with this fatal woman.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.381
But there weren't proves.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.480
Men and even women that had falled for her charm...

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.820
...ended up gaining a six feet underground.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.680
Never trough her hands, of course.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.980
I even understand those who were victim's of her savage claws.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.380
Even I could put to test my integrity,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.307
to take out her clothes,

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:05.920
kiss greedily her firm breasts, and then...

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.340
I never understood why did that always happened when I was in front of a woman.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.080
But I never let this small problem affects me.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.320
I expertly wear my hat to impress people.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.080
And made my way...

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.440
...as a passing unnoticed figure.
