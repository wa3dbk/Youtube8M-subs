00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.390
last night in the uh...

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.959
the bottom line is

00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:26.339
uh... and i talk to people for
massachusetts regularly people who tend

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.119
to vote

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.769
and john mccain

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.970
style republicans

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.930
which is basically what massachusetts
has to the extent that as republican is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.030
some tea parties there but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.809
uh...

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.450
for the most part

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.610
and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.680
there's like in a in massachusetts
there's their issues with women i think

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.420
and maybe there are never easy probably
are but i'll match is a little weird

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.180
and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.930
massachusetts is a lot more blue caller
ish

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.370
in sensibility that i think people real
ts

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.980
people of this notion of of masters is
being brahmin

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.830
of being uh... sort of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.380
you know

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.200
ivy league issue

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.460
that's really not the case across the
state

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.750
you have

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.680
a lot of industrial towns and
post-industrial towns

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770
and uh... fishing

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.770
pal stand

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.570
you know hierarchies east

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.820
iraq's he was the number one cruise in
ca

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.950
in massachusetts fab

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.950
i don't know what it is today

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.430
my experience matches is just very

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.400
blue collar

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.380
and nadia even to the extent that is now
while blue collar click uh...

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.950
you know like milk

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.000
it's a lot a light blue collar

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.129
was that the home the triple back

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.289
you know triple decker is

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:18.479
c_-three family home

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.879
like uh... you know it's like uh... we
call a townhouse

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.549
in new york but it's good

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.819
some of the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.959
anyways so

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.159
brown appeals to people

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.289
on a personal level because he's like
that he just sounds like

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.129
he sounds like everybody else in
massachusetts

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.489
elizabeth warren doesn't

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.439
she's got sheet you know i don't hear an
accent from her but i guess is that

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.790
maybe a little bit of an oklahoma nixon
tiny

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.120
but there's an absence

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.839
of a massachusetts accent

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.309
when you hear on stage and i really do
think that people

00:02:55.309 --> 00:03:01.299
massachusetts an incredibly parochial
stake

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.629
full of just a lot of perot killers

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.819
and

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.509
plays an out with that said i still
think elizabeth ones can win bag

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.689
in one of the reasons is gonna be

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.869
this is uh... this bull lies the reason
why

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.309
who's our model supreme court justice

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.499
uh...

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:23.569
we're gonna restarted

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.730
who's your models of premkumar justice

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.549
now this is going to catch

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.239
scott brown

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.409
uh... off-guard

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.749
because he doesn't think about this
stuff

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:35.809
and

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.209
when he's at home

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.559
to stock into his buddies we're talking
to the other republicans of course

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.709
we all know who they praise

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.079
the most bigoted

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.109
backward ass

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.669
burlesque

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.819
this is the case uska link abhi for
massachusetts

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.719
because he is this that type of guy he's
just in a whole

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.579
so let's so who's is modeled justice bur
remember now scott brown trying to put

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.059
our obligation in ten

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.379
like a vote for me scott brown is not a
vote from its mcconnell snot vote for

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.749
gemma uh... inhofe

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.169
not a boat for

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.740
every other right wing uh... devalued

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.900
in the senate or across country for that
matter

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.289
who's our model supreme court justice

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.430
uh...

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.430
missing here that's a great question
uh... finger justice system here

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.570
now he realizes like of all my god hold
my god

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.900
arguably that said this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.199
trinkets healers with warrants face

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.360
she's like

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.899
man this guy stepped in it

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:52.949
using course kelly is his favorite judge

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.749
and of course he can say that because
that reminds everybody y

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:02.379
voting for a republican senator from
massachusetts

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.830
give my love of the mit romney

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.849

independent here that you can actually

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.529
like this and i don't even think what we
have the ability of justice is out there

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:39.119
and i and i'm proud of the ones we have
this morning with that now this is on

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:40.930
