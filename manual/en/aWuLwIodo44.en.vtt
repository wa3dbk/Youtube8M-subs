00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.880
Welcome to Civilization: Beyond Earth. I am Master Control, constructed in Founding Year 122. 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.540
 I am a Wonder of this planet, created to provide colonial administrators with centralized control for the optimal functioning of their colonies. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.740
My capabilities are at your service.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.120
Since our peopleâ€™s settlement on this planet, we have grown from fragile beginnings into our full strength.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.220
 Soon you will have the capability to directly control the progress of a settlement, writing the future of mankind. 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:58.620
The fungal biomes of this world initially presented many challenges to us. Despite these divergent evolutionary patterns, we are now capable of sustaining Earth-based life on this planet, as evidenced by these Terrascapes. 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.020
These precious gardens permit Earth life to thrive here, and are a delight to our people.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.060
Our faction believes that humanity is good in and of itself. We believe that humanity holds a special place among the universe. 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.980
We transform worlds so that more humans may thrive without resorting to invasive cybernetics or alien gene transfusions. We are aligned with the Purity Affinity. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.780
Deploying Solar Collector satellite. This unit will increase energy yield near our capital.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.029
 Purity-aligned factions specialize in maximizing yield within their territories.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.049
Our culture thrives. We have the ability to develop an additional Virtue for our people.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.720
 By choosing Technoartisans, part of our cultural output will be added to our research total each turn. The expected outcome of this is to accelerate our research gains.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.800
I have detected an active threat. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:27.180
Native Species: Vivens Bestia Insulae. Colloquial name: Kraken. Defining features: Gigantism. Calcareous outer shell. Tentacles. Grinding chitinous beak.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.640
Largest known indigenous species. Right now this Kraken represents an imminent threat to trade and security. 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 Commencing attack with Naval Fighters.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.080
Direct combat suboptimal. Adjusting tactics. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.780
Aerospace fighters engaging. 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.539
Naval Fighters switching to ranged combat. 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.860
threat neutralized

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.820
I have detected a possible threat. Vadim Petrovich Kozlov, leader, Slavic Federation.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:46.280
Forces amassing near our borders. The Slavic Federation is aligned with the Supremacy Affinity. Supremacy believes that humanity needs to be independent of their planetary biosphere. Supremacy-oriented factions practice radical augmentation and extensive cybernetization, as opposed to our Purity Affinity.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.220
Kozlov likely intends to destroy our capabilities to terraform this planet.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.800
Opening direct diplomatic communications.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.370
Threat level elevating. My calculations have determined that a pre-emptive war declaration will give our faction the optimal chance for survival.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:25.539
Supremacy military forces rely on positioning and battlespace configuration for optimal attack. By disrupting their formations and using our orbital attacks, we ensure the survival of our forces.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.180
Declaring War.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.140
Deploying Aegis bipedal combat system.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.370
 Aegis specializes in fire support and anti-infantry operations.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.500
Planet Carver in combat orbit and awaiting orders.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.750
 Authorization for orbital attacks granted. Commence firing.

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:45.519
Deploying LEV destroyer. LEV destroyers offer unparalleled firepower and protection.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.440
Success is inevitable.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.680
By my calculations, Kozlov must either regroup his surviving forces or face destruction at our hands

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.780
We have achieved security for our people.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.880
How shall you direct the future of mankind? 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.399
Stand by to assume full administrative control.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.460
This is Master Control. I am terminating connection.
