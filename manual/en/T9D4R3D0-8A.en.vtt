00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.230
Blerio is a three year old Postier Breton

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.900
who was sent to us from France. He had run
away with a log behind him at home

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.100
and as his owner wants to give rides with him back in France

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.100
he needed to be safe, confident and happy
in what he was being asked to do.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.770
This film shows some of the things he
has achieved during his training with us.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.980
When we break horses to harness

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.420
we teach them to cope with many
different hazards because we believe

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
this gives them a good initial
preparation for what they may encounter

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.480
in their future driving careers.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.480
Here we are showing that Blerio can now be cantered in harness,

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.449
showing that he is not frightened of the carriage behind him.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.940
We also take him on grass

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.210
in a big open field to show that he will
behave just in a rubber bit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.250
in an environment which can be exciting
to horses.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.250
He will trot happily away from home when
asked.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.390
We then ask him to canter towards
home. Although using the reins on a horse's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.829
quarters is not considered technically
correct

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.679
because Blerio had had an incident at
home prior coming to us

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.240
where he bolted with a log on the long reins, we are demonstrating that he

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.789
will not panic or kick back

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.179
when the reins flap about around his quarters in the carriage. This is an

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.819
unusual feeling for a horse

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.490
so again, just like using the whip on their
quarters and not only on their shoulders

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.090
we believe horses should be prepared for plenty of different things

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.140
not just what is considered "normal".
Fletcher then asks Blerio to stop and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.860
stand still

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.860
before asking for a rein back. Bear in
mind that all this is being done

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.860
just in a soft rubber bit.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.299
Here Blerio is doing the hazards in our arena.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.590
if you plan to go to a show ground with your horse, they could have stalls, flags

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
bunting, crowds of people, maybe even
bottles left on the floor

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.280
that your horse or carriage could step on and it would make a noise.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.709
This is why we ask them to step over the barrels. They get caught up around the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.510
horse's feet

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.030
and make a noise, as the horse goes over them

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.630
and also as the carriage passes over them
behind, which is not the noise that the carriage

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.609
normally makes.

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.190
As you can see Blerio remains calm. If
you go to a driving trials event,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.489
again you could meet unusually
decorated obstacles

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.549
in bright colours, often with flags around
the obstacles, 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.750
or brightly painted signs. In indoor trials
you can also encounter pedestrian

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.090
crossing mats which we ask him to go over
here.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.319
If you're giving rides to tourists,

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.250
they could have rustling shopping bags; 
all of these things need to be

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.060
prepared for

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.060
and we believe this is better to do this
during their initial training.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.959
We also take Blerio over the bridge in our field. This shows that he is confident

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.260
enough to walk onto a different surface

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.260
as well as over the echoing bridge.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.160
 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.140
Blerio's owner came over from France to
drive him

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.140
prior to his return home.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.720
We also drove Blerio

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.360
as a pair,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.360
trandem,

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.160
and in a team.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.229
All this helps to improve
his confidence

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.960
both with other horses around him and
when he is out in single.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.720
