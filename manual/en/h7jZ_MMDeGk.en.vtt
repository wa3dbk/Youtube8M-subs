00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.670
Hi, I'm Ranger Lori and I have just a few
minutes to share with you a little glimpse

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.610
into the life of Grand Canyon’s top predator,
the mountain lion. Not only is the mountain

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.190
lion Grand Canyon’s top predator in every
habitat through this park, it’s also serving

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.380
a valuable role. Its helping to maintain the
ecological balance throughout this wilderness

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.379
ecosystem. Now, the lion, as our top predator
in the park, is also a skillful hunter. Weighing

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.249
up to 200 pounds and measuring in length from
6 to 8 feet long. This is an animal that is

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:44.730
capable of running 45 miles per hour, and
leaping 15 feet straight up in the air. Wow!

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.640
It has wonderful senses; great hearing, spectacular
vision. In fact, its vision is so good, it

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.079
can see with 1/6 of the light that you and
I need at night. It’s a wonderful nocturnal

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.639
vision. Don’t let that stop you from going
on a night walk while you’re here, though.

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:06.659
They have tremendous weapons as well. You
can see, cats have sharp retractable claws,

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.650
and powerful teeth. In fact, you can tell
by looking at the skull of the mountain lion,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.370
this is a true carnivore. We don’t have
molars, we only have carnassials, these are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.140
designed to slice meat up whole and swallow
it down. This is a nocturnal animal, or a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.800
corpuscular animal, that means it hunts in
the twilight. It uses silence, stealth and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.610
stalking to capture its food, typically by
ambush. There’s a lot of dining options

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.670
here at Grand Canyon National Park, both for
people and for mountain lions. Mountain lions

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.450
could start with an hors d'oeuver, like say,
a fox, or a ringtail, or even a javelina or

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.510
wild turkey. But, that’s just an hors d'oeuver,
they move onto a bigger course, something

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.340
like our mule deer, our elk, or even bighorn
sheep. Not an easy thing to do. Their food

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.770
is 4 or 5 times bigger then they are. And
their food – is armed. They’ve got weapons

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.200
and fight back. Hoofs and antlers and horns
that can crack skulls, puncture lungs and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.030
break ribs. This isn’t something we have
to deal with. In fact, when we wake up in

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.940
the morning, and open the fridge and reach
for the yogurt, yogurt is not usually trying

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.550
to kill us in the morning. So, it’s a good
thing mountain lions are such skillful hunters.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.160
Mountain lions are playing a valuable role,
here at Grand Canyon National Park. They’re

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.520
helping maintain the ecological balance throughout
this wild ecosystem. As they feed upon herds

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.430
of mule deer and elk, they help keep those
populations stable, which in turn, keeps all

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.620
of the vegetation stable, providing habitat
and home for everything underneath it. Now,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.440
it’s not just what mountain lions eat, but,
it’s what they don’t eat, that keeps them

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.209
such a valuable player here. Mountain lions
are picky eaters. If their food starts to

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.930
spoil, they don’t want to eat it anymore.
They will abandon their kill, which now provides

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.220
food, for all the scavengers that live here.
Things like foxes and weasels. Things like

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.090
ravens, turkey vultures, and even the most
endangered bird at Grand Canyon, the California

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.670
condor. Now, it’s not likely you’re going
to see this illusive animal. If you have a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.520
rare encounter, what do you do? Stand tall,
look big, don’t run, fight back, if you

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.010
must. While you’re here visiting us at Grand
Canyon National Park, again, you’re not

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.350
likely to see this secretive animal. But,
chances are, it might see you!
