00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.840
When mankind was created he was given a soul. This soul gave him the clarity to perceive the world around him and man prospered.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.309
But whatever created man also placed a soul devouring Demon upon the Earth.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.899
It's almost as if whatever designed man did not believe in his creation. The old one, with its insatiable appetite for souls.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
Lay in slumber... waiting.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.410
Completely naive, mankind learned how to unlock the potential of his soul and the world was united owing to the soul arts.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.989
Not much history of this time remains

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.869
But we know that mankind prospered under a benevolent rule

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.378
Perhaps by the Old King Doran, the people were happy time passed and mankind spread across the Earth.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.339
but the divine creator decided that there was a price to pay for progress. A lust for power awakened the old one, and a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.029
Colorless deep fog swept across the land spreading through the cities of man. Out of the fog came terrible demons

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.939
Hungering to Devour and reclaim souls for the old one

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.659
Mankind looked to face a steady extinction and soon over half the world had been erased by fog

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.319
But against all odds a few humans managed to lull the old one back to its slumber the fog retreated

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.800
But innumerable souls had been lost forever this event came to be known as the first scourge

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.730
in the aftermath of the first scourge the fabric of the world was unstable so monumental were appointed to the Nexus a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.499
Central point linked to six corners of the kingdom these monumentals sacrificed themselves and became half living sentinels of reality

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.450
With no immediate threat peace was had for a time the Soul Arts were banned, so the mankind would never awaken the old one again

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.640
But mankind has a short memory so he's destined to relive the past

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.050
One by one the monumentals died and they were not replaced

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.049
The kingdom of Boletaria rose again after the first scourge this time without the knowledge of the Soul Arts

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.199
Behind this Kingdom was King Allant the 12th

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.469
Magnanimous Ruler who cared for his subjects and fought valiantly

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.160
Against the remaining vile and depraved demons of the first scourge in his old age Allant became Melancholy

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.060
the Soul Arts had been forgotten by most, but they still existed and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.170
Eventually Allant discovered the Nexus and with a newfound thirst for power he went there and learned the Soul Arts

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.940
but who taught him

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.800
Trapped within the nexus along with the old one is an immensely powerful, Demon

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.599
Her powers date back to the first scourge where she was able to suck out the soul of any creature

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.650
instantly killing them a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.100
prisoner of the Nexus her powers contained

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.679
The candle maiden tends to the lights of the nexus and to the souls that are bound there we can't know for sure

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.640
Where Allant Learnt of the Soul Arts

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.929
But when he left the nexus he left with the ability to suck souls from the living with the revived knowledge of the Soul Arts

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.950
Boletaria experienced unprecedented prosperity and just like before the wheel of time began to turn again

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.820
King Allant wanted more no longer satisfied with his power

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.520
He took the black blade Soulbrandt a blade designed for Demonic souls in a desperate bid for power

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.399
he once more ventured to the nexus and this time awoke the long-Forgotten Old One from its slumber and

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.919
So began the second scourge the fog has spread out once more and the kingdom despairs

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.119
No one has heard from the king and the demons have overrun Boletaria as the fog spreads the rest of the world hears rumors

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.179
Warriors from other lands speak of the enticing power of Demon's souls, the demons consume the souls of humans

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.250
Enriching their own Demon souls and the power of a mature Demon soul is Beyond human imagining the fog will eventually swallow the world

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.830
But no one who enters the fog returns

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.039
But you need to enter for one of two reasons

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.570
Brave soul who fears not dark

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.569
I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.680
Shall guide you

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.179
So that you may lull the Old One back to slumber

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.940
Has the land found its savior or have the demons found a new slave
