00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.880
Well it's that time of year!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.590
High school students are searching high and
low for that perfect dress, I know it took

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.650
me awhile, if you're still looking style expert
Alison Deyette is here to hook it up.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.090
You did so well with these gowns!

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.960
I wish they had these choices when it was
our prom.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.470
Trends this year are poofiness and pink, a
lot more elegant and pretty!

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.470
We even have some reminiscent of Carrie Bradshaw
in Sex and the City.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:42.800
What I love is that two of our models are
from the Step Up Women's Network, all about

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.000
helping teens become confident and college
bound.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.550
It's also great social networking for women
of all industries.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.300
Gorgeous gown, part of Georgina Chapman of
Marchesa's line called Pearl at JC Penny.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.070
This dress is 250 dollars that makes me think
of Bradshaw!

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.140
Ballet pink, with a belt and great little
bag from H&amp;M.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.460
Here's a great interesting color, it's not
just blue, pink or white, its like sea foam!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.860
Alison: This is sea foam green worn by Christina,
and that was Markus our escort for the day,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.369
it is by Dalia Macphee who is a designer here
in LA.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.219
You can go, for 350 dollars, to Neiman Marcus,
daliamachpee.com or Nordstrom's, beautiful

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.040
jewels from jewel mint, gorgeous head to toe.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:59.600
These are great, appropriate dresses that
are not hoochie prom.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.599
This is Autumn, who is part of a dance troupe
with her mother, this a gorgeous dress from

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.379
David's Bridal.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.580
This is what they call their "cut-glass" embellishment.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:26.880
Very affordable 199-229 dollars, great from
David's Bridal.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:39.140
This short dress is a great option because
she can wear it in a few years, also from

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.900
the Pearl line by Georgina Chapman, 110 dollars.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.620
Poofy, fun and polka dots with great heels
from Chinese laundry.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.230
I just love all the accessories again from
jewel mint but very fun and flirty.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.700
We are not trying to age these girls, she
is actually also one of our Step Up teens!

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.310
All the hair today was done by the Private
Room in Beverly Hills, we got what's called

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.239
the Locks Lab "Falling in Love" hair pieces.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:26.450
This is a dress available at Sear's, this
is Christel also in the dance troupe, 118

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.280
dollars by City Triangles with fabulous Shoemint
heels.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.530
Again, it is all about being appropriate and
fun, getting a chance to look older but still

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.950
look age appropriate.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.090
Can we get one more look at all you girls
as I brag about Alison Deyette because she

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.349
always picks the best items for us.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:59.019
