00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.840
And the fish swam together in the ocean forever.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.400
Wow that was such a good story [yeah!]

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.069
Hey guys, I'm Jessie and these are my boys Diego and Zion.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:18.280
We love reading together. Reading with your kids is awesome but there's also so many other little tricks you can do to make it even better.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.477
Talking about the book cover for instance is one of them. Here, I'll show you how.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.960
[piano] [baby giggles]

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
All you have to do is ask a few questions about the cover and describe some of the things you may have noticed.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.880
And before you know it, your kids will be so excited to read and so much better at critical thinking.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.800
Check it out.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.460
Alright, so what do you guys think this story is about?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.980
About two fish, one's alone and one's happy.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.027
One's alone and one's happy? What about you Zion, what do you think the story is about?

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:55.547
[mm] Somebody is trying to get fishes?

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:57.547
Somebody is trying to get fishes?

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:08.087
Learning to predict what will happen is such a huge reading skill. Even asking the  simplest questions about the characters, and the mood, will help your kids develop that skill.

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:10.007
Who do you think caught him?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.700
A boy?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.480
A boy? So do you think it's going to be a happy story or a sad story.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.760
[together] Happy.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.540
Yeah, what's going to make it a happy story?

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.140
[He's happy] He's happy? Even though he's in the net?

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.060
Okay, what do you think Zion?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.180
Maybe he's in the water playing?

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.689
Yeah maybe he's in the water playing, yeah that's good.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.692
Before we read any book now, we talk about the author and the illustrator.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.380
It's such a great way to show kids that books come from people's ideas, and their work.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.100
This book's called "Hotdog Car"

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.840
Do you see the hotdog over here?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.540
It's a hotdog and they made some wheels and they made some of that.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.880
Yeah so this story is by Louise Pattel and it's illustrated by Patsy Chen.

00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:58.831
Is he clapping his hands in the car?

00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.770
He might be... but probably not. He's driving so he's steering the hotdog wheel.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.670
So um, what does an illustrator do?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.350
[um] Do you know?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.900
Draws the pictures?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.840
Yeah, the illustrator draws all the pictures and they color the pictures, that way it's really exciting to read.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.320
Do you think the illustrator used crayons, markers, brushes [nah, crayons].. crayons? What do you think?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.260
I think...

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020
Brushes, like paint brushes?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.740
I think... I think... I also think um... sharpie.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.940
Sharpie, possible, maybe a thin sharpie around the hotdog part but these are really cool bright colors.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.901
Yeah, we're gonna read it together.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.754
When we talk about authors and illustrators, my kids see that they can also write and illustrate too.

00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:58.774
It's amazing how such a simple conversation may inspire them to make their own books.

00:02:58.774 --> 00:03:02.054
The great thing about book covers is that you can talk about anything.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.960
When Zion only knew a few words, I'd ask him about colors, shapes and basic objects and while we did that, he worked on his vocabulary.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.280
You can mix it up and ask different questions depending on your child's age and their interests. Just make it fun.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.724
These are like really bright colors, right?

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.610
Yeah [and there's a little bit of dark here]

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.090
Yeah its got some dark blue in there... some aqua...

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.090
It's like the ocean, remember the ocean? [blue, orange, grey, green?]

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.000
What's grey?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.220
[the net] The net is grey. That's good. Do you see some shapes in here?

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.600
Oh yes. A circle, an oval,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.480
They have the "O"which looks like a .... right!

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.000
A tiny bitty circle?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.020
Yeah looks like a little circle for the eyes.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.240
Diamond and squares.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.884
Yeah, diamond and square. That's... I didn't even see that. That's good.

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:54.384
A long rectangle.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.500
A long rectangle, that's right.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.670
[a long rectangle]

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:05.670
And there you go: book covers. A great chance to get your kids excited about reading, writing and illustrating.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.660
So make sure you take a picture, or a video of you talking book covers with your kids and hashtag it "Mother Goose Club."

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.060
We love when you subscribe and when you comment. So show us the love, and catch other tips and activities on other Show Me How videos.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.748
And hey, keep rocking that reading time. Catch you later.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.780
[Three two one! Pow!]

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.220
This is a great way...

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.820
for something... cause [gibberish]

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.900
They can illustrate and uhh!

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.080
They can tell uhh!

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.280
[hiss]

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.240
[grunting]

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.091
Reading books is... that's not even the line.

00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.365
That's not what you told me to say [laughs]

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:46.945
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's wrong.

00:04:46.945 --> 00:04:48.059
Here, ill show you...

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.300

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.120
[ss] You can...

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.920
[ahh] That confused me more [laughs]

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.680
[yells] This is a dad with three kids, right here.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.743
After a while it's like "dude"

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.500
[laughter] Get off of me.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.840
We got this!

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.440
Sorry. Tons to talk about.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.140

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.131
Alright here we go. This is it. This is it.

So keep rocking that reading time.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.290

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.070
