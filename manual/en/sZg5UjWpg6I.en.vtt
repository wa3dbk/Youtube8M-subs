00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:11.030
Nicknamed "Our Best" feeder, the Perky-Pet®
30-ounce no-drip hummingbird feeder is a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.320
traditional bottom fill feeder
classically designed with easy to fill

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.170
features and durable hardened glass.
Remove the product from the box and set

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.800
the pieces on a tabletop or counter.
Remove the plastic covered wire hanger

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.980
from inside the bottle. Before the first
use, wash all the feeder parts. There is

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.970
no need to remove the perch around the
base, but if you do, you will need a small

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.220
screwdriver or socket hex wrench. Wash
the feeder parts in warm soapy water,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.090
rinse thoroughly, and dry.
Reattach the perch if it has been

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.700
removed. You're now ready to fill your
feeder. It's suggested that you fill your

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.450
feeder outdoors or over the sink. First
prepare the nectar as instructed.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.700
Refrigerate any unused nectar.
Pour the nectar into the bottle opening.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.650
While upside down, place the reservoir
base onto the bottle opening and turn

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.250
clockwise until firmly seated.
Quickly turn the feeder upright.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.300
If you filled your feeder in the house,
you may want to carry your feeder

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.060
upside down until you're out in the yard.
To prepare for hanging, tie a knot in one

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.160
end of the plastic-coated wire. Pass the
other end of the wire through the hole

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.170
in the cap. Place the cap on the closed
end of the bottle, and turn the cap until

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.040
firmly seated.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.520
You can now use the wire to attach to a
chain, branch hook, or other hanging

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.600
device or simply wrap the wire around a
small limb.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.640
It is important to change your nectar
every few days. When left in the hot sun

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
for extended periods of time, the nectar may ferment, becoming unhealthy and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.700
unattractive to birds.
To complete your hummingbird feeding

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.040
needs, Perky-Pet® provides a wide variety
of hummingbird nectars. With its

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.420
