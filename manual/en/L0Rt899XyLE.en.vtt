*laughing*

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.760
Agh!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Haha

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.660
The chaos dragon mob! I'd never thought I would see it.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.540
The most legendary shot in all of ping pong...

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.340
The spin is pure chaos. Look at how it defies even the laws of physics...

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.980
BOOM! Yeah!

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.180
...every movement, every twist is completely unpredictable.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.740
...the thousands of scrolls of the Shao Lin monks. Only one man has ever returned.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.580
