00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:01.778
Philornis downsi:

00:00:01.778 --> 00:00:03.805
Searching for a Solution

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.868
My name is Piedad Lincango

00:00:08.868 --> 00:00:11.354
and I work for the Charles Darwin Foundation.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.943
We are studying an invasive fly

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:16.788
called Philornis downsi

00:00:16.788 --> 00:00:20.183
that attacks the newborn chicks

00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:22.043
of different species of birds

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:24.320
such as the Mangrove Finch,

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:29.474
which has fewer than 100 individuals remaining in the wild.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.523
The fly locates nests

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.319
and then lays its eggs inside.

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:37.600
Larvae emerge from the eggs

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.589
and feed exclusively on the blood of newborn  chicks,

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.695
which can lead to their death.

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:48.609
We have found up to 100% chick mortality in nests.

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:51.383
Finding a control method

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.210
for this fly is a high priority for

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.412
the Charles Darwin Foundation.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.914
We have groups of experts working with us

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:03.119
from many countries.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.945
We also have

00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.978
a large group of Ecuadorian scientists

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:09.821
working on this problem.

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.226
At Charles Darwin Foundation’s

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:14.163
Insect Containment Facility

00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:16.605
we are carrying out different studies.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.662
Possible solutions

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:22.009
for controlling the fly include

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:25.965
biological control using natural enemies

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:29.350
such as small micro-wasps

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.416
that act as parasitoids.

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:34.426
Another possible control method

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.896
is the use of attractant odors

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.604
such as a pheromone.

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:41.802
If we discover an odor that works,

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:43.755
we can use it in traps.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.707
We might also be able to

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:47.458
release this odor into the environment

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.488
and confuse the flies.

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:55.820
This way, males won’t be able to find females.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:59.473
There is another potential control method for the long-term

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:03.255
which is the use of sterile males.

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:07.489
However, for all of these control methods

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.331
it is imperative that we can rear this fly

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:12.790
in laboratory conditions.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.679
My name is Johanna

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.712
and I work for the Philornis project.

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:21.836
Right now I'm going to pour

00:02:21.836 --> 00:02:23.676
papaya juice into this trap

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.660
to attract Philornis

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.696
and later we'll return to take

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.020
the flies to the lab.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.180
One week later

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:34.962
I'm Daniel Cedeño

00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:37.868
and I'm about to check the traps

00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:40.294
and take the flies to the lab.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.752
These flies are collected in the field

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:47.190
and then we rear them in the lab

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.895
to carry out experiments.

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:51.821
This is a complicated procedure

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.207
because it's the first attempt at rearing

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.193
flies that feed solely

00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:01.384
on the blood of newborn chicks.

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:03.928
In the lab I'm working on

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:08.064
mass rearing Philornis downsi;

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:10.865
collecting its eggs to obtain larvae,

00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:13.596
feeding them,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.002
providing the correct temperature for their growth

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:19.738
and monitoring the whole life-cycle of this fly

00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:21.946
to eventually find a control method.

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:25.037
If this invasive species

00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.499
is not controlled quickly

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.765
it’s possible that in a few years time

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.141
the Mangrove Finch will become extinct.

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:36.015
If we manage to rear flies throughout the year

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.828
we can gain really valuable information

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:40.734
that will later allow us

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:42.579
to find a solution

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.316
and apply it in the field.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.442
Controlling this invasive fly

00:03:47.442 --> 00:03:48.715
is a great challenge

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:50.535
but we can do it!

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.568
Our work is possible thanks to the support of scholarship students

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:54.505
and local, national and international volunteers.

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.978
We also thank our international collaborators for their indispensable contributions.

00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:59.777
This project is carried out in collaboration with:

00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.693
and is financed by:
