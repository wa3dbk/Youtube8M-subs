How's it going today, guys? Robby, coming
at you from the House. Today we're talking

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.871
about the 2011 Jeremy Jones Boot. A nice mid-line
boot, especially formulated for those of you

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:19.540
who are looking for a mid-line boot that's
going to be a little bit softer. It comes

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.590
in at about 5 on the support level. It's going
to be awesome for the park. Or, even if you're

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.780
looking to hit more of a back-country side
of things, it'll still perform well in there.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.460
It's pretty much a take-it-anywhere-on-the-mountain
kind of boot. A couple take-homes for this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.039
guy is, you're going to have double-stitched
seams all the way across the boot. It holds

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:44.640
up really nicely. You're also going to get
the reduced foot size. So instead of, if you're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.520
wearing a size 10, it'll look like the foot
is going to have, say, a size 8.5 or 9 on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.320
there, so you don't have to worry about as
much toe-drag and things like that. Also,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.850
what we're going to get on the foot-bed here,
we're going have a nice lightweight foot-bed.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.320
It's called the Park Fit. And what it is is,
it's just going to be lightweight and a lot

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.960
more cushion coming underneath your foot,
so a little more shock absorption for those

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.280
of you who are coming down from big jumps
or just really landing quite hard on your

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.790
feet there. It's also going to have B3 Gel
in your heel and right underneath your foot-bed

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.030
so that you can have even more cushioning
from that side of things. In terms of the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.540
liner, you're going to have the traditional
lace-up. And then, as well, you're going to

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:40.500
get the Flex 2 liner on the front, which is
going to be, basically, a nice high-end liner

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.440
on there that's going to custom mold to your
foot. And you can tell that it looks pretty

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.680
techy on that side of things. But it's definitely
also going to have the Velcro on the front

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.400
here that will make it so you don't have to
worry about if it's not going to fit exactly

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:04.140
right with your foot. Like I was saying, definitely
a nice boot overall. And it's good for any

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.369
sort of rider who's looking for, basically,
a boot to take them anywhere in the mountain,

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.450
especially if you're sitting in that intermediate
or advanced level. So go ahead and check it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.500
out, it's the 2011 Jeremy Jones Boot.
