Hi, I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about some tips for painting a ceiling.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960
Now we are actually re-painting this bathroom
right now and in this particular application

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.230
we've been working on this we've actually
got the ceiling that we are painting the same

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.419
color as the walls. Now, if you are going
to be painting your ceilings in a white and

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.810
have it different from the walls then what
we want to do is we want to get some masking

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:38.550
tape and we want to prep the area by actually
taping off the ceiling. Now, if this is something

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.750
that you are going to do in a day or a weekend
then just using a standard masking tape is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.550
fine, now if painting your ceiling is going
to be over an extended period of time then

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.579
you'd want to use the extended release tape
which is the blue tape or the green tape you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.270
can find in your hardware store or home improvement
store. So what we want to do is we want to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.740
line this tape up and we want to make a straight
line right at the corner and the most important

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.409
thing is to get it consistently as straight
as you can along the edge of the ceiling.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.231
We'll just do a small section just to demonstrate.
It doesn't necessarily have to be all of the

00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:29.670
way up into the corner it just needs to be
consistently the same distance. So as we paint

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.759
this we will get a nice consistent line all
of the way around. The next thing to do as

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.860
you are painting your ceiling is to make sure
that you have the right tools. What we will

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:54.149
do is we will come in first and using our
ceiling paint, we will actually trim, or cut

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.049
in, and you what to do at least a couple of
inches from your corner as you are going to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.000
be doing with a brush and once you have done
that you can come back with a roller. Using

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.480
a roller mounted to the pole, such as this,
where it just screws on is going to be your

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:23.870
easiest way to paint a ceiling that is up
over your head. So the important things to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.940
consider when you are getting ready to pain
a ceiling is to make sure that it's prepped

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.709
correctly, that you have it taped off, and
that you are using the right tools as far

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.069
as a pole and a roller and you will be able
to do a good job. I'm Tim Gipson and that's

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.120
tips on painting a ceiling.
