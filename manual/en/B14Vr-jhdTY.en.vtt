Hi guys, welcome back to Fuji. In this episode
I'm going to try and show you guys shift lock.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.340
Shift lock is a technique that real drifters
use. It's when they shift down a gear to break

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.760
traction in the rear and get the rear end
to step out. And in Gran Turismo it's kind

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.609
of hard to do because there's no real clutch
per se unless you're lucky enough to have

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.780
a G25. But I do find that the technique shift
lock does work in Gran Turismo as well. So

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.039
let's try and demonstrate it for you. Shift
lock, you're just going to be in one gear

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.190
higher than you would for the corner and just
shift down to the lower gear right as you're

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.920
entering the corner, and that should step
the back end out. And it will come around

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.320
on you. And it's primarily used on high speed
corners. Doing it on low speed corners or

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.199
high breaking corners is kind of tough. So
let's try and demonstrate shift lock for you

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:12.960
on this next fast corner. We're going to be
in one gear higher. And right on entry you're

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.590
just going to shift down into the recommended
gear, and that should step the back out and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.030
get us sliding. So one gear higher, shift
down right as you're entering the corner,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:44.170
face through the right like so. Higher gear
shift down. Oops. So I'll show you on this

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:51.600
final corner at Fuji. Just want to be a gear
higher, shift to the lower gear, and that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:05.770
steps the back out like so, and start your
drift. So shift lock is a technique that usually

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:16.400
works if you know what gear corner to go in.
Once again, it's primarily used on those fast

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.870
corners where little braking is needed. So
on these corners where you have to break hard,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.605
I usually don't try and shift lock. Usually
we stick with the other techniques like feinting

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:38.290
and power over, and feather and throttle through.
But this corner that we're going to enter

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.799
is a good corner to demonstrate shift lock.
So let's go in a higher gear than is necessary

00:02:44.799 --> 00:03:08.980
right before we turn in, shift down, and that
gets the back stepped out. Oops. So let's

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:22.050
try in on this low speed corner. Does get
the back out and you simply catch it and accelerate

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.730
through. So practice shift lock by yourself
while I'm on fast corners or wherever you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.680
feel like you need little braking. It does
just break traction right as you enter the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.500
corner. So you just want to be in a gear higher,
right before you just want to shift down,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.909
and that gets the back sliding for you. So
this is just another way to initiate your

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.559
drifting.
