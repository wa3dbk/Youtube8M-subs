00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:29.581
Did you win something at the lottery?
- No. You?

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:34.671
No. Fortunately, we have a nice job.
- Then why are we driving this car?

00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:37.878
Because we have a nice job.
- Yea, that's it.

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:45.589
Why did we start in this car and not the
Vanquish? Put your hand on the Affalterbach logo.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.980
That's warm.
- Does it have a high drivetrain?

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.367
No. It has heated seats with vents and massage
function. You can inflate it to make it smaller.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.547
It also has heated armrests.
I can't live without these anymore.

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.316
It's fantastic.
- It's nice.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:21.993
If we did win it, an S-Class coupe is the ultimate
f* you statement towards those who wanted a lift.

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:27.761
It's OK with 2 people. We're with 3
people now. Martijn, lift your legs.

00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:30.950
Hello. Help.
- He's sitting sideways.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.357
I'm tall, Casper has room as well, but even when
you move the seat forwards there's no space.

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:39.085
This is the most ridiculous car ever.

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:43.498
Yes, it is. Remove the rear seats.
If you did win...

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:54.179
The first thing we do is go to Autoblog.nl
and find something expensive I can afford now.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.247
#Wewonthelotery.
- #Ftheworld. What would you buy?

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:07.349
Would you buy an S63 coupe?
- It is very good.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:15.032
It sounds great, it's extremely fast,
although this one is limited to 159 mph.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:26.748
It has 577 hp, 159 mph... Go. It's shifting up. All
the junk on it makes for almost autonomous driving.

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:35.423
Seats with massage function, the satnav...
I can do pinch to zoom on the touchscreen.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:47.713
It works fantastic. At the same time, which brand
is named when you're talking about dream cars?

00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:54.152
We do that at P&amp;R. What would you
buy if money is no objection?

00:02:55.305 --> 00:03:02.246
Mercedes didn't make the list.
- Aston Martin was named a 1,000 times.

00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:16.910
What's that yellow blinking light?

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:23.768
That's traction control. Doesn't it have AWD?
- No. Do you?

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:26.463
Yes. It's ideal.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.372
It's cold. The armrests are so cold.
- The seats are heated to grill level.

00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:41.813
No problems here.
- The seats are still not very comfortable.

00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:47.928
I think you're sparing the seats'
feelings. They sit like crap.

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:56.595
The specifications. A 6-liter V12.
- 5.9-liter.

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:00.867
It does 0-62 mph in 3.8 seconds.

00:04:03.441 --> 00:04:08.661
Mine does it in 3.9 seconds, and it was way
faster. Even when you made a false start.

00:04:08.661 --> 00:04:12.190
It's cold and winter tires. 4Matic.

00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:28.903
First, I only hear... Then it starts to grip.

00:04:29.322 --> 00:04:34.139
It's faster, in theory.
- This does?

00:04:34.888 --> 00:04:39.024
201 mph.
- Wow.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.455
We did 171 mph, but that makes me nervous.
- It sounds great, though.

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:09.260
Is this a real dream car? Everyone
goes nuts about Aston Martin.

00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:19.090
In recent years, Aston Martin... They all
looked the same, not much was new.

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:24.559
I think this is a very pretty car.
- Very pretty.

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:31.105
Who still builds a naturally aspirated V12?
Everyone stops, but they continue. At least for now.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:38.854
It could be that your engine
sits there in a few years.

00:05:39.913 --> 00:05:42.980
Mercedes and Aston Martin will work together.
- They will.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.897
For as long as it's possible, I think it's wonderful
we can enjoy a naturally aspirated V12.

00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:03.258
Which car would you pick to
drive for the rest of the year?

00:06:04.714 --> 00:06:21.938
As a daily? The S63. I don't think it's smart
to drive it to the supermarket every day.

00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:27.830
I'm checking if there's room for a Maxi-Cosi.
I haven't driven this car much.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.533
It's so sexy. You've been driving it.
- For a day.

00:06:35.434 --> 00:06:40.320
I think...
- You were thinking "Do we have to shoot all day?"

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:47.283
It's not that bad. As a daily it's a difficult car,
but who buys it as a daily? No one does.

00:06:47.283 --> 00:06:50.840
You could buy an S63 as a daily.
Maybe that's the difference.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.338
You can buy the S63 as a daily driver.
It's also "cheaper".

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.786
Slightly. 100,000 euros or so.

00:07:00.434 --> 00:07:06.071
Seriously? That one was 210,000 euros last
year and now it's 214,000 euros or so.

00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:16.697
It has features like Swarovski crystal headlights.
3,800 euros. For in your headlights.

00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:27.688
It's 240,000 euros, with current prices maybe a bit
more. Let's say, for 250,000 euros it's full-option.

00:07:28.424 --> 00:07:31.709
Including a perfume thing in your glovebox.

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:40.536
This one was over 300,000 euros last year.
They didn't dare say the price of this one.

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:45.974
It doesn't matter. If you buy a car like this,
it doesn't matter what it costs.

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:54.138
You'll be looking at this one. It's sexy. The
other one is just an S-Class with 2 doors less

00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:56.642
and Laguna coupe taillights.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.500
