00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.700
This video will focus on the proper way to spray GOLDEN's archival MSA varnish, make sure your spray area has good lighting and ventilation!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.989
It is critical to create as dust-free of an environment as possible,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.179
Clean the immediate surrounding area before varnishing, reduce any blowing air

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.870
Whenever possible as this distorts the spray pattern, and can

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.349
Impact the evenness of the spray varnish. A cardboard wedge

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.779
helps to angle smaller artwork to make it easier to see the varnish being applied. As with the background

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.699
surfaces, cover the wedge with clean paper to help further reduce dust in the spray area.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.509
It is strongly suggested to use a NIOSH approved respirator equipped with filters suitable for mist and organic vapors

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.719
especially with spraying indoors. This test paper will be attached to the sprain wedge using low-tech painters tape.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.819
For heavier objects such as a stretched canvas

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.920
Use plastic items like these jar lids to raise the canvas from the table surface.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.080
Be sure to properly shake your varnish can for two full minutes prior to use.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.889
To remove the cap use a paint can opener in the opening of the cap or just muscle it off by squeezing on the sides

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.520
of the cap while twisting.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.500
GOLDEN archival varnish comes equipped with a fan spray top this tip can be

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.219
Adjusted this change the elliptical spray pattern from the factory the preset position is ideal for spraying side to side,

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.689
Turning the inner spray tip 90 degrees is ideal for spraying up and down,

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.139
but diagonal spraying is also possible. A distance of 10 to 12 inches reduces lapped lines and runs.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.019
to reduce spattering and uneven build-up

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.680
Always start and end the spray pattern off of the artwork move the can at a constant rate of 1 foot per second.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.379
In starting by spraying directly on the piece or even hesitating while spraying is likely to create runs and drips in the varnish layer.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.970
In most instances the easiest method to coat the surface is side-to-side and overlapping the sections as you move downward

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.619
When spraying is complete turn the can upside down away from the artwork and spray for a few seconds this clears the valve stem to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.410
Reduce spattering the next time that you spray. Immediately

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.410
Wipe the spray tip to remove any varnish allow each layer to dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.639
There are no issues with waiting longer. While one could turn the inner spray tip,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.780
Smaller works can simply be turned on their side for the next coat of varnish shake the can for an additional thirty seconds before spraying

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.869
between coats. If you waited longer than 20 minutes shake for the standard two minutes.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.540
Repeat the spray patterning for each coat.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.179
On larger works be sure to shake the can for a little while for every 30 seconds of spray.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.299
If you are working in an area that isn't so clean or where there may be a lot of dust or insects in the air,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.600
Consider creating a drying cover for the work.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.100
This example is made from a cardboard box with openings on all sides a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.949
Cheesecloth type material was then taped inside be sure to measure the cover to easily fit over the work.
