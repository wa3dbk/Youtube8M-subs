00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.750
We are about to do the blood draw for the PRP using the platelets that are found in

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.540
the blood, we concentrate them and we use
them to produce these growth factors in the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.750
skin as we inject it into the areas that we
want them to repair and rejuvenate. It helps

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.269
to bring in new blood vessels, new collagen,
new elastin and really is a true anti-aging

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.540
process. We are about to start doing the non-invasive
Thermi tight treatment and what's amazing

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.690
is we can do all the way up into the eyebrow
and the eye lid so we can get an eye lift

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.020
without having to cut. We are going to do
the lips to improve the lines here and to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.430
improve the skin around it. We are using the
infrared camera to monitor the treatment area

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.480
and once we get to the end point of the treatment,
we stop in that area and we move to the next

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.180
area. The monitor shows us over here that
the skin is heating up very nicely. It takes

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.340
about 20 to 30 minutes to do one half of this
face. We can then look and see the difference

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.549
between one side and the other.
The same Thermi Tight device can be used all

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.970
over the body. It's not limited just to the
face and the neck. One of the great things

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.040
about doing the Thermi Tight treatment, not
only do you see the immediate change in the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.330
skin, but it continues to do a cellular change
over the next 3 to 6 months and you continue

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.409
to get improvement.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.409
Right now I'm feeling soothing heat on my
face. It's actually nice.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.540
I'm just going over each area at least 3 times
and getting it up to the set temperature;

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:59.189
you can already see some improvement in her
lines.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.439
So we just finished half of the face and as
you can tell the eye has lifted, the lines

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.829
are less prominent, so we are going to start
now on the second side. One of the great things

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:17.720
about this technology is that it can be used
on all skin colors because we are not doing

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.470
anything to the skin surface, is all working
underneath to tighten the collagen. Now we

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.390
are about to start the Thermi RF portion.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.099
So I'm just prepping the skin with some betadine
to sterilize the skin.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:48.010
Doing a little bit of numbing here. You’re
going to feel a little pinch. It’s OK? Where

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.260
I'm treating now on the jowl area, you can
see that it is heating up and it's becoming

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.140
white and it's telling me what I've treated
and what I've not treated, so it's a great

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.360
guide that tells you exactly where you need
to be. On average anywhere between half hour

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:15.209
and an hour you can do most of this treatment.
We have started doing the second side. In

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.739
Marcia's case the skin is pretty thin so it
tends to heat up very quickly, but she has

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:29.050
a lot of these deep lines which are harder
to treat, so in her case we are going to add

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:40.540
the Platelet Rich Plasma to improve the quality
of the skin and to improve the healing process.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.299
We are done with the Thermi RF and now we
are going to put the Platelet Rich Plasma,

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.250
the PRP, we are going to inject it into the
area that we treated so that we can get even

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:10.390
better results. So we just finished doing
the 3 procedures, we did the Thermi Tight

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.709
to the face and neck, and then we did the
Thermi RF, then we did the Platelet Rich Plasma.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.360
It really wasn't painful especially the first
process, it was very soothing and comfortable.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.800
By tomorrow again it will look a lot better
when this numbing and all of the initial swelling

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.340
goes away, and you will look better and better
over the next few weeks.
