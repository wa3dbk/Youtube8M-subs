00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.280
Wimbledon is like a dream for me.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840
I love Wimbledon. I want to play there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.600
Wimbledon's
the most important tournament.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.240
All legends are made there.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
I've been involved with
the HSBC Road to Wimbledon since 2002

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.560
and that's been based in the UK.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.280
But we really felt
that there was an opportunity

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.680
to spread the word of Wimbledon
overseas.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.920
I've been playing tennis for six years

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.360
and I like
the physical fitness in tennis

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.920
and to be healthy

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.560
and I want to be a professional player.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.160
When I was small, I joined a school
where there were a lot of sports

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.720
and I started
liking tennis the most.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.080
I've been playing tennis since I was
five and I practise four hours a day.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.160
I played well, even when I was small.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.520
I'd be very excited

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
because I'd be the girl from India
who is going to play at Wimbledon.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.480
Since the kids
started arriving this morning,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.400
they've been really excited
about coming out here

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200
and getting to meet Tim Henman

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.000
and meet Dan Bloxham,
the Head Coach at Wimbledon.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.760
It's just been
a fabulous experience for them.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.680
Murray's grip is here
and del Potro has a big swing, OK.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.720
But what they have in common is
they have full commitment to the shots.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.720
Working with the kids
has been one of the highlights

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840
because it's their energy, their
enthusiasm and their desire to learn.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520
He is a very good coach.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.160
I learned that the most important thing
in tennis is to be fit.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.000
I learned a lot,
so now when I go to my academy,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.520
I'll improve my strokes
and play better.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.040
I'll do what they told me.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.640
They'll use what they've learned
to help their tennis get better.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.920
They love the game of tennis

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.080
and hopefully this initiative

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.120
can really benefit Indian tennis
in the long run.
