00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.303
Do you want some water, 
or anything?

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.071
No, thanks. I'm better now.

00:00:05.238 --> 00:00:06.906
So, How was the robber?

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.709
Distressed.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.479
No, ma'am, 
I mean, how did he look?

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:18.518
He looked sad, unhappy. 
 He was terrible. Terrible.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:21.254
Ma'am, I mean,
 what was his appearance?

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.923
He looked like a crackhead, I guess, 
but I don't think it's his fault,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.427
the society puts him 
in a position that...

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.829
-- Crack.
-- I just don't get it.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:35.268
Ma'am, let's do this. 
The robber, is he black or white?

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:42.308
First of all, I like to think about the 
"robber" as a desperate human being.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:48.348
But ma'am, is he a desperate 
human being like a desperate Pelé

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.450
or a desperate Kaká?

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:53.319
Look, I'm gonna make
 this easy for you.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:01:01.594
His face reminded me of a
 giraffe running in a savannah

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.898
seeking for water 
to quench its thirst.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.333
Ma'am, help me help you.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.071
I need an actual 
feature of the person.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:14.074
-- He had a beautiful voice.
-- A beautiful voice.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.646
Okay, all right.
 What did he took from you?

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.184
Well, he took my hope, right?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.452
Just for starters.

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:30.557
He took my dream of living
 in a better country,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.561
and to sum it up, 
he took everything, right?

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.063
This is getting hard for me.
Because...

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.666
That's enough for me, all right?

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.937
Yeah, I think that's enough
 for everybody, sir.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:48.942
Ma'am. I'm gonna explain it to you 
as if you were 6 years old, okay? All right.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.245
I need something more... 
what was he wearing?

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.015
He was wearing 
what he could afford.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:00.753
The minimum 
a decent citizen needs.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.422
Ma'am, does it look like him?

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.124
That's him!

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.727
