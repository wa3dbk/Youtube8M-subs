Carla Hall:
Hootie! How are you guys!

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:05.091
It's such a pleasure.

00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:08.991
Well, I'm a really big kid and
so I have my mother here to

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.958
actually turn the pages.

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:13.858
I know some of you all have
your parents here, too.

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:14.291
All right.

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:17.425
So today we're going -- I'm
going to read "The Giving Tree"

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:18.858
by Shel Silverstein.

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:20.692
It's one of my favorite books.

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:24.391
And when I was doing Children's
Theater this is one of the books

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.291
that we did.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.825
So I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:31.558
So here is the book (indicating)

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:32.925
Do you all know
"The Giving Tree?"

00:00:32.925 --> 00:00:33.925
Children:
Yes!

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:47.725
Carla Hall:
Yes. Awesome. All right.

00:00:47.725 --> 00:01:03.792
"Once there was a tree and
she loves a little boy.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:22.158
And every day the boy would come
and he would gather her leaves

00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:30.325
and make them into crowns
and play king of the forest.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:34.858
And he would climb her trunk.

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:40.325
And he would swing
from her branches.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:43.491
And he would eat apples.

00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.558
Just like you all
are doing today.

00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:55.892
And they would
play hide and seek.

00:01:55.892 --> 00:02:05.892
And when he was tired, he
would sleep in her shade.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:15.325
And the boy loved the
tree just very, very much.

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:20.491
And the tree was happy!

00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:31.591
But time went by and the
boy grew older and the

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:39.158
tree was often alone.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.692
Then one day the boy came
to the tree and the tree

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:43.792
said, 'come, boy.

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:48.591
Climb up my trunk and swing from
my branches and eat apples and

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:53.358
play in the shade and be happy!'

00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:56.291
'I'm too big to climb
and play,' said the boy.

00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:58.725
I want to buy
things and have fun.

00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:01.458
I want some money.

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:04.425
Can you give me some money?'

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:08.325
'I'm sorry,' said the
tree, 'but I have no money.

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:11.958
I only have leaves and apples.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.425
Take my apples,
boy, and sell them.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.325
Sell them in the city, then
you will have money and you

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:22.391
will be happy!'

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:27.325
And so the boy climbed up the
tree and he gathered her apples

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:29.358
and carried them away.

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:36.391
And the tree was happy!

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:43.458
But the boy stayed away for a
long time and the tree was sad.

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:46.591
And then one day the boy
came back and the tree

00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:48.958
shook with joy.

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.825
And she said, 'come, boy, climb
up my trunk and swing from my

00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:55.991
branches and be happy!'

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.991
'I'm too busy to climb
trees,' said the boy.

00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.091
'I want a house to
keep me warm,' he said.

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:03.258
'I want a wife.

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:04.658
I want some children.

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:07.224
And so I need a house.

00:04:07.224 --> 00:04:09.858
Can you give me a house?'

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:12.325
'I have no house,'
said the tree.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:15.458
'The forest is my house.

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:19.124
But you may cut off my
branches and build a house,

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:25.892
then you will be happy!'

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:31.425
And so the boy cut her branches
and carried them away to build

00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:33.158
his house."

00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:45.291
Look. "And the tree was happy!

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:50.491
But the boy stayed away for a
long time and when he came back

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.892
the tree was so happy
she could hardly speak.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:57.325
'Come, boy,' she whispered,
'come and play!'

00:04:57.325 --> 00:05:01.458
'I'm too old and sad
to play,' said the boy.

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:07.458
'I want a boat that will take me
far away, far away from here.

00:05:07.458 --> 00:05:10.291
Can you give me a boat?'

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.091
'Cut down my trunk and make
a boat,' said the tree.

00:05:14.091 --> 00:05:21.758
'Then you can sail away
and you can be happy!'

00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:28.158
And so the boy cut down
her trunk and made a boat

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:33.458
and sailed away.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.858
And the tree was happy!

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:42.124
But not really.

00:05:42.124 --> 00:05:47.291
And after a long time
the boy came back again.

00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:51.158
'I'm sorry, boy,' said the
tree, 'but I have nothing

00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:52.925
left to give you.

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:55.425
My apples are gone.'

00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:59.491
'My teeth are too weak for
apples,' said the boy.

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:03.091
'My branches are
gone,' said the tree.

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:05.058
'You cannot swing on them.'

00:06:05.058 --> 00:06:09.858
'I'm too old to swing on
branches,' said the boy.

00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:13.124
'My trunk is gone,'
said the tree.

00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:15.425
'You cannot climb.'

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:20.091
'I'm too tired to climb,'
said the little boy.

00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.925
'I'm sorry,' said the tree.

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.958
'I wish that I could
give you something but

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.425
I have nothing left.

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:29.458
I'm just an old stump.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:38.124
I'm sorry!'

00:06:38.124 --> 00:06:41.091
'I don't need very much
now,' said the boy,

00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:45.625
'just a quiet place
to sit and rest.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:48.792
I'm very tired.'

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.991
'Well,' said the tree,
straightening herself

00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:58.391
up as much as she could, 'well,
an old stump is good for sitting

00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.291
and resting.

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.258
Come, boy, sit down.

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:05.458
Sit down and rest!'

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:10.692
And the boy did.

00:07:10.692 --> 00:07:14.224
And the tree was happy!

00:07:14.224 --> 00:07:15.525
The end!"

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.758
(applause)

00:07:17.758 --> 00:07:19.958
Carla Hall:
Thank you all so much.

00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.425
This was so much fun.

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:23.758
Do you have any questions?

00:07:23.758 --> 00:07:26.525
Do you want to talk about
your favorite books?

00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:28.458
Do we have time?

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:29.858
We don't have time!

00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:30.991
We're ready for the next thing.

00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:32.991
Are you going to
see the next reader?

00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.291
Well, have fun.

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:36.291
Bye!
