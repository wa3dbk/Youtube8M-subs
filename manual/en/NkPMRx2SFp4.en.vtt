TOUCHED THAT.

YOU WANT FOR CHRISTMAS?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.560

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.470
&gt;&gt;NO, I ALREADY HAVE TWO.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.570
HEY, HOW DO YOU GET AROUND TO EVERY HOUSE
IN

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.570

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.920
&gt;&gt;KYLE-- &gt;&gt;IF I WANTED COAL
FOR CHRISTMAS WOULD I HAVE TO BE BAD?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979
IF I WERE BAD AND I STILL WANTED COAL WOULD
YOU GIVE IT TO ME?

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.870
BECAUSE THEN YOU’D BE REWARDING ME FOR BAD
BEHAVIOR AND THAT

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.090
WOULD THROW OFF THE WHOLE NAUGHTY AND NICE
LIST THING.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.090
&gt;&gt;IT’S TRUE.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.569
&gt;&gt;KYLE, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU
NOT TO ASK

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.569

YOUR TREADMILL?

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.569
&gt;&gt;NO, BUT I STILL HAVEN’T TOLD SANTA WHAT

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.569
&gt;&gt;WELL TELL HIM QUICKLY RIGHT NOW.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.569
