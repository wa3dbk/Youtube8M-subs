Hi, I’m Cameron, and I’m from Missouri. Welcome to Notre Dame Stadium.

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:08.675
Notre Dame Stadium was designed by Coach Knute Rockne and opened in 1930.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.645
Even though he was only able to coach one season here,

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.581
the Stadium will always be known as the “House that Rockne Built.”

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.684
The original structure could hold about 59,000 people

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.923
and after the expansion and renovation in 1997, 
 can now hold a little under 81,000.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:25.659
They opened the gates for us today, so we can 
 go out on the field and check it out.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.727
Come on, let’s go.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.214
Wow, here we are inside Notre Dame Stadium.

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.584
Can you imagine all the great players who have played here throughout the years?

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:54.788
From Paul Horning to Joe Theismann, Joe Montana and Tim Brown.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.692
Even movie directors are attracted to Notre Dame for its traditional feel,

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:04.464
from the real grass on the field, to the diagonal stripes 
 in the end zone and even the wooden bleachers.

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:16.009
Painting of the football team helmets is another tradition here at the Stadium.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.814
Every Monday before a home game, student managers and volunteers repaint each player’s helmet.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.983
The gold paint contains real gold

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:25.986
and is the same gold that’s used on the dome of the Main Building.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.125
The grass on the field is mowed every day during the summer

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.096
and when it gets a little colder, they back 
 off and only mow it every other day.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.200
Notre Dame is one of the few universities to play full-contact inter-hall football.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.970
And each year, the championship game is played right here in Notre Dame Stadium.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.940
A couple years ago, my dorm was in the championship game, and we won.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.380
As you can tell, football is a huge part of the Notre Dame tradition,

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.950
so next time you’re on campus, you’re gonna want 
 to come check out the Notre Dame Stadium.
