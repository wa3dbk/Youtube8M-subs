00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.100
What I’m holding here is the prototype of
the gamma ray spectrometer that our group

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.001
sent on the Mercury MESSENGER mission to Mercury.
It is a germanium-based gamma ray spectrometer.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:17.570
It’s a high resolution gamma ray detector,
and the reason that it’s gold plated, and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.480
it’s polished and gold plated, is that this
is to act as infrared shielding for the detector,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.849
because, although this technology is very
high resolution, it has the big drawback that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.290
to operate, it has to run at minus 200 degrees
Celsius, about minus 330 Fahrenheit.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.750
So this is especially complicated at Mercury,
the closest planet to the Sun, because of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.850
extremely harsh thermal environment there.
And the way you cool the detector in such

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.320
a harsh thermal environment is, first, is
to have lots of infrared shielding, which

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.930
reflects the Sun’s heat, and reflects the
heat off the.. coming from the planet. And

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.869
so a highly polished gold plated surface reflects
about 98 percent of infrared light. So what

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.960
we have is, in capsulation with our germanium
detector inside, and around it we have several

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.030
infrared shields and the whole thing is suspended
on a Kevlar.. set of Kevlar fibers to isolate

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.060
it mechanically from the outer hot body.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.210
We’re really getting excited now. The instrument’s
been in flight for nearly seven years. Of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.510
course it was very exciting when it launched,
but we’ve just sort of been waiting, and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.670
we’ve been off doing other work. So now
that it’s actually approaching orbit, approaching

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.270
turn-on of the instrument, we’re all very
excited. We’ve been having conference calls.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.810
We’ve been reviewing the plans of what we’re
going to do for testing and evaluation and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.619
so on. And so yes, a pretty exciting time.
And we’ll definitely all rest a little easier

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.740
once we see the first data coming down.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.779
So the purpose of having a gamma ray spectrometer
on this NASA mission at Mercury is that the

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:09.209
surface of Mercury is highly radioactive.
It’s bombarded by cosmic rays from space.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.950
Unlike Earth, Mercury is not protected from
those cosmic rays because it doesn’t have

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.750
a thick atmosphere, and it doesn’t have
a strong magnetic field; both of those things,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.500
which protect Earth. So Mercury is highly
radioactive. So our instrument in orbit can

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.709
detect those gamma rays, and it turns out
that gamma rays act like a fingerprint for

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.010
the elements that emit them. So if you can
measure those gamma rays with high resolution,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.850
you can determine the surface composition
of the planet. And that’s very important

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.519
to help discriminate between various formation
theories, to help them understand how the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.939
planet formed and what its geological history
is.
