00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.120
(electro-funk music)

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.890
- Hi, I'm Denis De Souza,
celebrity colorist for Joico

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.980
and I'm here today to share with you

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540
a ground-breaking new innovation
in the world of color.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.600
It's called LumiShine.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.280
It guarantees results with twice the shine

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.060
and 100% great coverage
for every single client.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.430
The secret lies in Joico's new
technology called ArgiPlex.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.460
This means, you feel the joy

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.850
of healthy hair every time you color.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.860
You will see how extraordinary
LumiShine really is.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.773
Let's get started!

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.383
Brunettes, it's your turn
to shine with Caramelt.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.690
Mix formula one with
LumiShine Xtra Life Blonde,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.650
and 40 volume developer.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.073
You want to divide the
hair into three sections,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.980
then, start at the back,
taking diagonal weaves.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.257
Feather formula one two to
three inches from the scalp.

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:57.830
You need to repeat this
on the opposite side

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.900
and slightly higher at
the back, like this.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.596
Then, get formula two
ready for the next steps.

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:07.520
(electro-funk music)

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.963
Mix VeroLight and 10 volume developer.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.040
Leave a slice parting of natural hair,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.650
then work your way towards the crown,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.747
alternating between formulas

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:19.633
one and two in a brick lay pattern.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.100
(electro-funk music)

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.760
Now, start at the hairline and pivot

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.550
toward the top, center part.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.580
Again, leave a slice of natural hair

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.440
between each foil and alternate

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.809
between formulas one and two.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.400
(electro-funk music)

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.620
When you get to the
fringe, apply formula two

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.073
in fine back-to-back, horizontal weaves.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.373
And that's it with the foils.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.250
(electro-funk music)

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.040
Now you want to apply the glaze formula

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
of LumiShine 9NV and 5 volume developer

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.560
to the entire head.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.360
When that's done, all that's left

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.773
is to shampoo and condition.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.070
(electro-funk music)

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.270
And these gorgeous locks are
what you get with LumiShine,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.530
intensely glossy, 100% healthy hair,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.500
and shades that knock everything else

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.350
out of the park.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.680
Thanks for watching, guys.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.013
