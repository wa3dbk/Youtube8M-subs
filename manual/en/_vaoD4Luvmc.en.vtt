00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.529
I feel like I’ve played this before.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.169
Not this game specifically, but...Moshi Monsters
in general.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.370
Like, I’m pretty sure there was an original
DS game based on this franchise, and I’m

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.539
pretty sure I reviewed it.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.140
I would go check, but...that would take away
the surprise.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.019
Plus, I don’t want to remember.

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:46.750
It’s Moshi Monsters: Moshlings Theme Park
for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:57.150
Alright, all joking and snide comments aside,
this is a decent little game for kids.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.329
It’s obviously based on the Moshi Monsters...thing,
which is kind of like Pokémon meets Facebook.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.850
I guess it’s this social network where kids
trade monsters or something.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.850
Whatever.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.860
Sounds like a Ponzi scheme to me.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.860
Pikachu scheme.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.420
Nonetheless, Moshlings Theme Park takes 60
moshlings and puts them in a theme park.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.670
Based on that title, I would’ve never expected
that.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.619
You basically travel around this magical island
searching for monsters and playing minigames.

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.659
The gameplay is simple, and the theme park
concept is pretty adorable.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.509
Very fitting for kids.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.090
Really, my only problem with this game...is
that the theme park isn’t even there at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.090
first.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.030
The island is basically boarded up, so you
have to unlock minigames one at a time.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.289
The whole game is essentially rebuilding the
park one game at a time, and for a game that’s

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.319
supposed to be for really young players, I’m
not sure that’s the best idea.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.319
It felt tedious for me, let alone a little
kid.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.779
Hyped up on Smarties.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.600
As with any compilation, the minigames are
hit and miss.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.720
Some of them are better than others, some
are worse, none of them are all that thrilling

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
or memorable.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.630
I think kids are probably going to be a lot
more interested in the monsters...but you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.260
have to go through hoops even for those.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.840
You come across these games where you have
to guide the monsters down a path with all

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.010
these obstacles.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670
Again, more tedious than fun.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.510
There’s nothing inherently wrong with this
game, and it is fine for kids.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.370
But at the same time, you’d think a game
for kids would be a little more...fun?

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.310
That they wouldn’t put the monsters behind
a tedious game of unlocking minigames?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.430
I don’t know, just a strange design choice
to me.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:52.180
The games also don’t explain themselves
much, so it’s a little confusing at times,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.900
too.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.540
But for the avid Moshlings fan...eh, probably
just fine.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.610
I mean, they’re in a theme park.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.239
Try not to find that adorable.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.670
Can’t be done.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:21.290
It’s Moshlings Theme Park for 
the 3DS.
