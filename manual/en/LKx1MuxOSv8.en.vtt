00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.981
As superheroes continue to defeat the forces
of evil – and their competition at the box

00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.040
office – more and more DC and Marvel comics
characters are getting their chance to shine

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.040
on the big screen.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.340
The Justice League and Avengers take care
of the most world famous heroes, but what

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.720
about the characters who are just as powerful,
popular or important – but nowhere near

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720
as well known?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.960
Some of the best comic stories are yet to
be told, assuming the studios know where to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
look.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.649
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Underrated Superheroes
Who Deserve Their Own Movies.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.649
Martian Manhunter

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.719
A super powered alien marooned on Earth is
a story comic fans have heard dozens of times.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.480
But when Superman refers to Martian Manhunter
as “the most powerful being on the face

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.829
of the Earth,” he is clearly deserving of
more than a supporting role.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.149
The story of just how J’onn J’onzz, the
last surviving Green Martian came to Earth

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.320
has changed over the years, but the important
points remain the same: J’onn lost his wife

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.079
and family, wound up on Earth, and decided
to help those who couldn’t help themselves.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.379
Also, he’s one of the most powerful heroes
in the DC Universe.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.360
Able to fly, read minds, phase through objects,
become invisible, change his shape and density,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.400
and regrow himself from a single hand.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.430
Manhunter obviously became a staple of the
animated Justice League, but if you ask us,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.810
Bruce Wayne admitting that J’onn is basically
a combination of Batman and Superman means

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.660
leaving him out of DC’s movie universe would
be a colossal mistake.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.660
Darkhawk

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.170
In the modern age of unmanned aircraft and
military drones, the superhero Darkhawk may

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.190
not be as groundbreaking as he used to be.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.189
Even so, the story of a teenager who finds
a mysterious amulet that allows him to pilot

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.120
an extra-dimensional android is a big screen
hit just waiting to be told.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.979
The teenager Chris Powell may lack the name
recognition of Tony Stark, but his suit of

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.759
armor is even more powerful, even if he's
not actually wearing it into battle.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.550
If Marvel plans to keep pushing their technology,
alien scheming, and cosmic plot lines - while

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.359
bringing in younger fans with Spider-Man - then
a Darkhawk appearance in the MCU would be

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.409
an unexpected, but potentially brilliant twist.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.409
Captain Comet

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.299
The Cosmic side of the DC Universe may be
dominated by Darkseid and the Green Lantern

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.610
Corps, but the supporting cast in the colourful
corners of space are just as important - and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.520
few are as interesting as Captain Comet.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.960
Created between the Gold and Silver ages of
comic books, Adam Blake was one of the first

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.510
fictional mutant heroes, introduced over a
decade before Marvel's X-Men.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.720
Blessed with superhuman strength, psychic
and telekinetic powers, Blake took up the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.340
Comet name to fight crime, before exploring
the galaxy.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.459
Comet returned to the DC spotlight in the
2006 series "Mystery in Space," which saw

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.620
the hero uncovering the mystery of his own
resurrection on Hardcore Station, an intergalactic

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.360
hive of criminals and drifters.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.310
If DC wants to match Marvel's Guardians of
the Galaxy or the return of Star Wars, this

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.110
is one space based hero that could do the
job - without dealing with the universe's

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.230
biggest cosmic villains.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.230
Beta Ray Bill

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.040
The Avengers can throw some mean punches,
but only one of them wields the power of a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
god.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.670
So when Thor first came across an alien spaceship
headed for Earth, he was more than surprised

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.470
to find a being on board that could match
him blow for blow.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.390
The alien was none other than Beta Ray Bill,
one of the last survivors of the Korbinite

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.319
race, placed into a body resembling a horse-like
animal from his homeworld.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.010
After claiming Thor's Hammer for himself,
the pair would grow to respect each other

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.489
as noble warriors, with Odin giving Bill a
hammer just as powerful as the god of thunder's.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.799
The horse-faced warrior went on to become
a fan-favourite and a serious weapon in Marvel's

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.570
cosmic wars, even starting a romance with
Lady Sif.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.069
If Chris Hemsworth wants to hang up his cape
any time soon, or crosses paths with Marvel's

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.310
alien races, handing the spotlight to Beta
Ray Bill would be a dream come true for comic

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.310
fans.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.500
Moon Knight

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.959
Some may write him off as a rip-off of Batman,
but Marvel's supernatural Moon Knight is anything

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.959
but.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.950
When former US Marine and professional boxer
Marc Spector found himself working as a mercenary

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.470
in the sands of Egypt, a run-in with valuable
artifacts - and his fellow hired guns - leaves

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.400
him lifeless in front of a statue of Khonshu,
the Egyptian Moon God.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.390
Offering to return Marc to life if he acts
as his living Avatar, the Moon god blesses

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.450
him with superhuman strength tied to the phases
of the moon, and a shroud of bright white

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.450
cloth.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.530
It isn't all just hunting criminals, though,
since the gift splits Marc's personality into

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.950
pieces, making him even more of a wild card
in Iron Man and Captain America's Civil War

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:01.950
standoff.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.690
The bottom line is that even Taskmaster, the
deadly copycat of Marvel's universe, refuses

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.710
to mimic the Moon Knight’s fighting style.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.710
Why?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.140
Because he'd rather take a punch than block
it, with each hit seen as penance for the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.940
pain he caused in his former life.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.000
Who knew someone could make Batman seem well-balanced?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Union Jack

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.190
In the Marvel movie universe, you don't need
a superpower to be an effective fighter in

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.350
the war between good and evil.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.840
But as the studio's plans grow, there's no
time like the present to introduce a European

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.870
operative - even better, one who fights not
just terrorist threats, but supernatural ones.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.830
There are three men who have used the name
of Union Jack, from wealthy British aristocrats

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.690
fighting in costume during World War 1 and
2, to a commoner lucky enough to wear the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.690
famous costume.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.320
He may not be a super soldier, but Jack could
easily fit into the ranks of SHIELD's top

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320
agents.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.030
And if Marvel wants to wade into supernatural
horror, the hero's long history with vampires

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.690
and the occult makes him the perfect candidate.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.690
Zatanna

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.139
The Justice League may feature a super powered
alien, an Amazonian demigod, and a super speedster,

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.600
but they all share the same weakness: magic.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.050
And when it comes to sorcerers, Zatanna Zatara
is hard to beat.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.960
Uttering magical spells in battle against
DC's deadliest villains is one thing, but

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.690
when wounded enough to put normal magicians
out of a fight, Zatanna has even resorted

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.440
to writing out spells in her own blood – how’s
that for dedication?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.360
Knowing that Warner Bros will be bringing
magic into their movie universe, Zatanna's

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.910
power, experience with the League, and history
with John Constantine makes her a no-brainer

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.940
for a starring role.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.940
Nightwing

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.370
Ask any comic fan, and they’ll tell you
that calling Dick Grayson ‘Batman’s sidekick’

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.370
is selling him short.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.050
As Robin the Boy Wonder, Dick used his time
under Batman’s wing to master dozens of

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.240
martial arts and languages.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.480
But he was destined for greater things, becoming
the leader of the Teen Titans, before deciding

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.580
a new name was needed for his solo career.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.340
Remembering Superman’s stories of the Kryptonian
crimefighter Nightwing, Dick set his sights

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.280
on Bludhaven, a city in need of a protector
just as Batman had watched over Gotham.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.340
But it wasn’t just Dick’s fighting skills
that made him effective.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.530
When DC’s New 52 saw Grayson unmasked to
the world, Batman convinced him to fake his

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.960
own death, and take up a career as a secret
agent, launching the brand new comic series

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960
“Grayson.”

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.770
Knowing that Zack Snyder’s Justice League
movie universe features a version of Batman

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.460
who’s been fighting crime for decades, we
have to believe a plan for Dick Grayson is

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.940
in place – if not as a masked vigilante,
then as a covert operative gathering intel

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.330
for the Dark Knight.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.330
The Question

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.160
Vic Sage was living the typical life of any
famous reporter, before a close friend gave

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.390
him a tip he couldn't resist.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.470
To thwart the black market sale of of an artificial
skin, Sage covers his own face with the product,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.280
and ambushes the men behind the crime.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.259
Realizing that hiding his famous face will
let him uncover crimes - and stop them himself

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.180
- he takes a new name: The Question.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.419
Audiences are used to masked vigilantes, but
a DC hero with a passion for journalism, beating

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.590
criminals for information, not ‘justice’
– would be a welcome change.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.990
Blurring the line between normal reporting
and a ‘supernatural sleuth’ — with the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.380
audience in on the joke – The Question is
too unique a hero to pass up.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380
Doctor Fate

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.199
If there’s one character whose absence from
the big screen is downright criminal, it has

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.199
to be
Doctor Fate.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.139
The name refers to the helmet worn by the
hero more than the person underneath

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.850
it, having been passed down to a half-dozen
people throughout DC’s history and alternate

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.850
Earths.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.150
Uncovered in the tomb of the ancient god Nabu
the Wise, the original Fate was trained

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.620
in the ways of magic from the god himself,
blessing him with a golden cape and costume

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.440
to
wear along with his signature helmet.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.379
Granting the wearer not just magical attacks,
but

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:18.250
superhuman strength, flight, and invulnerability,
the Helmet of Fate has been a major factor

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.780
in
too many storylines to count.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.280
Every comic fan is sure to have their favorite
version, but with the

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.669
hero’s popularity in the comics, animated
series, and even the TV series Smallville,

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.550
the lack of a
major movie role is a problem that DC’s

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.560
supernatural-focused movies will hopefully
solve.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.120
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.259
