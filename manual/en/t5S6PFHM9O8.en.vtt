hi I'm Kyla from tujawellness.com 
today I'm going to show you one of my favorite

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.409
summertime recipes, sangria

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.039
and we're going to do things a little
differently, choose everything organic to

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.259
make it a little healthier, as well as some
rose wine

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.349
so we've chosen a delicious bottle of rose organic rose from Summer Hill

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.919
in Kelowna, BC, as well as a selection
of organic

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.810
from Choices Market, also in Kelowna

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.620
what we're going to do is cut up a whole
bunch of fruit, whatever flavours you like

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.160
choose those fruit

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.620
so we start with some pineapple

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.820
and lemon, lime  and orange, so some
wonderful citrus flavors there

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.099
and we're going to add also some juicy raspberry

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:52.720
and blackberry

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.990
then grab the picture that you are going to serve the sangria in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.820
in essence throw in all of those delicious fruits that you've chosen

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.210
and then grab the entire bottle of rose wine

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.190
and just throw it in there as well

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.920
and let it set overnight

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.150
and what we're going to do now, right before you're going to serve it

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.240
you're going to add a scoop or two, depending  on how sweet you want it,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.800
of organic lemonade concentrate and that will just sweeten it up a bit, making it a little sweeter

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.479
for summertime

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.450
and then one of the last things to add
some fizz, a little sparkle

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.030
so essentially what I've chosen here is just some Perrier, you're going to add it in there

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.670
for a little freshness, you don't need the whole bottle, just a little bit

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.060
another cool little thing you can do is actually
choose some of these Santa Cruz

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.819
organic sodas, so there's some ginger ale

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.689
or a little mango lemonade, you can choose those instead for a different flavor, little more of a spritzer kind of a feel

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.659
and essentially you're ready to serve it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.820
there's one little trick that we've got to show you first

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
what we've done is chosen some of the fruit and we've put it on a frozen tray

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.010
or into the freezer overnight

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.569
so it's a really, really, really hot day
you're expecting some hot weather

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.219
and so we've chosen some of the marinated fruit and and you can just sort of stick

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.430
it in here onto the tray a few hours
before your guests come, throw it into the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.369
freezer and then just take it out just when
you're ready to serve it

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.989
then we have our glasses

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.129
you know what, I'm just going to use my hands, why not?

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.739
so they'll be nice and cold for when they're ready to go and it's super hot outside

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.659
and for my friend

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.699
you can see that we've chosen some kiwi and some strawberry

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:48.699
we're pretty much ready to go

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.049
mmm, I can smell it

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.969
delicious rose and the citrus fruits

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.699
 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:02.909
and there you have it

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.249
organic sangria. I'm Kyla from tujawellness.com. cheers!
