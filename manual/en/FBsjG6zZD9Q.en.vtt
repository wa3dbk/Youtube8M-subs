00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.400
So at the moment we're here with
Practical Classics latest almost

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.950
completed project Mark II Jag which I
believe has been with the magazine

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.169
for three years John?

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.259
Jon Simpson is the magazines chief
mechanic so he gets his hands dirtier

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.960
than most of us and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.289
he's basically lived, breathed and eaten this particular vehicle for most of the last 3 years.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.900
What was it like when it turned up?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.490
It was a shed, a real shed.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.889
Full of filler, someone had started the 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:32.600
restoration

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.990
and abandoned it, left his wife

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.710
she wanted to get rid of it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.710
A few drinks one night with our then editor

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010
and uh... i think a deal was struck.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.290
And so since then

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.270
its had

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.430
well it's basically been rebuild hasn't it?

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.220
you know i've had eighteen months solid welding on this car, I'm now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.190
seeking analysis

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.430
Psycho-analysis for it.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490
but it was a bit of a scary moment when

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.420
when we discovered how bad the bodywork 
was, it was originally sent

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.980
to SPL

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.590
which basically mean't all of the rust, all of the paintwork and all of the filler was stripped off

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.830
by having this vehicle dipped.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.590
And when it came out of the dip what happened?
there was about nine inches had disappeared

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.730
off the bottom of it

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.440
The top was nearly separated from the floorpan.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.650
It was in a really bad state.
And the whole car itself had banana'ed slightly, which means it had sagged

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.710
down on itself so it had to be re-jigged

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.250
and then Jon began his weld-a-thon

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.180
which he's still recovering from

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.330
but now

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.900
it's looking fantastic

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.090
S&amp;G Barrett have been our partners for the
parts in this and we've had it trimmed by 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.700
Aldridge trimming

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
all the people involved with the car including the Jaguar enthusiasts club have been right behind us from the start

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.439
and we wouldn't have been able to have done it without them but

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.890
it's taken a fair amount of effort from

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.929
this big man here so thank you Jon and
yesterday we started it and in a minute we're going to start it

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.870
for you.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.759
It's only the second time this vehicle's been started since the restoration began

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.250
Hopefully it will work today
