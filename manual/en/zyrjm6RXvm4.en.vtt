00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.067
I've lived in
Burlingame for 42 years.

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.233
I'm Joanne Garrison.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.900
I moved here with
my husband in 1986.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm very happy to have
just--with the Burlingame

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.300
Historical Society
published a book on Burlingame.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.900
Burlingame is a very--
it's a close town.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.467
It's a very friendly town.
It's very old.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:22.000
And we seem at home there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In a nutshell,
Burlingame was formed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.367
to serve Hillsborough.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:29.800
Very wealthy people from
San Francisco created

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.833
summer homes and mansions
in Hillsborough,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.100
which is west of Burlingame.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.533
And they needed a town
to service their needs.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.533
They needed stores.
They needed plumbers.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.067
They needed electricians.
They needed hardware stores.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:51.333
Burlingame, as a small
town, was--you met everybody

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.400
in a different store because
the stores were there for years.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.733
This is the waiting station

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.867
that all the prominent
people came to.

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:01.967
And you know, I can
just imagine them here.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:04.300
Teddy Roosevelt came through
this train station on,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.267
I'm sure it must have been
a fundraising trip

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:08.300
to the Burlingame Country Club.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.100
But other--before the
city really developed,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.600
this was the home of all
the community meetings.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.533
This was where
the Burlingame Woman's Club

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.967
got its start.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.667
This is where
the First Baptist Church

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:21.267
over on El Camino
got it's start.

00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:23.800
The baseball field at
Washington Park is like

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.900
something out of
a postcard from 1885.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.033
It's amazing.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:33.000
It just--this place kind
of takes you back in time

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.933
a little bit.

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.767
And when we bought
this house in 1962,

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.167
we paid 33,000 for it.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:46.067
And I was offered 5 years ago
3,500,000.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:48.067
Not for the house,
for the property.
