00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.009
CLAY Here at DadLabs we’ve long advocated
for dads being at every single doctor’s

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.830
appointment during pregnancy.
BRAD There’s only one problem with this

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:22.740
plan, and it’s called...you boss.
CLAY Today’s show is brought to you by BabyBjorn.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.699
Shouldn’t your kid roll in the CEO of baby
carriers? The BabyBjorn Baby Carrier Synergy.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.110
BRAD Now we understand that asking your boss
to miss work to go to your wife’s doctor’s

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.640
appointments can be tough.
CLAY No we don’t.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:01:05.960
BRAD What do you mean, “no we don’t?”
CLAY How do we know? We don’t really have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.420
a boss. I mean Daddy Troy, sort of.
BRAD We had bosses before DadLabs.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:22.409
CLAY I can’t remember that life. Hm. What
if I had a boss and I wanted to go to my wife’s

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.539
doctor’s appointment?
CLAY Hm. What’s the best approach here?

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:42.369
Make light. Be funny.
CLAY Hey, boss, hopin’ to go to my gynecologist

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:50.700
today.
CLAY So my wife is pregnant. Goin’ to the...no?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.170
CLAY Maybe if it’s better if you go all
legal.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.529
CLAY Sir, I am respectfully demanding that
I be allowed to visit my wife’s gynecologist.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.559
Under the auspices of the Family and Parental
Leave Act of 2001...

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:13.300
BRAD You have no rights.
CLAY Yes, but if this was Sweden...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.881
BRAD It’s Cleveland.
CLAY Or Iceland.

00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:18.250
BRAD Didn’t Walmart buy Iceland?
CLAY In Iceland I would have...like...three

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.931
weeks to go to the gynecologist.

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:26.530
CLAY And what if I had one of “those”
bosses.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.230
BRAD AT A COMPUTER.
BRAD There will be no marketing team meeting

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.250
to day because Clay is at his gynecologist.
Send. That’s what she said. Hey. Headed

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.769
out for your “appointment.”
CLAY Yes.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.120
BRAD Okay. Well keep those stirrups warm for
me.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.750
CLAY I don’t...okay.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.310
And wouldn’t this all just be so much easier
if your boss was a woman?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.620
EXEC Headed out for your appointment?
CLAY Yes.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.430
EXEC Okay. Well keep those stirrups warm for
me.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:06.560
BRAD Daddy Clay, it’s 2009. Most bosses
are cool with guys taking a little personal

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.999
time to be with their pregnant wives at a
doctor’s appointment. If they aren’t then

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:21.219
they really suck.
CLAY If you have experiences getting excused

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.650
from work to be at your partner’s appointments,
please share at DadLabs dot com. Techniques

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.329
and excuses welcome.
BRAD And thanks to our sponsor, BabyBjorn.

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.730
In Sweden they have this all figured out.
Baby carriers, too. BabyBjorn. See you next

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.769
time, in the Lab.
