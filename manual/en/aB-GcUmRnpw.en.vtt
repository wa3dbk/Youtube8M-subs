00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.810
 

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.810
 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.590
Hello Namaste

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.300
salaam alaikum sat sri akal welcome to
another session of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.250
AAPI be fit be cool campaign the
American Association of physicians of

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.119
Indian origin

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.669
have come up with the concept of be fit be cool to encourage

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.520
us all to be really fit so we be cool

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.640
so today I'm going to show you congee
you know this is a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.930
kind of a soup that's made all over
Southeast Asia

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.430
but today I'm going to use oats which is
a much

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.740
healthier alternative to rice so for this

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.170
first we're going to just add some water

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.560
in a vessel in this we're going to add all this ingredients and we're going to

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.770
let it boil earlier I have discussed  about beta carotene

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.829
which is naturally available in colored vegetables

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.900
specially which are red, orange and green so today we're going to use

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.970
carrot and orange juice to make this congee

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.540
which is a very healthy soup so to make
this

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.210
very simple take a ball of water in which

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.970
we're going to add you know grated carrot you
can even make puree of it but

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.450
just grating this carrot is good enough
in this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.470
we're going to add you can grate some orranges
and put it in this

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.990
so that gives a very nice flavour and
also some saunf powder

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.270
saunf powder saufn is a you know sweet spice

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.470
and a when you add to any of the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.840
dishes it gives a very nice sweet aroma in this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.070
I'm also going to add some pepper powder and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.159
Julian's of ginger and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.180
oats you know we're going to let this
boil along with

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.580
carrot so you don't have to worry if the carrot will be cooked because

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.110
it's already grated and carrot doesn't
need to be cooked to enjoy

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.450
along with the this so we're going to add

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.420
some of this oats into it and adjust the
amount of water

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.459
so you get a nice thick kanji

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.670
and this we're going to flavor this with dill leaves which we're going to add little later

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.099
and also orange juice, dill leaf and orange
juice is a nice combination

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.849
to this carrot and oats congee in
this we're going to add

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.590
some salt you know make sure you add
just salt

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.189
that is required for you to enjoy good
taste

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.909
salt in excess is always bad and we're going to let this

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.560
come to a boil and we're going to enjoy
this as a soup

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.700
now you know after it comes to a boil

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.519
and let it simmer for at least 4-5 minutes

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.980
then the oats will be perfectly cooked but
now we

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.450
are going to make this mice beta
carotene rich

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.299
so we're also going to add some orange juice so
reduce the flame

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.650
and orange juice k

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.939
you just make sure you adjust the
consistency and

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.150
as I have told you earlier this is going to
be

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.419
season with dill leaves so here

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.279
I've got dill because dill is very
strong you don't want to add too much

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.400
just make sure just add little bit of

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.010
dill leaf to give a very nice aroma to this and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.439
just mix this wow!! what a nice

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.049
aroma I can already feel here this is
fantastic

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.290
I just want this to mix a little bit

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.159
and I have adjusted the seasoning also

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.769
so let me just one last time

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.800
isss !! wow !! Aahh

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.730

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.120
a carrot halwa, but mmm !!!

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.560

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.209
see for lot of people like me who want to
feel

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.750
the fullness in the stomach you know
these kind of congees

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.739
are the best when you are in a mood for dieting
this congee can be substituted

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:11.430
for a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.530
meal also and you can also add

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.139
as I told the shreds of boiled chicken or even
paneer

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.380
you know here i got pieces of paneer which I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.800
cut into small pieces and in this we're going to add

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.740
our awesome sweet aroma giving this

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.770

this is looking good

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.250
wow ha very mild aroma

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.130
coming from dill leaf and this is loaded

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.010
beta carotene ultimate Wow!!

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.610
hmm!! this is a fantastic food

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.389
but how do you encourage somebody in your
house who wants to diet

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.229
our body works like a clock if
somebody eats dinner at seven

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.590
at seven o'clock they will start feeling
hungry and

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.810
at that time they tend to eat more than
what they need

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.310
sold just fifteen or twenty minutes or half an hour
 before the regular eating time

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.510
provide them with this kind of congee

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.510
and they will most likely skip a meal

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.800
because this gives you a kind of fullness with very limited calories

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.990
absolutely no fat and you will thoroughly enjoy this

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.990
mmm!!!  superb

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.229
and with any kind of crackers that
would be even better

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.750
mmm!! this is

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.720
