00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:33.550
Jared Polin froknowsphoto.com, welcome to
Allen's Camera where I have the Nikon D3300

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.190
with the new 1855 VR II.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.190
That's right.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.410
It's a new kit lens.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.770
It's lighter, sharper, faster and it sounds
like a what's that bands name?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.410
What's that bands name?

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.760
Lighter, quicker, stronger, faster, you know,
they have their helmets on.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.870
Anyway those guys, anyways let's on boxes
give it a sniff test and see what we think

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.440
about it.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.530
Let's just go over the specs real quick.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.350
I wrote them down because there are some major
just key specs that I want to hit first.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.850
24.2 megapixel sensor with no OLPF, what does
that mean?

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.580
It's possible that this has the D7100 sensor
in it, which is cranking out some really sharp,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.960
colorful contrasting and boomfied [Phonetic]
[0:01:12] images that I so far like.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.360
Now Nikon couldn't verify whether it is the
same sensor, or most likely it is.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.830
You have your 3-inch LCD screen which is fine,
11 point AF that's a big deal.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.300
Remember back to something like a D70 and
you had maybe 5 and then a D40.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.850
You had 3 11 points focusing 11 point focusing
system in this, and 5 frames a second is pretty

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.190
darn quick for a base bottom of the line entry-level
DSLR camera.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.330
ISO upto 25,600 so no longer can anybody ever
complain that they can't shoot at higher ISOs,

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.570
but remember better glass is always important
to get better shots.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.920
And it does not have wireless built-in that's
something that you can add separately.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320
It would be nice if they did add it in.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.000
And what do you get this for?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.659
Under 650 bucks out.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.979
Now that it is an unbelievable price.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.950
And for a beginner, anybody just starting
out, looking for their very first DSLR camera

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.200
this is going to do everything that you need
from still images to HD video at 1080P.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.849
So that's what you're looking for, and this
could be it.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.450
So let's unbox to sniff it, and tell you what
else I think about it.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.120
Boom, oh this is the Version 2 lens.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.080
Let's see if it's 25% lighter and sharper.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.620
Oh yeah it's definitely lighter.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.310
It now has a button on the side to lock it
and unlock it.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.319
It's a kit lens.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.980
For anybody just starting out the kit lens
is going to be very, very basic.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.810
It's going to do a fine job.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.180
It's not the end-all be-all, but just starting
out get to learn your camera, get to learn

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.180
what you're doing, then you can upgrade to
something else in the future so you got that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.020
lens, let's get out the body, let's just feel
what it's like and then we'll wrappy make

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.990
wrap us in it up.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.489
So it's wrapped up in the Styrofoamy popping
buttons, no Styrofoam.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.950
Oh yeah, South Beach smell, because it has
that suntan lotion oil smell go into it.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.730
Yeah you like that so smaller camera, extremely
light without a battery in there.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.010
But again you got to remember baseline camera
right off the bat if you're just looking to

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.209
do some basic still images, it's going to
do a great job.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.700
You're looking to make little short videos
and you're starting to figure out how to progress

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.730
as a videographers it's a okay place to start.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.480
What makes it better for a video camera now
is that Nikon has finally included a mike

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.090
input meaning you could get something like
I'm wearing or you could get a road Smart

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.750
Lab [Phonetic] [0:03:43] which is going to
give you a better audio.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.629
Very simple, you've got your on/off switch.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.410
You've got your record video.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.250
The back is very easily or very well put together.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.379
Everything is where it should be and you'll
take your one SD card right there.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.989
Other than that this thing is the lightest
thing I've ever felt.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.870
I can't believe that this is a camera and
I can't believe that it's not butter, but

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.180
it is extremely light.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.790
It's all plastic, but it is what it is for
650 bucks just a little less than that to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.989
get into the game with DSLR video and photos.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.069
This is going to be a nice option.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.590
So that is what we have this time.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.660
That's an Unboxing and Sniff test of the Nikon
D3300 from Allen's Camera.
