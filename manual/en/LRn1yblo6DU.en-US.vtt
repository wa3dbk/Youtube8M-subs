00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.110
a 37 year old guy named demon to bias

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.330
exxon was driving around in Dunwoody
Georgia

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.110
and apparently he had all little too
much to drink

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.070
because he ended up slamming into a
police car

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.140
now he was okay and

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.900
the cop was also OK but this guy
casually drove off

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.130
as if nothing happened as if he didn't
just slammed into a police car

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.010
well naturally the police caught up to
him and pulled him over

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.719
and here's the best part the story she

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.040
when they asked him for his license

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.250
he handed the cop a beer

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.329
awesome

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.780
Dunwoody police spokesman sergeant fidel

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.289
Espinoza said the suspect was quote
totally unaware that he had even

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.719
collided with the officer's patrol car

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.110
so exxon was arrested on eight
misdemeanor charges including DUI and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.100
reckless driving

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.049
it was his third DUI arrest he's being
held in the DeKalb County Jail

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
on three thousand two hundred seventy
dollars bond so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.570
a good little PSA to the kids out there
don't drink and drive because you might

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.880
do stupid shit like this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.900
the said look it's all about safety in
moderation

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.439
and wanna be too corny or 2g0 anything
but

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.520
less thing I'll say a match in this
story was about somebody that was high

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.790
on weed and they did this

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.960
the republicans and Fox News would be
screaming to keep a weed illegal see

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.390
somebody crashed and then they hit the
officer a blunt could you believe that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.920
they handed him a joint afterwards how
ridiculous is that band we draw

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.220
everybody in jail fuck 'em

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.329
lock em up throw away the key but when
it's a alcohol

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.770
nobody's covering a story nobody
suggesting we should ban alcohol

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.509
and right but they shouldn't they
shouldn't suggest a ban it for weed they

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.479
shouldn't suggest you bennett for
alcohol

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.090
we just accept that some people are
gonna be morons right

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.619
but again the PSA is don't drink and
drive cuz you

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.619
don't drink and drive excuse me I sound
drunk

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.869
cuz you might end up doing some stupid
shit like this
