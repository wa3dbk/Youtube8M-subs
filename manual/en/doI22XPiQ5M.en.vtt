Hey folks! This is Don Perkins with a Quick
and Dirty Review

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.179
of Wiz Dice 100 pack of random
polyhedral dice.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.730
I got this set in today. Today is February
25th 2014. I ordered 'em off of Amazon.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.640
This pack cost me, I think, $19.99

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.380
and, uh,. it had a surprise 'cuz none of the
reviews I saw said this.  Everything

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.109
indicated it'd be a random collection dice
and you'd be able to get good sets out of it.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.320
But here's the big reveal: 
and you've probably already seen...

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.950
can tell what I'm about to show you: 
there are complete sets of dice in this.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.520
All different colors.  And don't
forget there's a little bag they add in here

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.000
 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.920
with... that has another set of... full set... 
guaranteed full set of dice in here, we'll show you what that

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.079
looks like in a moment, 
(It turns out that it  duplicates one of these sets), 
but this is their

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.910
so-called "free set" of dice that's in there.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.300
But if you count that set of dice I just
threw off camera

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.379
that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, 
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.479
SEVENTEEN polyhedral sets of platonic solids dice!

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.400
That's right, d4, d6,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.380
d8, d10, percentile, d12, d20...
they're all here.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.900
I've got white. I've got pearl with gold
lettering. I've got a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.820
opaque red; a translucent red; an
opaque yellow;

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.009
opaque green; translucent green; a marblized

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.640
solid green. I've got a dark
translucent blue;

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.170
a light translucent blue; a light
opaque blue.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.369
We've got a nice deep purple translucent.
We've got

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.220
a purple, verging on violet,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.040
opaque set.  We have a brown set.  We have a marblized white and black set

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.000
that... we have...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.170
(um, you know) it's black with white marbling.
And we have a full-on

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.229
black set of dice.
Hands down

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.340
this is the best deal right now out there.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.400
(laughs)
I've got all these sets of dice.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.429
119 dice, all in matched polyhedral sets.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.790
You can't go wrong.  
I am gonna show you what was in the little bag.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.500
[It] turns out that it matches this marblized set.
Now this will be random... it's not...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.030
You may get something different. And again, 
I don't know if Wz is doing something

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.739
different in their packaging now

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.800
than what they've done before... because,
again nobody else's review said you were getting

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.160
full sets of dice.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.180
I certainly did.
Whoever picked my packet

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.300
definitely tried to give me matched sets.
Hopefully...

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.450
(I'm dropping dice on the ground as I do this.)
Hopefully you'll get the same.  So

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
this is the winner.  This beats out Chessex,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.500
with their random dice of factory seconds.  
This beats out the White Tower set,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.260
which is a beautiful set of translucent dice.
Again you're not guaranteed colors

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.099
on this one,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.120
where you are guaranteed exactly
what you're getting on the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.600
White Tower set.   But I gotta tell ya: this is a beautiful set of dice and the fact that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.590
they're all

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.590
in matched sets makes this a great value.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.600
119 dice in my set.  
Again, I can't guarantee everybody's gonna get the same thing,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.120
there's a good likelihood, though, you're
going to be seeing something very similar to this

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.620
when you open up your package.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.200
This is my hot top recommend.
Hopefully this review was helpful to you.  
If it was please hit

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.440

helpful."

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.510
Don out!
