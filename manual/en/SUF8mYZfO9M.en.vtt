00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.330
let

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.640
can continuing one of the i think the
most damning

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.979
just spent a forty-five minutes talking
steve clemons

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.249
about

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.359
the substance or lack thereof of the
debate

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.359
foreign policy debate

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.359
some instances there was some in some
missus there wasn't

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.029
but i think the one element that is
going to resonate

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.159
most electorally speaking

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.429
from the debate

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.429
was the fact that mitt romney was
continually

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.470
josh marshall once referred to as being
dead slacked

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.990
i think mit romney looked bleak

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.560
and befuddled

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.660
and how does dat

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.120
and did not stand up to president old
bomb a and i think conservatives are

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.100
gonna have a problem with this he sort
of had his face robin it a little bit

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.060
and conservatives just can't stand that

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.270
they're ok with mitt romney flip-flop
and they're ok with mitt romney

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.020
moderating and saying wait ass too

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.150
line for the lord said that he can get
elected but the one thing they cannot

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.750
tolerate

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.370
is adding president obama

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.190
this mandate and the metro sexual guy as
they like to refer to them

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.670
walked all over mitt romney

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.000
here's another example main

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.750
from a kit from the comedic perspective

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.120
not necessarily the most original

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080
but certainly you know

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.040
its key again for a wide audience this
is what you do you take from uh... oh

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.920
what's his face david spade

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.590
so uh... here is a president obama
talking about mitt romney's uh...

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.870
uh...

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.890
foreign policy

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.320
two months ago when your ass what's the
biggest geopolitical threat facing

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.310
american use of russia

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.380
not all kinda

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.409
is that russia

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.900
in the nineteen eighties are now calling
as per the foreign policy that because

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.720
hailed the cold war's been over for
twenty years

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.280
but government you know when it comes to
our foreign policy you seem to want

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.139
import the foreign policy as the
nineteen eighties

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.069
just like the social policy nineteen
fifties and the economic policies

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.569
nineteen twenties

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.440
you say that you're not interested

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.909
in duplicating what happened in iraq

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.339
but just a few weeks ago you said

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.310
you think we should have more troops in
iraq right now

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.590
and the the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.599
challenge we have a no you haven't been
a position of

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.519
actually execute foreign policy

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.809
every time you've offered an opinion

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:34.879
ueberroth

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.589
well so there it is uh...

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:41.219
president bombard one in all over did
bromley

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.909
and uh...

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.039
the funny thing is that we are in there
and it was practicing using yours

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.779
before that first debate it seems like
uh... president obama had been

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.359
practicing his ringers

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.189
and i think as sort of aback u_s_ and
superficial

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.019
as

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.269
the idea that that could actually means
something in terms of dampening

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.779
conservative busy as 'em i think that's
what we've seen
