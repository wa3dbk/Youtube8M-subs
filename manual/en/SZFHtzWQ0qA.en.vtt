00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.290
The Sims has always been a strange beast.
Just the initial concept of taking over someone

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.710
else's life and guiding them through the mundane
tasks that make up our own existence takes

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.750
on kind of a sinister tone when you think
about it. Of course if you think a little

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.930
more, the RPG genre is all about taking over
another person's life, and if you grind enough,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.210
monster slaying can become as monotonous as
attending a nine to five job and having to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.360
cook yourself dinner every night. It's kind
of amusing then to see that the latest installment

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.079
of The Sims is set back in medieval times,
with the express purpose of making the franchise

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.570
more like a traditional RPG.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.730
The game starts at character customization.
You can pick from pre-made sims or take the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.190
time to craft one to your liking. After that
you pick out of a few origin stories, and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.400
are thrown into the world. Luckily the game's
tutorial helps you on your way, and before

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.650
long you'll be questing, and filling your
house with furniture. Yes, the bulk of the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.590
game hinges around questing. As you befriend
members of the town, they will have quests

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
available to you. Completing these quests
will level up your attributes, incur fame

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.069
and favor, and give you job titles that hold
certain perks with them. Complete enough quests

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.240
and story quests become available which shape
the direction of your town and the world.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
While questing, you also have to keep an eye
on your status. If your sim is hungry, sleepy,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.679
anti-social, or stressed out from not enjoying
themselves, you need to spring into action

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.579
and take care of these basic needs, otherwise
your sim will start dragging their feet and

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.429
impeding your progress (and addressing these
needs awards your sim with points needed to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.939
get things done). Like other sim games, you
can purchase all manner of furniture for your

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.899
house, with such purchases like the dart board
helping you train certain attributes.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.740
For fans of The Sims, this game is a wonderful
hand holding introduction to some of the mechanics

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.939
of the RPG genre. It's a little slow paced,
and that will put some players off (especially

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.380
since it takes a while for the story mode
to reveal itself), but if the melding of The

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.439
Sims and a medieval world sounds like fun
to you, grab yourself an ale, sit back and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.630
immerse yourself in the world of Merry Ol'
Wherever this place is.
