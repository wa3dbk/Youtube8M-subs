00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:08.629
I'm Dan Doherty,

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.656
executive chef
at Duck and

00:00:09.656 --> 00:00:10.922
Waffle here in
the Heron Tower.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.118
[MUSIC]

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.513
Today I'm gonna
show you how to

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:15.962
make pollock
meatballs baked in

00:00:15.962 --> 00:00:18.220
a lobster cream with
a Parmesan crumble.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.510
If your fish is fresh and
your sauce is right,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.120
you're gonna have
the best meal ever.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.100
The first job,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.470
we take our beautiful,
fresh fish.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.820
You can put it
in the blender,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.110
give it a quick blend.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.810
Or if you don't have the
luxury of the blender,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.310
we're just gonna use
a nice, sharp knife.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.012
As you move it,

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:36.180
it kind of stays where
it's meant to be.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.770
So that's now ready to
go into, into the bowl.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.900
We take a little
splash of the cream,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.110
almost as a,
a little binding agent.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.224
You want to accentuate
the main ingredient,

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:46.280
which is the fish.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.000
Things like lemon,
tarragon, parsley, salt,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.180
it just kind of
heightens the flavor.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.060
It gives a really nice

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.920
herbaceous freshness
to it.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.980
The best way to
make the ball is to

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.310
just get your
hands dirty.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.900
You can give it a little

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.310
squeeze together to make
sure it stays together.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.171
That's now ready to

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:02.152
pop in the fridge until
we've made our sauce.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:07.712
[MUSIC]

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:10.270
Okay, so now we're gonna
make the lobster sauce.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.920
First thing we need to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.622
do is add half
of our butter.

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.220
When you're roasting
shellfish and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.720
things like that,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.565
when that butter
is bubbling away,

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:20.400
it just creates this most
amazing smell and flavor.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.270
So now we're gonna
add our vegetables.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.960
As the butter gets brown,
it becomes nutty and,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.250
you know, that's where
all the flavor is.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.379
In French they
have a term for

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:29.510
it called beurre
noisette,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.604
which means nutty butter.

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:32.165
Okay.
So the next stage is to

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:33.443
add the tomato purée.

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:35.140
You wanna go straight to
the bottom of the pan.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.870
If it gets caught
up into the shells,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.220
it won't get any
heat into it.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.208
So once the tomato
purée's cooked out,

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:41.377
three to five minutes,

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:43.198
we're gonna add
the lobster stock.

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:45.741
So just to cover.

00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:47.131
We're gonna let that
come to a boil and

00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.656
reduce that.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.870
And you always want to
reduce sauces on a,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.691
on a high heat so

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:53.590
none of the flavor gets
stale and boils away.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.480
Now the sauce is reduced
almost to nothing.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.900
We add the double cream,
and

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.810
then we're gonna just
move that to the side and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.710
allow it to infuse for
25 to 30 minutes to get

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.730
all that flavor
out of the shells.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.580
The final stage is

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.180
to caramelize
the bread crumbs.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.498
You want a little
bit of crunch and

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:10.650
a little bit of
a topping almost,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.518
just to bring it
all together.

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:13.150
I'm kind of addicted
to this and,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.790
you know, the chefs in
the kitchen made fun of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.220
me because I literally
put it on everything.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.471
Last thing we
need to do now is

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.015
strain our sauce because
that's now ready.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.990
That's what we
call liquid love.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.880
Just pour it over.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.670
Now, at home,
you want your oven to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.110
be preheated I'd say
about 180 degrees.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.100
The balls feel nice and
firm.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.360
They're ready to go.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.600
So we take our
Parmesan and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.020
sprinkle it over the top.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.018
We give it a further
minute or two inside,

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:41.024
just to melt, and
then we are ready to go.

00:02:41.024 --> 00:02:44.182
[MUSIC]

00:02:44.182 --> 00:02:45.029
Okay, so just to finish,

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.377
we're gonna add
the bread crumbs on top.

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:49.116
[MUSIC]

00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:49.720
Okay, and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.540
that's how you do wild
Cornish pollock meatballs

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.373
baked in a lobster cream
with a Parmesan crumble.

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:57.661
