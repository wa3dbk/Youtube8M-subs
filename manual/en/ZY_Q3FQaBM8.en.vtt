00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.250
Keep hanging baskets and potted arrangements
around your home looking fuller longer with

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.509
a little care.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.969
Its called deadheading, which means you regularly
remove any old blossoms or seed pods from

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:11.969
the plant.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.529
The reason we do deadheading is because all
flowering plants are supposed to produce a

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.480
blossom which then turns into a seed head.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.100
And once it puts out its seed head and re-seeds
itself it has done its job.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.619
It has lived its life expectancy so it slows
down.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.620
So we as gardeners sometime back have realized
that if we cut off the old blossoms and we

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.210
cut off that seed head we are tricking the
flower into blooming more.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.510
First you want to get your hanging basket
down to where you can see it, looking at any

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.940
old foliage.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.510
Some of them you can just simply pull out.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.039
Some you want to cut back, but we would want
to go down and cut back to the next leaf node

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.080
and make a cut.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.280
This is going to promote new growth to come
out.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.190
As you're going through deadheading, you're
going to want to make sure you get a clean

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.250
cut.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.750
You know you can use your fingernail.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.650
But a good shears, or a good pruning device
is really helpful in making that clean cut.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.740
If you don't make a clean cut you're asking
for disease to enter into the stem when its

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.230
dying off.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.760
Undercutting is also really important, not
only is deadheading, but when you undercut

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.120
you want to go from underneath and start thinning
that out.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.680
Because what happens is it gets really leggy,
so if you go in and you kind of just start

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.190
thinning out you're also promoting more growth
by doing that.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.670
And sometimes they say that 25 percent of
your basket can be thinned out and within

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.840
2 to 3 days it's going to start producing
new shoots.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.880
Here we've got this beautiful sweet potato
vine, and its going to grow as one vine, and

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.160
you see underneath there its going to start
dying out because its not getting the proper

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.660
air ventilation.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.409
So what we'll want to do is go in and prune
our vines and our flowers again, going back

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.969
to the next leaf node, making a clear cut,
this is going to promote this to grow two

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:27.109
stems out and thicken out and not be that
long, leggy look that sometimes we see.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:32.719
That's how you fill in a nice full basket.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.420
and what we mean by haircut is going in and
not really paying attention to where you're

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.870
cutting and just going in and making good
clean cuts and promoting new growth.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.819
Sometimes our flowers are just tired they're
straggly they're spindly and just by going

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.650
in and making good haircuts this is the best
for this plant right here.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.661
Like these pansies, these are a cool season
crop and they love it in the springtime, and

00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:01.890
they love it in the fall when it's cold.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.790
So, in the middle of June, these will start
slowing down with the blossom process, so

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.560
what you can do is you can go in and just
give these a good haircut.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.319
Just like a lawnmower, just go in and mow
em off.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.319
Slow the process down and get more energy
for fall.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.999
By doing that you're not only promoting thicker,
healthier growth, but you're doing what perennials

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:28.750
do over the winter, you're letting them slow
down and rejuvenate for fall growing.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.609
Angie says with proper care, your hanging
baskets and flowering plants can keep looking

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.670
great all summer long.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.439
