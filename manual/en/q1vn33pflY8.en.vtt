00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.980
Now we're going to begin with skin care. This
is the most important step other than removal

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.320
at the end of the night. You need to take
care of your skin. Your makeup is only going

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.110
to look as good as the skin underneath it.
You want to make sure that you cleanse your

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.539
face completely before you start your makeup.
Don't do your makeup over your old makeup

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.881
from the night before. Just don't do it. Cleanse
your skin completely. Make sure all the makeup

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:29.060
residue is off. Once your skin is completely
cleansed, then immediately apply your moisturizer.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.360
Depending on your skin type, you can use an
oil-free moisturizer. A moisturizer with an

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.670
SPF is good for daytime. She has a little
drier of a skin type, so I'm going to use

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.600
a bit of a more moisturizing moisturizer just
to give a little more hydration. Apply it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.590
all over the face
and even down the neck. Don't forget the neck.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:09.100
The neck is a very important part. Around
the eyes. You don't want to put a ton on,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.049
but definitely make sure that you spread it
evenly and that all parts of your face have

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.359
moisturizer on it. It'll just make your makeup
go on a lot nicer too. Then I'm going to use

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:25.049
a little bit of an eye cream as well, which
I think is very important. Just around the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.630
eye area. Put a tiny bit of eye cream before
you start your makeup. Anything you put around

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.439
your eyes will go on so much smoother and
your eyes is where you see your age most often,

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.509
so you want to make sure that your eyes look
fresh, young, and healthy. Lastly, you want

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.330
to put on a lip conditioner, especially if
you're using a lot of lip colors and especially

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.920
in the winter. You want to make sure that
your lips are very, very hydrated. Rub your

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.099
lips together. Now we're ready to start with
foundation.
