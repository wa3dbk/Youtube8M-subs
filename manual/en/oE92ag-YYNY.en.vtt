00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.000
It's early forenoon.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.750
At first put a sign.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.800
Type into the first line "[timesign]".
(case is ignored)

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.000
When you left the second line free

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.000
and make a rightclick on the sign

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
the current time is displayed in the second line.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
To change the time write a value

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
between 0 and 24000 on the second line.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now a rightclick change the time.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, now after reading the time
the first sign is ready for usage.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Not only numbers can be used

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.000
but also names representing a daytime.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The server's administrator is able to change the list of names.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If you have no sign in inventory

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and you're out of wood

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but have a watch with you.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.000
You can easily change the time

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.000
by rightclick onto a block.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It only switches between
sunrise and sunset.
