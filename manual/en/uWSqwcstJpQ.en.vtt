♩ Good evening my dear, your escort is here! ♩

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.720
Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.200
With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.160
Especially, if it leads to the movies.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.240

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.600
You're starting to annoy me!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.880
Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.200

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.100

I'm sorry, Finn. I just...

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.640
I don't wanna date you.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.300
Date me?! Man, I just want to go to the movies.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.060
Movies!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.840
If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.900
'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.740

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.220
Of course, as friends.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.240
But no tongue.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.620
