Hi! I am Weldon Moon on behalf of Expertvillage.com
we are going to the final steps of building

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.570
a spiral staircase. We are going to mount
the platform on as you see, I have laid it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.099
down. touched things up and got ready. it
is little hard to mount this up on the platform

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.940
and hold it up and get it right. So this makes
the things a lot easier, we set it down on

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.750
the ground and then we can just use measurements.
What you want to do is use some quarter inch

00:00:40.750 --> 00:01:14.560
self tappers, tapping screws and mount this
on their at the proper heightâ€¦ Again I have

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.830
got the lines where the last step goes and
this is how we line it up, put the line that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.790
are on the pole. On this platform the reason
I screw it on, is because it makes it rather

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.610
awkward for the powder coaters to move this
around and paint it as it is fairly easy and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.930
symmetrical it works pretty good without it
on. So we take it off and powder coat it separately

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.490
so that I get powder coated under all the
surfaces and you do not have any spots that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.640
will rust. Rusting is an important factor
and you want to make sure that if you do this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.350
you have a competent welding this up and make
sure that they do a good job. Make sure it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.170
is dry and it will last a longtime. This is
a great item of the spiral and people like

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.170
to come in and look at these just because
it is unique, and it is a great conversation

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.810
piece beside being very practical.
