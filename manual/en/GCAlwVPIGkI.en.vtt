00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.070
 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.020
Now our shifter here
has a broken shift stop.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.832
It keeps backing out and
causing some shifting issues.

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:15.040
So we're going to go ahead
and pull it out of the way

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.100
and throw in one of
our economy shifters.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.700
This thing right here
is bad to the bone.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.310
You're going to have such
a shorter shift throw

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.310
than your stock shifter.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.190
It's made out of
billet, light weight,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.510
has integrated shift stops
in it, with lock nuts.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.009
That way, you
won't have to worry

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.870
about damaging your T-5
or T-45 transmission.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.690
Now to remove your
existing shifter,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.570
a 13 millimeter or half
inch socket is all you need.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330
Simply pull out
the four bolts that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.110
hold in the existing shifter.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:26.510
 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.480
And then break the seal between
shifter and the transmission.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.020
Pick it up out of the way.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.960
Clean the entire area on
top of the transmission.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.400
Apply a fresh [INAUDIBLE]
of Permatech's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.287
Ultra Black or
something similar.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.370
And then you can bolt your
new shifter into place.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.580
 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.170
Now that we've got the new bead
of silicone laid into place,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.330
went ahead and throw the
economy shifter down,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.700
tightened up the
first three bolts.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.890
Now the economy shifter comes
with new Allen head hardware

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.130
and washers to attach
it to the transmission.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.950
Takes a six
millimeter Allen head

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.610
to tighten those into place.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.530
Go ahead and run the
last one down here.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.010
Just double check the pattern.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.665
Catty corner.

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:19.510
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.570
All right.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.260
Now we're going to
set the shift stops.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.630
Go ahead and slide it
up into third gear.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.320
Take your six
millimeter Allen socket

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.910
and run the shift stop
in until it barely

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.440
touches the shifter
handle, and then

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.970
back it out about
an eighth of a turn.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.910
And then tighten down the lock
nut with an adjustable wrench.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.380
And we'll do the same thing.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.438
Pull it down into fourth gear.

00:02:46.438 --> 00:02:50.460
Run that shifter stop up
til it barely touches,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.980
back it off about
an eighth of a turn,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.780
and tighten down that lock nut.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.230
Now your shifter stops are set.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.390
You won't have to worry
about damaging the shift

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.466
forks inside your transmission.

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:10.020
Now we can go ahead and
take the lower shift boot,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.180
slide it back into place.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.890
Unlike some
aftermarket shifters,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.660
you do not have to trim your
shift boot with our economy

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.090
shifter.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.610
Just work it around.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.910
Throw your four bolts in.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.470
And then you can grab your new
handle and slide it into place.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.340
Now this handle
has two positions

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.920
it can be in, fully down or up.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.430
We're going to go for
the up position here.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.360
It has talent Allen head
bolts that hold it into place.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.030
We recommend a little bit
of blue or red Lock Tight

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.800
to keep these things
from backing out.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.060
And it takes a five
millimeter Allen

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.340
head to get these into place.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.270
Now once you get these
bolts tightened up,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.810
you can go ahead,
throw in your console,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.900
and enjoy your new shifter.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.030
