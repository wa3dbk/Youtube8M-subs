00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:04.941
- I think a next generation classroom

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:09.093
is one that is not necessarily
laden with technology,

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:12.130
but is infused with sort of a new way

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.247
of teaching students and
actually getting them

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:16.449
engaged in their learning
in a different way.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.761
- The role of the student

00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:21.844
will be moving from a passive learner

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.316
to an active learner.

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:30.882
So that's gonna be a shift
in the role of the instructor

00:00:30.882 --> 00:00:32.215
and the student.

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:35.201
- We know from research that

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.430
in order for students to remember things

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.091
and to apply them, they
have to work with them,

00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:42.293
they have to take this information

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:45.497
and actually make it fit
into what they already know

00:00:45.497 --> 00:00:47.071
and to their current schemas.

00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.980
- Whereas before maybe
students would come in

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.062
and sit in the back, check
their email, look at Facebook,

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:56.062
now they are in a small group often,

00:00:56.963 --> 00:00:58.983
with four or five other people,

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:00.933
and all those distractions are gone.

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.968
They are completely centered

00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:05.629
on looking at or solving a problem,

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.245
talking with their peers,

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.571
trying to really find their
own professional voice.

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.759
- Because this style of
teaching is very interactive

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.088
and has the students also
interacting with each other

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.697
and with the professor and
also teaching each other,

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:20.271
I have gained a lot more information

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.804
on the specific topics.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:24.381
And having different people's
opinions and experiences

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.101
makes for a broader range of learning

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.397
and an increase in knowledge

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:31.263
that probably wouldn't be available

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.047
from one person's opinion.

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:34.872
- I really enjoy having class

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:37.129
in the active learning classrooms

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.587
as opposed to the lecture halls

00:01:39.587 --> 00:01:43.000
because it feels less like
a task to come to class

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.452
and more like something
to look forward to.

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:47.890
We can tailor the topics
that we learn about

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.137
to our own personal
experiences and backgrounds,

00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:52.377
and as a result,

00:01:52.377 --> 00:01:55.999
all of the information
is much more meaningful

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.983
and applicable to our
interests and our work field.

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:01.767
- We need young people

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.843
in the workplace, in our world,

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:05.863
who can really do great critical thinking.

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:08.942
And so, when we are
practicing critical thinking

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:10.265
every single day,

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:13.559
as opposed to passive
reception of knowledge,

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.917
we are going to get such
a payoff I think in future

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:18.909
because students are going to know

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.985
how to do critical thinking here,

00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:22.343
and then they're going to
move out into the world

00:02:22.343 --> 00:02:23.708
and they're gonna know how to dig in,

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.700
they're gonna know how to
talk about difficult topics,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.111
they're gonna know how to apply knowledge

00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:29.392
to current situations.

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:32.290
And so I really feel like the
payoff is going to be great

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.575
for the learners of tomorrow,

00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:36.734
for the kind of workers
that we need for tomorrow.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.890
It'll be an absolutely terrific payoff.
