00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.300
This October, the Supreme Court
is going to be hearing a case on

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.800
invocate-- religious invocations
at city council meetings.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.800
And they haven't done anything like this
in 30 years. So, this is actually a big deal.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.700
It will talk-- it'll let us know whether
or not we can have religious convocations,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.300
-- religious invocations rather --

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.000
at city council meetings
and maybe even beyond that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.700
And here's the story
of what happened:

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.100
For years, the city
of Greece, New York,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.600
they had a moment
of silence and then

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.100
I think about 13... 14 years ago,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.400
they started doing a

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.200
Christian prayer.
They started having an invocation.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.000
And for like 10 years--
I'm sorry, for like 7 or 8 years,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.100
it was all Christian prayers
all the time.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.100
And they would have local chaplains,
priests come in and deliver this prayer.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
And then, finally, some-- two women said:
"You know what? You can't just have Christian's praying.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Like, you got to have some other options here.
And they filed a lawsuit.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.600
And while the lawsuit was happening, the city had a--
I think 4 of the next 12 meetings had non-Christian

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.600
invocation speakers.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.400
And then they went right back to Christian,
Christian, Christian, all the time.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700
And basically, the initial

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.400
court, the judge
in the case said:

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
"Those Christian prayers?
Totally fine. It's tradition."

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.400
And so, the two ladies, one of whose name
is Galloway -- last name Galloway --

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.600
her side filed an appeal.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.800
And the appeals court said: "You totally can't
just have Christian prayers all the time."

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.300
And there's a few reasons for this.
One is that it

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.000
makes the side-- It makes you think
the government is endorsing Christianity.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600
And that's not okay.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.200
And there's also some pressure, like some coercion that
everyone has to participate at a city council meeting.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.600
And so, for a
variety of reasons,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.800
it's not okay to just have
Christian invocation prayers.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.900
At least as we know
the law to be right now,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.000
you can usually get away

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with invocation prayers
at the City Council meeting

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
or, you know, a state government
meeting, or anything like that,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.500
as long as they are nondenominational. You know,
you could say, you know, "Let's all pray to God

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
that we have a good meeting"
or just pray to God. Period.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
But you can't say "Jesus".
You can't say

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.600
"Buddha". You can't say "Allah". You can't name
your God. Just have a non-denominational prayer.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.800
And that's being
pretty much okay.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.600
And what was
happening in Greece,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
they're not nondenominational.
They are very sectarian

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.700
godly Christian prayers.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.800
So, anyway. Second, the appeals
court said it's not okay.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.200
So, Greece can't
do that anymore.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.100
And so, the town's side decided to go to the Supreme
Court. They said: "We want the Supreme Court to look at this."

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.100
And usually, the Supreme Court says no to everything.
They're not going to listen to your case. They'll just let the lower courts

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.500
decision stand.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.500
They took up this case. They said:
"We want to hear your arguments."

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.700
And so, now
the question is:

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.000
Is it okay for Christians to deliver
openly Christian prayers

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.800
at government meetings?
And that's a big question,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
because if the answer is yes,
if the Supreme Court says

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.400
the appeals court
was wrong, and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.500
it's totally fine to have
these religious invocations,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.100
you know, as long as--
Everyone can do religious invocation prayers,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.400
what's going to happen is you're going to
start seeing Christian prayers all across the country,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.900
because they're
in the majority.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.500
And almost every city council meeting will start having
Christian prayers all across the country. That would be a disaster.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.000
It would make the government into
just another church, really.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.600
So, I definitely don't want to see that happen and
you never know how this Court's going to act.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.400
So, this is a big deal. 30 years ago is the
last time they weighed in on this matter.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.900
It's a very different
court now.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.000
So, we're gonna have to see
how they're going to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.300
rule on this, but it's a
big question and I hope people

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.600
pay attention to it
when it comes up this fall.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.600

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.300
and we hope to see your comments
and discussion below.
