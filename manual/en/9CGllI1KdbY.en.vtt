The Menehune Mayhem is a free surf contest
that I put on with the help of my friends

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.760
and family and this will be the ninth year
that we're putting it on.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.550
Each year I try to one-up what I've done the
previous year and make it a lot more fun for

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:15.250
the kids and this year I'm having a dunk tank,
a jumping castle, a gigantic scavenger hunt,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.450
an art show area where they can paint rocks
and t-shirts and canvases, I'm gonna bring

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.170
in a kid's band that play really good music,
I'm flying in a DJ so they can have good music

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:44.960
all day once the band's finished, and aside
from all of that it's a surf event, and even

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.680
if you don't surf it's a good place to come
down and just enjoy the beach, whether you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.140
are into surfing at that age or not there's
a ton of activities for the kids to do and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.970
over the last nine years it's snowballed with
the help of the community and my family and

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.190
friends into one of the biggest events on
the island and something I look forward to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.350
every year.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.829
Menuhune Mayhem started nine years ago because
I felt like there wasn't really a lot of contests

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.030
for the kids to do on Maui, about 150 kids
probably and I think every single one of them

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.370
has a smile on their face right now.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.440
I think for me the most rewarding thing about
having this contest is just seeing all the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.190
kids stoked and everyone has a good time at
the beach.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:39.650
The simplest thing in the world is happiness
and I'm a big fan of it.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.400
Any kid growing up on Maui has somewhere to
surf whether it's the north side, the south

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.060
side, the west side, the east side, you're
on an island so no matter what direction you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.480
go in you're eventually gonna run into an
ocean and fortunately for us, myself included

00:02:54.480 --> 00:04:08.780
having grown up here there's tons of different
waves.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:05:24.960
No matter what else is going on in the world
on that day, I'm gonna be on Maui to run that

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.960
event.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.250
That's probably the one day out of the whole
year that I actually have set in stone that

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.120
I'll be somewhere and I wouldn't miss it for
anything else.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.820
Welcome to the Ian Walsh Experience.
