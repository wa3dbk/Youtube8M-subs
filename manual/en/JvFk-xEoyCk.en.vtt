00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.680
one, two, three, four!

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.040
Rev up your engines!

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.380
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.080
okay it's happened to all of us we're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.190
running an air conditioner and water
gets all in the passenger side and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.810
stinks everything up, so today I'm going
to show you how to fix that wattery mess

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.800
for good, so open the hood to find out
why the mess started in the first place

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.809
if you look on the intakes here, you'll
notice all kinds of leaves and flowers

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.690
and that's because I park under this giant
crape myrtle bush here, more of a tree,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.100
some of this crud gets sucked into the
vents, sucked into the evaporator case

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
in here and clogs the drain hose that's
supposed to drain the water out and then

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.480
once clogged up, the water makes a little
dam and starts going up, and up, and up

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.830
and it all spills and gets under the carpet,
makes everything wet and stinky, so get a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.250
good shop vac, and suck all this crud away

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.990
once it's all clean, that will keep future
crud from getting inside the evaporator

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.450
and clogging the drain, you cleaned the
drain but in this case, there's not any

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.079
working room on the drain hose down here,
so we'll Jack the car up in the air and

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.189
get it from the bottom side, now in many
cars you do have to jack it up to access

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
the drain hose, but I just checked on this Celica and it's a lot easier, because the drain

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.280
hose is right here, we can reach it with
our bare hands and hook a hose up to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.329
squirt it out right here, then just get a
piece of long hose that'll fit over that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.000
hose, then slip it on like this so it
covers the hose, then just get a garden

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.399
hose put it next to the hose, put your
hand over to cup it and squirt it a few

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.820
times to send water back up to clean it
out and you can now see it dripping out

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.539
now you do this process three or four
times and if you park under a tree like

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.659
me and refuse to move,
do it once a month to keep all the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.590
crud out, now if I could only figure out
how to keep these birds from crapping on

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.550
my car all the time life would be
perfect, well at least the carpet won't

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.080
be wet anymore, and remember if you've
got any car question just visit

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.850
Scotty Kilmer.com
and I'll answer them as soon as I get

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.110
back from the asylum!
