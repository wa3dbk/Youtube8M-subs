00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There was time and we couldn't imagine anything ever changing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Even that we are the change

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
ReuniÃ£o de classe

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500
And them it happend after all 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200
inevitably

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We've ... wait intellectualy in the right places hopefully

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yes we grown ups now
Mature, sensible

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
But could there be something in us that stayed the same

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Something that drive us deep down

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.500
Something that keep us young and revitilizes us

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.000
Something that speers us own to do our best

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
Time and again

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.000
No matter how old we are

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
It is our core values that define our caracter 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
it is this inner streams that make us who we are

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.800
This is the only way we can keep developing and yet remain true to ourselves

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
like the new nine eleven
