00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
There are very few games that can reasonably
scare you and then there is Dark Souls.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.610
The game is somewhat of a sequel to the remarkable
Demon Souls but this time around you are given

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.340
an entire world to explore and die in contrary
to the first game’s hub-based castle setting.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:18.570
Dark Souls is hard and you will die a lot
but with a game of this polish and finesse,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.260
every time you die the blame goes to your
own hands.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.320
Again, like the first game, Dark Souls is
very light on plot, letting actions speak

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.860
louder than words and action you will find
a plenty here.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.889
The graphics convey a dark and haunting atmosphere
while the game play and controls are smooth

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:34.370
and intuitive.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.999
Again you given the task to roam, kill, collect
souls to advance your character and proceed

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.339
through the very minimalistic plotline.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:53.999
The controls are spot on so the gamble between
life and death is fluid and exact.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.229
No single boss fight is the same, making each
encounter a new experience.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.350
The new covenant system is also a fresh surprise
that allows you to make or break new relationships

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.659
with NPC’s that either helps you live or
help you die.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.530
Online play remains as a solid component where
you get to get short glimpses of other player’s

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.799
deaths and this can be the key factor in helping
you to go any further.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.580
With a game so well polished that the moments
when the game coughs up and lags can be so

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.580
noticeable although it does not completely
ruin the experience.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.649
When the frame rate drops the game just stutters
and you may also end up with one or two glitches

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.630
where a boss gets stuck in a wall or hangs
over empty space.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.290
Dark Souls is a terrifying game in a very
good way.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.799
There is no other title that gives you a sense
of satisfaction even as you continuously die

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.119
every fifteen minutes or so.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.520
It has a steady learning curve with an amazing
presentation and controls.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:57.350
Final score: 9 out of 10.
