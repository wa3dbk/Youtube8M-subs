Bug Out Bunker Tour

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.210
Hi it's AlaskaGranny

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.649
I call this my bunker  and I filled it up with

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.650
supplies last fall and I haven't been out to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.860
check it since then so it's gonna see
have anything

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.860
weathered over the winter and I thought I would share the experience with you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.900
spider webs

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.900
 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.970
I can see from here it still looks dry

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.370
so that's a good start very dark in here

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.800
in the  very first bucket  I have a gamma lid with a
flashlight

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.800
a crank up flashlight right on the top  and some matches

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.180
so I can crank it up and easily 
look around for what else I need

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.200
I did that on purpose I have some oil lamps

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.759
light one and show you around

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.170
the bunker is not full of spiders and  things
are actually pretty dry

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.500
I have some number ten cans of fruit

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.200
I have toiletries and medicine here

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.130
lanterns and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.590
and food supplies  oils  cleaning supplies  vinegar  bags

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.590
more oil lamps some

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.850
fuel I have some forever foods  sugar salt tea brown sugar  vinegar foods that should

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.810
last a lifetime I have more number ten
cans of

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.670
rice eggs biscuit mix and toilet paper

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.100
some I will be  interested to see if that held up

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.220
to the moisture in here

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.830
I have sugar   the lids I got didn't exactly fit so I put food in jars and then

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.190
inside the 5 gallon buckets 
just try to help a little bit

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.590
that when you get your free  buckets for food storage

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.590
bucket they're not always a good
idea

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.510
I have oatmeal and brown sugar in number 10 cans

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.440
I have beans and rice in number 10 cans

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.290
the bottom shelf has  charcoal with some lighter fluid

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.430
I have a luggable loo emergency toilet

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.110
loaded with supplies I have a bucket with a red lid   that is first aid supplies

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.170
have them packaged foods inside a 5 gallon bucket with a gamma lid

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.180
mashed potatoes  macaroni and cheese noodle roni  things
like that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.330
bucket with gamma lid and and there's another
bucket

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.130
of food behind that that I have stored some

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.290
extra  foods and be sure you 
put labels on what you have in these things

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.380
so you remember what they are and what you have

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.209
I have a toolkit I have

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.770
a water barrel over here just some funky
old

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.890
tools and then I have some flower pots

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.420
with soil in them  if I needed
to start an emergency garden or

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.440
I want  to  long-term store root
vegetables

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.030
I have that available so it's a good
start I don't have everything in here

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.780
but this is not all the supplies I have
these are the supplies I have

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.739
so far  at this location and I'm
thinking for

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.290
year 1 of my bunker I'm pretty happy how
that turned out

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.370
so let me know what you're doing

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.000
gather up supplies for your family

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
