00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.080
I had a chance to catch up with Vito Rallo
who is the author of a new book called exposing

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.300
the danger between martial arts and yoga.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.730
I will start by asking what’s your personal
background in martial arts?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.430
My background was involved in [ ] karate and
in that nearly 30 years I do have extensive

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.620
work in the martial arts that I can speak
as an expert on it.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.620
I was a five time national champion.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.440
I was an instructor in two different universities.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.910
And throughout my history and involvement
in the martial arts I gained a lot of knowledge

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.190
of what to do and what not to do.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.150
So at some point then you got the revelation
that it was not healthy.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.370
That is was dangerous.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.510
When did that happen?

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.100
Well that happened about three years ago when
I began to do some research.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.390
I didn’t want to do the research because
I wanted totally out of this.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.439
But then there were church people and other
people that got me … there were church people

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.560
that got me involved with this again and then
against my true knowledge of knowing what

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.380
was in the martial arts as though that point
on everything seemed to go downhill until

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.540
God kindly delivered me out of the martial
arts and the spirits behind it.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.200
So what are those specific dangers that you
see for people of for Christians involved

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.930
in martial arts?

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.420
Well that basically goes back to the history
of yoga.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.600
That’s where the martial arts came out of
and because the martial arts came out of yoga

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.210
they are all connected to Hinduism and they
are all connected to Zen Buddhism and so today

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.960
people no matter what they call martial arts,
they can call it Christian Martial Arts, Christian

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.340
Yoga, they can say anything that they want
but in actuality it is a form of Hinduism.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.210
Actually a person is practicing Hinduism in
going through that.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.170
If they do any kind of training.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.660
So does that open the door for certain things
in their life?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660
Yes.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.069
There are spirits behind everything that you
do.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.909
You can’t separate the spiritual from the
physical.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:26.900
It’s impossible even other people are involved
like masters will tell you Hinduism and yoga

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.970
are connected just as the martial arts are
connected to Zen and Buddhism.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.621
There’s no separation of the two because
of the physical aspects behind them you are

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:40.760
going to see that the power sourcing used
called universal power source that we talked

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.330
about in my book.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.510
We talk about the energy that gives that person
that power.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.230
I asked a martial artist one time although
at the time I didn’t understand it, where

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.261
do they get the power from?

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:57.780
And they said well it’s from this energy
out in space or wherever it is at all around

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.780
us.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.780
But not the God of the bible?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.470
No it’s not the God of the bible so what
they are saying is that personal energy is

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.940
the energy they draw from.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.341
That energy is not of God but that energy
is of a demonic realm.

00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:14.830
What would you say to Christian parents who
are maybe looking for programs for their children?

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.980
Self-defense or martial arts.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.840
Are there any safe martial arts programs or
things for children?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.990
My fifty years of knowledge of the martial
arts says the opposite.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.020
There are no safe martial arts.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.020
They are all connected.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.239
Both spiritually and physically there is something.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.700
They are connected to a Hindu religion.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.540
Now I keep going back to that because that
same Hindu religion for example was practiced

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.130
at the white house a couple of years ago and
they let 1000 children practice yoga on the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.489
front lawn of the white house and that happened
to be on the very holiest day we have which

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.489
is Easter.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.870
Sometimes you see Christian yoga, is there
such a thing as Christian yoga?

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.870
It’s impossible.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.909
You can’t separate the two.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:10.850
Once again yoga is Hinduism and yoga is Zen
Buddhism is the martial arts and it’s all

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.850
interconnected.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.459
In my book I [ ] that out about what those
two connections are Zen Buddhism in the Hindu

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.459
religion.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.459
Vito thank you.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.849
We appreciate you taking your time today.

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:23.849
Thank you.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:29.560
In order to legitimize the martial arts and
keep it in a form which is palatable and people

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:42.229
won’t believe Hinduism or Zen Buddhism they
have given it titles such as Tae Kwon Do University.

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.600
This makes it palatable because people believe
that their children are being educated in

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.779
some type of educational.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.240
They are but they don’t realize what that
education is or what’s behind that education.
