Hi I'm Hondapro Jason, welcome to the HondaPro
Show.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.200
watched by over 1.3 million people, and kept
alive because you subscribe.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.300
this week I have Honda news starting in the
U.Ss and going all the way to Japan.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.080
I'm Super Charged about it.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:31.840
So lets get into it.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.550
The SEMA show in Las vegas is here and gone.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.999
Now the SEMA show is where auto manufacturers
get to show off all of there after market

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:39.999
parts.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.789
and honda had a huge display.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.140
They unavailing the 2014 Civic coupe, showed
off the new rear styling, showed off how the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.729
front and the front grill is going to be totally
different, also there is a hint of what might

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.949
be a lae watch camera and what I think might
be push button start.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.770
now they also showed off the Civic Si and
the new Civic si with there Performance upgrades.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.560
well Honda's performance upgrades ended up
being about 4 horsepower and 4 foot pounds

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.630
of torque now that's not the whole story.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.800
Hondas big news comes from HPD their unleashing
what they are calling thier Street performance

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
line.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.659
now they are starting with the CRZ and this
line includes things like lowering kit, bigger

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.399
wheels and tires, ground effects, and exhaust
system that comes right out of the center

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.579
of the rear bumper. and, a super charger,
wait.. did I just say a super charger? from

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.000
the Honda dealership?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.300
yes I did.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.100
which means if you buy a new car you get a
3 year 36 month warranty if you already own

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.119
a CRZ no problem, you still get a 1 year 12
moth warranty.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.430
Now not many people own the CRZ that's OK
Honda is going to releasing throughout the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.840
entire line up.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.789
which means the Civic, the Accord, even the
Odyssey and the Pilot might getting Super

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.540
chargers, now this is huge news and something
that us tuners and enthusiasts have been waiting

00:02:14.540 --> 00:04:45.960
for a very very long time.
