00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.300
There are some things PCs can do that console
games shouldn't.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.180
Call it division of labor, argue over superiority,
I don't care.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.560
And sure, while there's been some cross-contamination
that worked well - Goldeneye wresting dominance

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.720
in the FPS sector, or the Super Nintendo version
of SimCity which was pretty decent, or even

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.430
the controller-optimized PS3 and PS4 renditions
of Final Fantasy XIV - more often than not,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.620
you're left with a stripped-down interpretation
that feels like an affront to all you hold

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.750
dear.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.430
Civilization Revolution is a stripped-down
interpretation, surely... but I don't know

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.140
if it's that much of an "affront."

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.360
Maybe an "aside" or an "aback," but this PS3
version of the famously obscenely huge 4X

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.880
staple holds its own and can serve as a nice
primer, an introduction into one of the most

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.140
intense of gaming genres.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.710
I'd lay some plot on you, but really, you
craft the plot as you go, along the basic

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.850
lines of "Your civilization, led by (INSERT
GREAT LEADER HERE), builds from sticks and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.130
stones to world domination."

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.770
Just like its big brothers, that domination
can take a number of forms, from absolute

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.520
military victory to cultural ubiquity to being
the first people to reach Alpha Centauri.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.410
From that basic starting point, you have the
freedom to do those four Xs mentioned earlier:

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.530
Explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate,
at whatever pace you wish.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.959
That said, you'll also have competitors, other
great leaders displaced from their own geographic

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.570
bounds, trying to expand their grasp of this
hunk of randomly-generated landmass.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:02:00.890
It's the standard Civilization bit, really,
just... kinda altered for the console masses.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.100
You can't have super-precise mouse and keyboard
controls in this case, so you've gotta adapt

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
for the relatively clunky controller... and
that's where Civ Rev stumbles.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.930
You've got a thumbstick that moves your focus...
sometimes... and directional buttons that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.100
cycle through units in a given region or move
to the next region, where "next" is a constantly

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.100
ambiguous term.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.849
It might be in a different conflict entirely,
just aligned so closely to your vertical axis

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.010
that suddenly BAM.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.400
You're in Barcelona, instead of moving to
the next battalion of units stationed outside

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400
Minsk.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.989
Fortunately, while the controls are a bit
grindy, the graphics are by-and-large capable

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.300
of holding things together... in the main
game, at least.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.849
Other functions such as the Civilopedia, while
a useful resource for the history and edutainment

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:50.239
aspects of the game, sometimes have egregious
graphical mishaps, and this is actual footage

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.359
of how choppy things get when you finally
beat the game.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.359
Yeah.

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.180
Civ makes this PS3 grind like hell... but
you won't really notice it in the moment,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:09.469
because you'll be too intensely focused on
discovering the next best technology.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.620
The audio presentation isn't bad, and the
background music... well, you're going to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.440
forget all about it because you'll either
A) be too deep in diplomacy to hear anything

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.930
or B) have shut off the audio long ago because
the garbled vaguely-ethnically-flavored speech

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.620
of your quote unquote "trusted advisors" made
you want to rip out your hair.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.659
There's a number of things that make this
Revolution kinda weak as a Civilization title,

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.650
but regardless, it IS Civilization, and you're
probably not going to wrest yourself from

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.239
it until you've taken over the world.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.090
Just one more turn, man.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.980
Just one more turn... oh, and you've gotta
choose your next science to pursue, which

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.730
means you should reassign some workers in
Moscow for better efficiency, and...
