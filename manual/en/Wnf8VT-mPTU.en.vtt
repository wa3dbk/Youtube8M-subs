00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:03.560
Right now, I'm going to show you
how to create a newsprint

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.910
collage from your photograph.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.700
The first step is for you to
create a wide range of

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.220
photographs of your model.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.920
So carefully think about who
your model is and what

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.180
relationship you have
to your model.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.700
What do you want your
photographs to portray?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.955
Experiment with different
lighting

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:25.870
and angles and closeups.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.220
Pay close attention to your
background, because the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.660
background is especially
important.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.190
If you have any objects in
the background that are

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.360
unnecessary, those will take
away from your image.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.020
So you will see here
that I created--

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.700
this is one of the photographs
that I took, and this is the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.930
image that I'm going to use.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.720
This is in color, and you want
to either photograph your

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.730
images in black and white or
then transfer your images from

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.650
color into black and white.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.120
So this is my black and
white print out.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.870
So, when you're photographing
your model, it's not

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.360
necessarily important that you
capture their face, but you do

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.980
want to convey your model's
personality through your

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.130
photograph.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.040
So I'm going to be using this
image, and I'm going to trace

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.720
my image, and basically what
you want to do is attach

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.390
another sheet of paper
on top of your

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.160
photograph, and trace it.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.640
So one way to do it is place it
over a window, and you'll

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520
be able to see through
it, or you can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.870
also use tracing paper.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.730
So here's my tracing of the
original photograph, and now

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.570
I'm going to be looking through
different newspapers

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.890
and find a wide range of values
that I can incorporate.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.720
So your goal is to translate
all of these values within

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.220
your photograph into
this image.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.630
So you're looking at different
values and pulling them out,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.250
and laying them out on
your sheet of paper.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.520
Using thicker quality paper will
also be a good in this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.150
case, because it will
absorb your glue.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.780
You want to use small pieces,
but you can also alter them in

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.200
size from this size to
really tiny ones.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.970
You could also cut them
out by tearing them.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.480
It creates these very soft,
uneven edges, and it allows

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.140
you to blend the values
together much more

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.300
effectively.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.900
So what you can also do is find
values in advance and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.710
sort them into different piles,
and you can also store

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.970
them in an envelope
just to help you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.710
get yourself organized.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.880
Look at the lightest values, and
then see just how much of

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.480
a range you can achieve.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.790
So here are my lighter values,
and there's no really right

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.360
way to arrange them.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.430
I'm just layering them and
trying to translate what I'm

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.640
seeing in the photograph.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.330
As you can see, my friend in the
image has pastels smeared

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.080
on her arm, and they look
slightly different.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.790
They look more like bruises
in the black and white

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.360
photograph, but it's still
important to translate them.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.170
So I found texture
in the newspaper

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.506
that has that variation.

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:35.580
I believe it was an image of
popcorn or something, but it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.830
really matches that texture
and value, so I'm going to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.020
incorporate it in here.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.310
You can also use pieces with
text if they match a certain

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.130
texture in the image that
you're creating.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.630
If you see certain details or
wrinkles, you can actually cut

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.530
them out and use them
as actual shapes

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.260
rather than torn pieces.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.880
So having a nice variety of
shapes and edges will work

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.000
well in your artwork.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.950
This will begin forming and
coming together slowly, but

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.940
you just have to be patient,
and you have to continue

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.150
adding and subtracting until you
find all the right values.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.410
I would not recommend using
colors in your collage since

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.180
this is about recreating a
black and white image.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.550
I think the most challenging
part comes in creating the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.210
facial features.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.380
So for the facial features, you
could actually trace them

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.090
and cut them out, like the lips
and nose, and attach them

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.090
on their own.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.930
Or you can try to recreate
them using small bits.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.550
It's also important that you
recreate the background, and

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.810
for the background, you can use
much bigger shapes than

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.700
the ones you used in the body.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.580
Just remember variety is
important, and it can really

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.090
add to your image.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.480
You can create the background
using strips that are vertical

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.980
or horizontal, depending on what
you see in your image.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.230
And once you lay your entire
collage out, you can take some

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.920
glue, some white glue, and start
gluing these in place.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.870
Just remember that you're using
thicker paper, such as

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.540
drawing or watercolor paper,
so that it's able to absorb

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.150
some of the glue.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.555
And remember, you don't
need a lot.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:52.250
And areas that you're building
up, you can add the one piece,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.610
and then you can glue another
one over it, and so on.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.120
And over time, as you develop
it, your piece will develop a

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.280
tactile quality.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.870
It will look as though you can
sense and feel the surface in

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.700
front of you.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.080
See here, I'm building
up this collage.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.220
You might find it helpful to
glue some of the shapes, and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.330
then come back and start adding
more shapes as you go

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.060
along, rather than having
all of them laid

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.220
out in front of you.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.010
So try this out, and see how you
like it and what happens.
