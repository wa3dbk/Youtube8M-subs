00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:12.040
Meanwhile, I still seek justice.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.430
I still seek justice because the number of
subscribers continues to plummet.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.090
The number of subscribers to the Representative
Press channel continues to plummet.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.280
It is a mystery to me.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.170
I want to point out two things: This massive
dip is not he February 9th dip.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:54.019
This massive top in subscribers.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.390
This dip is from 2/10 and is ongoing.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:34.040
On 2/9, YouTube "deleted subscriptions from
all inactive YouTube accounts" in a "one-time

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:56.300
adjustment" which 
reduced the RepresentativePress subscriptions

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.810
total from 48,743 to 47,322.
