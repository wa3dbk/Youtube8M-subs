00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.330
The highly anticipated moment has arrived.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.650
Star Wars Disney Cars are here!!!

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:35.730
And now the uboxing adventure begings...Jabba
the Hut has encased Luke Lightning in plastic

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.570
packaging.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.579
He must be removed to save the rebellion.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.480
He is tough to get out of the package.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:04.780
The force is strong with this one.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:23.029
Yoda in package I see, release him I will.

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:29.359
Oh no, C-3PO Luigi and R2-D2 Guido have also
been trapped in Jabba The Hut's Plastic Packaging.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.560
Only with the force they may be removed.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.679
Master Yoda Fillmore it is too early in my
training to preform this task.

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:33.679
Trust in your feeling Luke Lightning.

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:34.679
Feel the Force FLOWING through you.

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:35.679
Oh no, not Princess Leia Sally.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:36.679
Sir, from my calculations, her chance of survival
is 3645 to 1.

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.679
Master Yoda-Fillmore, she is too big, I cannot
levitate her.

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.759
Much you still must learn Luke-Lightning.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.249
You ask for the impossible!!!

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:53.409
I don't believe it.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:05.560
That, young Luke-Lightning, is why you failed.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.070
Darth Mater,
not even the Dark Lord himself could keep

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.440
from the plastic packaging.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:31.790
Forward we move, leave him we will.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
A Storm tractor, we must not tip him.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.910
Breathing...

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.360
Darth Mater, how did you get out of the plastic
packaging.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:49.220
Such packaging is no match for the dark lord.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.110
You don't know the power of the dark side.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.110
Stand to the side, I must release my storm
tractor.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.110
Lightsaber.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.110
We will meet you rebel cars again.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.118
Thanks for watching and have a great day.
