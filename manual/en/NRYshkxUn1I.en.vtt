I believe the barrel-chested gentleman with the luxuriant mustache was first.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.340
Should've been faster, Sonic!

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.380
Okay, here we are, two Double Meh Burgers with extra pickles.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.240
I said NO pickles.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680
It'd be an honor to work for you without pay!

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.920
Mop the bathroom?!

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.620
Wow! Back at Meh Burger, I'd have to be a manager to do that!

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.600
I fear his enthusiasm for the most menial tasks causes us to appear inferior by comparison.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.420
He does more sucking up than my cousin Suzanne, and she's a vacuum!

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.620
But I've spent a year and a half in the fast food industry.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.600
I can't sit around indefinitely! What do you think I am, a Meh Burger?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.340
You stop that right now, young man!

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.060
Dave: Well, maybe you shouldn't have left the power supply in here, then.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.280
(beeping)

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.760
(device powers up)

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.020
I'd say it could only be some kind of doomsday device.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
And it's gonna destroy the world even bigger than that one!

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
If we increase the energy output of both devices and get them vibrating at opposite frequencies,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.380
then there's a small chance they'll cancel each other out.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.960
Yeah, just for a second, pretend I'm NOT a science guy.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.020
Oh, wait, this isn't the drive thru. What do you want?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.500
Drive up to the next window and come in.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.040
Sonic: Eggman!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.120
No, don't stop working; I'll make you lunch.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.140
Too slow? Ha, you forgot who you're talking to!

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.760
(blubbers)

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.820
They'll pay for this.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.420
Dave: I'll show you!

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.900
Well, I'll show you!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.020
I'll show him!

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.220
And it's gonna destroy the world even bigger than that one!

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.160
If you're okay with Eggman destroying the world bigger than you.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.000
Who puts an off switch on a doomsday device?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.800
What the what?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.720
What the what?!

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.460
Orbot: It's Cubot! He's been disassembled!
