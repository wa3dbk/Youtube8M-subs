1 O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
    his steadfast love endures for ever!

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.640
2 Let Israel say,
    ‘His steadfast love endures for ever.’

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:03.480
19 Open to me the gates of righteousness,
    that I may enter through them
    and give thanks to the Lord.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.080

    the righteous shall enter through it.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.200
21 I thank you that you have answered me
    and have become my salvation.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:32.640
1 O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
    his steadfast love endures for ever!

22 The stone that the builders rejected
    has become the chief cornerstone.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.080

    it is marvellous in our eyes.

24 This is the day that the Lord has made;
    let us rejoice and be glad in it.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.920
25 Save us, we beseech you, O Lord!
    O Lord, we beseech you, give us success!

27 The Lord is God,
    and he has given us light.
Bind the festal procession with branches,
    up to the horns of the altar.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:44.600
1 O give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
    his steadfast love endures for ever!

    you are my God, I will extol you.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:02.320
