Hey guys! How's it going? It is MyDifferentUserName here

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.860
and today I'm going to be showing you
one of the new carbines from

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.980
Battlefield 4.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.130
This is also known as the shortest
member of the AK-12 family

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.119
and it essentially is going to be
replacing the AKS-74U from

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.300
Battlefield 3.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.120
So here it is the AKU-12 Carbine.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.920
So basically this gun has similar traits
to the AKS but in the AK-12 format

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.170
and you know there's always arguments
going around "Is it a sub-machine gun?"

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.700
"Is it an assault rifle?"

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.250
Technically, it's labeled as a sub-machine
gun due to its small size

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.610
even though it fires the exact same
round as the AK-12 fairly similar to the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.289
AK-12 this weapon is

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.579
also ambidextrous meaning that you could
be left-handed and right-handed

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.860
and still successfully be able to use as
weapon and even while in combat this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.910
but it can be also

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.420
really useful just as a backup in case
of a sticky situation.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.200
The stock on the weapon can also be
folded up and even though it limits it's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.209
full-auto ability, even though, it is a
small weapon

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:23.729
it can also still be using all the
stock is folded which is perfect for CQB.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.270
The weapon is basically an AK-12, but has
a small handguard, a shorter barrel, a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.750
different muzzle brake and even

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.500
a lower front sight and also there is no
difference between this gun and the AK-12 besides

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.209
the fact of maybe acquiring targets from
a longer distance.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.130
So in conclusion, the AKU-12 happens to be
just like one of my favorite carbines

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.479
from the Battlefield 4 multiplayer and it is a
serious "kick-ass" weapon and now

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.479
we get to try it out!

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.090
Subscribe for more Battlefield 4
weapons and as always...

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.390
