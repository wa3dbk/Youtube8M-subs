Hi, I'm Bulletyme, dance choreographer here
in L.A., here on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.530
In this video clip I'll be showing you how
to do an advanced wave. You want to start

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:20.680
by lifting your right hand, bend your fingertips
down, and as you open your palm you lift the

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:30.490
elbow out, lift your rights elbow out. Let's
just do that much again. Fingertips go down,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.440
the difference between the advanced wave and
the basic wave is that the advanced wave pays

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.059
very close attention to specifics like keeping
the hand flexed the entire time and keeping

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.350
where it is in space. So the next step you
want to push your elbow into your body and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.219
lift your shoulder up and then carry that
over to the other side, but we'll get to that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.179
in a moment. So shake that on out a bit, let's
try the left side. Lift your left hand, curl

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:12.440
your fingers down, flat blade, elbow out,
push that up into your ear bring it down and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.070
wave it on out. That's waving with the left
side. Let's try to connect the two. Right

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.360
arm, bend and push, left arm comes up, notice
that this is the first picture, and then it

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:41.740
rolls on out and reverse it, fingertips, arm,
push, lift and up; fingertips, arm, push,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:54.340
lift, arm, fingertips. Fingertips, lift, push,
arm, flex, fingertips and there you have it

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.890
your advanced wave.
