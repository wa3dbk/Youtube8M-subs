00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.560
Hey guys.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.949
Guess what time it is?

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.600
It's green smoothie time and my best
friend, kale here, we're going to make a green

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600
smoothie.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
It's not really my
best friend.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800
It'd be kind of sad.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.800
Okay.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.010
So this green smoothie is going to have apple,
banana, pineapple,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.529
kale, coconut meat, ice, and coconut water.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.679
You got that?

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:21.679
Sweet.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.670
Apples
particularly are really good for the digestive

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.670
system.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269
The fiber in it
really helps reduce cholesterol and actually

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.159
really helps cleanse the
liver.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:33.270
So if you're wanting to cleanse the liver,
everyone needs to cleanse

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.270
the liver.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.410
The liver cleanses all the toxins out of our
body so cleansing

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
the liver is very important.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.930
Okay so with the apple I'm going to put half.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470
I've got like three different
types here.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.510
Pink Lady, a Gala apple, and a Fuji apple.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.190
So I'm going to
leave the seeds in and the stem.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.190
Everything goes in.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.190
Same, same with all
this.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
Look at this stem.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.190
I like this one.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.460
Look at that, how big it is.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.000
If
there's a little worm in there, get the worm

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.290
in there, more protein.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.290
And
this one too.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.290
Wow.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.290
Look at all those seeds.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.290
I don't know.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.290
Whatever.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm not
going to die.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.280
And throw it in like that.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.140
Sometimes I like to cut them up a little bit
smaller.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.999
Two bananas.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.999
Pineapple.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.179
Coconut meat.

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:22.509
Try not to get the eggshell
in.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.869
It'll suck.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.409
That's good enough.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.390
And some kale.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210
All right.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.210
Kale.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.689
So this green smoothie as you can see is probably
50/50.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.659
Okay 50 percent
fruits, 50 percent grains.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.569
That's what you want to do and as you go on
keep

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.310
putting in less, less fruit and more, more
grains.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.539
Coconut water and some
ice.

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.719
All right.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:10.530
And there we have it.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.340
That's our green smoothie.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:29.950
Apple, banana,
pineapple, coconut meat, coconut water.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.560
That's it.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.560
And kale.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.560
Hey guys.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.409
Today we're going to make a green smoothie
but it's going to have

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.409
avocado in it.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
Now avocado is one of my favorite snack foods
to have.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.040
It's
just full of all the good stuff, it keeps

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
you full for ages.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.930
You could
practically live off avocado as well.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.279
So we're going to start off with a
green smoothie... [ends]
