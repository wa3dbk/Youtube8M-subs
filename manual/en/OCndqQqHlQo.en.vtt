[BOe's Little Shop!!!]
[Episode 23: Umbrage of Bo-Dhi]

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.934
Hey, uh, BOe?

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.552
Do something to introduce me to that girl.

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:11.633
Come up with something.

00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:13.108
Fine.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.295
Walk up to her without getting spotted.

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:27.197
Asshole!

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:31.264
Nothing brings people together better than a shared problem.

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.781
Especially with sexual subtext.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:34.670
Yeah.

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:37.910
Hands back and nose in the corner!

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.060
A-and he was also saying something bad about hares!

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:41.752
Yeah...

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.411
Nose in the corner, I said! You're both punished!

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.661
Especially you, Boniface.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.170
Being an alien doesn't give you the right to manipulate humans.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.060
Oh, come on! Manipulating you people requires no super powers at all!

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:57.970
You just need an excuse to say something bad about hares!

00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.891
Yeah, of course, keep talking.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:01.047
Wanna bet?

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:02.126
W-w-what...?

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:07.046
Let's bet that I'll easily manipulate you people with no super powers whatsoever. Deal?

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:08.812
What will we bet?

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:09.834
Well, emm...

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.653
Ah! Remember that fancy shell you showed me?

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.613
Went for a valuable thing, didn't you, bastard?

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.307
If I lose, you'll have my Smilenator, all right?

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.842
Well, deal? Deal? Deal?

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:21.523
All right. I give you three months to prove it.

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:22.401
You're a witness, Slob!

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:28.083
Hey, what is he--What is he tinkering out there?

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:29.355
Making a site.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.577
Is that gonna be some sort of an organization?

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.410
Nah, more of a religion, I think.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.113
Let's hope our creaker won't mess things up. Again.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.212
You're saying bad things about hares again!

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:46.978
And ye shall know the name of the true God Bo-Dhi

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:49.776
who is omnipresent and omniscient!

00:01:50.232 --> 00:01:53.413
He be the basis of all that matters!

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:56.741
He be the string in the fabric of time!

00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:00.585
Everything is made of Bo-Dhi and everything comes to him!

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:03.628
Hey, look! A strap of Lapkin's bra is sticking out.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.825
Man, just look at that innocent mug!

00:02:08.377 --> 00:02:09.330
What is he saying, anyway?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.068
Eh, to hell with him. Usual mumbling.

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:15.845
Probably something bad about hares.

00:02:18.756 --> 00:02:19.502
Let's see...

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680
Well, the comments are generally positive.

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:26.070
Good... good articles... charity... appeals for peace, well-being...

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.834
The first neutraletarian reli-religious movement ever...

00:02:31.848 --> 00:02:34.618
Nothing bad about hares, by the way.

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:36.391
Oh, by the way, Lapkin?

00:02:36.486 --> 00:02:36.949
Yes?

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.711
Did you seduce anyone from Channel One?

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.107
Alright, lemme see...

00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.792
There are 11 secret members in the database,

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.499
along with 2 official ones: a soundman and a corrector.

00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:47.211
Eh, we don't freakin' need a corrector.

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:48.198
Nobody does.

00:02:48.527 --> 00:02:50.741
A soundy, however, does have some use.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.929
Oh, by the way, what's our situation in India, Munter?

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:54.614
Just fine.

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:57.585
Yesterday legislators lifted a ban against our organization.

00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:59.332
Ohh, congratulations!

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:00.359
Ratsh's doing, I assume?

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:00.747
Obviously.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.715
Man, is that Ratsh a cool dude! Raise him in status, will you?

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:07.377
Such a man will say nothing bad about hares.

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:11.318
[For the harmonious and cool life]
Damn, I've started seeing that BOeish propaganda way too often.

00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:12.579
[For the harmonious and cool life]
Honestly, it's getting on my nerves!

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:14.327
Why is everyone listening to him, anyway?

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:16.559
He didn't come up with anything.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.460
He just took all the pleasant things from existing religions,

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:22.505
while throwing away all the... all the unpleasant things.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:23.550
That's it.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.139
And he declared himself a sin!

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.261
A seer, I mean!

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:28.450
This is his only miscalculation.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.460
Hey, let's discuss something bad about hares. I love it.

00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:37.662
Representatives of main religions arrived at the presidents' meeting.

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:43.830
For the first time there was a representative of a new, but worldwide popular movement of Bo-Dhi.

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:52.742
In the name of the One and Almighty God Bo-Dhi who obliged me to declare this child Moris

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:56.320
the Never-Speaking-Of-Hares-Poorly.

00:03:56.641 --> 00:04:01.346
And also in the name of the entire world and stuff...

00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:08.618
For at the heart of all governments, all ideologies, is the seizure of power and foppery!

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:10.934
And foppery be a sin,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.656
for all people are equal under Bo-Dhi!

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:18.995
And let hedonists rejoice, for the meaning of life is in gaining healthy pleasure.

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:23.215
We need to stop it somehow. This religion has already dominated the entire world!

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.701
Most of the governments are his bitches, for god's sake!

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:31.574
So what? Now there's no war, no terrorism. Economy is recovering. Everything is regulated. Everyone's happy.

00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:34.418
I don't know, Show-Off. I feel like there's some sort of a trick behind.

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:36.817
Couldn't he solve everything without religion? Eh?

00:04:36.903 --> 00:04:37.527
No, he couldn't.

00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:39.249
Humans are herdish creatures.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.911
As for hares, I can only say bad things about them.

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:43.348
Especially now...

00:04:46.973 --> 00:04:47.676
Hey, you!

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:49.939
Hey, wake up, grand-freakin'-master!

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:51.029
Wipe your mug...

00:04:51.144 --> 00:04:53.602
Eh...? Ah...? What? What? What happened?

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:56.470
It's me, Show-Off. Descend from above, you asshole...!

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.234
Eh, showed up...

00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:02.071
Lemme get some damn sleep! I've got to bless a Botswanian community tomorrow, for God's sake!

00:05:02.241 --> 00:05:02.732
All day...

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.140
Hey, I wanted to say one thing... In short, I give up. Got it?

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.525
Halt this crap already. Fine, I lost... Whatever...

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:13.130
Ah-ha! Finally admitted defeated, didn't you?

00:05:13.308 --> 00:05:14.936
The shell is mine!

00:05:16.497 --> 00:05:18.384
HOORAAAAAAAY!

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:22.082
Hello! Listen to me, people!

00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:24.195
Hear me out, will you?

00:05:24.336 --> 00:05:26.646
I've got an important announcement for all of you!

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:29.179
In short, people, it was...

00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:31.546
I admit that it was all a joke.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.984
Got it?

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.267
In short, this entire religion was a joke.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.209
We just had a bet with the hare--I mean, with the grandmaster...

00:05:38.696 --> 00:05:40.644
regarding manipulation...

00:05:40.648 --> 00:05:42.925
Anyway, it doesn't matter! I've just given up.

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:45.661
To put it simple, that's it! All of you are free!

00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:50.807
I'm sorry if someone took it too seriously. That's not my problem. Goodbye, everyone.

00:05:54.255 --> 00:05:55.348
He was such a good hare...

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:56.585
Funny...

00:05:57.025 --> 00:05:57.651
Yeah...

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.027
Well, Show-Off was pretty good, too. Alive.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.246
Was saying bad things about hares sometimes, though.

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:04.185
Sure has a sin.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.415
Had, I mean.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.858
Hey there, goofs!

00:06:09.716 --> 00:06:11.150
We're alive, really!

00:06:11.314 --> 00:06:13.795
Having fun at Hawaii. So what?
