00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.300
The LEGO games are always better on consoles.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.040
That's one thing you can rely on.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860
Emma Watson always has a killer dress.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.270
That's another thing you can rely on.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.910
But this is, like...it's not changing what
you know, but it's certainly challenging it.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.980
LEGO The Hobbit is still better on consoles,
but...it's also gonna make you stop and think

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.370
about it, for a minute.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.010
Like, oh...Em wore a little jacket tonight.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.440
Still crushin' it...but not a dress.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:07.160
Changes everything, while changing nothing.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:23.770
Now, I played this on the 3DS...like, right
after playing the PS3 version.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.970
So I had the console version fresh in my mind
when I went into this one.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.330
And I can tell you...although the quality
gap is still there, it's nowhere near as wide

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.330
as it used to be.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.799
You can tell they've taken some serious strides
to close it.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590
And they've done a pretty good job.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.880
So much so that, if you're more of a handheld
person, I'd no problem recommending this one.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.530
Still not as good, but...also not as bad,
as handheld LEGO games have been.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
So obviously, LEGO The Hobbit is based on
the first two Hobbit movies.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.790
We've reviewed the console versions for both
the Xbox 360 and PS3, so check out those reviews

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.299
for more on the gameplay.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.759
Suffice to say, though...it's what you'd expect
from a LEGO game.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.640
It's the same combat, the same puzzles, the
same smashing and collecting...

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640
The same LEGO.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.950
In fact, I said in our PS3 review that...these
things are almost reaching Madden levels of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.330
sameness, from game to game.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.270
They're always good, but they're never much
different.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.090
Now, where there is a difference...is on handhelds.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.370
Again, playing this one right after the console
version...it really illustrated just how different

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.590
these games are.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.390
Where LEGO The Hobbit is this, grand adventure
on consoles...it's a smaller quest on handhelds.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.250
It's more about...individual achievements,
and speed runs, and replaying levels...

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.950
In fact, it's almost got a bit of an arcade
feel.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.230
The levels are a lot shorter, and each one's
designed to be played several times, to accomplish

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.970
all of the goals.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.819
And you know, to be honest...as much as I
like exploring Middle Earth, and the size

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.090
and scope of the console version?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.030
This game's pace...was actually a great change
of pace.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.590
It really comes down to preference, and what
you're in the mood for...but it's nice to

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.730
know each version offers something different.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.740
In fact, they're totally different, in terms
of feel and design.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.100
It's, just...the core gameplay.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.849
That's pretty much the same.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.540
One thing that's certainly not the same...is
the presentation.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.300
On consoles, this is kind of a gorgeous game.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.030
I mean, it's not technically stunning or anything...but
artistically, it's very pretty.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.030
On handhelds?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.310
Eh, not so much.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.560
The colors aren't as rich, the lighting's
not as good...I mean, it's not a bad looking

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.700
3DS game, but it pales in comparison to the
console version.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.360
And the same goes for stuff like sound, and
music.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.360
So again, it's really a matter of preference.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.709
If you're looking for big, beautiful worlds
and the freedom to explore, go with the console

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.709
version.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.540
For a more old-school approach, with more
linear levels and shorter sessions...the handheld

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.200
version's great for that.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.099
For a series of games that's notorious for
stagnating, and repeating itself...it's nice

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.459
to see the LEGO games starting to address
one of their biggest shortcomings.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.750
That being the quality gap that made their
handheld versions seem like afterthoughts.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.769
That's not the case with this one.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.010
Now, the game's still better on consoles,
but...

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.409
Much like a hobbit, the small one might surprise
you.

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.630
It's LEGO The Hobbit, for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.110
And check out our reviews of the Xbox 360
and PlayStation 3 versions for more.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.800
Seriously, guys...I had to play all three
of these.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.740
It's the least you could do.
