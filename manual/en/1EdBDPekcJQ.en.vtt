00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.790
Now let's try Vertical Figures on both hips
form up to down.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.610
Keeping the knees bent we're going to lift
the right heel off the floor, push away into

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.189
the right hip.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.100
Now we're going to slide it out, drop the
heel down, bring the hip down and contracted

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.189
back in towards the centre.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.630
Now we're going to switch our attention from
this side to the other side the body, lifting

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.339
the left hip up, pushing out, dropping the
heel down contracting back in.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:47.359
Lifting right, right heel comes up the floor,
pushing up, coming down, pulling back to centre,

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.760
lifting the left side out, heel down and in.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.819
Now you want to be careful, when you're pushing
out, make sure you're keeping the way on the

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:02.140
inside of the foot, you don't want to roll
the ankle at all, so you want to stay centred.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.830
So once again, you want to keep the chest
really havering up, chin up, and this movement

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.750
should not your upper body whatsoever.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:25.020
So let's try that with music.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:36.570
[music playing] Stepping right, stepping left.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:47.729
Let's try it a little bit faster.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.580
So you want to make sure your tail bones are
pointing down no matter what and your lower

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.590
are still engaged and there is no twisting
to this motion so it's actually happening

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.821
just from side to side there is no front or
back dimension to it, and the tail bone's

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:03.880
tucked down.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.420
Once again.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.700
For now, I will recommend keeping this out
of your chest hyper isolating but sometimes

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.180
you want to let your chest involved and let
it travel into your upper body.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.570
So that's how you're doing an up to down vertical
figure 8.
