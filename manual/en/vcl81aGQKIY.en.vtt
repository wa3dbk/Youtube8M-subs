00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.620
PowerPoint presentations are designed to be
shared electronically, but sometimes you need

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.140
to print them too.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.950
That's why it's important to understand the
basics of printing, and also the options that

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.970
are unique to PowerPoint.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.300
If you're familiar with PowerPoint 2007, it
might look like the Print Preview mode is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
missing.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.310
Not so.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.170
Just go to the Backstage view, and you'll
find everything has been combined under Print.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.860
To get started, you'll need to enter the number
of copies you want.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.170
Then select a printer if you're connected
to more than one.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.261
And here, if you're working with a long presentation
and you only want to print part of it, you

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:54.570
can enter a specific range of slides; otherwise
Print All (the default) is fine.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.020
Next is the Page Layout menu, which lets you
decide how your slides are going to be arranged

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.550
on the printed page.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.740
You can include everything from Full Page
Slides, to Notes, to just an Outline.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.979
You can even print handouts for yourself,
or fellow presenters, or members of the audience.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.579
I like how this one has space to write your
own notes or comments about the presentation.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.770
Now, one of the last things I'll do is switch
from Color to Grayscale to save on printer

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.770
ink.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.140
When you're ready, just click the Print button
at the top.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.179
Alternatively, you can save time using something
called the Quick Print command, which prints

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.130
your presentation using the default settings
and the default printer.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.729
You just need to add it to your Quick Access
Toolbar first.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.950
Click the small arrow here, and choose Quick
Print.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:02:06.999
Now you'll be able print your entire presentation
in a single click.
