hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.500
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. You know

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.390
during the festival time we all love to
make some kind of snacks and a couple of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.260
you have requested me to make Chekkalu that is another kind of rice

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.769
cracker that is specially made in Andhra

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.550
yeah during the festival times we make
it a lot. So to make this chekkalu,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.520
I've taken around you know one cup of
rice flour making this chekkalu used to be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.510
very tiresome

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.800
you know when I was a kid my mom used to soak rice and then make the powder of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.450
freshly soaked rice and then make these
chekkalu. But it is very easy you don't

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.750
have to go through that kind of
procedure i'll show you a very simple

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.590
procedure where you can just make it
with dry rice flour, add a pinch of salt. In

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.550
the ding chik I put little bit of curry leaves , little bit of ginger and green

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.329
chilies

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.140
what you do is make into a fine paste
you can even put it in a blender and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.369
make a fine paste

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.880
since i'm making such a small quantity
i'm making it in my ding chik ding chik

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030
ok this one and mix it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.070
I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.940
have soaked some channa dal in the water here is a little bit of channa dal just put some

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.780
channa dal

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.950
ok if you want to add more of channa dal
you can add; to this add 1

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.540
tablespoon of butter and just mix it up
because there is some amount of moisture

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.070
in the butter in the green chillies and
curry leaves paste we added and even

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.630
little bit on channa dal.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.850
so you have to add very little water do
not put a lot of water just a few drops

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.500
and that's it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.240
you know see this should be more than
enough. Lot of people do a mistake

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
of adding a lot of water and that is
what is the problem it should be just

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.030
barely enough

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.610
it has to be very tight dough.. ok... maybe
a few more drops of water

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.560
ok

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.730
and just to need the dough ok now let me
make a small ball out of this okay and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.549
if i press the edges should crack;  you know that is when the dough is good see if

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.930
edges don't crack

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.209
that means you added too much water into this mixture and one more thing is do

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.860
not keep this dough for long

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.180
you know when you make the dough make it in small batches and make it as soon as

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.110
possible and finish the dough if you keep
this dough for a long time

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.640
these chekkalu will get lot of color but
they will not get cooked and they can

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.040
remain soft; now the dough ready

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.880
just put it on a polythene sheet like
this and then cover it and then press it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.150
ok and see how all the edges have cracked see that is when the dough is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.140
perfect

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.410
so put it in the oil

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.560
one more time see if your dough

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.280
good if you just break it should break in
it should break open like this

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.079
you know it's kind of powdering it is not
soft or it's not like chapati dough

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.359
there is;  because we added nice butter and make it into a shortcrust it'll break

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.199
easily

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.250
and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.030
as less amount of water that you added
into the dough will make excellent

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.270
chekkalu,  so just put it under the  polythene cover

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.370
just press it ok you can make it a
little bit thin you can make it a little

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.120
bit thick

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.350
the way you want and every time you will
get a perfect chekkalu if there is a lot

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.640
of water in the dough

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.290
even this chekkalu can puff up and they break open that is not good at all

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.060
sometimes people try to boil a little
water add rice flour to it and add these

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.959
ingredients

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.560
you don't have to do all that because
that will never give you a good chekkalu

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.489
and one important point is not ever fry
in hot oil

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.580
always use little low flame to fry your
chekkalu

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.329
ok when you see your channa dal nicely
colored little bit

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:31.110
that's good enough remove them off and
you can try this chekkalu huh hmm huh

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.360
so dear friends i hope you enjoyed to
learn how to make this Chekkalu along with

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.010
