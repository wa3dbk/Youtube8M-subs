00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.170
Okay, we're gonna do little maintenance
on a VW Rabbit blower motor.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.500
To get at the blower motor we have to
remove this piece a sound deadening

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.010
foam by

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.510
removing these two plastic screws by
hand.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.300
Alright, remove the blower motor

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.750
from the wiring harness.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.740
To remove the blower motor itself we're just gonna gently pull on this tab and twist

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.260
counterclockwise.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.480
It'll fall right out.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.300
So, chances are the reason you're doing this maintenance is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.430
your blower motor is making some noise or not working properly

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.170
so once you get it removed give it a few
spins take note how much resistance

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.540
there is there.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.180
The blower motor housing is held on by
three rubber tabs. You're just gonna use a

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.350
standard screwdriver to press in those
tabs,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.559
pull up gently on that housing, and repeat for the rest of the tabs

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.979
until the housing can be removed.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.720
So in my case there was a significant
amount of resistance when I spin this

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.640
blower motor.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.780
VW released Technical Service Bulletin
in February 2011 basically saying that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.940
snow can get inside the system cause
corrosion. That's what you see here.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.990
These bearings just get all gacked up to
the point where the blower motor just

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.580
doesn't function properly.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.300
So here I am just using carb cleaner to
clean out the motor. I'll give the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.640
blower motor a few twists.  I can
already feel it freeing up.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.640
I'll follow up with some lube.  I've got some wd-40 that'll go on here in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.350
a second.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.259
And you don't want your car to smell
like carb cleaner wd-40 so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.439
use a shop vac or a blower to get that
thing nice and aired out before you

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.549
reinstall it.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.620
To make the blower motor housing
reinstall easier I'm just puttin' a little

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.570
dab of dish soap on each the three
rubber tabs.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.760
And again use a standard screwdriver...this time in

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.800
reverse...Just sorta pull up on each rubber tab until it clicks into place.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.680
So this blower motor is

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.860
spinning significantly more freely now,
but I'm not done.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.180
You guys can repeat this process as
may times as you want with the whole

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.840
cleaning-lubing-airing out-clean

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.640
lube-air out, untill you get it moving as
freely as...as you're comfortable with

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.459
Reinstall the blower motor in reverse
order.

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.220
Now, I speed up the film here, so it looks
easy, but guys take your time. Don't force

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.470
it. You have to sort of

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.170
shimmy it around a bit 'till it finds its
way in and you don't wanna apply too much pressure

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.970
lest you break the blower motor.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.700
Reattach the wiring harness.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.120
Reinstall the sound deadening panel by

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.250
hand tightening the fasteners, and give
your refurbished motor a test.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.600
And guys, one of the most common side
effects of having one of these gummed up

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.310
blower motors

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.400
is that your blower motor resistor will
fail.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.050
If that's the case where you have just your
high-speed working

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.209
be sure to check out my other video that
shows you how to

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.160
repair that resistor for two dollars.
