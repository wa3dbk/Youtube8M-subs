Hello, my name is Mihaly Fabsk, and we are
here on behalf of Expert Village. We are talking

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.420
about white whines -- how to serve, how to
enjoy, the white whine. First of all, if you

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.710
have white wines you need a white wine glass.
Actually, this is a nice white wine glass.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.939
Usually, the big difference between the white
wine glass and the red wine glass is the form

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.769
and also the white wine glass is smaller than
the red wine glass. And the serving temperature

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:42.960
is also important. We have to serve the white
wine around eight to twelve Celsius degree.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:01:12.220
If you have a red wine, it depends on the
style, the grape variety, the wine-making

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:26.270
techniques; you have to serve around 15 and
19 Celsius degrees. So, the red whine needs

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.030
a little bit higher temperature -- needs a
little bit bigger wine glass, and also some

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.920
red wines, and white wines as well, need more
oxygen. So, for example, if you have an old,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:50.240
full-bodied, slightly tonic red wine, the
best way to open the bottle -- if you use

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:07.630
the curve -- so, decanting the wine is the
best way, so the decantation, it helps you

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:18.870
to remove the sediment, and also the wine
can get fresher and the wine will be more

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.610
fruity, more rich, and better quality, when
you have it.
