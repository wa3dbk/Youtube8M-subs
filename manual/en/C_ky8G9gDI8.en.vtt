Narrator: What is the universe made of?  The vast majority of it consists of the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.210
wispy cosmic lightweights hydrogen and helium.  Everything

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.220
else on the periodic table contributes only a small fraction of the whole.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.250
Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are forged in stars, and during

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.260
their explosive deaths as supernovas.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.350
Type 1a supernovas are nature's most productive foundries.  An old

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.380
white dwarf star pulls gas off its giant neighbor.  The dwarf gains

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.380
mass until it becomes unstable and blows itself to bits.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.560
The explosion creates vast amounts of heavy elements and blasts them into space.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.600
Suzaku is an orbiting X-ray observatory, operated jointly by NASA

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800
and the Japanese Space Agency.  And it recently spotted the metals

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.860
chromium and manganese in intergalactic space for the first time.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.860
It's the largest known concentration of rare metals in the universe.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.890
Suzaku was looking at X-rays shining from the core region of the

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.910
Perseus galaxy cluster and detected the metals in hot, thin intergalactic gas.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.970
The gas is so thin it's close to a vacuum, but it fills a volume

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.160
of space in the cluster about 1.4 million light years across.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.170
Music

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.190
Supernovas forged the metals and blasted them out of the galaxies, but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.240
a single stellar explosion wasn't powerful enough to get the job done.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.260
That requires periods of higher than normal star birth and death.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.310
These so-called starbursts stirred up vast outflows of matter called

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.340
superwinds.  Heavy elements forged by supernovas rode the superwinds

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340
to intergalactic space.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.410
A single supernova can produce thousands of times Earth's mass in chromium.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.450
The Suzaku astronomers estimate that it took some three billion

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.480
supernovas to forge the treasure trove they found in the Perseus Cluster.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.520
The total reservoir of heavy metal discovered by Suzaku

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.550
is even more staggering.  The Perseus core region

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.590
holds 30 millions times the Sun's mass in chromium.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.600
About 10 trillion times the mass of Earth.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.660
Suzaku's chemical census of the universe is just beginning, but it's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.690
already revealed just how rare and precious some corners of the cosmos are.
