00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.839
We've taken a chain link fence down,

00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.059
and we are going to put a wooden fence in it's place.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.720
So, here's Roland with the magic post.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.660
There we go. We just make up a post out of one by six,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.800
cut down to three and a half and a inch and three quarters,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
and then we stick it over top of the steel post and then it never rots.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.180
Or if it does, it doesn't rot in the ground,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.170
just rots a little bit on the face of things,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.310
but we're going to lift it up a little bit, so it doesn't rot.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:51.320
So, that's how to make
a chain link fence and turn it into a wooden fence,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.180
without reposting everything. What
do you think Roland? It's nice.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.800
Make a fence from a post. A fence from a post. Ha ha ha.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.380
So, this is about the halfway point on the fence.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.700
And what I'm going to show you is how I fastened this.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.880
What I do is set one board at each end, and I tack that in,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.320
and level it in at the bottom. And this end too.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.880
You'll see the height difference here,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.820
so then after I've got one board set at each end,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.540
this runs downhill a bit, so that's why the height difference,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.340
then I level in the top board, with a spirit level,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.500
and I bring all the rest up, so that
they have that three quarter inch gap,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.320
and I can set my lattice into that.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.680
Now, this is a very good fence to build

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.300
because you can stay with the bottom grade pretty easily,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.740
and still stay level on the top.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.940
Not like those kind of fences that are just made with sections.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.820
It can stay level on the top, look nice and neat,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.160
and you can still have your bottom closed

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.520
so that, you know, animals can't go under it, blah blah. That sort of thing.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.540
So, you'll see I have these just sitting in here spacing,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.420
and when I'm done with this
section, I'll put one section in each of these.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.840
I'll show you that in a bit.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.540
So, I'll show you how I set these posts.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.740
The post is, I put these bottom pieces in first,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.180
like you'll see here, just to spread it,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.980
and then I attach one post to each end here.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.060
This is a high end, and the bottom sort of slopes over this way.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.540
So, I attach one at each end, one post,
or one picket,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.080
and then I take the level, and I make the spreader across the top of this,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.540
which is just a one by six cedar,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.140
and I set if for three quarters at that end,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680
because I have a lattice that I want to sit in there,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.860
and at this end, I just go level and whatever it ends up to be, that's fine,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.620
because I have lots of play in that.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.420
And when I put my pickets on, then I carry them down

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.360
at three quarters and then that end one just drops off,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.220
and it's whatever it wants to be.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.540
That's just an interesting way of building that fence

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.980
so that the tops all look nicely stepped up in a proper level fashion,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.660
and the bottoms
close the gap.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.160
It doesn't matter where that bottom one ends up,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
because it's right at grade level,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.820
and you want it to stop the little animals or plants from creeping under.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.460
So, it doesn't have to be level in this design.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.740
Then afterwards, of course, I'll put my lattice in,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.020
and I'll put another facing piece on the front.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.280
And I'll show you that.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.920
So, here's the finished fence.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.220
We put these little tiny caps on here that hold the,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.300
they help to hold the post together I guess, a little bit,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.620
because they drop down over the top a bit.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.680
That's the fence. Very nice.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.140
