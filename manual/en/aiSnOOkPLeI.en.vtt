00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.880
Hello, I'm Ernesto. I'm from Spain.
I'm 25 years old.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.270
Hello, I'm Isabella.
I'm 23 years old.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.250
I like that
it's very peaceful city.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.680
It's not like a big city like New York but
also you can find a lot of things to do.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.040
I like Portland because it's not
boring but it's also not too busy.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.370
The people in Portland
are very, very kind.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.780
That's the first thing that
I recognized when I got here.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.010
The teachers at Kaplan
International Portland are high quality,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.700
the highest quality in the city
we're ranked one of the top centers

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.440
in the whole country.
There's a lot of interaction

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.830
with the teachers and the students
and students with each other.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.690
The percentage of speaking time
at all Kaplan centers

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.840
is 80 percent student
and 20 percent teachers.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.370
The students are the ones
who are doing most of the talking.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.300
In terms of housing and accommodation,
students have a couple of options.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.520
One is their own apartment.
Their apartments come furnished with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.730
internet and television and it's within
a 10-minute walk from Kaplan.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.090
The other option is a host family.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.040
My host family is very nice.
They are very kind with me.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.260
It's the best way to learn English
because you are American family

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.320
and I have a nice time with them.
If you want to eat around here in the school,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.380
you have a lot of places
just two steps from here.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.190
There are little trailers and they are
different from different countries.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.230
You can eat here Mexican food,
Thai food, Greek food.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.430
My favorite food it's Mexican
because it's very spicy.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.030
Here in Portland it's not only beautiful
the city, also the surroundings.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.170
One of the most beautiful things that
I admire from Portland

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.180
are the Multnomah Falls.
You can also go to Mount Hood.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.830
If you come here in the winter,
you can go skiing there.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.870
Here there are lot of outside activities.
We can do paddle boarding.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.600
You are with a surf board. It's very fun
because it's quite difficult to stand up.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.390
I like kayaking.
Kayaking is great fun.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.360
It's good to be on the water but you have
to be careful that you don't capsize.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.330
At Kaplan we also offer social
activities like happy hour

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.520
where you can go hang out
and get to know the other students.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.050
We enjoy a lot with Kaplan
when we go to happy hour with them.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.050
We go all the class. It's very nice
to spend the time with that group.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.250
I think my English is improving.
You learn a lot.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.200
You also may have new experiences
as you get to know new people

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.680
from different countries.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.170
I'm happy that I've come to Portland.
I like it!
