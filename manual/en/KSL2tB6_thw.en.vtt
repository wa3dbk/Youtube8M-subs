00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.135
You know I'm an honest man
in honest business.

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:24.172
Organic business is all about trust.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:29.154
We trust that as we sow, mother
earth gives us something back.

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:33.242
That's what real love is.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:36.703
10 hours earlier...

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:45.314
Are you burning our accounts?
 Yeah.

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:50.576
Guess we didn't get the EU grant?
 No.

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:55.610
Well, 50 percent for me.
 Fine.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.457
Are you coming to the recreation
day?  Why not.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.440
Good.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.219
Were you going to tell them this
company is bankrupt in 3 months?

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.076
We're not bankrupt. With these
debts one has to think up something.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.425
Accounts are like a ticking
time bomb...  Nonsense.

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:24.511
Open your top button and throw the
first one. Perttu...

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:28.721
You're a great accountant.
Stay that way.

00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.167
Our Perttu had an unfortunate
accident.

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:58.516
Great accountant, clumsy person.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.514
The weekend seminar didn't
work out for Perttu.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.641
But let's move on.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:09.343
This seminar is
titled Vitality from Nature.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.794
Perttu has got the attention
he deserves.

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:16.101
Let's have fun. Should we
play mÃ¶lkky?

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:21.135
More fallen ones! Well done!

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:26.400
Get the camera from the car and
take a picture of me playing.

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:32.496
There we go! 14!
Who's keeping score?

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:37.007
Aini, would you make your
delicious carrots...

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:13.071
You saw nothing.
 But I saw something.

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.366
What?  A trunk full of company
cash.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:20.564
What did you really see?
 A bathroom renovation.

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:24.139
That's all?
 I'd like to travel.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.398
In Europe?  I'd like see the world.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.051
With the wife.

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:35.360
And the motherinlaw.
 Oh, come on.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.003
Case closed, right?

00:03:38.298 --> 00:03:41.350
And half of the trunk contents.

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:53.781
Perttu had the heart for organic.

00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:59.036
He said glyphosates
would take away betacarotene

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.276
which is the precursor of
vitamin A.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:06.368
It's important to vegans!
And to the turnip pigs.

00:04:10.804 --> 00:04:18.960
Hey, don't worry. Come here.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.839
Who is the bosses little turnip pig?

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:29.159
Who is?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.128
oink, oink.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.187
Betacarotene.

00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:51.961
Organic business is all about trust.

00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:54.572
That's what real love is.

00:04:55.911 --> 00:05:01.208
We have a calling for this work.
We want to do what's right.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.764
Perttu also believed in this.

00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:09.217
Let's take a moment to honour
Perttu.

00:05:21.538 --> 00:05:23.790
Sorry.

00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:27.659
Yeah? No, you're not interrupting.

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:30.079
Just having a quiet moment.

00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:34.335
What now?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.103
No! We got the EU grant!

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.269
And we should deliver the accounts?

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.778
And the petty cash deposit?

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.314
And the accountant should come
over to sign the papers?

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.356
Great.

00:05:57.983 --> 00:06:00.032
Goodbye.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.271
We made it.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.121
I'm only doing my duty. Who would
make up something like this?

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:28.798
It's my duty to inform the
authorities.

00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:32.744
I have evidence of
employee Aini Viherpeippo

00:06:32.744 --> 00:06:35.086
being guilty of accounting
fraud and treachery.

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:41.397
It's sad, not knowing who
you can trust in this world.
