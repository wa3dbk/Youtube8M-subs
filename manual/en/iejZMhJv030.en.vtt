When I come in the morning, it usually takes me a while circling.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:26.259
Yeah, cleaning up a little bit and doing some thing,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.823
slowly nestling to the point where I can actually remember where I am in a painting,

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:40.038
or even realize a new point of entry, so that I can get back into the making of the picture.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.625
Sometimes it can take days to find, to know what to do next.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.227
But the last thing to that, spray it again, but with a little matte media so it doesn't bleed.

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.977
But luckily with the number of paintings happening, I can kind of move between one and another.

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:09.419
But the work, to make the work, it's being in here everyday.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:19.576
And some days, you'll have a great great day and work for the entire day, and make headway,

00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:24.556
and have realizations and leave in the best place because you had this intense engagement.

00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:37.256
Then other days, I just can't seem to find that connection. I think, that's part of the work, just being in here,

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:41.574
just looking at the work for a long time, and really realizing the painting.

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:54.936
