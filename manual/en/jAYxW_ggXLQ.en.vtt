00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000
After Istanbul, everything's changed.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.500
I don't trust them

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.700
What the hell is this?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
General! I need to talk to you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500
Be short Lieutenant, they're coming.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
The mission was a hoax Sir!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
The Americans used us since the beginning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The CIA was just looking for a manuscript

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
I know! But, they accused you

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
for the homicides, theft of documents

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.500
I am innocent!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
They stitched me up

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.500
I trust you Lieutenant! But now, you're alone

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.200
Ladies and Gentlemen! Professor Nicholas Beck!

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.500
A 1887 manuscript contains the mathematical formula

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We're talking about the biggest mathematics mystery:

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.500
The Riemann's Theory.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.000
That would brake the entire global financial system down

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.700
By the way, the book that could reveal his demonstration is already lost forever.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.500
In just one night.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.000
It could force RSA: The most secure code in the world.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
Now the secret is revealed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Yes Sir?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
What if that manuscript would really exists!?

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Whoever own it, would have the access key to all worldwide banks

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.000
If what he says is true, we would be the most wanted men on Earth

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Secret Services, CIA, NSA: They're all compromised!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.500
Why did you involve us?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
Written and performed by Alessandro Carnevale.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm afraid you don't understand the real interests linked to Riemann.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The debut movie by Claudio Pagnacco.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
I'll drag you all with me!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Lieutenant!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I keep asking myself what did you really understand about this story!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Musics by Alessandro Gargiulo.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500
It will be the biggest manhunt of history

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.000
What is the price of truth?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.800
Lieutenant!

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500
This is the story

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.000
That Secret Services tried to hide forever.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.000
We can still get out of this

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800
Help us

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.000
When we'll get rid of him, there won't be anymore obstacles.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.500
To realize

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.800
He's the only one who knows how it's really gone.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.000
Our movie.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.500
You must trust me!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.500
That's it:

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
He can't do it by himself.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.800
His conservation principle, his last, lowest survival instinct,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.500
will transform itself in a catastrophe!
