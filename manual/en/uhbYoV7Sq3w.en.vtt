00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.440
R: So, we are here at yakiniku!

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.720
R: And we're being really difficult because

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.940
we're here at 2pm, there's no one here,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.615
they had to turn on the lights for us...

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.234
R: This is the normal price with drinks.

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:15.364
R: But we chose not to get drinks so it's "just" going to cost us $28.00.

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:17.995
R: We can order for the next hour and a half, and then

00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:20.236
we have to finish eating within two hours.

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.915
R: This one is tabehoudai (all-you-can-eat).

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:26.900
R: I like this one because it has a lot of different options for vegetables,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.955
different things... like you can get soup or rice.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440
R: A lot of people get rice but we're not very Japanese,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.957
so we're just pretty much getting meat and some vegetables.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.460
R: And then the really good ones are beef and pork.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.034
R: And since I don't really know the differences for all of these,

00:00:41.034 --> 00:00:44.656
I just asked for the recommended ones. So we'll see what we get here!

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.320
R: She brought out all of this.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600
S: This is great food.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.520
R: We can have as much of it as we want for the next two hours.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.460
S: We're going to get so fat.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.100
R: I know!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.835
R: So, it's raw meat that we cook ourselves

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.180
and it's always reeeeeally soft!

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.940
R: So here's a lot of beef and then some pork.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.440
R: Oh my god, that looks amazing!

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730
S: It's sizzling.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.320
R: Omg...

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.320
R: It's so soft my chopstick like melted through it.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.360
R: It got stuck.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.174
R: I want to get a video of me poking this so you can see how soft it is.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.340
R: This is absurd!

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.796
S: Melts in your mouth.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.980
R: The thing that makes Japanese yakiniku so good are the sauces they have.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.360
R: The sauces are delicious!

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.080
R: I'm going to go for the sweet ones. I always like the sweet.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.020
S: I'm going to go spicy.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.820
R: I'll do both.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.220
R: The only thing you have to be careful about is that some of these places

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.994
if you're doing the all you can eat, the tabehoudai, then

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:44.834
if you don't eat all of something, they charge you extra for it.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.580
R: Oh my god.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.400
R: Ommaghhrdd.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.675
R: It's like melting!

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:53.394
S: It's that good?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.620
R: How's yours?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.180
S: Delicious.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.000
S: I'm in heaven right now. I'm telling you I'm going to be getting so fat.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.329
R: Since we just asked for recommendations, we don't really know which one's which.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.020
R: Shane's testing them out one by one with no sauce

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.340
to figure out which one's the best.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:14.143
R: This is his look of concentration.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.504
S: It's between these two.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.400
R: These two.

00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:22.394
S: These are the juicy fat ones that are delicious.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.440
R: The ones that melt.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.140
S: Yeah.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.700
R: Okay.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.300
S: This one melts, too, but I think this one tastes better.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.860
R: Okay.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.180
R: But we should get this one again.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.874
R: Okay. All right, got it.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.940
R: These two right here, plus this miso pork.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.980
S: It's so good.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.560
R: Omg it was so good.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.360
R: Being the American pigs that we are, we've eaten almost everything so far.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.040
R: I'm on break.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.800
S: I'm still going!

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.660
R: I can't eat anymore.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.360
R: We are so full!

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.640
S: So full of meat.
