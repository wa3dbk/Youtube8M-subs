Marc Luber: Hey everyone ñ Marc Luber here
from Careers Out There - you can find me at

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.890
Careers Out There dot com.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.519
I recently interviewed Kim McAllister ñ sheís
an emergency room nurse in Northern California

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.469
and a 30 year veteran of the nursing profession!

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.010
You can find her at Emergiblog.com where she
talks about the life and times of being an

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.010
ER nurse.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.010
I asked Kim to tell us what itís like to
be an ER nurse.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.010
Hereís a look at how it went!

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.910
Kim, tell us about being an ER nurse ñ specifically
an ER nurse.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.429
Whatís a typical day for an ER nurse?

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.110
Kim McAllister: A typical day in the ER is
that there is no typical day in the ER!

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.370
Every day is different and you really canít
ñ I always say you canít appreciate a nice,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.990
quiet day in the ER until itís over because
you never know what youíre gonna get.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.371
But a usual day when you come in is you basically
dive right in.

00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:52.540
Thereís no easy segue in to the shift.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.271
When you come in, you walk right out into
the department, into the melee thatís in

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:05.509
progress and you get your report sort of on
the fly from the nurse who youíre relieving

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.670
and you just basically dive right in!

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.390
You have an assignment basically at ñ in
California now with the nurse-patient ratios,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.220
thatís about 3 to 4 patients, depending on
the assignment.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.440
You go get report from the nurse who youíre
relieving and then I immediately go right

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.500
in and say ìhiî to every one of those patients
just to eyeball them, whatís going on, and

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.410
just get an idea of where theyíre at immediately.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.030
And it sounds very simple, but for the next
8 hours, I basically am taking care of those

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.600
patients, discharging and then moving.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.200
And the whole idea of ER is patient flow.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.780
So you move the patients, you get them in,
you take care of them as efficiently and as

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.600
quickly as possible ñ now that doesnít mean
rushing ñ that just means making sure that

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.119
the labs are done efficiently, that if theyíre
being admitted that they get up to their room

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.000
as soon as possible.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.719
Itís much more comfortable for them to be
up in a regular room than sitting down on

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.230
that ER gurney for very long.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.680
Discharging them as soon as possible so they
can get out and get moving and the next patient

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.329
can come in.

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.430
So basically youíre doing that for 8 hours.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
Of course in the middle of all that, youíve
got the patients who are going to have cardiac

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.799
arrest, emergent situations, have patients
that come in with an emergency that need to

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.719
be seen right away and bump the patients that
have been in the waiting room, so you never

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.719
know.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.319
Luber: So are you the one deciding ? If someoneís
coming in, are you looking at them and saying

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.069
ìyouíre worse off than this guy over here
ñ youíre coming to the front of the line.î

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.069
Is it kind of like that?

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.459
Kim McAllister: The triage nurse will do that.

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.459
Luber: OK.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.470
Kim McAllister: And if the triage nurse says
ìyouíre coming to the front of the lineî

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.280
and Iíve got the empty bed, Iím where that
patient is gonna go.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.480
And once that patient gets to my room, Iím
responsible for doing a full physical assessment

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.159
on that patient, hooking them up to the cardiac
monitors so I can see their heart tracing,

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.200
getting a full set of vital signs.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.400
If theyíre a critical patient or in a lot
of pain, Iím responsible for getting in an

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.689
IV so they can get pain medication.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.989
I draw blood from that, I make sure the proper
tests are ordered, the blood gets t the lab,

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.950
Iím responsible for monitoring those results
and making sure the physician sees the critical

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.269
results, I monitor any IV fluids that are
ordered on that patient, I monitor ñ this

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.400
is really important ñ the patientís pain
level.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.019
What it is when they come in, what it is within
a half an hour to an hour after I give pain

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.699
medicine, I monitor their visitors, their
family, how theyíre reacting to the patient

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:57.449
and how the patientís reacting to themÖAnd
what I basically look for is itís all about

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.309
the patient and how theyíre responding.

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:06.409
How theyíre responding to the treatments
and how they respond to the eventual diagnosis.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.680
So Iím not only dealing with the patient,
Iím also dealing with the family, Iím dealing

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.440
with all the ancillary departments: the physicians,
the pharmacists, the radiology department,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.699
the housekeepers, itís a healthcare team.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.930
And the nurse is basically the backbone of
that team.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.080
Luber: Now youíre not in a county hospital,
right?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.900
Youíre not dealing with gunshots and gangs
and violence and all the crazy stuff, right?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900
Kim McAllister: No.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.510
If we get any gunshots itís rare.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:40.409
In my facility theyíll be like walk-ins,
so weíre not part of the knife and gun club

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.449
where I work.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:49.389
Iíve mostly stayed in moderate sized community
hospitals, not county, trauma centers or anything

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.389
like that.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.629
So the big action takes place there.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.230
