00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.320
CHRIS: You see, I'm looking
for a sock that looks just

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.900
like this one.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.880
ABBY CADABBY: Oh, what a
pretty striped sock.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.410
CHRIS: Yes, it's very
nice, Abby.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.030
But it's no good to me
without its match.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.590
See, I need it to
be in a pair.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.340
ABBY CADABBY: Yeah, I know,
because you have one, two

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.360
feet, right?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.454
CHRIS: Yes, exactly.

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:23.610
ABBY CADABBY: Well, you are in
luck, Chris, because that is

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.029
the trick I want to show
you, my new two trick.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.520
CHRIS: Oh?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.484
ABBY CADABBY: Yeah, I learned
how to turn one

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:32.939
thing into two things.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.060
CHRIS: Really?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.930
You think you can do that
for my sock over here?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.350
ABBY CADABBY: Of course I can.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.318
Watch this.

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:41.286
Ahem.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:46.610
Oogle boogle binky boo, turn
Chris's one sock into two.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.550
[ZAP]

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.310
SOCK: Ugh.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.500
Oh.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.060
Yo.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.900
ABBY CADABBY: [SQUEAL]

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.060
I did it I did it.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.130
I did it.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.830
SOCK: Groovy laundry mat.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.475
Any single socks around,
everybody?

00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:57.830
[GASP]

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.680
Well, hey there you lovely
striped thing.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.510
Want to go for a spin
in the dryer?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.069
Huh.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.650
Quiet, isn't she?

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.240
ABBY CADABBY: See, I told
you I can do it.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.000
Boy, I can't wait to show
Elmo my new trick.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.940
Bye, Chris.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.880
CHRIS: Abby?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.200
Abby, wait a minute.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.681
ABBY CADABBY: What?

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:16.643
What's wrong?

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:20.350
You got two socks,
see-- one, two.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.926
CHRIS: That's true, but they're
not exactly a pair.

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:25.440
You see, they don't match.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.140
SOCK: What do you mean?

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.460
I think we go good together.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520
CHRIS: I'm not saying you
two can't be friends.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.130
I'm just saying I need a pair
of socks that match.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.760
You see, this is
a striped sock.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.580
You have polka dots.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.510
SOCK: Purple polka dots,
if you please.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.100
CHRIS: OK.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.760
And you talk.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.290
SOCK: Oh, by the way, did you
know that polka dots are also

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.590
called circles.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.320
There you are there.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.733
You like my circles, huh?

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.580
Hey lady, what do you think?

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.479
Circles and stripes go great
together, right?

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.440
LADY: Did that sock
just talk to me?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.510
Whoa, I have definitely
been here too long--

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.174
talking socks.

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:08.030
SOCK: [GASP]

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.219
Will you look at that?

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.250
It's a sock swimming pool.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.095
I am going to take a dip.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:17.995
Gangway.

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:22.395
[BOING]

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:23.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.512
CHRIS: Yeah, another thing--

00:02:24.512 --> 00:02:26.610
my socks don't do swan dives.
