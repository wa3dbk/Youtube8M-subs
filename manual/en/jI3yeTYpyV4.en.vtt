Welcome to Draw Tip Tuesday!

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.620
Today we’ll be using watercolors, water
and some brushes - oh and a waterproof pen

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.630
which I forgot to show you here!

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.010
Choose an item to draw - it doesn’t matter
what. I choose to draw a brush. It has a fairly

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.029
simple shape and is pretty straight forward.
I draw the outlines, and t give it some weight,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.390
I add a cast shadow.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.860
Then I pick up my watercolors and start mixing
and coloring. If I want light colors, I add

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.260
more water, If I want denser colors at the
darker, shaded side, i simply add a little

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.190
more paint. The lighter and darker bits will
tear into each other when they are still wet

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:11.460
- just let the paint do its job.
For shiny highlights: I keep bits of white.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.600
When the paint has dried, you can et back
in for another layer, this time using a smaller

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:26.780
size brush, and picking upping with less water.
Then hatch your way through the shading, using

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.670
dense colors and looking at your subject for
reference. Don’t touch the white areas,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.803
they will pop out as highlights.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.030
to a simple, not-so-interesting-looking line
drawing!

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.370
Why don’t you try this yourself? I am pretty
sure you will make awesome art!
