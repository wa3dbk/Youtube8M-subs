00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.449
With nearly 300 million active users
and more than one billion downloads.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.315
Angry Birds is one of the most successful 
mobile games created so far.

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:16.938
What exactly makes Angry Birds 
so popular and so addictive?

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:20.607
Psychologists, user interface experts,
and game designers

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:22.354
have identified a few reasons.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.960
We'll explore them in this 
virtual environment

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.409
which is modeled after the same principles 
as the Angry Birds world.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.239
First, Angry Birds is enticingly simple.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.959
It doesn't take much time or effort 
to get the hang of it.

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:36.823
And develop what psychologists call
a "schema".

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.586
A mental model of the game 
and all of it's rules.

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:41.626
Ow.

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:47.920
You use your finger to pull a slingshot 
and fling one animal — in this case me,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.815
at another less likeable animal's 
fortresses until they crumble.

00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:57.465
And that's pretty much it.

00:00:57.465 --> 00:00:59.188
In Angry Birds you later learn

00:00:59.188 --> 00:01:01.181
that the pigs were stealing
the birds' eggs.

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:03.804
Second, the game obeys 
the laws of physics,

00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:05.400
most of the time.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.988
Our brains evolve to recognize
cause and effect.

00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:09.270
As children we learn to expect

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
that our actions 
have predictable consequences.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.577
If you pull lightly on the slingshot,

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.920
the projectile won't go very far.

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:20.624
Greater force equals greater distance,

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.973
but the angle 
at which you pull matters too.

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:26.320
The slingshot in Angry Birds
works in exactly the same way.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.202
The game even traces the arcs of birds
flying through the air,

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:31.732
helping you improve your slingshot skills.

00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:35.132
Similarly, the different structural 
materials in the game

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:40.236
— wood, glass, stone — splinter, shatter
and crumble in realistic ways.

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:44.210
Angry Birds also keeps us hooked
with instant gratification

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.383
and easy access to new challenges.

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:49.297
Buildings topple within seconds
of releasing the slingshot,

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:51.706
and as soon as we finish one level
there's another one

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:53.750
available to us without delay.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.775
And when you finish the entire game,

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:59.450
there will probably soon be 
a new version for you to download.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.940
