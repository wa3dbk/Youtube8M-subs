00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
My name is Ryan.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.210
I am in Iowa, and I'm
in the creative writing

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.420
program with SNHU online.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.960
Actually, I found SNHU through
a Google search, and pretty much

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.410
admissions took over the
rest, convinced me to come,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.370
and it's been good ever since.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.340
The online school has just
been amazing for me, actually.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.660
I am definitely more able
to really dive in and do

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.650
the things that I need to do
online in my own time, which

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.410
has been great.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.900
The faculty, all of the
instructors that I've had

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.177
so far are awesome,
being able to communicate

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.260
through the discussion
boards and things like that

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.675
and really make
themselves available.

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:44.060
The blackboard that
we use is great,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.360
even some of the add-on
software for the math classes,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.640
and I know the school is
sort of integrating Google

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.580
into a lot of things, and all
of those are really easy to use.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.860
So just being able to be more
internet-mobile even online,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.410
but presence there is
awesome and super simple.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.640
So I was looking for something
that would take as many

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.700
of my transfer credits
I could get and actually

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
get a degree in as little
amount of time as possible.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.750
Through my own
circumstances, I'm

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.610
in a position where we're
moving quite readily,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.700
and I'm sort of tired of
working the minimum-wage jobs

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.810
that you can find for a
year or two before you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.882
have to move again.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:27.090
So I was really looking to
try to find something that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.010
would lead me into a career that
I could take with me wherever

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.640
I went, so SNHU was
really the best fit.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.380
I would definitely
recommend SNHU to anybody.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.460
Anyone who would ask, this
is where I would say to go.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.770
In terms of anything that
jumps out that's been awesome

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.600
or that I really
enjoy, just everybody

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.457
that you communicate through the
school is just right on point.

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:53.290
They really are good
at getting back to you,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.625
getting open communication.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:58.420
The doors are always open,
and there's really never

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.170
any way to not get any
questions answered.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.160
If you have something
to ask, and everybody

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.140
is just there for you,
so it's a good support.
