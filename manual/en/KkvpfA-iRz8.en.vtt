00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.620
Ku-Kukuku... Kuroneko?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.710
Negative.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.340
Kukuku... My name is "Yamineko". Accepting "corrosion" into myself, I have transmigrated into a dark angel...

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.120
■ Kuroneko right? ■
Kukuku... My name is "Yamineko". Accepting "corrosion" into myself, I have transmigrated into a dark angel...

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.590
Kukuku... My name is "Yamineko". Accepting "corrosion" into myself, I have transmigrated into a dark angel...

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.870
What's she going on about?

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.570
She's even more off her rockets than usual.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.190
I, I see... So you've joined a circle too.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.370
Yes... That I did. All by myself.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.240
I don't know why but she seems to be in a bad mood.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:48.970
...Hmph... Well, it's the same as always... It was the same during Winter Comiket too. In the end, it just means that the likes of humans live in a world different from me.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.420
H-Hey hey... Why do you look so dejected?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.810
...I'm not feeling dejected.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.510
...What about you? Is it okay for you to be here? You're busy with your examinations, right?

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.290
Not really. It's fine, it's fine. I pretty much have it under control.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.990
...Wha...

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.670
Haha, thanks for worrying about me.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.540
......W-What... Th-Then... for what... did I...

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.990
? What's wrong?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.860
Nothing!

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.510
Woah!

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.840
W-What's up with her?! Shouting all of a sudden...

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.110
...You've got to be kidding me.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.960
What is it?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
Nothing to do with you. Just talking to myself.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.840
...Hmph. So what is it? Have you come to laugh at me because I haven't even sold one volume?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.610
■ Of course not. ■
...Hmph. So what is it? Have you come to laugh at me because I haven't even sold one volume?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.020
...Hmph. So what is it? Have you come to laugh at me because I haven't even sold one volume?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:04.190
I see... So it's true. Kukuku... I knew it. You have been deceiving me all along.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:17.810
Kukuku... It's meaningless to continue toying with my heart. I will not feel a thing, for I have given my heart to the darkness.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.510
...S-Such paranoia.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.410
Kuroneko... Kuroneko is... sulking.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.440
O-Onii-san... Is she all right? She seems dangerous.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.990
Says you?!

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.240
I-It's all right. Leave it to me.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.610
H-Hey... Kuroneko? Calm down, you're mistaken about something.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.660
Mistaken? ...Do tell what I've misunderstood?

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.820
Err, let me introduce her first.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.560
This is Aragaki Ayase. Kirino's classmate and best friend.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.540
That woman's... best friend?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.240
H-Hello...

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.640
Come to think of it... She does look familiar.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.110
Y-Yes. We met for a while at last year's Summer Comiket.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.410
.....Aah, yes.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.410
...Phew. Seems like the misunderstanding has been resolved.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.590
I'm appalled... Laying your hands on your sister's best friend; you're the worst.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.740
■ It's not like that! ■
I'm appalled... Laying your hands on your sister's best friend; you're the worst.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.910
Like I said, it's not like that! Right, Ayase?

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.710
...Yes.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.340
Hmph, really? How suspicious.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.190
Kuroneko, what happened? You're much more venomous than usual today.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.770
...Hmph... I've been telling you from the start.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.120
Right now I am... the Angel of Vengeance "Yamineko".
