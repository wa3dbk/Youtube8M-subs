00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:10.570
Daddy Clay: Today in The Lab. Pregnancy brain
- medical condition or myth?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.289
Daddy Brad: Now we have no trouble remembering
who makes the best baby gear in the world,

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.670
it's BabyBjorn. Fabulous design and fabulous
safety. BabyBjorn.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.470
Daddy Clay: So pregnancy brain is one of those
things that people discuss anecdotally so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.730
often that we just accept that it's a medical
side effect of pregnancy. But is it?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.480
Daddy Brad: To find out, we interviewed Dr.
Keith Kesler. He's an Austin psychiatrist

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.210
and brain chemistry expert.
Dr. Kesler: With better neuro-imaging techniques,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.590
we're able now to see in real time what the
effects are of different phases of life. And

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.809
what they found in a study in Canada is that
there's a diminishment in the volume of the

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.719
brain of about 4%. In particular, there's
a diminishment in the volume of hippocampus

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.120
which is an area that's responsible for new
memories and for spatial relationships. It

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
would seem logical that if that's shrinking,
then it's not as effective and that would

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.980
account then for women forgetting how they
get to the grocery store, losing track of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.890
where they are even in their own neighborhoods,
and forgetting what the name of their kid

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.050
is. Laboratory studies with animals, with
rats, they're finding that many of the things

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.240
that women have been complaining about can
be reproduced in the lab. The brain shrinks,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.460
but with the flooding of all of these hormones
in the brain of progesterone, particularly,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.110
but also estrogen, it seems that the progesterone
actually helps increase, overall increases

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.850
nerve growth in the deep portions of the brain
that are protective later for dementia with

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.850
women. There may be some benefits over the
long term. They've done studies with pregnant

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.390
women and with women that have never had children,
and they've followed them over time, and have

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.590
found that there may actually be an improvement
in overall cognitive function in a woman because

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.490
of having been pregnant. Biting your tongue,
being patient, and writing everything down

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.811
much like a contract so that everybody remembers
what was talked about. So in some ways, it's

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:15.981
like most things in a relationship. It's infusing
a lot of humor into it.

00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.900
Daddy Clay: Saying "this is all in your head",
not a very good strategy?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.930
Dr. Kesler: Not good unless you want to sleep
on the front porch.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.750
Daddy Clay: I think of it as being sort of
like occupied hard drive space. And if you've

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.629
got all these concerns and worries particularly
the first baby, you're gonna lose track of

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.849
other, less important things. I wonder if
actually mommy brain becomes less and less

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.439
severe with each successive baby.
Daddy Brad: No, it gets worse, because there's

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.060
more stuff to think about. First baby, you're
focused on the baby. You got one baby to take

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.980
care of, that's it. Third baby, you've got
two kids to take of and a new baby. My wife,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.340
the past couple of months, has been putting
the powdered sugar in the freezer and the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.250
ice cream in the pantry. Ice cream doesn't
go in the pantry.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.519
Daddy Clay: That's pretty conclusive evidence.
I think that actually pregnancy child brain

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.280
gets worse after the kid is born. You know
Bill Cosby used to say that kids all have

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.300
brain damage but I think he got it exactly
wrong. Kids cause brain damage. And I think

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.939
it's quantifiable. I think you can find parallels.
For example, one kids, ten points off your

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:18.400
IQ. Two kids, same as like early stage Alzheimer's,
kind of like Ron Reagan when he was in office.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.599
Three kids, that's definitely spongiform,
encephalitis. Four kids, lobotomy.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.090
Daddy Brad: Is that why I drool a lot?
Daddy Clay: Probably so.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.230
Daddy Brad: Yeah.
Daddy Clay: You know what, this is all for

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.920
The Lab this week. We want to thank you for

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.340
BabyBjorn. You don't want to forget this,
no matter what, no matter where you go, no

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.730
matter where you are with your kid. Remember,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.379
Daddy Brad: Adds IQ points.
Daddy Clay: We'll see you next time here in

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.650
The Lab.
