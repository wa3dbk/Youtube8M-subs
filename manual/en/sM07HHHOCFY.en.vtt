00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:10.470
Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com,
and I’m going to demonstrate the moment

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.460
to moment modification of the more or less
standard violin holding position in the playing

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.640
of a fiddle tune. This I’m starting out
in what you might say was approximately standard

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:36.700
violin position, but fiddlers aren’t often
required to remain in one position because

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.030
of having to look at sheet music or because
of being in a really crowded carefully arranged

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.140
orchestral seating. So then they’re more
free to move around; I’m sitting down at

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.809
the moment, but I often play standing up.
And my playing position will change over the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:54.859
course of this tune…
