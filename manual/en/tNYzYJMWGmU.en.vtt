00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.710
You know, you should never give up on green
tomatoes.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.960
It pays to give them a chance.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.949
Let's say you have a bumper crop of tomatoes,
and it's getting cold, and you're wondering

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.550
what to do with those green ones.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.690
Well, there are a lot of recipes for green
tomatoes.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.590
I love salsa verde -- that's good one.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.940
And also, fried green tomatoes.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.489
If you don't love the tomato itself, at least
you could see the movie.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.820
These things are delicious, and they should
be preserved at all cost.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.180
Let me show you a time-honored method for
turning a green tomato like this into a beautiful

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.280
red, ripe one.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.760
It's really quite simple.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.140
You see, success in ripening a green tomato
begins in the garden.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.120
What you wanna do is cut them with a knife,
a sharp knife or scissors, and you wanna make

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.679
sure that you leave the little cap and stem
on -- that actually helps.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.579
When you bring them in, just rinse them off
with some tepid water and let them air dry.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.549
Once they're dry, go through and pick out
the ones that are white like this: You see

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.310
that white-ish color?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.980
Don't go for the really dark green ones that
are small and hard.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.400
Those are better for salsa verde.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.920
When they're white like this, they're more
likely to ripen.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.480
Those little hard green ones, they often rot.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.170
With them sorted out, what you wanna do is
take the tomato and just take a piece of newspaper

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.210
like this and just wrap the tomato in a newspaper
and store it in a dark place like a box.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.160
You see, I'm just placing these tomatoes inside
here one at a time.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.170
And what you'll want to do, eventually, is
place this box in a cool, dark place.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.230
When I say cool, I mean 55 to 70 degrees.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.730
If you want them to ripen a little faster,
warm the temperature up.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.170
Another way to accelerate the temperature
is to take an apple, or two in a box this

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.310
size, and place the apple in the box with
them.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.450
You see, the ethylene gas that an apple gives
off accelerates the ripening of really any

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.450
fruit.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.509
Certainly, the tomatoes are producing their
own ethylene gas which causes them to ripen,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.800
but these apples will really amplify the process.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.900
Next, all you have to do is box them up, place
them in a closet or in a basement, and check

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.340
on them about once a week and see how they're
ripening.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.760
If any of them begin to develop a spot, or
it looks like they might rot, take them out.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.840
And if you only have a few tomatoes, don't
worry about putting them in a box: Just place

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.390
them in a brown paper sack, and the same process
will cause them to ripen as well.
