00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.236
Greetings,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.818
If you want to try something new…

00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:09.242
If you dream of becoming famous…

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.478
If you are not afraid to challenge yourself, and others…

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.370
Try the new way to play Team Battles:

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:16.624
the Leaderboard!

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:18.090
Form your own team.

00:00:18.282 --> 00:00:19.240
Play together.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.561
Perform well and receive unique marks of distinction,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.066
credits and Ranked Points.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.138
Every win takes you a step closer to the top of the Leaderboard!

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.385
Start your path to glory by setting up your own team.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.344
You just need to press the button.

00:00:34.507 --> 00:00:35.570
Then send invites.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.895
The maximum number of players in a team is 12,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.318
but 7 is enough to play Ranked Battles.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.618
Any member can be promoted to the rank of Officer by the team’s Commander.

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.671
Officers can send the team into battle.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.447
After the team is complete

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.445
and all members have confirmed they are ready to start,

00:00:55.603 --> 00:00:57.627
the Commander presses the “Battle!” button

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.286
and a special matchmaker seeks a rival of equal strength.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.565
Once a suitable rival team is found, you are redirected to the spawn screen.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.006
You can see the map for the upcoming battle

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.858
and the spawn positions of the teams.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.068
With this knowledge,

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.935
every team member can change their selected vehicle.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.896
But the time for this is limited.

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:19.774
If all players in the team have confirmed that they are ready,

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.071
they enter the battle in the vehicles they have chosen.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.490
If any player fails to choose their vehicle,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.277
the whole team enters the battle in the vehicles originally chosen.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.795
If your team is complete but you want a regular, Unranked Team Battle,

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.852
you can press the “Go to Unranked Battles” button to switch.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.215
You can go back to playing Ranked Battles at any time.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.330
If there are fewer than 7 members in a team,

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:49.571
then the team can only play Unranked Battles.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.706
In Unranked Battles,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.329
you can always ask some Legionnaires to fill spots on your team.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.593
This is also a good way to find players

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.731
who can later be added to your Permanent Team.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.554
A Legionnaire is any player who is not a member of the Permanent Team,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.034
but plays in that team in Unranked Battles.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.307
Any Legionnaire can find a team and join its ranks.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.809
To do this, enter the Ranked Battles mode.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.331
In the list of teams,

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.087
you’ll only see the those who are seeking additional players.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.260
Every player can find a team to suit their taste and apply there.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.030
Remember: you can apply to only one team at a time.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.675
So, if you have already applied to a team and then find a better option,

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:32.467
you’ll have to cancel the first application before applying again.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.699
Every team has their own page, featuring detailed statistics.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.330
Here you can see the team’s position on the Leaderboard,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360
the vehicles in which they play best,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.770
and the maps where they win most often.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.823
You can also see the personal statistics of every player.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.138
You are able to see the teams who are in the same Division.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.525
In the Statistics tab,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.872
you can also see a team’s achievements from season to season.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.558
Ranked Battles will be played in seasons.

00:03:02.493 --> 00:03:03.916
At the end of each season,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.512
all participants will be awarded with unique marks of distinction.

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:11.397
Starting with the second season, there will be an even bigger reward:

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.242
the top Leaderboard teams will qualify to compete in the Wargaming.net League.

00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:21.427
Form your team and see if you can make it to the top of the Leaderboard!
