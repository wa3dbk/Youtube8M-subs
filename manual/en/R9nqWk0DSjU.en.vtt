00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.440
Hey guys!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.640
Today I'm coming to you guys with a review
for a new line that I've never tried.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.770
It's the Dark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti
Shrinkage Collection.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.970
So their Dark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti
Shrinkage Collection is supposed to be catered

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.539
towards natural hair to promote elongation
and less shrinkage.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.290
The product line consists of a whole bunch
of creams and glazes.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.260
There's a sheen spray that I saw.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250
They have a ton of products in this collection.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.260
Whenever there's a collection of products,
they are usually formulated to be used together.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.580
So usually you would use their shampoo, conditioner,
the leave-in, in the order in which is directed.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.720
So I did not purchase all of the product.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.020
I just purchased the coil moisturizing souffle.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.470
As I do this this review, take that into consideration.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.619
I did not use all of the other series of products
that may have an effect on my personal results.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.619
If you guys follow me on Instagram, you already
know that I picked up this product as well

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.439
as an edge control that I want to try out.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.690
As soon as I open this up, I get this tropical
feel.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.600
It smells exactly like Mango.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.330
That's the strongest scent that I smell is
the mango.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.580
It smells absolutely amazing.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.420
I absolutely love it.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.720
The price range for the line: each and every
product costs between $8 and $10.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.310
The price point was one of the major factors
in my decision.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.230
I liked the fact that it was less than $10.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.410
It's somewhat affordable in the medium range
of prices.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.670
For the amount that you're getting in the
14oz jar is absolutely amazing for the price,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.840
for $8, it's not to bad.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.690
For someone who wants to use the entire collection,
it can get very pricey, once you start to

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.750
add up the numbers.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.260
Like I said, there's a shampoo, a conditioner,
the cream glaze, this is the moisturizer,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.390
they have the sheen spray.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.560
We are already looking at a little over $40
just to be able to achieve their results,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.310
the ideal results.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.629
So I think that the line is a little bit pricey.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.670
My first impression when opening up the jar
when I got home was that it was of a very

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.530
creamy texture which is what I expected for
a souffle or moisturizer.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.170
One thing that I did notice is that, unlike
any moisturizer that I've tried, it had an

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.370
oil buildup on the top of the jar.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.210
It still has an oil buildup today.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.970
When I used it, I had to mix it with a rat
tail comb to mix in all of the ingredients.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.700
I figured maybe it was sitting on the shelf
for a while and the ingredients started to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
separate.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.690
But after using and mixing it, the oil is
still settling at the top.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.070
It kind of reminded me of a relaxer.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.599
You know when you purchase a relaxer they
tell you to mix it first before you start

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.990
putting in the activator?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.990
That's what it reminded me of.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.270
It kind've scared me because it is Dark and
Lovely and they are pretty much known for

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.599
their relaxers.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.099
Nonetheless, I still tried out the product
and went ahead and applied it to my hair.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.840
The direction say to condition your hair,
detangle with their Knot Out Conditioner.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.930
Like I said, i don't have those products,
I just have the coil moisturizing souffle

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.930
so I didn't use that.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.090
I used my own personal conditioner which was
the Suave Naturals Tropical Coconut conditioner.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.720
I have a review on that as well, so I'll link
that somewhere on the screen.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.780
But I used that to cowash my hair and started
to get into the product.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.810
It just says to run it through your hair from
roots to ends using fingerless motions to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.239
comb through.

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.050
Be sure to keep your hair damp while applying
and air dry.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.660
Finish off the look with a sheen spray.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.110
Those styling directions are pretty much a
wash and go.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.040
So I tried to do the wash and go method.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520
I tried shingling it through my hair.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.239
To be honest as soon as I put the product
on my hair, it felt like it was just sitting

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.239
on top of my hair.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.209
It didn't feel like it was being moisturized.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.890
I didn't see any type of definition.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.620
My curls were not popping.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.300
I was not seeing any results with this moisturizer.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.310
So I went ahead and tried a different method.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.320
I tried a twist out since I already had the
product on my hair.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.440
I went into the twist out process and started
twisting my hair into medium sized sections.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.490
These are the results that I got.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.889
When I woke up the next morning I had a bit
of white residue.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.660
I can still notice it.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.849
I had my mom look at my hair.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.350
She said she doesn't notice it but I can totally
see the white flakes.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.719
When I took it down, I still had white chunks.

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.009
It was pretty much flaking out of my hair.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.059
My hair didn't take well to it or it's just
not moisturizing for my hair.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.059
Overall, I'm not really too impressed.

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.330
Like I said, this is a first impression.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.339
I used it for a wash and go to try the wash
and go thing.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:08.169
Now I'm trying a twist out and the twist out
looks pretty good.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.569
My only complaint is the flaking and I don't
really feel like it's as moisturizing.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.449
Some of the benefits and things that I actually
liked about the moisturizer is that my hair

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:19.979
is really shiny.

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.249
I really like it.

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:23.580
My hair isn't weighed down.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.949
It still has bounce to it.

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.619
But I don't know if you can even hear it while
I'm running my hands through it, it still

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.440
feels really dry.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.210
It doesn't feel moisturized at all.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.860
I'm going to give it a few more tries.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.779
I'll try it on a braid out and everything.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.689
I personally just tried the wash and go and
the twist out method because this is an anti

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.270
shrinkage line.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.910
Now, when you do braid outs, you're technically
elongating your hair.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.089
Your hair is going to look a bit longer.

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.919
That is my first impression on this product.

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.740
Like I said, I'm going to try it again on
a braid out, roller set, something of that

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.740
nature.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.020
I'm going to try a whole bunch of different
hairstyles and I'll come back again to do

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.939
an overall review, if you guys would like
to see that.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.129
That's my thoughts.
