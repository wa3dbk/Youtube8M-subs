00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
hi i'm Valerie from the decorating room
today I would like to show you how simple

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:04.900
and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.910
easy it is to bring life and dimension
to flowers and other fondant

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.650
or gumpaste

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.730
decorations by using Pearl Dust or Color Dust

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.119
pearl dust adds shimmering highlights and
pearlized finish

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.439
while color dust adds natural shading and
depth and dimension

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.320
first I'll show you how you can paint by
adding lemon extract

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.439
and then I'll show you how to dry brush
using our color dust

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.529
so first what I have here

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.860
is some lemon extract that I already put in the
bowl

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.110
and I'm going use bronze and this is the
bronze pearl dust

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.739
and I'm going to try and put about

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.480
half the amount of pearl dust

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.670
to lemon extract you don't want it to be
too

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.399
wet  but at the same time you don't
want to be too dry or else it will

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.430
be hard to brush onto your

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.700
product okay that should be alright and
here I have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.030
a fondant ribbon right here so we're
going to start

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.340
painting on there very simple

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.009
what you can do and what I

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.030
pretty much always do is

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.799
add multiple layers of

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.340
paint to get more depth and to get

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.610
a more rich contrast

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.259
so there's your first layer and then

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.770
once you let it dry for a couple minutes or
not even, maybe a minute

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.689
you can go ahead and actually I"ll do this
part here and brush over it again

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.479
until you get the color that you're
looking for

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.810
that's how simple it is to paint and now
I'll show you how to dry dust

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.200
here I have some simple blossom flowers

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.009
and I'm going to use our

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.509
Orchid color dust orchid pink

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.119
and using a brush

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.260
now when you're dusting when you're dry
dusting wherever you start

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.989
brushing is where you want the most
color to me

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.760
because as it touches

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.050
your flower or whatever you're working with
it's going to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.739
already leave a darker shade, so
wherever you're going to begin

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.080
should be where you want it to be the
deepest color

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.480
so since I want the edges to be darkest I'm going to start there

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.690
and so the great thing about dry dusting
like this is you can

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.930
keep adding layers and layers

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.879
and when you pull down you can lessen

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.160
the pressure of your brush so it fades

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.420
and it's pretty forgiving so you
can play around with it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.200
you don't want to have too much on your brush so always
tap off the excess you can always add

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.750
more

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.030
okay so here I have all the completed
blossoms

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.650
I'm using the same technique that I just
showed you with the color dust

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.019
so a safe tip for you when you're

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.060
working with dust or pearl dust but
painting

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.860
it's always best to try a sample of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.819
your colors on a swatch of fondant or gum paste that you have extra laying around

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.220
just so you can get the right pressure
the right color

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.950
the right technique down before you
actually work on your finished cake

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.310
it just saves you a lot of time
that way also another tip is you can

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.989
mix

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.549
all different colors together if you
want to add a pearlized look

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.330
but you don't want the same colors
as the pearl dust you can mix color dust

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.569
with the pearl together

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.890
and it gives a difference sort of
shimmering effect

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.099
