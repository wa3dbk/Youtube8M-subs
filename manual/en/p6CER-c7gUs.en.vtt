00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Hey, Guys! So... Happy Christmas Eve

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.980
eve eve eve

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.340
Um... I'm gonna open my

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.920
advent calendar

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.420
Four sleeps to go

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.020
And it is a...

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.660
Christmas pudding!!!

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.340
*Om nom nom nom*

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520
See, I wanted to tell you about something that sounds pretty exciting for you guys

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.720
The makers of the film 'Chronicle'

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.720
are asking YouTubers

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.220
'What are you capable of?'

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.820
And I thought I'd get involved too

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.880
All you have to do is post a video response

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.540
to this video answering the question

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.700
'What are you capable of?'

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.120
And the big film chiefs are gonna make

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.060
a short film with all the best entries

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.680
which is pretty cool

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.240
So I was thinking

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.600
what am I capable of

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.920
and I decided to test myself

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.580
by doing something life changing

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.860
and world altering and brilliant

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.620
Am I capable of...

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.260
BAKING

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.140
*duuun*

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.380
*taaa daaa*
*Phil almost falls*

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.700
P: I fell over again

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.900
D: Pikachu is itchyy
*kills phandom*

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.620
P: Pikaa

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.080
P: So today we are making Christmas cookies

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.320
D: And whose recipe are we following?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.340
P: Have a guess?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.580
D: DELIA SMITH

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.380
P: YEAH!!!1! Here she is flying into the kitchen now

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.680
P: Oh, Delia
OH DELIA
*look at Dan's face*

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.120
P: I'm a bit excited

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.060
I've never baked anything before

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.520
So this is my first time

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.740
D: So you could say that Delia's gonna take your baking virginity?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.680
P: (thoughtful) You could say that *but don't though*

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.760
D: Oh, Delia

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.580
P: So for this recipe you will need:

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.580
225 g of plain flour

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.920
D:Fresh from the hairdryer
*Dan played a prank on Phil and put flour on his hairdryer, in case you didn't know*

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.160
P: Not again
*Dan's smol laugh*

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.260
P: 110 g of caster sugar *with an american accent*
D: Caster sugar

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.520
P: 110 g of cold butter, chopped

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.420
1 medium dinosaur egg
D: CHICKEN FETUS

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.440
P: Icing materials

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.900
Baking paper

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.900
And a mixing bowl

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.900
Food colourings (optional)

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.860
A broken mixing device
D: Thanks Tesco *irony detected*

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.320
P: Firstly, preheat the oven to 180°C

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.820
D: But get an adult to help you if you're 8

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.560
P: Also that's 350° F

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.600
I know things!!

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
*weird noises by Dan*

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.860
So Delia suggests we use a food mixer, but we don't have one

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.260
so we're using a broken whisk

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.620
Oh, my God... That's scary

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.460
*smol scream*

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.860
And also a wooden spoon

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.420
D: Pure man power

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.920
P: Dan, that's terrifying

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.140
Pour all 225 g of flour into your bowl
(he already has flour all over his face)

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Add your 110 g of sugaar

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.740
Chop up 110 g of butter

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.260
Noooo!!!! Now I'll never be the prince of the butter kingdom

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.940
*butter dying noises*

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.900
D: The signs of a psycopath waiting to happen

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.600
Globula
*wtf Dan??*

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.840
P: You wanna mix all these together until they resemble fine bread crumbs

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.180
Though I've got no idea how this is gonna work with a wooden spoon

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.840
*smol laugh*

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.240
Um... But let's go for it
D: YEAH

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.040
Four hundred and ten hours later

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120
I take inspiration from Disney

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.380
How do you pass time??
P: How?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.740
D: By singing a song

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.200
Left to right
Right to left

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.980
Everybody is whisking up and down

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
P: Back and forth
Up and down

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.640
Everybody is whisking Delia Smith's face

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.160
D: OH MY GOD
WHEN WILL IT END?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.520
WHEN WILL IT END??

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.960
*smol scream*

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.220
D: The broken whisk of Cazacdoom (I think that's how you write it...)

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.640
P: Yeah, this is doing loads

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.040
D: The fork of justice sailing through the night

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.240
P: Don't stab me in the hand

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Bread crumbs, bread crumbs everywhere

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.600
Everyone is eating bears (??)

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.740
D: Is this baking video gonna unintentionally turn into a full length album??

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.760
P: I think so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.620
P: Oops *smol scream*
D: PHIL

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.880
P: Sorry!! Don't do that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.760
At this point you should have a delicious smell coming out of the bowl

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.200
D: Although we've already added the flour, so it's past the point of tastiness

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.900
And four hundred and fifteen hours later

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.660
*look at Philly's face
SO CUTE*

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.300
P: We has bread crumbs!!1!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.480
D: Delia you're the one for me... What??

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.940
P: Once you have the bread crumbs

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.440
crack an egg into the bowl

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.860
D: There we go
P: eeg

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.980
D: Be (Phil almost drops the egg) $%##¨&amp;#¨%#¨@$%$@
P: Sorry

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.620
I didn't drop it though

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.300
D: Stop it, won't... Buttery hands! Stop, stop. Phil

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.140
P: That was perfect

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.460
D: No eggshell

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
P: Add a teaspoon of water

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520
Now you have to mix it until it becomes a ball

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.740
D: Really?
P: Yeah

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.140
I'm guessing it's meant to be like a football

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.380
D: Ballbasaur (see what I did there??)

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.180
Congaeling all the stuff

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.400
Egg, egg, egg
It's the king of all yolks

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.140
Is Delia some like epic robotron or something??

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.460
How does she do this??
P: I think she is

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.120
She is the 'Delianator'

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.560
After stirring it for a while, you can use your hands to make your baall
*Dan's face omg*

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.040
D: It's a breakfast bar stool
It's a breakfast bar stool

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.900
P: I don't think this is gonna make out into the album, Dan

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.220
D: Nooo... A Japan exclusive bonus track??
P: Yes

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.400
D: Yees

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.880
P: Flouring the surface

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300
So get your ball nice and floury

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.100
*smol scream*

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.960
I thought you were gonna hit me in head like a psychopath

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.000
D: I did, but the camera's rolling
*wow, Dannyul*

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.860
P: Okay, so get your ball nice and floury

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.940
so it's not sticky anymore

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.860
and you can throw it around like this

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.980
like a pizza!!1!

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.860
So now, if you want colours, you want to separate the mixture into different sections

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.400
This'll be our green section

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.280
P: I've done this slightly wrong

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.680
and you're probably meant to add the food colouring at the same time as the egg

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.840
but let's just add it anyway
D: Let's just get permanently green hands

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.340
D: ooppss, oh God

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.880
P:Okay

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.560
Now it's time to roll it at a neat flat surface

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.560
D: DIEE DIEEEE
P: They have feelings!!1!! They have feelingss!!!

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.160
Roll it until it's got the thickness of a 1 pound coin

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.940
For americans, that's about three ants on top of each other

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.320
Would you say??
D: Um.. Yep

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.660
Like, about that thick

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.920
D: This section would be a lot better if I had cleavage

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.720
P: Lightly grease your baking tray

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.460
D: Grease? (Yeah) You mean lubricate

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.820
*how to sexily lubricate your baking tray*

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.780
We made Australia

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600
P: Now cut them into any size you want

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200
It's preferable if you've got a cookie cutter

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.120
but we just have a giant knife

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700
P: Add your cookies to the baking tray

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.280
What is that gonna be??

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.900
D: You'll find out

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.940
So on tray one we havee:

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.220
A llama, a mistery, a cracker,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.160
a ball, a fail whale, a snowflake

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.880
a... (star thing) star thing? A P and a catterpillar

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.120
P: And on tray two we have

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.060
A lion face, a snowman, a D

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.620
an Earth, a house, an... What is that??

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.300
D: I don't know

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.160
P: A... thing And a tree! And a gnome

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.220
Now put them in the oven

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.800
one on the top shelf, one on the middle shelf
*hey, Dan*

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.080
for ten to fifteen minutes

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.420
then swap them around halfway through

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.840
about the seven minute mark

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.080
There you go, my babies

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.740
*what did you say, Dan?*

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.440
*Dan's pants are lower than my self-esteem*

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.580
P: I just realized our windows are open

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.960
the whole neighbourhood can see us
D: OH, God

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.460
P: It's not advisable to make these cookies in your favorite jeans

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.240
*ta daa*

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.380
P: They're ready!!1! Oh, they look really good

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.240
They kind of slightly over cooked

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.380
but they still look tasty

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.740
I think it's time to decorate them

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.540
Daan, come look

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.000
D: Oh, they turned out so much better than I thought they'd do

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.060
P: Your fail whale looks awesome

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.000
D: I know, right??

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.900
P: Oh, that's good

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.860
D: I thought they were all gonna be disasters

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.180
P: Yeah. I like my snowman, as well

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.040
D: But, c'mon though... Who actually thought that my llama would turn out okay?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.880
Look at it

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.020
P: Planet Earth

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.240
D: Catterbiscuit

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.940
P: It's time to commence the decorating
D: Yeeaahh

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.980
D: It's like the Sistine Chapel, but better

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.020
P: I'm quite proud of our creation

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.620
D: I am too

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.340
I was honestly expecting them to be a lot more of a disaster

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.720
But they're actually quite fit

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.700
P: Yeah. So it turns out I am capable of making cookies

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.660
Almost hit my head on the ceiling

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.520
D: Well, don't you want to know what the mistery cookie is??

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.660
P: Yeah, What is that?

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.820
D: So what do you think it is, Phil?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.120
P: Um... a spaghetti bolognese?

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.300
D: It is... a placenta

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.100
P: Nooo

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.040
D: A placenta cookie, of course
P: Oh, no

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.500
P: You can eat that one, Dan

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.240
D: I will

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.800
P: Weirdly, that looks like the tastiest cookie as well

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.560
How many Christmas is out of ten?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.860
D: Twelve

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.440
P: Do you want me to leave in a room with it?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.040
P:So, yeah, cookies aside...

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.980
D: Pretty good, yeah?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.180
That's right

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.880
Delia knows how to hit the spot

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.680
P: Cookies aside, I wanted to tell you about our radio show

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.880
*smol screams*

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.900
P: Me and Dan have been given a two hour radio show

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.640
On BBC Radio 1 on Christmas Day

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.520
D: Yep. And this won't just be a radio show

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.560
Will it, Phil??
P: No

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.080
D: It's going to be two hours of video

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.320
P: On the Radio 1 website

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.640
It's on Christmas day between 10 and 12 pm

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.420
So we're not gonna interrupt anything important

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.760
You'll have finished your dinner, you'll be like:

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.100
Aaahh, time to watch Phil and Dan for two hours

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.320
It's gonna be the best

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.800
Dan, you can leave now

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.460
*multiple attemps of landing the bear on his head*

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.340
P: YAY

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.100
D: These aren't just normal Christmas cookies

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.740
These are freaking DELIA SMITH Christmas cookies

00:07:52.380 --> 00:08:01.080
*christmasy music*

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.100
D: The minute you walked in the joint aand...
P: Um... Dan?
