00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.600
&gt;&gt; BROCK: Boston has played an incredible role in American History

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.860
so today we're taking a walk along the freedom trail

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.460
and we're going to learn how to take incredible photos along the way

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; GUIDE: A photo walks tour is very different because not only are you going to learn the history of Boston

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.255
But you're also going to learn how to take creative pictures

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:34.495
&gt;&gt; BROCK: So the freedom trail is actually identified by a red brick line that carries through the city

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.114
Identifying the most historic spots in Boston

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.800
&gt;&gt; GUIDE: This is a really cool shot in black and white

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.720
&gt;&gt; BROCK: One of the first stops is here in the Granary Burial Grounds

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.080
which dates back to the mid 1600's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.940
there's over five thousand people buried here including John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Paul Revere

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.180
The Omni Parker Hotel is the oldest hotel in all of America and it's actually where

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.500
John F. Kennedy proposed to Jackie Onassis

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:09.694
&gt;&gt; GUIDE: This is a great shot because we have some great clouds

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.800
&gt;&gt; TRAVELER: We really learned how to avoid the typical touristy kind of photos

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.160
and be more artistic in the way we're looking at the historical moments

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.340
&gt;&gt; BROCK: This is the State House where the British laws were read to Bostonians

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.920
and ironically enough in 1776 the Declaration of Independence was first read

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:37.394
&gt;&gt; TRAVELER: I reccomend it for anybody whether you're a local or someone just wanting to see Boston

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.280
it's a terrific tour

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.520
&gt;&gt; BROCK: And the last stop is here at the home of the infamous Paul Revere

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.673
in the North end of Boston's oldest building

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:52.040
This walk along the Freedom Trail here in Boston has been incredible

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.820
I've improved my photography skills but also learned so much about American History
