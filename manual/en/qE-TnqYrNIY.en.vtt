00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.560
What is the best intermittent fasting schedule
for women?

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.700
It seems that each and every year, a new diet
trend comes along that promises dieters an

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.749
achievable way to reach their weight loss
goals.

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.950
Unless you've been living under a rock recently,
you'll have noticed that intermittent fasting

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.980
schedules are currently big news!

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.200
It's pretty self explanatory to work out what's
involved, but it's basically all about strictly

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.370
limiting your calorie intake for short period
of time.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.740
The premise is brilliant for women who want
to lose weight, but still eat normally most

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.039
of the time, and allow themselves a little
indulgence.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.589
Let's take a look at the best options when
it comes to the best intermittent fasting

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:40.749
schedules for women.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.069
First up is the Fast 5 method.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.359
On this diet, you're allowed to eat during
a five hour window each day.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.699
You can choose the five hour window yourself,
so it's fairly flexible in this respect.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.909
You're unlikely to lose any weight during
the first three weeks, so bear this in mind

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.530
before starting the diet.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.920
You need to be in it for the longer haul,
and it isn't considered to be a quick fix!

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.870
Next, what about the 5:2 method?

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.960
This one involves water fasting for two days
a week, then eating a normal but healthy diet

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.270
on the remaining five days.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.270
This one has been covered perhaps the most
extensively in the media.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.940
The fact that only two days per week are different,
and you eat normally the other 5, it can also

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.260
take a while to start seeing results.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.800
If you like to see the scales going down to
spur you on, this isn't necessarily the right

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.220
option for you.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.560
Finally, there's the Alternate Day diet.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.230
This was developed by James B. Johnson M.D.
and involves eating normally one day, then

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.990
eating less than 500 calories (or, 600 for
men) on the following day, then repeating.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.970
The great thing about this diet is that it
supercharges your metabolism.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.360
Your body quite literally doesn't know what
to expect, so you can be fairly sure that

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.990
the results will start showing in the fastest
possible time.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.670
In this respect, it's the Alternate Day diet,
that really ticks the boxes.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.820
Sticking to the day on, day off schedule also
means that it's really quick to get into a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.820
routine.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.530
Whichever intermittent fasting diet you decide
to go for, do your research and plan your

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.910
meals in advance.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.080
Whether you're a career lady, a busy mother
juggling a young family, a student at college,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.690
or anything in between, there really is a
way to make a fasting diet work for you.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.620
As with everything though, failing to prepare
is preparing to fail, so don't put yourself

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.510
at a disadvantage before you even get started!

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930
The right mindset is also your secret weapon.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.260
Approach it as a lifestyle choice that will
have long-lasting health benefits rather than

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.430
just a way to get thin quick, and you'll be
best placed for making positive changes.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.630
You'll need to overcome the urge to overeat
on your 'normal eating' days, so bear this

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.220
in mind at the beginning.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.880
Have you ever done one of these diets?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.730
Did it work for you?
