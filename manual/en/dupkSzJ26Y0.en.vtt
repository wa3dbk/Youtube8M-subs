HI 
why is windows so slow why is computer so slow Whatever the cause, there are lots of ways 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.200
to help speed up Windows  Please follow me step-by-step at fawziacademy on YouTube
Restart regularly

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:32.866
This tip is simple. Restart your PC at least once a week, especially if you use it a lot. Restarting a PC is a good way to clear out its memory and 

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:43.799
ensure that any errant processes and services that started running get shut down.
Restarting closes all the software running on 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:57.166
your PCâ€”not only the programs you see running on the taskbar, but also dozens of services that might have been started by various 

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:08.432
programs and never stopped. Restarting can fix mysterious performance problems when the exact cause is hard to pinpoint.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:22.966
The more things you have open and the longer you keep them running, the greater the chances your PC will bog down and eventually run low on 

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:30.299
memory.
Check your computer's speed
There's no need to guess the speed of your 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:42.566
computer, however. Windows provides a way to check and rate your PC's speed with a tool called the Windows Experience Index. 

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:55.499
Open Performance Information and Tools by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.466
Performance Information and Tools, and then, in the list of results, click   Performan ce Information and Tools.

00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:58.499
     

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:10.433
The Windows Experience Index rates your computer on five key components and gives you a number for each, as well as an overall base 

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:24.166
score. This base score is only as good as your worst-performing component subscore.
Base scores currently range from 1 to 7.9. If 

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:34.132
your PC is rated lower than 2 or 3, it might be time to consider a new PC, depending on what tasks you want to do with your computer.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:45.266
To view your computer's base score
. If you recently upgraded your hardware and want to find out if your score has changed, click 

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:55.199
Re-run the assessment.   If you don't see subscores and a base score, click Rate this computer.   

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.833
