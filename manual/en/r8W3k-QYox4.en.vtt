&gt;&gt;Stephanie Christensen: Our office recently
got the chance to try out a couple of printers

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.690
from the HP OfficeJet Enterprise X series.
All-in-ones have been around for a while,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.160
but this latest line takes things up a notch
by providing a faster printing speed, 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.630
along with mobility and security.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.910
What makes the HP OfficeJet Enterprise X series  printers stand out is the Page Wide Technology.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.990
While traditional inkjet printers print from
left to right, the HP OfficeJet Enterprise

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.210
X series printers actually feed the paper
through and print an entire row at the same time,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.469
very much the same way a large printing press
does. This is pretty cool. This is why this

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
line of printers is so fast and can print
70 pages per minute, which is twice as fast

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.659
as laser printers. If one of us has a large
print job, 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.710
we don't have to worry about clogging up
the rest of the office's workflow.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.460
The printers use a pigment-based ink rather than a dye.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.670
You could actually pour water on the page and the ink would stay.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.250
The HP OfficeJet Enterprise X series printers
come equipped with USB plugins and card readers,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.619
and also have wireless capabilities. I am
able to print directly from my smartphone

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.159
and tablet using HP Eprint or AirPrint applications
while being away from the office. Or I can

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.200
simply print material using the NFC technology
by tapping my tablet against the printer.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.219
A lot of times large multi-function printers
can be difficult to navigate, but the color

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.070
touch screen makes setting up the machine
really easy. Along with the color touch screen,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.549
the printers are equipped with a built-in
keyboard, which simplifies inputting emails

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.899
and sharing documents.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.030
We have a lot of sensitive information floating
around, so we need a printing solution that

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.009
provides us with adequate security. That's
one less thing to worry about knowing this

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.240
series of printers features pin code access
controls and encrypted hard drives.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.390
HP OfficeJet Enterprise X series printers
delivers great functionality at an affordable price.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.869
