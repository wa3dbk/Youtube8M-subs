00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Currently is taking place the "Pedro Carbonell Tour". 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.900
Can you explain what is it?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The idea is born last year

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The Pedro Carbonell Tour gives me the possibility to share experiences with spearfishers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 to give some advices to us

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I do also a little promotion for Beuchat 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I sign autographs on t shirts and posters

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What do you often talk about with the spearfishers?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We usually talk about the spearguns configuration informations

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They ask some questions about the spearfishing techniques I've tried... just like the indian

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Actually this is the question I get asked often

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What are the differences between the New Zealand - Australia Tour of 2011 and this one in France?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There are not a lot of differences

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Spearfishing enthusiasts are the same all around the world 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
even if it 's true that spearfishing techniques are differents

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There are a lot of people here in France who travel abroad 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and ask me questions about the last year tour in New Zealand and Australia

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000
Are you Ready for a Pedro Carbonell Tour in 2013?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Yes of course, who knows if we will stop in the future ! 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Maybe we will go to the USA or in South America, I don't kow !

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Beuchat will make its choice in 2013 !
