Salads can oftentimes get boring but today
I'm going to show you how to make an exciting

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.589
one from the La Boulange cookbook.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.640
We're going to be making the Warm Goat Cheese
Salad.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.950
Let's get started!

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.740
You're going to need 8 cups of Spring salad
mix 11 ounces of Goat Cheese 2 tablespoons

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.019
of French Herbs, so I'm using Thyme, Rosemary,
Dill, and Chives.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:33.100
1 egg, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 24 candied
pecans, 12 grape or cherry tomatoes cut in

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.760
half, and then for the dressing 2 tablespoons
of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.289
a pinch of salt, and a pinch of ground pepper.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.690
First in a bowl, mix your goat cheese and
herbs and form them into a ball.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.760
Put them on a plate and put in the fridge
for about 2 hours until it's firm and set.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.390
Now let's prepare our Balsamic Vinaigrette.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.980
Mix together your balsamic vinegar, salt,
and pepper, and stir until the salt dissolves.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.950
Then while whisking, slowly drizzle in the
olive oil until it emulsifies and forms a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.360
nice vinaigrette.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.570
Then set it aside.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.750
Now take your egg and whisk it well into a
bowl.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.799
This is going to be your egg wash for the
goat cheese.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.390
Take your goat cheese out of the fridge once
it's firmed up, and then piece by piece dip

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.619
it into the egg and dip it into the bread
crumbs.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.280
The egg is what's acting as a glue to grip
the bread crumbs onto the goat cheese.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.676
Now on the stove heat up the skillet on medium
high heat and coat it with some olive oil.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:41.579
Then take your goat cheese and pan-fry each
side until it's golden brown.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.310
And there's your warm goat cheese.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.880
Now it's time to assemble the salad.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.140
First take your balsamic vinaigrette and drizzle
about 2 tablespoons.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.110
Next toss in your candied pecans and cherry
tomatoes and then toss it well.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.590
Now scoop out a little bit of the salad onto
a plate and then place your warm goat cheese

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.700
on top.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.799
And there you have it, your warm goat cheese
salad.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.849
Let's give it a try!

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.940
It's so interesting and I love the crispiness
of the goat cheese on the salad.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.379
It gives it a little bit of tang but also
a little bit of a crunch too!

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.910
