00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.900
Hi I'm John Temmel, the Siding Guy. 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.680
Thanks for coming onto our website.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.129
I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself, my company, my

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.329
installers, and 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.239
what we can do for you on your home.

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.109
I'm a preferred remodeler for the Hardie Plank Program.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.970
We install the siding for all their specifications.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.399
We've been in business since 1994. I've been doing Hardie

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.580
installations since 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.869
1998. 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.869
Hardie plank is a fiber cement product. Hardie's been in the market, in the Atlanta market, since around '94. 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.670
Hardie has the pre-prime, which is on this wall right here. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.420
We'll put two coats of latex on this and it will last 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940
a good ten twelve years.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.210
If not longer.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.300
Hardie plank also makes the color plus, which is a 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.520
pre-painted, factory painted product 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.490
that has a fifteen year warranty on the paint.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.720
So your siding 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.720
would literally not need to be painted for over 15 years. Hardie plank has a 30 year warranty.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.150
If there's a problem with your siding after 25 years, you get one hundred percent of the value

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.800
back on that siding. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.650
I have installers that have been with me since 1998. 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.960
You'll probably get a shot of Jesus a little bit later.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.130
Behind me is the table saw set up. We've been installing siding on this house 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.110
for two days now. 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.220
Had the whole house stripped down, wrapped, and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.630
put in PBC moldings, and of course Hardie Plank Siding. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.630
Hardie corners, pre-primed product which is gonna get two coats of quality latex paint.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.530
If we take the siding down and find some internal problems

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.250
we're gonna know what to do and how to fix it right. 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.050
I've been home building industry for
over twenty five years, I've built

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.960
single-family homes for over twelve.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.670
So anything behind those walls, if there's any problems, we're gonna 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.330
know how to approach it and how to attack it. 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.740
This particular customer's fascia soffit and frieze board 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.070
were all done with siding. 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.720
The hardboard siding we've taken off the walls.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.399
So we really had to remove all the fascia 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.760
soffit and you can see him pulling off the frieze board right now in the dental mold.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.009
We will be placing new

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.719
Hardie Plank frieze soffit, 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.989
vented soffit,

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.969
and fascia board. 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.879
This house what it's done with the PBC brick mold around the windows,

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.689
fascia, soffit and siding 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.109
will literally be maintenance-free.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.359
Pressure wash the house every few years and
that's it.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.049
"Fireplace has rusted out the pan.  

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.639
We gotta get proper dimensions

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:36.709
and order a new one. 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.319
You notice where I'm measuring now there's 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.719
all sorts of rust comin' down the side, we'll replace it.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.909
They're gonna always have rust comin' down their fireplace.  

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.889
Now the fun part."

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.819
I'm gonna take these dimensions down now and order that up with my

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.229
fireplace man Darrell.

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:02.279
I do believe he has another brother named Darrell, he's up there in the mountains somewhere."

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.379
When we start on a job in a neighborhood

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.989
we get our sign up

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.449
we'll stay in that neighborhood.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:11.120
We build up a reputation and remain in
that neighborhood because we can pull

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.900
the work,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.529
we keep our customers satisfied. 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.929
If you were to go onto Kudzu.com which is a

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.069
wonderful site,

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.639
checkout installers of anything,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.059

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.149
all of our customers satisfied.

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.739
With my extensive background in
construction,

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.629
anything on your home

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.479
that you would have done

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.150
we can do it. We can do window sash placements,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.319
we can build new decks for you,

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.729
we can add front porches on for you,

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:45.509
we can do anything on a single family home
that needs to be done. 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.249
We will be focusing on siding, but we can do it all.
