Hi. my name is Anne Glass.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.230
I'm a reading and learning specialist at a
private school in New York City and I work

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.050
with Kindergarteners through 3rd graders on
Reading, Word Study, and Writing Skills.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.250
In addition to be a reading specialist and
learning specialist, I'm also a parent and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.109
today I'm going to talk to you about topics
in reading.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.349
Almost every school from at least first grade
on, requires students to read about 20 -30

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.810
minutes each night.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.400
Now getting your child to actually sit down
and read the book can often be a challenge

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.410
and I hear from parents all the time that
it usually culminates in a battle involving

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.500
bribery, threats, pleading, and all kinds
of drama.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.739
There are some things you can do to avoid
getting to this point.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.359
The first one is to model your own reading.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.719
If your child sees you reading and enjoying
a book, he's going to be much more likely

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.450
to sit down and do it.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.560
It's a great way to avoid a do as a say and
not as I do scenario.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.610
And children who grow up in a household where
reading is a desired activity are much more

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.110
likely to be independent readers on their
own.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.689
The next suggestion is to make sure your child
has a designated reading place.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.250
That could be in bed, or a special chair,
or on the sofa, or just anywhere in your home

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.070
where he feels comfortable reading.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.720
You can even have a discussion around that,
discussing where you enjoy reading.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.880
You might have a special chair, and you can
talk about how that feels comfortable to you

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.939
and its a place where you can really concentrate
and create a quiet bubble for reading for

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.939
yourself.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.650
Another important tip for enforcing reading
time at home and making it a pleasant thing

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.030
to do is to eliminate possible distractions.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.420
That means turning off the TV, and turning
off the computer, and also making sure that

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.100
noisy siblings are out of the way and quiet,
which I know is easier said than done.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.170
It's also completely acceptable to provide
a small bribe or gimmick to your child if

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.240
you think that will motivate them to start
reading.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.610
I recently gave my son a book light and he
actually thought it was fantastic and he looks

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.350
forward every night to getting into bed at
bedtime and pulling the covers up over his

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.230
head, turning on his book light, and reading
for about a half an hour.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.510
So that's actually worked out really nicely,
and it felt like a treat for him and it made

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.790
it something fun to do, and he's also told
me that it just creates silence around him

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.120
where its just him and his book.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.660
One gimmick that I would advise against, and
I've seen a few of these, are these bookmarks

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.970
that have a digital clock on them and you
can actually set the clock for the 20 or 30

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.480
minutes that is required for reading.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.940
The problem with this is that its the only
thing your childs going to pay attention to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.970
and they will watch the minutes tick down
until the required time is up.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.450
So there's never going to be an opportunity
for that child to really dig into the book

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.420
and have the pleasure of losing himself in
a story.
