00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:11.779
It's June 30th, 2012, and I've just loaded a shiny new Cyanogenmod9 alpha build onto my shiny new HTC One X.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:19.560
This is the North American version, not the International version, so it uses the snapdragon processor as opposed to the nVidia Tegra3.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.486
So it was actually a little more challenging to find a ROM for it.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:34.766
But, thanks to vinvinvinster, whose build I found on the xda-developers.com forums, I am now running it on my device.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:47.187
This is my first time ever modding my phone.  So to say I was "nervous" about loading a custom, non-manufacturer-approved ROM onto the device is quite an understatement!

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:56.611
I was terrified of turning my shiny new device into a brick.  But, no tragedies occurred and here we are, up and running it, for about 12 hours now.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:01.608
So far it's been a pretty good experience.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.173
I'd just like to take a bit of time to show a couple of the features that I've found in Cyanogenmod that I've found particularly useful.

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:20.454
The first one is this concept of "Profiles".  If you go into "Settings", there is the "Profiles" section.

00:01:20.554 --> 00:01:25.880
It ends up being fairly reminiscent to what I used to use for many years on BlackBerry.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:36.588
So I've set up my home, night, silent, work, various profiles so that you can set up your device to behave differently in different situations.

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:46.154
So you can control things such as turning on or off or leaving alone the state of certain radios, Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi.

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:51.437
You can set the volumes.  So, while I'm at home I don't mind media, ringtones, and everything being loud,

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:54.864
whereas at work I like to turn down those volumes.

00:01:54.964 --> 00:02:01.432
You can control specific applications.  These groups are entirely customizable.

00:02:01.532 --> 00:02:09.213
But even cooler is the Lock Screen mode.  While I'm at home I'm not too afraid of people stealing my device or stealing my information

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:15.210
so I like to have it more convenient in an insecure, or, actually, let's make it completely disabled mode.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.207
So there is  no lock screen whatsoever when I'm in home mode.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:30.629
And when I switch to work then obviously I'll turn it on.  Really, any time I go out of the house I like to turn on the lock screen just in case the device goes missing on me.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:38.625
This is one option, in order to change profiles is to go into the "Settings" app and choose the profile you would like.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:43.408
But that's a little bit inconvenient, especially if you're moving around a lot.

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:49.405
So if you press-and-hold the power key there is an option here to change the profile.

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:56.115
So if I click here, it gives me a list of the profiles and I can easily switch between the different ones.

00:02:57.757 --> 00:03:05.753
Also, you may have noticed on the screen there is the option to take a screenshot right from the power screen.

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:08.465
Very cool

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:14.319
Another feature that I really like about Cyanogenmod is the menu key.  That's right, I said "the menu key"!

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:20.030
On the HTC One X you get a back button, a home button, and a task-switcher button.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:31.138
Google has tried to deprecate the whole idea of a menu button, much to the Samsung Galaxy S3's shagrin, as they have included a menu button despite that advice.

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:36.735
But I personally like the menu button because it is an operation that I use quite frequently.

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:44.374
Often you'll see the menu button all over the place.  Sometimes it's up here in the corner, sometimes it's down here in the corner, sometimes it's all the way across the bottom.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:50.513
But after loading Cyanogenmod9 there is actually a secret button beside the task-switcher button.

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:58.009
So if I click here on the task-switcher, here were are in the task switcher.  But if I click a little bit to the right of it...

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:05.862
Yes, there is actually a distinct hidden button to the right of the task-switcher button, which will bring up the menu.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:07.718
Very handy.

00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:19.069
I think one of the reasons I wanted Cyanogenmod the most is because for some reason HTC turned off one of the coolest features.

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.280
And it's the feature that when you hit the power button it turns off like an old-fashioned 60's TV.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.207
Love it.

00:04:27.307 --> 00:04:31.490
That feature alone was enough to convince me to load this ROM on there.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:41.770
Everything I've tried is working so far.  All of the apps that you see on the screen I've at least given them cursory tests.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.910
The phone works, sending/receiving messages, I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones that work really well.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.908
The only thing that doesn't really live up to the way that HTC Sense was before is the camera.

00:04:52.008 --> 00:05:07.899
The camera app is more-or-less stock Ice Cream Sandwich.  It, just, you know, HTC did an awesome  job on the camera on this phone and to use the built-in camera app is just a major step backwards.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:14.752
Hopefully in the future that will be fixed.  But, you know what, I'm just thankful that I have a build at all.

00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:20.677
The camera doesn't even use the entire screen real estate.  Like it's not using the whole camera.

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:27.602
If you bring up the photo it only takes up about this much of the screen.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:33.884
So just before I let you go, I'll just make sure to show you the version I'm actually running on here.

00:05:36.097 --> 00:05:41.451
So as you can see, model number, Android version 4.0.4

00:05:42.022 --> 00:05:48.590
And here we go, Cyanogenmod version 9, built on June 24, 2012, it's an unofficial build.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.587
Actually, it was built on June 23, so it's only a few days old, but it's running pretty well for me on this phone.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:06:05.866
I hope you give it a try!  If you're scared to mod your phone it's actually not that bad.
