Bayynat presents

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:25.000
On the birth anniversary of Jesus Christ (a.s.) and the New Year that starts by his birth,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we should celebrate these occasions the way the Quran does

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The Quran never talked about the birth of any sacred person

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
person with all the details that illustrate the Divine role in this birth which opens up to the world of the unseen

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and considering it one of Allah’s signs

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the way it talked about the birth of Jesus Christ

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Christ’s birth was mentioned in several Surahs,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:51.000
especially the Surah of Lady Mary, whom the Quran described as the pure sanctified woman who opened up to Allah,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so He made her grow in purity and beauty and right graciously He accepted her

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:19.000
after her mother had vowed her to be devoted to Allah’s service and invoked that Allah would accept her, and to the care of Zakariya Allah assigned her

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Every time he would enter her chamber to see her, he would find her supplied with sustenance,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and he would say: "O Mary! From where did you get this?"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
She would answer: "From Allah, for Allah provides sustenance to whomever He pleases without measure,"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
knowing that the angels used to bring down food to her while worshipping her Lord
