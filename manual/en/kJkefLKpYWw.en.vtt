00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.720
(Hello Zhen Huan)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.000
(Hi)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Hello!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100
(Because it's Star Awards, we're going thru artistes' bags)

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.260
(Can we see what's in your bag please?)

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.480
Can I choose not to?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.980
(Cannot!)

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.420
They just let you see what's in their bags?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.060
Actually there's nothing much in my bag

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.660
Hold on, let me think

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.560
Ok, sure sure

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.660
Do you want to just see what's in it or do I take it out?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.700
I don't like using wallet, so I just use a money clipper

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.980
Red packets because I don't tidy my bag

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.200
There's a $10 inside still

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.060
You have red packets as well?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.560
Yes

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.200
I have red packet too, but there isn't any money in it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
I have money in it still, so in future -

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.300
Is it since Chinese New Year?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.800
Yes

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.580
He's lazier than me! He doesn't clear his bag too!

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.420
Hey, red packet is a good thing!

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.180
That's right, that's right

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500
Ok, these money are all taken out

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.860
I think placing red packets is auspicious

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.100
There's a $10 inside, it's a small surprise

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.560
A soldier can't go to a war without his weapons

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.220
Artistes, when they report to the company

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.620
They have to have their script

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.840
It's a new show!

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.240
The script of the drama I'm working on

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440
I have four of these

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.720
I can only say

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.220
Today is the Star Awards

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.300
Tomorrow I have a morning shift

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.020
Woah

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.120
It's really

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.020
Are you able to recognize which one is me?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.160
This side is also me

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.480
Zhang Zhen Huan

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.920
I want to emphasize on this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.960
My name is written like this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.800
There isn't a 'G' in here

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.180
I basically did not change one bit

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.180
This side, let's forget it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.040
(You seem like)

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.920
No no no

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.420
(What is it!)

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.820
It's a pen

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.960
Also, a ring

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.260
No, this ring is only worn on the pinky

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.600
It doesn't seem to fit

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.520
I'll just wear it here

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.540
This ring is a secret, let's keep mum about it

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.560
(You're married quietly?)

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.360
Only engagement

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.300
So, just look at the ring

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.500
It's a little old

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.280
(May I know who is it with?)

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.340
The colour is fading away

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.900
This is a secret, I can't reveal it

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.500
If not I would have already mentioned it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
It's actually with Rui En

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.540
The drama's ring

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.600
In the show, we're both acting as a married couple

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.500
Because today is Star Awards, else there would be more things

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.360
Because I'm not filming today

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540
So there isn't much things today

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.580
But I should really have the habit of tidying my bag

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.940
Regarding the red packets that have yet to be thrown

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.840
Yes, I was telling everyone about it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.880
I should also put in lots of effort to tidy up my bag

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.300
Ok, I'll be keeping my things now

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.960
I know, I know

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.680
That's the reason why we have chemistry when we film

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.920
It's because our habits are quite similar

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.380
Which is, putting red packets in the bag

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.940
Ok, bye bye

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.960
I'll be going to prepare now

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.860
(Bye!)

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.820
Hey, hello

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.620
Byebye!
