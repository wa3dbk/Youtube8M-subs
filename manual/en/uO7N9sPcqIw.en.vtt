Hi, this is Matt on behalf of Expert Village,
and today we're going to learn how to make

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.650
my chinese chicken fried rice. So now that
we've cut and prepared our chicken, let's

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.650
cook it. I'm going to turn my stove on medium
and I'm going to put a little vegetable oil

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:26.340
in, just a little bit so it doesn't stick,
and I make sure I get the oil around the pan

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:46.050
like so. And I'm going to throw our chicken
in. Now we're not going to season it, because

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.000
we're going to dump this after it's cooked
we're going to put it in the rice. So we don't

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.922
want to season I just want it to be cooked.
So and we're just going to keep moving it

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:58.969
around so it cooks nice. We don't want it
to, we just want it to cook nice and not burn.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.140
We don't want it to be dark brown, we just
want it to cook through. The key is to always

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.401
keep it moving around because you don't want
it to burn. So just, I always keep it moving,

00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:17.820
just continually stirring it and stirring
it and stirring it. You see how it's cooking

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.479
nicely? So just keep stirring until it's cooked
all the way through. I'm not quite there yet.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.990
But if you notice you see how both sides are
actually turning white. They're not that raw

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.150
pink. It's because I keep turning it, and
see both sides are even, you can see that,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.060
because I just keep it moving. So just make
sure you just keep moving, I know it's pain,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.850
but if you keep it moving it'll definitely
cook better I think, and it will cook more

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.011
evenly. Okay I think this chicken is definitely
done. So I'm going to put this off to the

00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.380
side, and I will see you on the next step.
