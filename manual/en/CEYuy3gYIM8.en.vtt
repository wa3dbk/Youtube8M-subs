00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.210
Watching a big bass jump at eye level is a
unique part of Kansas float tubing. Get a

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.930
flyrod in your hand, get properly equipped,
and you’re in for one of fishing’s most

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.280
exciting challenges. Few thrills can match
the hand-to-hand battle of a lunker bass on

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.580
a fine tippet. And wherever you live, opportunity
is usually just around the corner. Small waters

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.199
are ideal for fishing from tubes.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.679
Mike Groenewold of Lincoln, NE, and I are
old college buddies. This week, we teamed

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.839
up and fly-fished a watershed lake in northcentral
Kansas our favorite way – using float tubes.

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.120
Catching enough crappies and bluegills for
one big shore lunch, we spent several days

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.539
devoted to our main mission: hawg largemouths.
And in a two-day window of good weather, they

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.329
didn’t disappoint us.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.289
Using five-weight fly rods, we probed the
shorelines with hand-tied flies that resembled

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:11.190
minnows. Stripping chartreuse Clouser patterns
on size 4 hooks, we caught most of the fish

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.530
about four feet deep. Water temperature was
only 60 degrees, about 10 degrees colder than

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.580
normal for this time of year. So a slow presentation
worked best.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.430
Float tubes are perfect for working in and
around submerged trees and stickups, since

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.780
the angler can quietly maneuver into perfect
position for casting. Heavy chest waders helped

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
us stay warm and dry during the two days we
spent fishing.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.860
You have to experience the fight of a bass
on a flyrod from water level to understand

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.940
it. The thrill can hook you for life. Long,
powerful surges by a fighting bass sometimes

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.740
take the rod tip completely underwater. And
jumps are spectacular, sometimes allowing

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.200
a fish to throw the hook and get away.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.420
Caught fish are sometimes lipped from a float
tube. Using the long rod as a lever, a bass

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.510
can be pulled close enough to grab by the
jaw. But that can be risky. It’s easy to

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.450
drop a slippery fish, or to bump it off the
hook while reaching. A small landing net can

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.840
help avoid a last-second disappointment.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.079
We caught bass bigger than 6 pounds, making
lifelong memories. Fish in the 3-4 pound range

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:35.510
were common on this trip. We had to work for
them, but we probably caught 50 between us

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.980
in two days.
We released all the bass to fight again.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.209
That kind of fishing is unforgettable, and
keeps you thinking about the next opportunity

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.790
for float tube flyfishing for big bass in
Kansas. Try it and see for yourself this year.
