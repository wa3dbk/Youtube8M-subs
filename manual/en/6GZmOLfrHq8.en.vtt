00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.820
Robocop, Star Trek, and many other sci-fi classics

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.660
have focused on the concept of the bionic eye.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.140
This fictional technology artificially provides its blind user with a sense of sight.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.500
Though different in execution, the bionic eyes in these stories all seem to scan the electromagnetic spectrum

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.260
creating a visual input that transmits into the brain through the optic nerves.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.600
Though this may seem like purely science fiction,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.000
we have found a company that is making the bionic eye scientific fact.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.580
I want you to imagine for a moment you are blind.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500
Some are born this way,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180
others lose their vision because of a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700
The innovative company Second Sight

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.460
has a retinal prosthesis system called the Argus II

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.860
that is intended to provide electrical stimulation of the retina

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.780
to induce visual preception to the blind by bypassing the damaged cells in the retina.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.900
The people here at Second Sight were nice enough to walk me through a demo

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.820
of their awesome technology

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.100
but first I'd like to throw a little trivia at you:

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.220
Answer correctly below or tweet us @ForgeApollo #BionicEye

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.020
and you may find yourself on a future episode of Technium.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.020
Which Star Trek character was able to perceive the world in a similar way to Geordi La Forge?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.520
I am here with Mr.Dwayne Setsui from Second Sight

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.020
and he's going to be giving us a demo of the Argus II

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.940
It all starts off with the implant

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.000
The implant consists of a set of electronics

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.940
that is actually attached to the outside of the eye

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.840
with a cable that's inserted into the eye and its attached to the retina.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.480
The glasses contain the camera

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.100
that actually captures the scene.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.660
So, whatever the camera captures

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.900
the image is sent down to our video processing unit that the patient wears on their belt.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.780
The VPU then converts these video images into electrical signals and sends them back to the glasses.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.680
The coil on the glasses sends the signals wirelessly to the implant.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.940
The implant then sends out small pulses of electricity to the retina.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.600
These pulses stimulate the retina and the resulting signals travel along the optic nerve to the brain

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.920
where they are perceived as patterns of light.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.200
Over time users learn how to interrupt these visual patterns

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.720
as objects and shapes.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.760
This is a simulator one.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.920
It gives the closest representation to what a patient would actually see.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
It's only black and white, its not color

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.220
and its somewhat pixelated, little bit blurry

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.920
because it does not give perfect sight.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.960
It allows you to see shapes,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.840
contrasts.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.860
So if you look at things such as this black square

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.760
on a white background, you should be able to see that fairly clearly.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.200
Like Geordi La Forge's visor, the Argus II has proved it is possible to provide an artificial form of vision.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.760
During the use of this system, some patients were able to locate lights,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.260
and windows, follow lines in a cross walk, and avoid running into things as they we walking.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.240
Some patients were even able to sort laundry or

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.540
determine where other people were located in a room.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.380
And some reported seeing lights and motion after being blind for many years.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.640
Patients have even been able to see large letters.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.060
Oh, its a 'T'.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.640
Yeah.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.540
It doesn't get perfect vision but it does give enough to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.680
where they can identify objects, and see things, and gain greater mobility.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.680
In addition to Second Sight, NASA is in development of a visual prosthesis called

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.240
the Joint Optical Reflective Display

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.140
JORDY - unofficially named after Star Trek's Geordi La Forge.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.000
Sci-fi full circle? Mind blown.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.260
