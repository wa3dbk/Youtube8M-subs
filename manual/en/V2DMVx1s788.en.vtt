Daniel Ghita

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:20.007
Q: You have made it to the Final 16, so how do you feel?

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:59.270
A: I feel happy to have made it here, but I am not so happy with my opponent as I will have a very strong fight against Semmy Schilt.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:17.429
Q: When you were offered Semmy, how did you feel?

00:01:17.429 --> 00:02:01.575
A: I feel good. To be the Champion you have to fight with the Champion, and that is really Semmy Schilt. It will be a special fight.

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:40.788
Q: Did you think your first time in the Final 16 would be against a champion?

00:02:40.788 --> 00:03:44.044
A: Well, after the tournament I had to fight against someone strong like Semmy. He was unbeatable for 3 years, but K-1 wanted me to fight against him so I accepted.

00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:51.798
Q: Did not you feel they were being kind of tough?

00:03:51.798 --> 00:04:25.750
A: Yeah, he is a very strong fighter. I have only one option, and that is to fight. So I will do my best.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:43.558
Q: I guess you have never fought against someone as tall as Semmy, so how will you handle it.

00:04:43.558 --> 00:06:00.273
A: I have never fought anyone as tall or with legs as long as Semmy. And I must be careful of his maegeri, and his left jab and not let them touch me .

00:06:00.273 --> 00:06:20.928
Q: When exactly was it that you used to be part of the Secret Service. When did you start there?

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:44.044
A: From 2001 and finished in 2008.

00:06:44.044 --> 00:07:02.594
Q: I guess it was very dangerous work. Did you every have any dangerous situations?

00:07:02.594 --> 00:07:06.627
A: Nothing much.
