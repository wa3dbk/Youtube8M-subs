Hello, this is JB and I am an employee here
at Austin Homebrew Supply in beautiful Austin,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:15.549
Texas. And today we are discussing wine equipment.
Now, right now I want to talk a little bit

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.850
about your choice of bottles. Once your wine
is complete, and done fermenting, ready to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.000
go into bottles, now you have to choose what
kind of bottle am I going to us. Am I going

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.910
to use a half size, am I going to use a full
size. Your choices of bottles vary quite a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.960
bit. The three basic decisions that you have
to make are this. Do I want a three hundred

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.700
seventy-five milliliter bottle? Do I want
a seven hundred and fifty milliliter traditional

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.629
sized wine bottle, or do I want a double size
one and a half liter bottle. This is a half

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:06.229
size, this is a standard size, and this is
a double size. Really, to me it all comes

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.979
down to how much do I want to serve at any
one setting. If I have a really special wine,

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.710
say a port wine, say one of our raspberry
chocolate port wines for instance, more than

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.759
likely I'm going to put it into a small bottle,
because it's such intense, rich wine, you

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.859
really, unless you have four or five people,
honestly, you probably wouldn't get through

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.209
a whole seven hundred and fifty milliliter
bottle, which is standard size, so. Small

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:45.779
ones for rich, intense special wines, middle
sized bottles for most of your standard wines,

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:50.380
and maybe a bigger bottle for a table wine
you're going to have at a party or a family

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.029
get together or something like that. So with
that being said, here's a few different choices

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:02.770
on your selection of, you know, what kind
of vessel am I going to put my finished wine

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.259
into.
