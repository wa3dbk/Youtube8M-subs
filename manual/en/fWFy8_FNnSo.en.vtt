00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.160
hello friends

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.200
in today's episode it will see how to
control

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.280
white flies white flies are white

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.320
colored insects that feed on your plants

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.140
and are really a menace in your garden
because they carry diseases

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.170
the first method will see it to get rid
of white lies

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.850
is to just use water

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.850
this hibiscus
plant was infested with white flies

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.460
and all I did was just uses a water
hose

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.810
and just hosed it down made sure all
the white flies from

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.900
the plant were removed and the underside of
the leaves were the most affected

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.320
so make sure that when you're using this
method make sure you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.830
check all the underside of the leaves
and then use

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.020
a hose and water to just spray down

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.540
and remove all the whitefly
larvae eggs

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.700
as well as the white flies themselves

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.900
this method works great when you have a large

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.930
area that's infected for example this
hibiscus plant was

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.130
pretty much all infested with white
flies 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.359
now sometimes you might have leaves 
that are very infested with white flies

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.429
eggs as well as larvae as well as
the white flies themselves

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.010
so its easiest to just toss them out and
throw them

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.380
the second method that will see today to
control white flies

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.800
is to use a yellow sticky trap now
this method works really well

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.090
because white flies get attracted to
the yellow color

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.340
and the go towards it and get stuck

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.360
and it works great for

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.530
all your vegetable crops and it does
really a good job because

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.270
it not only captures whiteflies but can
also capture aphids

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.320
so as you can see here I've tied this

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.979
yellow sticky traps next to my tomato
plants

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.310
and by making sure that white flies are
not around

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.100
you can ensure healthy vegetables that
are growing on your plants

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.720
without any diseases 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.320
Now the problem with
the white flies is that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.900
they carry diseases from one plant to the
other

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.480
and really infest your garden very quickly

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.460
so this yellow sticky trap works really
well for this purpose

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.780
And the final method we will be seeing today

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
is
by using a product called

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.670
Castile soap this product is made by
dr bronners

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.550
and is available for a pretty cheap
price

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.060
to use the Castile soap, you first need the
product itself

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.110
which is natural and organic

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.250
very safe to use in your garden and you
also need

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.700
to use a sprayer like this and which you
will be mixing the soap

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.990
so what you basically do is open up your
sprayer

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.450
and then add about a tablespoon of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.000
this Castile soap you don't need to be
very perfect with it just

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.320
an iron to a bar a tablespoon and then

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.370
add some water very slowly you do not
want to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.330
create a lot of froth in the your sprayer

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.020
before you spray

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.370
see some aphids that have infested 
this kohlrabi plant

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.860
and this method is the same whether
you're using it for white lies or aphids

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.420
the castile soap works very well

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.640
and as you can see we are spraying all
over

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.239
this plant using the Castile oil soap
spray

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.980
its pretty easy you spray thoroughly and this
takes care of most of the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.780
soft-bodied insects like whiteflies and
aphids

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.420
so I hope you liked this episode and I'd
like to know from your YouTubers

garden

or maybe other soft-bodied insects

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.189
