There goes another space-time rupture. If I make a statistical analysis of their vector

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.440
trajectories I may be able to predict-- Wait stop. You know what I predict? What sir? You

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.440
will NEVER get laid without SERRRIIIOUS help. SUPERF***ERS! [music] Hey! Look! In the window!  I think

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.759
I see somebody's elbow.  Is it Jack Krak? JACK! LET ME JOIN THE TEAM!!!  No... I think...

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.279
It's Princess Sunshine... Her elbow is so
beautiful... OH! OooH! OH! Oooooh...

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.280
I think I'm gonna pee!  Oh, I better hurry! I... Sunshine! What are you doing? I'm teasing

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.319
the losers outside with my elbow. It's just so EASY!  Oh, be nice to those boys. It's

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.329
not their fault-- You're just jealous because YOU'VE got UGLY elbows.  Whatever!

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.329
I have to pee! Hey, Grotessa. You're too
late, baby! I already put away my... Rooster

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.590
rod! Get the flork out of the bathroom! I have to tinkle!  Geez! Pushy!  AAH!!!

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.590
Jack! You peed all over EVERYTHING! That's just my wild style! I pee wild and free!

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.930
Jack, you asshole! Why didn't you use YOUR bathroom?!?! HUH?
You gotta be f***in' kidding, pudding! My

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.000
bathroom is goddamn ding dong disgusting! Fine. I'll sprinkle my tinkle in the sinkle. But

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.510
someone needs to do something before we run
out of clean places to pee.  HUH?!? But

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.960
that's impossible! We're doomed!
We doomed again? That sucks. I know! What

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.710
is it this time?  All the toilets are ruined, so Grotessa's peeing in the sink!  Uh,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.760
actually, now I'm pooping.  Cool. No! It's not cool!!! What if I have to pee again?!?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.470
What if I get the "feeling"?!?&nbsp;I... I
do! Oh! I already do!! I have to PEE again

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.470
RIGHT AWAY! Aaaahahaaa! I'll be RIGHT BACK! Hey! Stay out of my room! Oh, hey, Grotessa!

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.989
Are you done? When you're done, I'll help wipe for you, no problem. 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 Shut the f*** up, Ultra Richard!  Hey, everybody! I have an announcement! Meet our new recruit! 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.430
Hi, I'm Computer Fist! WOW! I'm so excited!
I found this dude outside-- Thank you

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:33.950
for this amazing opportunity. I didn't think-- SHUT UP!! FLORK! The important thing is, we'll

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.389
never have to clean a toilet again. Thank you. Thank you. From now on, we can just piss

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.439
and sh*t on this guy! Meatballs!  Don't worry... we're not literally going to pee

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.219
on you.  I know... ha ha ha...  YES WE ARE!  No, we're not.&nbsp;You can clean the

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.459
toilets, though. &nbsp; Jack Krak is the motherf***er and the motherf***er pisses where he wants!

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.129
 I... I'm just so HAPPY... I... I want to... SIIIIIING!

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:08.129
[music] I've been waiting for this moment all my life...  To get SH*T on!  For the chance to spread my wings and

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.349
truly FLY...  CLEANING TOILETS! Life is just a dance... sometimes you gotta take a

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.349
chance! I've been waiting for this moment... ALL MY LIFE!  Quit moving around so much.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.189
 Yeah! I've got "THE FEELING"!

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.569
Frederator!

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.029
Jack Krak is the motherf***er!
