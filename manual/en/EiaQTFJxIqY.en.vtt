00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.132
I'm willing to argue that
the cutest thing you're

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:03.980
going to see all week
is the tardigrade.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.612
Every day, NASA posts an
astronomy picture of the day.

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.070
And if you're not
following it, you

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.612
should be because
every day you could

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:12.360
be getting awesome pictures of
stars and galaxies and planets

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.370
and, last week, a tardigrade.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.308
Oh.

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.600
So Popsci picked up this
picture, and before I knew it,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.150
I was lost in a sea of
Google Images of tardigrades,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.250
and I decided that I just
had to talk about them.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.333
Now I need to get over the
cuddly, adorable factor

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.660
for just a second so that I
can talk about these really

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.340
awesome polyextremophiles.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.440
Also known as water
bears, these little guys,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.800
most only 1/4 to 1/2
millimeter long are plentiful.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.810
And there are over
700 known species

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.210
which can be found in
both salt and freshwater.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540
They like to live in moss
or at the bottoms of lakes.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.290
And they spend much
of their time munching

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.820
on bacteria and plant life.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.500
Now, I love this
description of them

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
from a 2002 issue
of Cell Biology--

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
"Under a microscope,
a tardigrade

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.210
looks a lot like a c. elegans
in which someone has deviously

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.240
expressed drosophila leg genes."

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.690
That is the most scientisty way
of saying that something looks

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.065
like a chubby worm with legs.

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.690
Now I mentioned before
that tardigrades

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.740
are polyextremophiles.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.240
And what I mean by
this is that they

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.850
can withstand many
extreme conditions--

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.570
extreme heat, extreme cold,
extreme pressures, freezing,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.700
radiation, and even dehydration.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500
They've been found in
boiling hot springs

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.570
and under layers
of Himalayan ice.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.300
They can withstand temperatures
from negative 328 degrees

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.673
Fahrenheit to 300
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.340
And they can withstand pressures
6,000 times that of the Earth's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.305
atmosphere.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.430
And they can withstand
about 1,000 times the amount

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.230
of radiation that
would kill a human.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.860
Tardigrades are such bamphs,
that they can withstand space.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.740
And I don't mean in tiny little
tardigrade astronaut suits.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.200
I mean they can be out
there with nothing,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.170
in the solar wind, subzero
temperatures, and vacuum

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.100
of space.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.190
In 2007, dehydrated
tardigrades were exposed

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.327
to outer space for 10 days--

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:51.660
10 days-- and when they came
back down to earth and were

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.690
rehydrated, not only did
some of them survive,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.430
but they went on to reproduce--

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.320
bamphs.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.773
So how do tardigrades do it?

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:02.190
Why are they so
good at surviving?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.508
And what can we learn from it?

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:05.550
So it seems that most of
their survivalist skills

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.680
come from their
ability to dehydrate.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.240
When stressed, they can curl up
into tiny balls known as tuns.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.990
And they can drop their
metabolic activity

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.330
to about point 0.01% of normal--

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.770
practically nothing.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.330
The tardigrades
also produce a sugar

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.520
known as trehalose
which helps to protect

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.010
their cells, organelles,
and membranes by suspending

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740
everything in a gel-like medium.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.240
Tardigrades have been shown to
stay in that dehydrated state

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.260
for up to 10 years.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.173
But when reintroduced to water
and favorable conditions,

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:33.840
they can rehydrate
and be back to normal

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.250
in just a couple of minutes.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.190
This dehydrated state is
known as anhydrobiosis.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.980
And along with cryobiosis, the
state in which the tardigrade

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.830
can withstand freezing, it
falls under the broad category

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.028
of dormancies known
as cryptobiosis.

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:47.820
Scientists hope to one
day take the lessons

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.910
that they learn from
tardigrade stress response

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.150
to develop techniques
to help other organisms,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.840
including humans, deal
with extreme conditions.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.490
Now about a month
ago, I tweeted this.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.907
And a couple of you replied
that there are actually people

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:00.290
making stuffed tardigrades.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.770
And I mean, if you know someone
with a birthday coming up

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.520
and you were thinking
of what to get them,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.410
I think a stuffed tardigrade--

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.190
perfect present.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.990
Now, someone also
responded with a link

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.630
to this video of a
tardigrade swimming in time

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.120
to "Shut Up and Let Me
Go" by the Ting Tings.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.250
And guys, if you're
having a bad day,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.320
just go click on that
video because it's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.100
awesome and almost as good
as swimming sloth videos--

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.110
almost.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.140
Go Forth.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.645
Do science.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.380
All right.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.505
Now, this video is about
to take a sharp right turn

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:38.750
into historical storytelling.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.930
So hold onto your pipettes
and your ear buds.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.580
Now anhydrobiosis
is not something

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.230
that we have
recently discovered.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.000
In fact, it's first
recorded observation

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.245
was in 1702 by Anton
van Leeuwenhoek.

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:50.620
Now, if his name
sounds familiar,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.287
that's because he's
often referred to as

00:03:52.287 --> 00:03:53.860
the father of microbiology.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.350
And he made great strides
in improving the microscope

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.940
and was the first
person to describe

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.320
single-celled organisms.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.355
Now, he called these
little guys animalcules.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:02.980
And at the age of
70, he wrote a letter

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.700
to the Royal Society entitled,
"On Certain Animalcules Found

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.927
in the Sediments in Gutters
of the Roofs of Houses."

00:04:08.927 --> 00:04:11.260
Now, I'm actually going to
read you a little bit of what

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.660
he wrote because I
feel like paraphrasing

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.280
Leeuwenhoek would be a crime.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.170
"I have often placed
the animalcules

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.140
I have before described
out of the water,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.320
not leaving the quantity of
a grain of sand adjoining

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.660
to them, in order
to see whether, when

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.030
all the water about
them was evaporated

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.270
and they were exposed to air,
their bodies would burst,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.120
as I had often seen
in other animalcules.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.780
But now I found that when almost
all the water was evaporated

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.540
so that the creature could no
longer be covered with water,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.760
nor move itself
as usual, it then

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.890
contracted itself
into an oval figure

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.500
and in that state remained.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.080
Nor could I perceive that
the moisture evaporated

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.230
from its body, for it
preserved its oval and round

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.970
shape unhurt.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.820
In order to more fully satisfy
myself in this respect,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.790
on the 3rd of September,
about 7 in the morning,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.730
I took some of this dry
sediment, which I had taken out

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.890
of the leaden gutter
and had stood almost two

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.290
days in my study and
put a little of it

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.170
into two separate
glass tubes, wherein

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.960
I poured some rainwater which
had been boiled and afterwards

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.070
cooled.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.690
As soon as I poured
on the water,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.660
I stirred the whole about
that the sediment which,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.670
by means of the
hairs in it seemed

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.610
to adhere like a solid
body, might the sooner

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.200
be mixed with the water.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.390
And when it had settled to
the bottom of the glass,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.810
I examined it and perceived
some of the animalcules lying

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.730
closely heaped together.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.910
In a short time afterwards, they
began to extend their bodies.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.890
And in half an hour, at
least a hundred of them

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.925
were swimming about the
glass, though the whole

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:42.550
of the sediment which
I had put into it

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.990
did not, in my judgment, exceed
the weight of two grains.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.880
The preceding kinds
of experiment I

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.945
had many times repeated
with the same success.

00:05:51.945 --> 00:05:54.070
And in particular, with
some of this sediment which

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.920
had been kept in my
study about five months,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.960
and upon pouring on
it rainwater which

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.290
had been boiled and afterwards
cooled, I saw in a few hours

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.800
time many of the animalcules
before described.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.330
And if, after being so long in
a dry state, these animalcules

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.480
upon water being given to
them can unfold their bodies

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.800
and move about in
the usual manner,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.000
we may conclude that
in many places, where

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.870
in summertime the waters
stagnate and at length dry up,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.930
there may be many kinds
of animalcules which,

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.180
though not originally
in those waters,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.320
may be carried thither by
waterfowl in the water or mud

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.080
adhering to their
feet or feathers."

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.590
Now, that letter is
over 300 years old.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.040
And that moment of
observed discovery

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.050
is still so cool to me today.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.420
And it's so cool
that we can read that

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.180
and read his original
words and experience

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.590
that excitement with him.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.110
Now, it's most likely that the
animals that Leeuwenhoek saw

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.250
were rotifers.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.790
But it is also possible that
his samples contained protozoa,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.870
nematodes, and tardigrades.
