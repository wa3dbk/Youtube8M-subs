00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:14.323
Round 1

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:22.501
First event for the athletic meet is popping the balloons.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:30.821
Bengi tried to go in to the other team by himself,
and almost got himself killed.

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:35.687
Bengi and Coach Park attacked each other at the same time,
but Bengi is the only one who died.

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:45.816
Meanwhile, MaRin dies as his balloon unties by itself.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:01:01.562
Bengi watches the game as he died in the early round of the game.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:02:19.743
Coach Kim unconsciously kills his own teammate, soO.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:25.300
Green team Impact dies by Paralyze as he had to fight
against 4 members of the Blue team.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.179
He killed me!

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.608
T.Ca : If you guys protect Coach Kim, then you guys
will do a good job.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:43.433
soO : He is the one who killed me! Why would I protect him.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:49.721
T.Ca : At least he is good at running around.
soO : He killed me. Him being good at running isn't the point!

00:02:49.721 --> 00:03:05.884
Because Faker is precious

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:11.512
Coach Kim helps Faker with tying the balloon,
and PiccaBoo picks up the popped balloons. There are many people who help out Faker.

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:15.911
Impact Effect

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:22.727
In the first match, green team showed no sportsmanship.
Therefore, the others teams made their balloons small.

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:31.964
Impact : Wow, Wolf.
Easyhoon : Are you crazy, Wolf?

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:40.487
MaRin : You and Bang have the same size.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:53.246
Because everyone blew their balloons small,
everyone agreed to blow balloons bigger than ParalyzE.

00:03:53.246 --> 00:04:06.503
Impact, who has small lung capacity, brought a mess to the game.

00:04:06.503 --> 00:04:10.557
Coach Choi : We have to make a tactic.
Faker : send all the blues!

00:04:10.557 --> 00:04:16.764
Coach Choi : You(Bang) is too fat, you(Soo) is kinda fat.
PiccaBoo is too big, and I'm a fatty. So~

00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:20.502
Coach Choi : So, 4 of us will run toward them and you
step on their balloons.

00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:37.762
Coach Choi decided to protect Faker with 4 big guys.

00:04:37.762 --> 00:05:05.384
Red team's tactic disappeared as everyone went
to different places.

00:05:05.384 --> 00:05:23.111
Meanwhile, Bengi, again, goes to the other team and got
caught by the opponents.

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:30.598
Wolf cheers as he got Coach Choi's balloon.

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:53.028
Impact : Out!
Faker : One is gone!
Impact : There's no green!

00:05:53.028 --> 00:06:18.740
Coach Choi : Go in, Bang. Get the yellow!
Bang : Go?
Coach Choi : Yellow is blocked! Go in fast.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.977
Yellow team and Red team have 4 survivors each.
The round ends as a tie game.

00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:35.055
Clueless Coach Choi

00:06:35.055 --> 00:06:38.062
Coach Choi : I think I stepped by myself. It was already popped.

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:42.675
The video tells that Coach Park popped Coach Choi's balloon!

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:47.114
Person who forgot the past

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:53.799
Impact : Can't step on the balloon.
Coach Kim : Bang, that size is speechless.
Impact :  How can you pop Bang's balloon.

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:58.787
Impact : You have to step like this to pop Bang's balloon...

00:06:58.787 --> 00:06:59.570
Impact : Bang has zero sportsmanship!

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:08.370
Green team already forgot about the Round 1.
