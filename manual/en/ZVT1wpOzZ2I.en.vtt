00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:03.136
It's starting another The Moustache In The Kitchen 
and I wanted to make another fatty thing,

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:07.497
Dani decided, I wanted to make onion ring and 
she chose Apple ring.

00:00:07.497 --> 00:00:10.570
Apple rings. Actually, it's a fatty recipe too, 
so don't complain about it. But it has apple.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.649
So it helps the kids to eat apples, look how nice.

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:20.632
It's good against kidney stone and it's 
good because you learn about the fairytales,

00:00:20.632 --> 00:00:24.840
the apple with the witch, all this ritualistic and medieval thing.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.982
If you're thinking about giving an apple to
your teacher on Teachers day,

00:00:29.982 --> 00:00:34.591
give her a caramelized apple. No, this is if you 
want to... have sex with her.

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:36.034
Oh is it? Who told you that?

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:39.985
Caramelized apple is that you want to have sex. Nobody 
loves without wanting to have sex.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:43.942
And does it need an apple for that? I don't know. 
Why people give an apple on Teachers day?

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:46.452
I don't know. Is just to be nice with the 
teacher.

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:50.910
But do you think it's related to the paradise's myth? Let's see.
You, that are christian, you gonna eat naked.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.448
You, that are pagan, you gonna eat for the witch.

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:57.339
Well, so today we're going to make apple rings.

00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:02.535
The Moustache In the Kitchen

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.867
Well, this recipe is from a website called fortunegoods.com

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.213
What?

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:12.680
Fortunegoods.com. I'll leave the link right down, so you can go there because there are other delicious recipes.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.271
Fortune goods is like treats of fortune. 
Yes, something like that.

00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.124
So take a look there because the other recipes are very
tasty

00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:22.162
and we're going to make one of them today.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:27.177
First thing: we'll make almost like a pancake batter, 
so you're expert on that.

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:32.602
No, no, it doesn't begin by the dry ingredients. First, the wet. 
Always, always, because what do the wet ingredients do?

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:35.109
They leave the mixture liquid.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:41.199
It's the preliminary of the kitchen, got it? You leave it wet 
so then add the dry. People want to know

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:45.774
how do break an egg with just one hand that Nina taught you? I don't know if I'll... an egg!

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:51.133
1 cup of buttermilk. We don't have it, unfortunately, 
but you can click here and learn how to make

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:56.803
a buttermilk. But I'm very practical today so we're going
to use yogurt.

00:01:56.803 --> 00:02:00.592
It's the bacon for who is on a diet.

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.272
Who is the guy who invented to combine egg and
yogurt? It's very curious but it's always good.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:11.283
So try it. Ok, ok, I won't try it because

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:16.923
I don't want! No, it's raw egg! Hum, I can eat this like this. 
How do you color this egg?

00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:21.385
2 tablespoons of sugar. Is this brown sugar?
It's organic sugar.

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:23.701
I'm going to use the Ana Maria Braga's egg.

00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.016
It's an organic egg.

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:26.456
And what about the yogurt? Is it organic?

00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:27.497
No, it's not.

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:28.218
So it's no use.

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:29.626
1/4 teaspoon of salt.

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:30.789
It's a pinch.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.363
Yes, in this case you're right.

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:33.873
A little bit more than that, love.

00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:35.411
So it's 2 big pinches.

00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:39.087
His pinch is small because all his fingers are fat,
and he takes the salt like this...

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:41.972
It doesn't make sense, you always say that. 
If my finger is fat, I can take more salt.

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:45.674
You can't, because when you press you don't
take enough, got it?

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:47.703
If it's three fat fingers they'll take more.

00:02:47.703 --> 00:02:50.526
Look, but there's less salt around them. 
Look how much there's in my pinch.

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.415
But it's not in this space you have to look at!

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:54.293
Of course it is!

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:55.118
I'm telling you my pinch is bigger.

00:02:55.398 --> 00:02:58.881
1/8 teaspoon of cinnamon.

00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:00.007
I don't work with this kind of number.

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:03.780
These american recipes are amazing but
we have 1/8 of spoon here.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.587
You must be kidding me.

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.219
It's a pinch, do you want to see?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.822
No, it's not. It's more than a pinch.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:13.399
1/4 teaspoon of baking powder.

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.337
Do we have 1/4?

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:16.410
Yes we do. Everybody has this at home.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.425
1/4 teaspoon of... It's just the tip of the spoon, right?

00:03:19.425 --> 00:03:20.681
Yes.

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.463
Mix a little bit...

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.850
I'll make a cake for youuu

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:33.991
With baking powder, flour, this egg... 
Ok, and now?

00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:36.941
Now, 1 cup of flour â€“ wait because it needs to sift.

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.111
The chorus is Gustavo Lima and you.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:43.211
Think about it. Reflect.

00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.933
Reflect right down and comment what you think about this.

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:47.189
It's a song to make babies, isn't it?

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.417
How can someone make babies with a song like this, love?
I wouldn't make babies with this song.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.918
Now mix everything.

00:03:54.017 --> 00:04:00.038
Alright, now that the batter is ready and the oil is warming,
you'll slice this apple like this:

00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:01.327
on the opposite.

00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:02.586
Like a... On the opposite?

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:03.558
On the opposite.

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:04.691
Good use of the english.

00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:05.251
Isn't it?

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.614
Now I know how to do, look.

00:04:06.614 --> 00:04:12.607
You made slices and now remove the center
with the seeds and after this

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:17.165
cut in two, so you'll have a big and a small ring.

00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:20.327
My goodness! Hold on. Hold on!

00:04:20.327 --> 00:04:22.309
This knife is not sharpened

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:23.568
Baby, don't you sharpen your knives?

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:25.012
I do, but they come back to normal.

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.646
Now you take a cuter like this. You can make 
lots of this at once.

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:34.337
But it will loose too much...

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:39.761
No, it's just the seeds. Now you use another 
one and we'll make two rings,

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.056
a big one...

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:43.277
One with peel and the other one peeled.

00:04:43.277 --> 00:04:44.533
Yes, to use the maximum.

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:49.641
You can also use a big cup and a "shot" cup 
to make them.

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:52.969
Who has ear reamer can use it too.

00:04:57.044 --> 00:04:58.642
Wait a minute. Pause, pause.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.345
And what about now?

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.155
Fry!

00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:05.049
Just throw here?

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:05.471
No!

00:05:05.845 --> 00:05:09.523
Now is just take the apples, pass them in the batter and fry.

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:15.211
Why do I have to stay right beside the frying pan?

00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.467
I am also beside the frying pan!

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.627
And do you accept the splashes?

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:23.140
Bring me the frier!

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:29.160
There's all a technique... The big one breaks easily.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.162
It's is a technique which I don't know what is, but 
it must have a technique.

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:36.079
I would use a brush. If I were a japanese guy
I would use a brush.

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:40.738
How do you think the japanese can make delicate
things? Being rudes? No, they use brushes.

00:05:40.738 --> 00:05:42.898
I think I'm gonna make my first one with the japanese style.

00:05:42.898 --> 00:05:47.610
Well, while they fry, you make a mixture of 
sugar and cinnamon so after they're cold

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.869
you can roll them on it.

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.007
Put one in my mouth so I can try.

00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:55.636
Can I try?

00:05:57.515 --> 00:06:01.245
The little ones are the best. They're more crunchy.

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:06.197
The other one is less crunchy, but it's also good.
Because not everything in life has to be crunchy.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:13.347
Bloody hell!

00:06:13.347 --> 00:06:16.167
Do you see? I told you savory food hurts.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:17.671
This isn't savory!

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.934
But is the principle of savory food, because
who would fry a cake?

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:24.876
Can we fry a communion wafer?

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:26.445
A communion wafer breaded...

00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:27.478
Is the communion wafer baked?

00:06:27.478 --> 00:06:29.044
It's the flesh of Christ, isn't it?

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:32.036
If you're vegetarian, you cannot eat a communion wafer.

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:35.837
Because is the flesh of Christ. And neither drink wine, 
which is his blood.

00:06:35.837 --> 00:06:39.612
If you eat a communion wafer and drink wine, you are 
almost the Christ in other words.

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:44.705
Now guess how many apple rings Paulo ate from the
beginning until now?

00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.338
Just guess.

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:49.002
How many rings do you think I ate? Write down here.

00:06:49.002 --> 00:06:51.228
Nutritionists never see this. Why don't they talk with us?

00:06:51.228 --> 00:06:53.241
Half of chocolate, half of fruit.

00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.773
My nutritionist only talked about the chocolate.

00:06:54.773 --> 00:06:57.809
Well, so this is a very "family recipe" or for you to
eat with your friends,

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.972
because it needs a lot of people to make, don't you think?

00:07:00.972 --> 00:07:01.719
And to eat, too.

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:02.684
Actually it needs 2.

00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:04.173
How many whisks for this recipe?

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:04.685
Two.

00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:06.524
Again? But why two?

00:07:06.524 --> 00:07:07.344
Do you think it should be one?

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:08.035
Obviously!

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:10.802
But for you... One for Dani and two for me.

00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:12.435
A blue gradient.

00:07:14.348 --> 00:07:15.771
I think it's delicious, very good.

00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:17.088
Amazing.

00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:18.374
It's soft inside.

00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.231

Just one in your mouth, love?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.574
This thing is the size of a dental arch.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
