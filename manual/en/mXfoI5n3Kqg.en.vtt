00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.410
Today I’m going to show you how to replace
the hard drive in your Mac Book Pro.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.780
You have two options: one is you can keep
the same type of hard drive that’s in there

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.679
now and just increase the capacity of it;
this is the cheaper option.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.079
Or you can upgrade to an SSD or a solid state
drive.

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.990
The SSD’s are a little bit more expensive,
but your computer will boot in half the time,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.360
the programs will load faster, there are no
moving parts so your battery will last longer

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.090
inside of your laptop, they run cooler, and
they can also run quieter.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.840
I will link both hard drives down in the video
description below.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.840
As always, it’s your choice, I’m just
here to show you how it’s done.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.880
After you pick which drive you want, you have
to move all of your stuff over from one drive

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
to the other.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.930
This is called cloning the drive.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.800
It will keep all of your files, all of your
programs, all of your homework, all of your

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.940
music; everything will still be there when
you clone the drive.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
I personally use a program called Super Duper,
but you can also use a program called Carbon

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Copy Cloner.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.649
Both of them do about the same thing.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.070
Just download the program, plug your new hard
drive into your computer, and then do the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.070
clone.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.699
It will probably take, you know, about 45
minutes to a couple hours, depending on how

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.940
much stuff you have on your hard drive to
transfer over.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.840
I’ll link the transferring cable, along
with the hard drives down in the video description

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.840
below as well.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
So let’s get started.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.150
Remember that you open your Mac Book Pro at
your own risk.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.390
There are 10 Phillips head screws located
around the back edge of the computer.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.040
So unscrew all of those and remove the back
panel.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.680
Then you have two screws that are holding
in the hard drive.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.390
They are connected to this little black bracket,
so set that off to the side somewhere safe.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.170
Pull up on the little tab and be super careful
right here.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.250
You want to unplug the hard drive so you don’t
damage that little ribbon cable that’s connecting

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.810
the plug to the hard drive.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.130
You can also see there’s some silver niblets
on the side of the hard drive.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.700
So unscrew those with a pentalobe screwdriver.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420
If you don’t have one of those, I will include
it in the video description.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.800
Transfer over the clear tab to your new hard
drive.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.840
I’m going with the Solid State Drive on
this computer just because of all the benefits

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.130
that it has.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.600
Screwing in those little pentalobe screws
on the side.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.061
And these just kind of hold the hard drive
in place after you plug it back in.

00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:01.930
It’s the same connector as the old hard
drive used.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.850
I’m going to put the little silver niblets
into the black bracket on that end piece and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.420
then just set it down into place, getting
that black bracket screwed down again.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.090
And then get those 10 screws back in place.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.090
That’s it.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.090
Thanks for watching.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.860
