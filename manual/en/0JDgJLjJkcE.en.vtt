00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.700
 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:17.800
Simply put, I like nature. I enjoy myself being surrounded by it.  I think nature knows a lot and can do just fine without us.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.500
Or maybe, it does it well despite the fact that we try to get involved  and try to be smart about it.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.800
I fall back on biological laws that have been functioning well  for tens of thousands of years.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:41.700
Our latest phase is that my wife and I created a family winery,  which we operate in my grandfather’s cellar.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.300
We try to run it without any intervention, which one might  interpret as being a case of lazy winemaking.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Our response to that is that we harvest the grapes, and bottle the wine,  the time in between is left to nature and our patience.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Basically, barrel ageing is the process during which our wines materialise.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.800
I strive for the grapes and the plants to feel good, so that the so-called  generative-vegetative balance can formulate in them.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.000
This means that there shouldn’t be more leaves than  necessary to create the bunches, the produce.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:34.700
Let’s say there is one bunch on a shoot and a shoot should be 14-leaves long.  This 14 leaves is enough to nurture and ripen a normal-sized bunch. This is the concept.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.200
This is what we are trying to formulate with the involvement of the plant,  in order that there should be the smallest amount of intervention and pesticides.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.200
And the reason for this is neither laziness nor money; we want the plants to feel good  because that’s when the fruit and the wine made from them will be delicious.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:07.500
It’s very important to decrease the compactness of the soil to the minimum  and to make the life of the soil richer and more blooming.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:18.000
Since the nutrition-absorbing capacity of the plant and other things depend on it.  And eventually the taste of the wine as well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.100
Curiosity plays a very important part in it. I’ve always been attracted by the seeking out of new things and the appreciation and respect of what I have found.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:45.400
What has occurred to me several times about a grape grower – who unfortunately, is a near extinct type of man – that he is a man with straight spine,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.900
he walks around with his head elevated and with open eyes.  While he knows his own abilities and is proud of them,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:08.100
he touches upon those things with adequate humbleness  about which he feels that he only cooperates with them as a guest.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
So we should respect the living creatures around us.
