00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:52.596
The poor people of southern Germany

00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:54.057
must have had quite a scare

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:55.977
when they heard those noises in the woods

00:00:55.977 --> 00:00:57.714
it's difficult to recognize

00:00:57.714 --> 00:01:00.323
but it was a Polo WRC

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:04.817
the Polo WRC is kind of a publicity thing

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:08.793
they gave the Polo GTI 220 HP

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:11.466
it's a nice idea

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.568
Volkswagen has joined the rally

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:15.474
so I understand the thought

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.846
but there was too little about this car

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.260
that was really 'Rally"

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.761
or had anything to do with Rallying

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.551
MTM thought, let's make one that does

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:29.253
that's what you heard earlier

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:31.431
it's the exhaust

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.654
and it is incredible

00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:37.730
I've never heard anything like it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.065
it's raw, loud and has pops and crackles

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:45.976
I hope you can hear this

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:48.016
but I took my foot off of the gas pedal

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:51.254
and this thing keeps popping for 30 seconds

00:01:51.254 --> 00:01:53.075
it's fantastic

00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:17.764
when VW built this car

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:21.083
they took the 2.0 TSI from the Golf GTI

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:24.649
they switched it with the 1.4

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.597
so it delivers 220 HP

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:31.195
MTM took this to 330 HP

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.022
which is a lot for such a small car

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:35.717
they also brought the torque up

00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:38.743
from 300nm to 420nm

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:42.228
and you really feel that

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.166
that means that the 0-100km/h time

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.711
went from 6.4 to 5.5 seconds

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:51.096
and the top speed is raised to 262 km/h

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:56.800
but it's mainly the experience that impresses

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.424
it's so fast and it has quite a lot of torque steer

00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:04.280
it has a lot of torque for such a small car

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:09.320
2nd gear

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:18.542
it's crazy and unreal and that makes it so much fun

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:21.098
it reminds me of the MTM A1 Nardo we drove

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:26.742
that had 500HP also FWD

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:28.724
that one was also quite wild

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:31.104
but this one is a little more aggressive

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.043
when you get to a corner

00:04:01.043 --> 00:04:06.935
you have to be in control

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:09.478
that's why they fitted a Limited Slip diff

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:11.419
there were some journalists who complained

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.690
that the Polo WRC was not drivable without one

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.262
so MTM thought let's make sure it's drivable

00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:23.022
even with 330HP

00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:27.523
and the exterior is cool as always at MTM

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:31.135
it looks like it's ready for the track

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.094
You immediately notice the black,

00:04:57.094 --> 00:04:59.795
18" nardo wheels from MTM

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:01.492
and behind that are immense brakes

00:05:01.492 --> 00:05:05.611
also from MTM, 330mm

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.877
then there's the KW springs and dampers

00:05:08.877 --> 00:05:14.656
It's quite difficult to drive this car

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:18.110
because it's wild and so powerful

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.677
the torque steer means that you

00:05:19.677 --> 00:05:21.062
really feel the power going through the wheels

00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:22.837
and you feel that the car is struggling

00:05:22.837 --> 00:05:27.491
but it is so satisfying when you drive this car

00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:33.164
because you are very concentrated, all the time

00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:41.055
and that makes this an incredible experience

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:49.863
All of those changes by MTM

00:05:49.863 --> 00:05:52.530
together with the base Polo WRC

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.933
with this great Alcantara steering wheel

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:56.596
great seats

00:05:56.596 --> 00:06:00.308
which are from the Golf V GTI I think

00:06:00.308 --> 00:06:03.947
It all comes together to form this very special car

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.512
it's all about the drive

00:06:06.512 --> 00:06:09.021
it can be tricky

00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.830
you have to pay attention

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:20.754
but when you do, it gives you something special in return

00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:24.745
and I love that

00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:27.835
and that's why we keep going to MTM

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:29.762
because they keep building cars like this

00:06:30.526 --> 00:06:33.957
and when you drive through these woods

00:06:33.957 --> 00:06:35.706
with those pops from the exhaust

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:40.689
which you hear from a mile away

00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:44.984
it really is something special
