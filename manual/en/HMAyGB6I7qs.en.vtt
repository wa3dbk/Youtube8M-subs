00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:09.433
The President:
In the end, it's our ideals, our
values, that built America --

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.666
values that allowed us to forge
a nation made up of immigrants

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:19.800
from every corner of the globe;
values that drive our citizens still.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.200
Every day, Americans meet
their responsibilities to their

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.000
families and their employers.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.400
Time and again, they lend a hand
to their neighbors and give back

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.066
to their country.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:38.900
They take pride in their labor,
and are generous in spirit.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.000
These aren't Republican values
or Democratic values that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
they're living by; business
values or labor values.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
They're American values.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.966
Unfortunately, too many of our
citizens have lost faith that

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:59.966
our biggest institutions --
our corporations, our media,

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:06.233
and yes, our government --
still reflect these same values.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.700
Each of these institutions are
full of honorable men and women

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.200
doing important work that
helps our country prosper.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.666
But each time a CEO rewards
himself for failure,

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.933
or a banker puts the rest of
us at risk for his own selfish

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:26.766
gain, people's doubts grow.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.700
Each time lobbyists game the
system or politicians tear each

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.533
other down instead of lifting
this country up, we lose faith.

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.566
The more that TV pundits
reduce serious debates to silly

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:47.266
arguments, big issues into sound
bites, our citizens turn away.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:51.066
No wonder there's so
much cynicism out there.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:57.100
No wonder there's so
much disappointment.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.400
I campaigned on the
promise of change --

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.066
change we can believe
in, the slogan went.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.433
And right now, I know there are
many Americans who aren't sure

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.100
if they still believe
we can change --

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.933
or that I can deliver.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:17.400
But remember this -- I never suggested that change would be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.866
easy, or that I
could do it alone.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:28.300
Democracy in a nation of 300
million people can be noisy and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.800
messy and complicated.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.000
And when you try to do big
things and make big changes,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400
it stirs passions
and controversy.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.100
That's just how it is.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.200
Those of us in public office
can respond to this reality by

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.033
playing it safe and avoid
telling hard truths and pointing fingers.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:55.766
We can do what's necessary to
keep our poll numbers high,

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:59.000
and get through the next
election instead of doing what's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.166
best for the next generation.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:08.366
But I also know this: if people
had made that decision 50 years

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:15.133
ago or 100 years ago
or 200 years ago,

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.233
we wouldn't be here tonight.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:22.533
The only reason we are here is
because generations of Americans

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.000
were unafraid to
do what was hard;

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.533
to do what was needed even
when success was uncertain;

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.800
to do what it took to keep the
dream of this nation alive for

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.600
their children and
their grandchildren.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.866
Now, our administration has had
some political setbacks this

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:51.200
year, and some of
them were deserved.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.033
But I wake up every day knowing
that they are nothing compared

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.633
to the setbacks that families
all across this country have

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:02.733
faced this year.

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:07.266
And what keeps me going --
what keeps me fighting --

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:10.100
is that despite
all these setbacks,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.400
that spirit of determination
and optimism --

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.633
that fundamental decency that
has always been at the core of

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:21.100
the American people
-- that lives on.
