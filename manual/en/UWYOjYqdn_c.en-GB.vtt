00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.880
BOTH: Hi, we're from New York,
and this is Small Talk.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.320
What's your favourite colour?

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.320
It's between blue...because I love the skylines,
when I look at the sky, and also...

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.640
..yellow. And i don't know why yellow,
I just like it.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.640
Were you naughty at school?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.080
I wasn't... Well, I was a little naughty at school,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.200
but I'm not saying you should be naughty at
school, I'm just saying I was a little bit.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.040
But...I did listen.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.280
How famous are you?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.520
I don't feel like I'm famous, because I'm just
the same old me, so I don't feel it.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.680
What's your favourite food?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.000
My favourite food is oxtail, rice and peas, or...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.240
fried chicken, collard greens and mash, or...

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.760
Or jerk chicken and fried dumpling,
or ackee and saltfish.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.160
Too many!

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.360
Who is your favourite rapper?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.960
My favourite rapper, erm...

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.720
it's very close between
Drake, Kendrick Lamar, uh...

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.800
J. Cole and Jay Z.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.480
What's the best goal you've scored?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.080
In the first-team environment, I'd probably
say the chip against West Brom,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.840
but when I was a kid, probably from 16,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.640
I scored a goal from the halfway line.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.040
So I'd probably say that was my best goal,
that I remember anyway.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.840
BOTH: Who's the best player
you've played against?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.040
I think direct opposition
would probably be Thiago Silva.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.800
What was your first car?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.800
My first car was, I rented
a BMW 1 Series for three months,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.520
but then MY car was actually an Audi A3.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.680
What's your favourite film?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.040
My favourite film is a very difficult question,
but there's many that I like.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.760
I like Denzel Washington as an actor, so I'd
say things with Denzel Washington in, I like.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.040
I really like Lord of the Rings actually.
I like that movie.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.240
If you weren't a footballer, what would you be?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.840
If I wasn't a footballer, I'd probably be an actor.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.320
Are you rich?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.600
Well, they say that wealth, if you're rich,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.680
money doesn't define you being rich,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.720
it's about being rich at heart
and on the inside,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.400
so I'd say I am rich, yeah.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.760
What makes you laugh?

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.720
Comedy movies, just my cousins,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.440
Jordan Ibe makes me laugh quite a lot.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.320
But, yeah, loads of things make me laugh,
anything can make me laugh to be honest.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
Have you ever killed an ant?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.320
Is something, like RSPCA, or anybody
watching out there

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.040
that's gonna get me in trouble for this?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.840
I have done it, many times,
when I was younger.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.360
If you were to be Superman or Batman,
who would you be?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.200
Batman, Batman. Definitely Batman.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.120
What was your best ever Christmas present?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.320
My mum and dad bought me wrestling
figurines, WWE wrestling figurines,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.680
and the ring at the time.
That was my favourite present.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.360
Do you wear a baseball cap backwards?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.880
Yes. All the time.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.360
Can you do a wheelie on a bike?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.480
Yes, I could do a wheelie, but I can't do one
anymore, because I haven't tried for years

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.160
and I might fall off my bike, so...

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.200
Have you ever cried at a sad film?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
I have cried, and you know what? I remember
fake crying watching Lion King

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.800
about 15 years ago.
But I have cried, John Q made me cry.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.240
Have you ever climbed a mountain?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.560
No, but I definitely will one day.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.160
BOTH: What is your favourite TV show?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.480
I'm going back now, but My Wife and Kids,
even though it's like an old show,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.160
in terms of... I'm too old to be watching that,
but it still makes me laugh,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.560
or Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I love that as well.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.000
Do you have a tattoo?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.240
No, I don't. I probably will
get one day though.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.080
How can I play for Liverpool?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.000
Work very hard, stay away from alcohol
and smoking, listen in school...

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.960
You know, stay dedicated to the job.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.400
What's the most trouble you got into as a kid?

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.880
Most trouble I got into was probably just being
told to face the wall by the school teacher.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.760
"Just face the wall, Daniel." Yeah.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.640
Are you good at climbing trees?

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.040
Trees? I was good at climbing trees.
I haven't done it for years though,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.040
so I don't know any more.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.080
Who's the best player you ever played with?

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.520
Best player I played with?

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.680
Probably say Gerrard.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.760
BOTH: What's the weirdest thing
you've eaten?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.200
I don't know, because a lot of things I eat
people say is weird.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.400
I have eggs with fruit - that's not weird to me,
but to people it's weird.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.480
But I have had oysters. I don't like oysters,
I tried them one time - bad times.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.160
I'll maybe try crocodile one day,
you never know.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.400
Do you get excited when airplanes take off?

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400
Excited? I get scared.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.600
Would you ever do a bungee jump?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.680
Possibly. Possibly.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.000
What is your favourite American sport?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.160
I love basketball.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.560
BOTH: How far can you swim underwater?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.480
Probably a length. Maybe.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.920
Do you ever make a beard with bubble bath?

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.040
I have done it, I'm not gonna lie,
I have done that in the past.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.400
Not recently, but I have.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.240
If you had a dog, what would you call it?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.640
I had a dog, she was called Roxy. She died.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.600
Bad times, man.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.400
Who is your funniest teammate?

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.240
Funniest teammate?
Jordan Ibe makes me laugh a lot, or Raheem.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.640
BOTH: Have you ever ridden a horse?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.080
No, I really want to ride a horse though, that's
one thing I would say I have to do one day.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.160
Who was your hero as a kid?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.880
Thierry Henry. Because I just loved the way
he played football, and...

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.600
..the way he was as a character,
the way he expressed himself.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.720
How much money do you earn?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.880
Very little. Should be more.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.720
BOTH: We hope you enjoy the show.
Goodbye!
