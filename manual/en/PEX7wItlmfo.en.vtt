00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:10.999
Hi I'm Clyde Lowe and we're

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.250
at the Koochiching Fair 2012
here near Northome Minnesota.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.125
I've brought in my
pedal tractor collection.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.999
That I've collected on
for about the last 20 years.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.208
We've displayed about half of it
last year and now this is the
full

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.041
display here this year.
This Minneapolis Moline is a

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.291
custom UDLF. They've made
a hundred of them here. A guy
did

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:39.041
about 10 years ago. The real one
is really highly collectible.

00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.999
They were made so you can farm with themPPduring the day and use themppfor a car

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.999
at night. To go to town. They would go about 40
-50 miles an hour down the
highway. And then

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:52.959
up here again we got some of the Olivers.
My favorite are the little
ones made in the early

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:55.999
1950's. They were made
by the Eska company.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.999
You can see as the Olivers progressed. They PPstarted with the small Oliversppand here it is a later

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.750
1950s. Then you get
in to the early 1960's.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.999
These were made and I've
had them all restored. These
were made

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.999
by a gentleman in Illinois.
He was probably one of the
best in

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:17.458
the hobby at it. But he quit now,
he's 77 years old and he

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.875
gave it up. I'm glad
I got as many as 30 some

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:27.875
restored by him. His name was Tex Gadikey.PPThis here particularppMinneapolis Moline

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:31.999
model was the only two speed pedal tractor ever PPmade. It was called a shuttleppshift you could shift

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.999
on the go. And it had two
sprockets

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.000
in it a big one and a small one and it works great.
And that's an original tractor
that was bought

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.333
a guy bought for his daughter in the mid 1950's.PPShe rode it for two years andppthen they stored it.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:47.917
And then they stored it up in the attic of
their garage and they brought
it down in 1998

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:52.000
at an auction sale which I purchased
over by Fargo ND. This
particular

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.999
Oliver the purple Oliver was made to
commemorate in the late

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.041
50's, they made a real purple Oliver tractorppand that was for plowing

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.999
demonstrations in Nebraska.
They did it to test to see what
the

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.917
horsepower was and what they would pull PPfor plows and when it was allppover

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:12.625
they were to be painted the Oliver greenPPand released to the public.ppSold to the public.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.999
Well some did get out
in the Oliver purple and so

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.000
there are a few that exist to this day, PPbut very few. And also there isppsome that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.999
the green paint is chipped off that peoplePPhave got and they can see thatppis purple

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.333
under there. And a lot of guys wonder what wasPPthat purple paint for butppthat's the story behind it.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.999
And this particular John Deere is a
newer model I believe it came
out last year

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.750
Here this 720. Most all my pedal tractors
are die cast aluminum and this

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.083
is getting away from aluminum and I guess the
price of it is what's driving
it and they are going

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:45.750
back to the pressed steel. Which
I'm not really happy with but
that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.999
just the sign of the times
to save costs. So this

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.125
rake is an actual working model. It was made by
a fellow in Tennesse. As you
can see

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:57.917
it's they've got cables hooked up to it.
It's an actual working model,
which most

00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.917
of them are nowdays.
Guys that are geniuses at
building

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:05.291
equipment are way above me
but they do build some nice
stuff.

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.959
This particular manure spreader was built by aPPmachinist in Wisconsin thepponly one he built.

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.999
So that's the only one of it's kind
and it's all a working model.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.000
Pretty unique. They made
a real John Deere lawn mowers
in

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.750
the mid 1960's and they
were called a patio set. This
was

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.291
Spruce Blue, Patio Red, Sunset
Orange

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.625
and April Yellow. And you can get
different implements for them

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:33.999
lawn mowers, rototillers,
snow blowers, a blade

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.917
each one comes with a different thing.PPI think they were only madeppfor the one year

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:42.458
out of John Deere 140
probably in 1965 -66.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:46.875
But the pedal tractor they only made
the Earl Company this green one

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.834
and my restorer in Illinois
he wanted to know if

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:54.375
I wanted a patio set. So what
he did we bought these

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:58.583
green ones and we converted them.
We wrote to the John Deer
company to get

00:03:58.583 --> 00:04:02.041
the exact paint. Restorer was very
into detail so he wanted to
get

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:07.000
it exactly and they are. That's the exact colors, PPthat the real John Deere's werepppainted.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.999
These were custom built too.
The were real

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.999
Case had a black knight and
then in 1976 to celebrate our

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.458
200th anniversary they come out
with the Spirit of 76 Case.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:23.542
The rest of these are from like
in the

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:26.999
1950's. They've been all
restored and

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.000
brought back to better than the original. PPThe paint nowdays is so muchppbetter than

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.625
when these were originally made.
So they shine a lot better.
Okay these

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:39.250
two represent an old tractor
but they were a new

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.250
production made within the last 10 years. ppBut the represent the old

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.250
F20 Farmall. And there

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.125
as you can see they are not near highly
as detailed as the actual
ones, pedals

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:55.959
that were made back in the 1950s. But they're
still a nice, represents a
nice old tractor.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:00.542
and then we got the as we go on
down the line here we've got the

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:04.333
Case, Internationals. And these

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:07.999
are from the 1990's and these
are in the 2000's.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.999
These are actual pretty recent productionsppin the last 2 -3 years. Case

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:16.583
IH's. This pedal here represents

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:21.208
the 5 millionth tractor made
by International Harvester.

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:24.166
Then that STX450 was a

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:28.834
one of the first 8 wheeled pedals they made.PPIt's got duals all the waypparound.

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:32.750
So it oscillates in the middle.
This isn't big tractor country

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.709
this is more logging country.
There's a few local small
farmers

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:41.750
up in here and it's we've kind of
got a variety of pretty much
every brand.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.208
of pedal that was ever made so.
