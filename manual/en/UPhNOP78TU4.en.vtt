What up Food Tubers it's DJ BBQ here at Big Feastival

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.860
Today we're going to put together the ultimate piggyback, it's called a fat boy not slim and I have a very special person to help me with said dish..

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.940
Ladies and gentleman, Zoe Ball. 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.990
Ta dah! Hello, hi, hello you thanks for having me. I'm starving, what are you going to make me?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.590
Ok, I'm going to make for you and for you guys out there the fat boy not slim

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:42.160
its a 6oz beef patty, cheddar cheese and then slow and low smoked pork over sweet wood, over sweet chestnut, cherry and oak man. There's flavour in those walls man.

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.939
We've got a 60 inch smoker 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.020
This thing is filled with 16 full sized pork butts, so it's this part of the pig

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.640
they're like dinosaur butts I've never had one bigger than the ones they've got in there

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.700
they've been cooking for 20 hours on sweet wood.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.260
I'm gonna get us a beef patty do you want to do the seasoning for me?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.560
Yes I'd love to do the seasoning, I'm terrible in the kitchen don't tell him.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.960
More or less? 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.600
Tiny bit more. Yes a handful

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.029
Ok and then hit the other side and throw it on the grill right there.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:18.769
Now listen you've got your own project rocking, you've got off air, Zoe Ball's own channel on YouTube.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.140
Yes it's new we started small

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.490
and it's quite exciting, it's lovely to do something in fact I brought you a present actually.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.760
You don't have to wear it now but to remind you always of us.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.980
Ok, this is the off air hat, I can do two hats at once.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.880
You know some would say that's foolish but no you can rock it.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
No I'll put it down here and you can save it for later, don't BBQ it please.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.760
Now do you like meat?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.200
I love meat

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.200
Oh my lord, look at those beauties!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.260
These guys had five hours 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.380
The smell, oh god I wish you could smell that

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:05.280
Ok, so 5 hours on sweet wood, then I wrap them with a cider vinegar and apple juice kind of jus sauce

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.940
and then, ok,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.340
Now this, there's hardly any pulling to do because look how it just falls apart.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.720
We've also got to make sure my burgers are ok

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.000
Yeh! Right so we've got these magic bear claws I feel like wolverine

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.840
this is the blade bone.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.420
You just wanna see that come out clear

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.680
and do you know where the sweetest meat is, it's closest to the bone. You kind of just pull it apart like that.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.980
Look at that, there's all that beautiful pink wood smoked flavouring, be careful because it's a bit hot.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.460
What you got? Aspestos mouth to handle that,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960
that's just so juicy and so tender.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.200
The burgers looking really good so you give it a little poke

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.080
and when it's less forgiving then it's more well done.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.430
if you can get your finger in there a bit more it's like a steak, a mince steak, it's a bit more on the rare side so we're going to take it to medium.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.940
Zoe can you throw some cheese on the burger please

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.100
And is that just normal cheddar cheese?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.160
Yes, it's a lovely cheddar cheese. If you need to get that thing rocking like really melted you just put the pan on.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.280
Now I'm going to get one of our lovely brioche buns and we're going to toast it on the grill

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.860
Don't want to burn myself

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.760
There we go, ok Zoe there's the toasted brioche and now we've got the magic to happen

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.740
So we're going to get some pulled pork on that bad boy, there we go

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.740
Ok, now we turn this into a fat boy not slim  burger

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.919
So we're going to top it with all this lovely pulled pork

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.160
There can never be too much pulled pork.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.251
We're just going to top it off with some BBQ sauce

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.280
this is like torture

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:26.600
So it needs one more thing, well two more things, the top to complete the sandwich and the second is for you to eat it.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.920
Ok, can I just tell you I love you, I haven't even tried it and I love him already. Here we go, are you ready?
