00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.200
I rose before the sun

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.900
and phoned the vagabund

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.640
half crazed, half of everything
wholly half and half

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.100
I told him what i had to
what i wanted to, what had

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.900
gone through the head
of this white nigga

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
I was all jive
I was the mulatta femme fatale

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
I was the man without a chin
I was the splendid Pão de Açúcar (sugar loaf)

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.100
I was the Lapa Arches 
and the sumptuous samba schools

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.100
exploding the avenue with joy

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.600
On a beautiful grey day
I wore my classy mac

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.100
on your Copacabana 
and on a clear sunny day

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.200
I dressed in my colored trunks 
to a park in gloomy “Curitiba”

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
I was the reverse of the sea
I was a desert full of life

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.700
which held the whole world

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.400
but also lots of space 
for whom the world didn’t even know he existed

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060
I was a well, a drain

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.940
But in any case I was bottomless

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.100
I just wanted the bum’s longing
to join mine

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.100
So that everything we dream
would be everyone’s day to day one day

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.100
And from the entire dream I was almost waking

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.900
but still had lots 
to tell the bum

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.840
Life is almost real
And what would it be or not be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.820
if not for our dreams, 
our fears, our grief?

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.800
But time doesn’t stop
The road doesn’t end

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.400
The long journey 
doesn’t end in my dream

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.280
I was only a man

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.000
A looney, almost nearly, a traveler 
carrying a heavy load on his shoulders

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.720
On a beautiful grey day

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.200
I wore my classy mac 
on your Copacabana

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.200
and on a clear sunny day

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.200
I dressed in my colored trunks 
to a park in gloomy “Curitiba”

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200
I was the reverse of the sea
I was a desert full of life

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100
which held the whole world

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.900
but also lots of space 
for whom the world didn’t even know he existed

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.040
I was a well, a drain
But in any case I was bottomless

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.200
I just wanted the bum’s longing
to join mine

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.100
So that everything we dream
would be everyone’s day to day one day
