00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.700
I am wearing Kelty's innovative PK 50 internal
frame backpack.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.289
This unique pack incorporates organizational
features that I haven't seen in any other

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:15.910
packs on the marketplace.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.360
It does so without any zippers, just a really
unique offering.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.370
But we are going to take a closer look at
what makes this pack so different from the

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.370
others.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.289
Before we look at those organization features,
I want to flip the PK 50 around and show you

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.590
its suspension system.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.190
Should mention this is an early version of
the pack.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.280
The model that will hit market is actually
going to have a slightly broader aluminum

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.170
stay from the one that you are seeing here,
but it will be that single stay which gives

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.000
some rigidity to the pack, enables it to carry
loads in a stable fashion, but also a light

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.200
weight and comfortable fashion.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.540
There is HDPE stiffener here at the top portion
of the pack, which, again, helps in stabilization

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.719
and load carrying.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:15.149
You have got fully padded contoured shoulder
straps as well as padded contour hip belt.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.529
You have got padding high here on the back
as well as right behind the lower portion

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:22.700
of your back.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.399
There is some channeling in here shaped in
such a fashion that there is a little bit

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.679
of space created between the suspension system
and your back.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.420
That allows air to flow and helps to keep
you cool instead of building up too much heat

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.740
in between yourself and the pack.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.299
Turning the PK 50 back around, we will show
off some of what makes this pack so unique.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.709
As it is stated in the name, it is a 50 liter
pack, but it is a modular 50 liter pack.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.609
What I mean by that is very unique front pocket
panel here on the pack.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:02.429
So not a traditional top loader.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:11.580
Going to unclip the face entirely and remove
this from the pack.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.160
I have actually stored here in these pockets,
by design, my clothes and I have got some

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.650
food here in the top of that lid.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.790
No zippers here at all.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.490
You have seen the buckles that I undid.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.560
There is a neat roll top closure underneath
here sewn shut, high on the pack.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.720
You only really need an opening there on that
lower portion.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.130
I have got all the extra layers I need here
inside the pack.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.980
Fully protected, I grab this, throw it in
my tent or off to the side as I set up camp,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540
because I don't need to get right into these
pockets.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.810
Having said that, there is a small roll top
closure up at top here where I have got food,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.430
snacks, things that I can get to right away
if I decide to.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.970
By leaving that panel behind, again, pull
this closed.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.480
I have actually got a streamlined 35 liter
pack for a different type of outing.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.210
Bit stretch pocket lives underneath that pocket
that we have removed.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.340
You can put just about anything and everything
in here with the amount of stretch that you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.990
have got in the pocket.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.520
If you have taken poles out of your tent,
this might be the ideal place to put your

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520
tent.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.440
Again, you have got quick access once you
take off that top pocket.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.400
You can get right to setting up camp.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.610
We will set that aside for the moment.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.090
Underneath these compression flaps which help
to keep everything nice and secure you have

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.650
got some interior pockets, deep pockets.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.330
In this case ideal for the tent poles and
I also had trekking poles in here that I didn't

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.130
need at that portion of the hike.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.810
Fit perfectly inside the pocket there without
any external lashing necessary.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.100
Again, no zippers there.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.810
I have got another roll top closure at the
top of the pack that gets me into the interior,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.850
the main interior of the pack bag.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.220
Down below I have got a dedicated sleeping
back compartment, no zippers.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.180
Again, very non traditional.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.770
Used to seeing that horseshoe shaped zipper.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.539
This is yet another roll top entry and I have
got a sleeping pad packed away in there and

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.340
then I have also got my sleeping bag as well.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.650
It is worth noting that because of that roll
top closure and the way this buckles down

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.590
in place, you could actually save some weight,
leave a compression sack behind and let that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.690
pocket work as the compression sack, so some
weight savings to be had there in addition

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.460
to some of those unique organizational features.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.009
A couple of other quick features to call out
here on the pack.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:14.280
You do have an ice axe loop at the bottom
or the bottom of the front of that pack.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.400
You do have stretch pockets on both of the
hip belts, again, that same material.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.860
So while they are very streamlined, low profile
pockets, lots of stretch—got keys in one.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:35.110
I have got my camera and phone in there other—on
the inside of that sleeping back compartment

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.020
you do have a removable shelf similar to what
you might find in a traditional set up.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.960
That enables you to separate items when you
want to between the top portion and lower

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.210
portion of the pack bag, or to open it up
when you don't need that separation and have

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.600
that much larger capacity in what would then
be a single compartment.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.330
Other nice inclusion by Kelty is an integrated
rain cover at the bottom of the pack bag.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.300
So it tucks into its own dedicated pocket,
not in the way when you don't need it.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.430
Doesn't eat into any of your storage capacity,
but it is right there if the elements turn

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.620
and you need that extra layer of protection.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:26.129
So, again, Kelty PK 50, kind of a two packs
in one option: 50 liter with all of the unique

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:32.059
organizational features that Kelty has incorporated
on this pack, plus take a portion of that

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:37.689
away and you have got that 35 liter sleep
day pack.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.360
Innovative, unique offering, priced right,
built right from a brand we have come to trust,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.669
Kelty.
