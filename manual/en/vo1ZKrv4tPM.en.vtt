Laurie Owen: Hi, I am Laurie Owen from Home
Instead Senior Care.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.970
Today I am talking about how to take care
of yourself when you are a care giver.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.550
The demands of caring for a family member
with Alzheimer disease or dementias can force

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.810
you to focus all of your energy on his or
her care.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.500
In fact research shows that many people start
neglecting their own care when they are caring

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.720
for others.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.710
A loss of self care can result in both physical
and emotional stress.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.640
You may experience a loss of sleep, headaches
and muscle aches, stomach problems, hair loss

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.800
and weight fluctuations.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.120
Other symptoms include anxiety, depression,
irritability and mood swings.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.280
Let's face it.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.079
If you are not feeling well, you won't be
able to take care of anyone else.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.170
So what can you do to keep yourself healthy?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.540
Its three things, self care, staying connected
with others, and relaxation.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.220
Self care means making sure you get enough
sleep, exercise regularly, eat well balanced

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.450
meals and drink plenty of fluids.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.310
Also make sure you continue to get your regular
medical checkups and preventative test.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.140
Research supports the idea that to stay physically
and emotionally healthy, we need a strong

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.970
social support network.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.200
Therefore, it is important that you build
in time for the relationships that nurture

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.830
you even if it's just a quick cup of coffee
with a friend, a call to a loved one or maintaining

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.479
spiritual or religious practices.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.979
Finally, there are many relaxation techniques
that can help counter stress in our lives,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.729
for example breathing deeply a few times a
day can reduce feelings of anxiety, and meditation

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.620
and yoga are also excellent ways to reduce
the feelings of stress related to care giving.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.979
By practicing a combination of good self care,
staying connected with others and employing

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.220
relaxation techniques, you go with distance
as a care giver with less stress and more

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.810
enjoyment.
