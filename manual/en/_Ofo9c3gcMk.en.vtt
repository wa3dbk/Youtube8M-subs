ADRI MURGUIA: We're here with
Eloise, and she's sporting,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.883
she might look homeless.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:30.250

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.380
ROCCO CASTORO: Hi.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm Rocco Castoro, the editor
of VICE magazine.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.440
Tonight, we're going to have a
doggy fashion show at Westway

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.232
in honor of our 2012
fashion issue.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700
The clothes are a little on
the S and M side, and they

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.020
were designed by
Ashley Levine.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.470
CLARA GOLDFARB: Hi.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.400
This is Otto, and he is dressed
as the drug dealer.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.206
Also has his backpack, which
is full of his merchandise.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.800
NATHANIEL DAM: My job
today is to walk the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.230
dogs down the runway.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.660
I will not wear the leather
pants, because I feel like it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.280
emasculates my already tiny
legs, and I'm not, yeah.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.190
I walk dogs once a year.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:44.420

her big debut, her

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.910
big coming out party.

Her first time at New
York fashion week.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.160
dogs, you got to agree.
