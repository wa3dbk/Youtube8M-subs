Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and we're going

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.200
to make party hats. This very fun party hat
is made out of only three pieces of construction

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.730
paper. This is the smaller paper. The first
thing you want to do is take the smaller paper

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:32.800
and just wrap it around your head until it
fits and tape or staple it. Nothing to it

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.129
really. Once you have your hat secured, you
might want to take a special pair of scissors

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.730
with the fancy edges and cut around the edge
so that you have an edge that looks like this.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.850
And you know if you don't have the fancy scissors
to do this kind of an edge you can always

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.280
just tear the paper and that too will give
you a fancy edge. Now one thing that you can

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.850
do too before you even cut out your hat, before
you staple it, is to leave it open and decorate

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.420
it. You might want to write Happy Birthday
in crayon or use markers or even use glitter

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.190
and glue. Once youâ€™ve done that, you put
your hat together and then you want to make

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.620
this. This is the fun stuff and it's so easy
to make. Cut out a variety of sizes and colors

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.310
of circles and then just start cutting out
your circle. You want to stay fairly close

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.050
to the edge, but it does not have to be even.
That's the beauty of it. And you just keep

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.480
cutting until you've keep spiraling around
and you have it looking like this. Then you

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:52.740
take the center and stretch it. As you can
see I used several pieces of yellow and several

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.250
pieces of purple. I started out with a large
circle with the purple and this was a small

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.001
circle with the yellow. Put them all together,
staple them at the top, shook them out and

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:14.730
here we go. A really fun, crazy Happy Birthday
hat. It would work for New Year's too.
