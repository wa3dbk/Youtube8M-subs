Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Pull-apart
Glowing Ghost Cupcake Tutorial where I'll

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.920
be showing you how to make this awesome pull-apart
ghost cupcake that actually glows.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.180
Now last Halloween I showed you guys how to
make our glowing frosting. So I'm using a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.000
batch of that today on our tools and equipment.
I will leave a link to that tutorial in the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440
description box below. But basically, it's
a frosting. It's fully edible. It's got the

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.800
magic ingredient of tonic water which contains
quinine and actually causes the frosting to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.850
glow.
You can see here, side-by-side, regular lemonade

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.269
and then tonic water. You've got the difference
in color. So you can see that the tonic water...it

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.850
really does glow. You will need a black light
to activate the glowing properties of this

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.880
cake but it's absolutely fantastic and perfect
for Halloween.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.730
So tools and equipment that we will be using
today:

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.949
I've got a cake board. Now I will leave dimensions
of my cake board in the description box below.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.230
And I've just iced mine black so that white
glowing ghost really pops off the board. We've

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.350
also got a great tutorial for how to ice a
cake board which I'll also leave a link to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.810
in the description box below.
I've got 24 vanilla cupcakes. You could choose

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.320
any flavor you like and I've just baked mine
in just black cupcake liners today.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.550
I've got an offset spatula but you can also
just use a large knife.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.900
I've got a spoon.
Some melted black candy melts. Now you could

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.710
also use cookie icing or [writhing] icing
for this. That's just going to do our little

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.900
eye detail.
Some scissors.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.310
A zip lock bag.
I've got a disposable piping bag. And I've

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.750
just paired that with just a round tip piping
nozzle. So it doesn't have to be any particular

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.740
size. Any round tip piping nozzle would do.
So the first that you want to do with your

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.890
cupcakes is you want to stick them all to
the board. So I've just use a little bit of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.210
that frosting, kind of like a little bit of
a glue.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.630
I've positioned all of my cupcakes and this
was harder than it looks. So I'm also going

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
to leave a link to a bit of a template for
your cupcake positioning or a guide for your

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.360
cupcake positioning in the description box
below. You can take a look at that and it's

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.090
going to show you exactly how to place your
cupcakes to get this great little ghost shape.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.980
So stick down my cupcakes and most of those
are already done, I'm jus going to take that

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.810
piping bag and I'm just going to lift up the
cupcake. Place just a little tiny dollop of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.350
that icing on the bottom and stick it back
down. So I've done to all of these cupcakes

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.840
and that's just to prevent them from sliding
around on the board or moving out of place

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.340
if you've got to transport this cake.
So with all of your cupcakes stack down, the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.240
first that we're going to do is we're going
to complete one of our low smooth style cupcake

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.469
swirls. So basically on each of your cupcakes,
you want to start in the center of the cupcake

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.599
and just come out. You don't have to be too
perfect with these but you do want to come

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.269
a little bit over the sides of the cupcake.
And you want to try and join all of those

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.989
cupcakes up. So you can see there I'm coming
up really nice and wide on the cupcake and

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.569
I'm actually joining them up with that frosting.
Don't come out too much over these side edges

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.680
or the outside line of your ghost is going
to be. Anywhere like... particularly in this

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.709
gap here, we have a relatively large gap,
just squeeze a little bit of that frosting

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.790
in there just to sort of even it up and make
sure that you're not going to lose any of

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.780
that frosting in those gaps you're transporting.
And as you come around to that outer edge,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.650
you just want to make sure that you're not
bringing that frosting too far out over this

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.540
outer edge of your cupcakes.
Now you can decide if you want to make this

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.590
ghost a glowing ghost or just a regular but
I still recommend using our glowing frosting

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.720
just because it's really really nice and white,
that really ghosty white kind of a coloring.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.930
If you don't want to use the tonic water for
that quinine effect, you can just replace

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.540
the tonic water with milk.
Alright, so your ghost should now be looking

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.263
like this. Now I just want you to use the
tip of your piping bag. And you don't have

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:41.450
to squeeze this all the way in like we did
those deeper holes, but just fill in any little

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.109
cracks and gaps so you've got a really nice
level surface to work with. Perfect.

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.519
Now your piping bag can go off to the side.
You want to take your offset spatula or your

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.859
knife and we're just going to smooth all this
down. So it does seem like a bit of a waste

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.459
of time spending all that time doing our lovely
low swirls. Like I said, don't be too worried

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.010
if they're not as neat as you like them to
be because they're really just to make sure

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.049
that we've got a consistent coat of frosting
and the same amount on each cupcake.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.540
So now you just want to take your offset spatula
and we're just going to smooth out our frosting,

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.430
just going back and forward there, all the
way down the cake.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.230
Now with my cake, I can see just a tiny little
duvet forming right here where I have a little

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.410
bit of a deeper gap. So I'm just going to
fill that in with a little bit more frosting.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.150
Anywhere that you can see that you're frosting
sort of sunk down, just give it a little fill

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.220
in. And we'll re-smooth.
So once you've got your little ghost to that

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.310
stage, it's as simple as giving him some ice
and a mouth. So this is where your black candy

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.310
melts or cookie icing or whatever it is that
you're using comes in. Just take that zip

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.630
lock bags. Spoon a bit of that candy melts.
Push it all the way to the corner of the bag

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.620
and seal that bag up, letting any air out.
Taking your scissors, snip off quite a decent

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.090
size corner, you don't want it to be too fine.
So you can see there I've got quite a good

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.740
amount coming out because we're going to be
doing just a couple of big circles.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.430
So you want to do your big ghosty eyes first.
You could also cut these out of fondant if

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.340
you want if you've got fondant on hand. And
once I've piped out my black candy melt...I'm

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.400
actually just using the tip of the bag just
to kind of smooth it down so it's not too

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.711
high and rigid so that it's all just distributed
nicely in there. And then we're going to give

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:28.069
him another circle mouth -- a little bit smaller
than those eyes.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:34.010
So there you've got your really really simple
glowing ghost pull-apart cupcake cake. As

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.360
I said, you guys can decide whether or not
you want to have this glowing or whether or

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.930
not you just want to make it a really cool
little ghost pull-apart for Halloween.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.400
I hope that you guys have loved this tutorial.
I hope you love the simplicity of this tutorial

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.930
and how easy this is going to be to put together
for your friends and family. Thanks very much

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.680
