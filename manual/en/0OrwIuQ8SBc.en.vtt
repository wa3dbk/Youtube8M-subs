00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.990
Now that we know a little bit about opening
up our files, we can apply what we

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.559
know to working with JPEGs and TIFF files.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.019
Let me show you what I mean, but
first what we need to do is navigate back

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.090
to our Adobe Bridge CS4 pull-down
menu and then choose Camera Raw Preferences.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.570
I just want to highlight that our
preference is to Automatically open JPEGs

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.629
that have been previously modified in
Camera Raw, and that's going to be our best

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.600
option and here's why it's going to
give us quite a bit of flexibility.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.989
We can basically do whatever we want with
that option, so let's go ahead and click OK.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.070
Now one of the things that you're going to
see here is you can notice that

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.310
there are certain files that have been modified
by Camera Raw.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.090
Here we can see
that this JPEG has been modified.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.659
There is an icon there telling me that it's
been modified by Camera Raw as has this image

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.360
which is a TIFF file.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.260
So this is
going to work the same way whether we're on

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.869
a JPEG or a TIFF, let's go ahead
and start off on a JPEG.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.480
Now if I'm on an image that has been modified,
and I double-click that image,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.600
you know what's going to happen right?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.130
It will open it up in Camera Raw, hosted
by Photoshop, interesting.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.530
Let's click Cancel.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.630
Let's say I want to skip Camera
Raw altogether.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm done processing this image; I just want
to get it inside of

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Photoshop.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440
Well, Shift+Double-Click that same file.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.540
It will then skip the Camera Raw dialog.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.710
Okay, great!

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.870
Let's go ahead and close that one and go back
to the Bridge.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.200
Now
at this file, never been modified in Camera

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
Raw.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.320
I double-click it, well; it
just opens it up inside of Photoshop.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.680
This isn't a "Raw" processed file, so
let's go ahead and close that navigate back

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.680
here.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.210
Well, how then do I open this
inside of Camera Raw?

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.680
Well, Command+R on a Mac, Ctrl+R on a PC,
will open that bad boy up inside of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Camera Raw.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.560
Well, let's go ahead and click Cancel and
look at a TIFF file

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
briefly.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.031
Again, TIFF file, same thing, double-click
it, it's going to open it

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.299
up inside of Camera Raw.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.940
Here, I can modify its contrast and give it
a little

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.580
processing here, just have some fun with this
file, make it look really punchy.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.650
I love the colors of this image.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.069
I'll go ahead and click Done, so that's been
modified.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.870
It's going to show me an
updated thumbnail preview here.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.180
It shows me that it has been modified.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.330
Now
again if I want to skip Camera Raw altogether,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.370
that's going to be a
Shift+Double-Click and that will then bring

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.849
it open inside of Photoshop.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.340
All right, well, closing that and navigating
back to this particular folder.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.400
The one thing that I'm trying to show you
here is that when you're working with

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.890
JPEG and TIFF files, you definitely want to
be able to take advantage of Camera

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.890
Raw.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.560
Yet you don't want to open up every JPEG inside
of Camera Raw.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.590
There are
certain JPEGs, like JPEGs that I shot in my

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.489
Point 2 Camera, I don't even need
to process them really, I just need to open

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.069
them up in Photoshop and maybe do a
couple of things to the file.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.650
Well, in that case, with this option, just
a double-click to open those up.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.390
Now, what's the other way we can open our
files up?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.630
Well, we can go to the JPEG
or TIFF and press Command+O on a Mac or Ctrl+O

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.150
on a PC.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.710
In an addition, that
will also just bring the file right into Photoshop.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.440
So as you can see, we have a bunch of different
shortcuts here floating around.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.040
Let's do a quick review of some of those shortcuts
in regards to JPEG and TIFF

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.200
files.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
Right now we have two different types of files,
files that have been

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.970
modified in Camera Raw, files that haven't.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.960
Let's first talk about the files
that have been modified, like this number

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.250
5 here.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.400
With this number 5, double-click, opens it
up in Camera Raw.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.150
Shift+Double-Click
skips Camera Raw, opens it up inside of Photoshop.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.489
It's almost as if, it's a
Raw file, like this file here.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.950
Same exact shortcuts and techniques that we
use

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.500
with this raw file that was captured in the
raw format.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.730
Now let's move to our
other types of files, our JPEGs and our TIFF

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.190
files that haven't been processed
in Camera Raw.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.379
Now with those files, if we want to process
them in Camera Raw, that's

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.319
Command+R on a Mac, Ctrl+R on a PC.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.660
That will then open them up in Camera Raw.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.660
We'll click Cancel.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.660
On the other hand, if the file hasn't been
processed in

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.940
Camera Raw, it's just as simple as double-clicking
or pressing Command+O on a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.760
Mac, Ctrl+O on a PC.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.150
That will then open up that image inside of
the Photoshop.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.150
All right.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.539
Well, I hope that this conversation has added
a little bit of

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.550
clarity to the somewhat confusing topic of
working with and opening TIFF and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:37.289
JPEG files in Camera Raw and in Photoshop.
