00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.580
How to Increase Your Sperm Count.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.980
Increase your sperm quantity and quality with
these scientifically tested methods.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.880
You will need Boxers Roomy pants Mobility
Vegetables high in glutathione Dietary supplements

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.510
Good dental hygiene A healthy weight and oysters.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.520
Step 1.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.990
Enjoy more nookie!

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.470
Research suggests that having sex on a regular
basis improves sperm quality, increasing the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.180
likelihood of conception.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.230
Step 2.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.999
Keep your laptop anywhere but on your lap:
The heat the computer generates and the knee-lock

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.360
position required to balance it can both damage
sperm.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
Step 3.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.149
Cut down on cell phone use.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.690
Stashing your cell in your pants while talking
with an earpiece may harm sperm, especially

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.559
if you use the phone four or more hours a
day.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.989
Step 4.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.309
Sperm wither in high temperatures, so keep
cool by choosing boxers over briefs and avoiding

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.839
too-tight pants, water beds (which tend to
heat you up), and electric blankets.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.590
Get up and move around every hour.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.050
A study of taxi drivers found they had lower
sperm counts than men in other professions

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.290
because sitting all day raised their testicular
temperature.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.290
Step 5.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:31.560
Eat more broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts,
and asparagus.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.250
Theyâ€™re good sources of glutathione, an
antioxidant that improves sperm quality.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.250
Step 6.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.920
Ask your doctor about supplements, including
coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, vitamin C, and selenium.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.910
High levels of these nutrients have been linked
to high sperm count and motility.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.840
Oysters, long rumored to be an aphrodisiac,
are the best source of zinc, which studies

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.490
have linked to increased sperm counts.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.490
Step 7.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.720
Brush and floss your teeth religiously.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.840
One study found a link between gum infections
and low sperm counts.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
Step 8.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.250
Lose weight if you need to.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.930
A 2006 federal study found that every extra
20 pounds a man carries may increase his chances

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.840
of infertility by 10 percent.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.500
Did you know While human sperm can fertilize
an egg for up to 48 hours, bat sperm are able

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.030
to fertilize for up to 135 days.
