00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.359
Go Team

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.699
Go!

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:19.220
Go Team, Go!

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.710
Go Team, Go!

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.850
Tag, your it.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.759
Barry, Larry. Did you two clean 
your room like I asked?

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.809
Ah, Mom I don’t want to.
Neither do I.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.000
Well then I don't think you 
two can go to the Carnival today.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Ah, Ma! But then we’ll miss all the fun.
Better clean your room then.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.420
What are we going to do? I’ve got an idea. 
Why don’t we use our ROK Blocks to build 
a Robot to clean our room for us!

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.000
That way we keep playing and go to the Carnival.
Great idea!

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.270
All done. Let’s turn him on.
Okay.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.379
Destroy Everything!

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.720
Uh oh. Ma!!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.720
With a Ferris Wheel, hay rides, and carnival games,
this has to be one of the best carnivals this town has ever seen.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.350
I’m confident that nothing could possibly go wrong.
Destroy Everything!

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.689
Breaking news! There’s a giant robot attacking the city, 
and he’s headed straight for the carnival.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.110
Rokenbok Go Team, we need your 
assistance downtown immediately. 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.770
This robot is making quite a mess, and he needs to be stopped.
We are on our way, Mr. Mayor.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.140
All right Team. Steve, I need you to sweep-up all those ROKs.
On it.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.500
Frankie, you start clearing the beams.
You got it.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.000
Mike and I will help get all the civilians to safety.
Betty, I need you to work your ROK Blocks magic.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.170
Come-up with a way to bring that robot down.
Yes Sir!

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.170
Rokenbok Go team, Go!

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.070
Oh no! He’s getting closer and closer to the carnival.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.850
Oh look! It’s the Rokenbok Go Team. 
We are saved.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.850
All right Team, let’s do this.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.320
How is it going, Betty? We need to stop this thing now!
I’m coming in.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.259
Try to keep the robot distracted.
Destroy everything.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.789
That was a close one. 
I’m dropping the net.

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:20.789
Way to go Betty! All right, boys, bring him down.
Malfunction, malfunction.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.369
They did it! The Go team saved the day.

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.929
Way to go everybody.  Great teamwork.

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:32.479
I just want to thank the Go Team personally, for 
stopping what could have been a catastrophe. . . 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.849
Excuse me.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.990
We built the robot to clean our room for us,
but instead it turned evil and attacked the town.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.130
We are really, really sorry.  Yeah, we’re really,
really sorry. 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.079
Well, boys I hope you learned your lesson.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:45.950
Yeah, hard work

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.309
and listening to your mom is 
always the best way to go.

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.759
We won’t let it happen again. Promise.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:52.839
All right boys.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.179
I think that you headed home
and cleaned your room. Yes Sir.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.639
Ok everyone.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.649
Now that the disaster has been averted. . .

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.579
let's all get back to having fun!
