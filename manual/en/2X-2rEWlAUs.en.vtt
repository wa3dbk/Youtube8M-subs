00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.827
(rock music)

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:05.660
- Ok, but check this
out with Les MisÃ©rables.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.893
- Uh huh?

00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:09.348
- Anne Hathaway during the promo for that,

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:11.623
she jumps out of the van, ok?

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:13.279
Out of one of those SUV's,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.658
they show her corned beef,

00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:15.792
they take a picture of it,

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.527
they post it on TMZ, everywhere else.

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:18.351
- What?

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.718
- Yeah, you didn't know this?
- No!

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:21.072
- And she gets upset,

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.487
"Oh my God, look at how
society has fallen!"

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:26.715
My point is this, is if
you jumpin' out of an SUV,

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.231
put on some friggin drawls,

00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:29.684
you know you're going to a movie primer,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:30.763
you got 100 cameras.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.838
These things can pick up
little boogers in your nose,

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:33.952
and stuff like that, right?

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:35.527
And you can come out legs wide open?

00:00:35.527 --> 00:00:38.651
And they get mad when they
have a corned beef shot, ok?

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.400
- Can't get mad Anne Hathaway.
- Exactly.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.116
- You asked for the corned beef.

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:43.946
- Hide your corned beef!
- Hide your corned beef!

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:45.106
- Let's make this drink!

00:00:45.106 --> 00:00:46.785
- This is a Glow in the Dark Blue.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:48.401
- Exactly homeboy, you need a

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:50.673
black light to make this
one work, but it's fun.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:51.869
- But it's so fun.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:53.880
- Ok, ounce and a half of gin.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.510
- Ounce and a half of gin.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.629
- Go ahead, how many are you going to do?

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.791
- Four: one, two, three, four.

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.840
- What's this?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.963
- Sloe gin.
- Go ahead, pour!

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:05.696
- One, two, three.

00:01:05.696 --> 00:01:08.178
- Ok, squeeze in two lemons.

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:10.427
- Two? Well, one lemon.

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:12.244
Two halves of a lemon.
- Yes, yes.

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.793
- The beauty of this is the tonic water.

00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:16.812
- Exactly.

00:01:16.812 --> 00:01:18.793
- Look at it glowing already.

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:21.108
It's where the magic happens.

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:22.560
(laughs)

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.252
Holy Copperfield.

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:30.133
- Keep going, let it overflow.
- Oh yea!

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.083
- Let it run, our cup overfloweth!

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.129
- Ohh.

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:35.812
- Ok, beautiful, go ahead stir up.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:40.226
- Alright, stir up,
'stirrups' is what you need.

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:41.862
(laughs)
- I need stirrups.

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:43.006
- To ride this drink--

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.215
to ride this wave of fun (laughing)

00:01:45.215 --> 00:01:46.388
- Are you talking about the drink?

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:47.385
- Yea, yea, yea.

00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:48.775
- Oh just to make sure
you were just joking.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.351
(laughs)

00:01:50.351 --> 00:01:52.542
And there you have it!

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:54.197
Glow in the Dark Blue!

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.149
Go ahead Nick, and take a sip.

00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:01.282
- Mmm, it's like a Gin and Tonic.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:03.681
But glowing on the inside.

00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.120
- Give a big smile.
- Is my mouth glowing?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.605
(laughs)

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:10.298
- Does it taste just a like Gin and Tonic?

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:10.897
- Mmhm.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.346
- The Slow Gin doesn't
offer a different taste?

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:13.837
- Well no, the sloe gin
makes it a little sweeter.

00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:15.865
- Ok boys and girls, we can
cut these lights out now, ok?

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.132
- Uh oh!

00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:18.664
- Tipsy Bartender, wish me some luck.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:21.580
- And there you have it! (laughs)

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.820
- Wait, I can't even put the lights off!

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.492
(laughs) - Ahhh!

00:02:25.492 --> 00:02:27.312
- I did not touch her, ok?

00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:29.174
Don't be squeein', screamin' for?

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:30.431
(screams)

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:33.753
You get to take your
time and work it slow.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.320
- Oh God, sloe gin!

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.543

Have your ass here on time, ok?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.568
- Get your ass here, and
hide your corned beef!

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.872
Unless you want to show your
corned beef, you can show.

00:02:46.872 --> 00:02:48.337
- Yea, that would be fun.
- Yea, that's fine.
