00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:07.037
(exciting music)Scott: When I started
my blog, it was with a simple idea;

00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:14.808
travel the world searching for
people whose style defined who
we are today.( perky music)

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:19.188
My name is Scott Schuman
and I am the sartorialist.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:24.928
( calm music) Real style can
be very subtle like a whisper.

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:30.318
People don't always have
to yell to be heard.

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:34.434
Someone can look great and have the most
incredible right-off-the-runway dress,

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:37.699
but if they don't have the
grace, and mystery, and desire,

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.242
it's not going t make a great photograph.

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:45.361
The image of Julie offered,
in one photograph, an image

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.443
that to me had layers of depth.

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.376
What'd you think when the first
time that I took your picture?

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.744
Julie: It's interesting when you shoot
me because you pull a quietude out of me

00:00:55.744 --> 00:01:01.776
that seems more true to who I
am as opposed to my shyness.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:05.893
It's just one of those moments, those
quiet moments where you just pause and

00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:11.245
take a photo and it just so happened
to have something special in there.

00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:14.321
Scott:The photograph became more beautiful
to me the more I got to know Julie

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:19.977
and the more I got to know
who she is as a person.

00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.557
It's the fact that she is so real.

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:26.130
I think it's the sincerity that
you see in the photographs.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.753
Yeah, that's really cute; I
thought it was going to be

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.306
way, way, way, way, way too big.

00:01:29.306 --> 00:01:31.045
It's close enough in the shoulder.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.506
Julie: Yeah, it's just a
little bit big, that's okay.

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.119
Scott: Yeah, that would
probably look great on me.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:34.658
Can I try it on?

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:39.591
Julie: I like your pop collar.

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:43.395
Scott: For me, a photograph is the
experience of taking the photograph,

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.321
and the interaction with the person.

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:49.429
It's beyond the clothing;
it's beyond physical beauty.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.611
I think they make you want to learn
more about who that person is.

00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:59.204
I met NI'ma and she just looked like
a dream out of a different period.

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:01.451
I just asked, like I do sometimes,
"Where's the dress from?",

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.845
"Where's the coat from?"

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:04.465
I could tell they were vintage pieces.

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.336
I wasn't expecting to hear her say
that they had all come from members

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:10.559
of her family and mainly from her grandma.

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.767
Ni'ma: This was my grandmother's.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:13.958
Scott: It's a [robe].

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.193
Ni'ma: This is her; and then
this is her with her sisters.

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:20.471
This is a perfume that
came from her apartment.

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:25.038
I was just trying to ...
all these pieces are hers.

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:28.117
Scott: You grew up watching
your grandma go to church.

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:29.381
Ni'ma: Um-hum.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.987
Scott: How did that influence you?

00:02:30.987 --> 00:02:34.885
Ni'ma: It just inspired me to put more
effort into my attire getting dressed.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:37.986
Just seeing her apply makeup,
selecting accessories.

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:40.186
At the time, I didn't know
what church really was.

00:02:40.186 --> 00:02:40.871
Scott: Uh-huh.

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.164
Ni'ma: I just knew she was
getting ready to go to church.

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:44.119
Scott: Um-huh, what did
you imagine it must be?

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.381
Ni'ma: A place that people would
just get dressed up and go and,

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:49.837
beautiful people were just going.

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.076
Scott: Yeah, almost like a nightclub.

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:54.111
Ni'ma: Yeah.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.993
Scott: You can't fake
a natural gracefulness.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:02.277
With her, it's in the calmness
of her face; it's in how
relaxed her eyes are, but

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:04.729
to me her entire beauty and gracefulness

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:09.576
is captured in the calmness of her hands.

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:11.557
When I started thinking about
doing the second book, of course

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:14.860
the very first thing you think of
is what's the cover going to be?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.921
By this time, blogs had
been around long enough;

00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:19.697
and the first thought obviously
would be to put somebody known.

00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:21.909
For me, that just didn't seem right.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.115
The more I thought about what
I wanted the cover to say,

00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:28.043
the more obvious it became
that that photograph of Ni'ma
would be the perfect one.

00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:31.110
It seemed like a perfect
door to open people up

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.962
into the world of what that
second book was going to be.

00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:41.143
For me, I found a camera is a device to
let people share who they are with you.

00:03:41.143 --> 00:03:46.437
With both Ni'ma and Julie, having
been the cover girls of my books,

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:47.610
they've become friends.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.073
I see them quite a bit; I'm always
curious about what they're wearing.

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:53.022
I often shoot them when I see them.

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:55.804
They have such a chameleon-like
character that I never know

00:03:55.804 --> 00:03:58.672
what Julie I'm going to
meet on any particular day.

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:05.064
I never know what Ni'ma I'm going to meet.
