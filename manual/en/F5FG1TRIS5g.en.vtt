00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Hello! Today we will be folding "Can Love Be

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.520
Squashed" by Sy Chen. This is a very

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.620
entertaining action model, and I'm sure

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.730
you'll enjoy it.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.099
Also please be sure to check out Sy

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.130
Chen's book, "Folding Hearts".

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.500
Now we're going to create four inside

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.900
reverse folds. We're going to do this by

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.970
using the existing creases that we just

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.630
made. So what we're going to do is start

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.300
with this top left flap and we're going

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.910
to make sure that this white edge here

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.940
lines up with this edge here.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.089
So what we do is, we sort of have to open

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.960
up this pocket, and just push this down

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.920
so that it aligns with the white edge down

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
here. And you should see a crease like

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.949
this, and it'll be right here. And what

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.869
you do is just push inwards along that

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.180
crease and then flatten the model. And

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.890
then you should have done your inside

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.530
reverse fold. So you do the same thing

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.379
over here, and just an easier method to

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.049
do this. It might help, it might not.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.549
You can just basically push here, and it

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.490
should just collapse along the existing

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.670
creases. If the other method doesn't work

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.979
for you then that should work.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.829
So now we're just going to do the first

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.920
 method on both of these. So let's

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.710
start by opening this flap a bit, and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.759
just push in, aligning the edge with the

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.569
other edge. And again, just push in along

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.170
that crease there and flatten it out. And

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.630
it should look like that. Then do the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.850
same thing one more time. So open up the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.929
flap a bit.

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.950
Push this in so that the creases align,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.480
and then just put that

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.490
there and flatten the whole thing out. So

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.280
it should look like this.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.560
Now we're going to create four more

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.619
inside reverse folds. So what we're going

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.690
to do is we're going to start with this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
top left area up here. We're not going to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.060
go in this region over here, but we're

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.620
just going to use this little square

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.220
here. So along this crease that we have

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.980
here, the diagonal crease, we're basically just

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.750
going to pinch it like a mountain fold.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.290
So it should look like a mountain when

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.600
you look at it from the side. And then

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.700
what you have to do is take the top part

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.250
of where it's pinched and just drag it over

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.680
into this region as far as it goes.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.430
And when you're doing that, try to align

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.230
this edge here with that edge there. So

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.630
when you do that, it should look like a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.140
triangle. Once it's like that, just fold

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.739
the edge over, and it should look like

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.130
that. Now you have to do the same thing

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.440
over here. So start by making this a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.120
mountain fold. So just pinch it from

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.530
the top, and just drag it over and align

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.820
the two edges here. And then just make a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.489
crease, and you should have that triangle

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.700
again. Once you have the triangle, just

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.269
fold across on this crease, just like that.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.799
And then it's done on this side. So now

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.739
just flip the model over, and we're doing

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.410
the same thing on this side. So let's

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.790
start by making this a mountain fold

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.320
again. And we're just going to pull over

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.760
as far as it goes and just make a crease.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.430
And again, fold this back over one more

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.769
time. We're just going to make this piece

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.650
a mountain fold. And drag it over into

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.560
that region over there. Make sure the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.890
edges align, make a crease, and then pull it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.400
back over. And you should sort of see how

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.819
the heart shape is starting to form.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.380
Now we're going to use these for flaps

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.600
that we created and we're just going to

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.780
put them inside each pocket. So to do

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.910
this, let's start with this top left

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.990
pocket, and we just open it up a bit. And

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.510
don't unfold any of the creases that we

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.760
made before, but sort of just pull it up

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.440
so that you have room to put the flap

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.950
inside. So once it's like this, just take

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.610
this flap here and push it inside. And

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.960
then it should fall upon one of the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.270
creases we just made. And then just

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.820
flatten it out so that the whole model

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.400
is flat. And you do the same thing on

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.980
this side. So just pull open this pocket,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.630
and then push the flap in. And again it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.370
should fall upon one of our creases that

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.470
we just made.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.020
Okay, and now once it's like this, we just

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
flip it over and we do the same thing on

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.080
the back. So let's start over here, and we

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.080
just open the pocket up, put the flap

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.890
inside, and flatten the model. And one

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.880
last time,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.250
open up the pocket, put the flap inside,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.660
and flatten it out.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.460
Now we're going to unfold the model

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.350
along the center crease that we made

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.530
before. So basically what we do is just

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.320
pull those apart so it looks like this

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.270
again.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.730
Once it looks like this, we're basically

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.310
going to create a waterbomb base on

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.390
these four creases here. You can probably

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.130
already see how we're going to do this,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.040
but just in case you don't, then let's

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.800
just do this together. So start by

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.930
folding in half along this long crease

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.560
here. And the model should look something

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.550
like this. And then now what we do is

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.000
we're going to create two squash folds. So

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.790
along this crease here, we're just going

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.030
to pull this side of the model over. Just

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.160
fold it over a bit and it should just

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.460
squash down naturally. And you'll know

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.870
you've done it right when it looks like

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.570
a heart. And then just flip the model

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.230
over, and you can do the same thing again

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.750
along this crease and this crease. So

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.240
basically just put your hand inside this

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.520
flap, and along this crease, we're just

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.530
going to fold the model over and flatten

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:53.139
it out. And it should look like this.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.090
Now there's only two more things that we

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.590
have to do before this model is complete.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.229
We basically just have to look at it

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.090
from the top, and we're going to put

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.909
these two flaps underneath two other

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:07.090
flaps. So let's start by taking this

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.210
right flap here, and we're going to open

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.740
up this flap that we made up front. And

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.560
we just hold that up for a second, and

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.639
just let this go over to the side that

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.219
you want it on. And once it's like that,

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:26.409
put that flap back down, and it should be

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.770
like this and it should lock a bit. And

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.389
now what we have to do is do the same

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.430
thing on this side. So we're going to put

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.270
this flap underneath this flap. So just

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.199
open this up, this one flap here, and

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.849
we're just going to basically pull the

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.520
model together and fold the flap back

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.930
down. Once it's like that, our model is

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.080
complete!
