00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.330
West Orange, New Jersey.

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:10.216
Nice, huh?

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.246
That's my dad in blue.

00:00:13.453 --> 00:00:14.868
And that's his best friend, Terry.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.252
The inseperables.

00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:17.311
- I can't believe you made me do this.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:18.359
- Good for your appetite.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:19.349
See you in an hour!

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.623
I grew up here with two families.

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:23.542
- We have so much to be thankful for.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.962
To the Walling and Ostroff clans.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.120
Who knew two families could get this close?

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:32.077
- Nina?

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:34.462
- Back for Thanksgiving.

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:35.448
My parents here?

00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:36.337
- There in the back.

00:00:37.647 --> 00:00:39.868
You could say life in the Oranges is

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:40.515
dependable.

00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:41.423
- I'm going out.

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.106
- Well. Don't you look nice.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.489
- Mom, give me some room.

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:48.131
That is until, what happened

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:51.256
happened.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:55.524
- Cathy.

00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:55.927
- Mom.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.846
- Oh my God!

00:00:58.846 --> 00:00:59.312
- Cathy...

00:00:59.312 --> 00:00:59.871
- I wanna throw up.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.472
- You're only 24 years old.

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:07.475
- We like each other.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.114
- Oh my God.

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.057
- You have caused some serious trouble, young lady.

00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:11.468
Don't you roll your eyes at me.

00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:14.360
- I'm sorry, when you try to play the stern father, it looks like you're pretending.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.938
- Your father is not pretending.

00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:16.691
- I'm not pretending.

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:17.746
- Terry, do something!

00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:23.225
- Okay, I hurt my ankle.

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:23.761
- You okay?

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.800
- No, I'm not okay.

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.028
- Can't we just be normal?

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:30.006
- What's normal?

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.078
I won't do this. I'm not that guy.

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:33.097
- Terry, wanna go?

00:01:33.097 --> 00:01:34.456
You and me, make out in the back?

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:35.856
Right now, let's go, let's do it!

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:37.587
- Nice move on the Christmas card.

00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:38.131
- Thank you.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.891
- Oh good God.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.603
- Mom and dad split up.

00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:47.858
How could nobody tell me?

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.081
- I'm taking myself out.

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:51.371
I'm having a good time for once.

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:06.487
- Merry Christmas!

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.283
- It's about to be.

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:13.718
- Life

00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:17.469
is tough.
