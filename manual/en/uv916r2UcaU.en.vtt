MARK MALKOFF: Hi, I'm
Mark Malkoff.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.090
Currently, I'm on a
New York City bus.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.630
I almost never take the bus
anymore because they are way

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.370
too slow here in this city.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.580
My guess is, even a child's
big wheel would beat a New

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.510
York City bus.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.480
And believe it or not, that's
what I'm gonna attempt to

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.020
prove right now.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.510
It is big wheel versus bus.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.740
MARK MALKOFF: The race?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360
One mile on 42nd from 10th
Avenue to Madison Avenue.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.660
Can I successfully
pull it off?

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.950
We're about to find out.

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:45.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think the bus
would beat the big wheel.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.410
MALE SPEAKER: The big
wheel, by far.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd say a bus.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.590
MALE SPEAKER: Big wheel.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.060
MALE SPEAKER: The bus would
definitely win.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd
say a big wheel.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.568

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:04.042
MARK MALKOFF: Here it comes.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:09.540
[HORN]

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.790
MARK MALKOFF: OK, go, go.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.420
Going.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630
I'm doing this, I'm doing
this, I'm doing this.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.672
Ah!

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:22.152
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.450
Bus driver, you think you're so
cool because you have huge

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.350
windshield wipers and can
control the doors.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.290
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS]

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.850
MARK MALKOFF: OK, the bus
is right in front of me.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.850
I'm passing the bus.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.350
The bus is right here, guys.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.350
I'm passing the bus.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.350
I'm passing the bus.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.200
I'm beating the bus right now.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.530
I am beating the bus.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.730
I am beating the bus.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.720
I am beating the bus.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.665
I am beating the bus.

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:56.810
Oh my gosh.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.930
Only three avenues to go.

00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:03.297
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:05.476
This is way faster
than the bus.

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.580
Plus, I don't have to
give up my seat to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.698
the elderly or pregnant.

00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:10.670
Woohoo.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:25.760
[LAUGHS]

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.377
Yeah, my legs are
in so much pain.

00:02:27.377 --> 00:02:29.630
Yes, I'm a huge baby.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.502
We're almost there.

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:33.760
(SLO-MO VOICE) Three
blocks to Madison.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.400
Three blocks to Madison.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.050
[GARBLED SLOW MOTION VOICE]

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.541
We did it!

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:45.535
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, sir.

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:46.040
MARK MALKOFF: I did it.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.990
I single-handedly beat a major
source of transportation on a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.240
child's toy.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.606
Take that, MTA.

00:03:05.606 --> 00:03:06.380
I beat the bus.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.630
I beat the bus.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.250
I beat the bus.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.210
I beat the bus.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.110
I beat the bus.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.360
I beat the bus.
