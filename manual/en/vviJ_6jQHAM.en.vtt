00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060
Steve: Hey guys, this is the creative mode of Minecraft, released in the 1.8 or pre-release.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.180
Um, apparently you can break through bedrock.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.820
Steve: So.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.180
Matt: Which we forgot to show in the-

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.160
Steve: Yeah we didn't-

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.660
Matt: We didn't-

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.800
Steve: We didn't even show the creative mode.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
Matt: We didn't go into the creative mode.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.760
(Sound of blocks breaking)

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.940
Steve: On a single player- server

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.880
(Sound continues)

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.380
Matt: Yeah.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.380
Steve: Then we could play multiplayer

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.440
Matt: In creative mode- what's that?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.380
Oh.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.500
Oh, little, um, what's it called?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.720
Steve: Abandoned mine.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720
Matt: Abandoned mine shaft- but yeah, anyway.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.060
So let's get down to bedrock.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.280
(Blocks breaking)

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.060
K, so, as you can see...

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.540
You can break bedrock in this.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.180
Steve: Wow.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.020
Matt: So let's go down, and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.960
Steve: Woah.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.480
Matt: Woah.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.980
Matt: Okay.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.040
Matt: What the- what the f-

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.560
Steve: Oh.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.440
Matt: Uh-hum.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.440
[Silence]

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.260
Ow! [Inaudible] Shit!

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.360
What is goi-

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.280
Both: Um.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.580
Matt: What the hell just happened?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.720
[Silence]

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.240
What's-

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.900
Saving chunks- I haven't seen that screen

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.400
Isn't that usually a loading bar there?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.120
Matt: Uh!

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.140
K?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.060
Steve: Wow, okay this is -

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.740
Matt: Is glitching out, but what- what is that
Steve: The hell is that?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.900
[Silence]

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.460
Matt: Um...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.720
[Silence]

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.420
Matt: I don't know what's going on here.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.960
I think that's- yeah that's crashed- okay.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.240
Okay, um- we're back, let's try that again

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.460
Steve: Hm.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.360
Matt: See if we can get into that-

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.540
Steve: The hell was that, like-

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.200
Matt: There shouldn't be any mobs or anything- or- I've never seen a mob like that.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
Well- the- was that a-

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.980
Steve: There was a-

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.960
Matt: It's not even multiplayer like I don't-
Steve: There was a friggin cave underneath the bedrock.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.360
Matt: Yeah.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.000
Steve: What the hell was that shit?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Matt: Out of the world, it looked like we fell into it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.540
Um.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.040
Let's try it again I guess.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.360
Steve: Weeeeee!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.420
(Oogh)

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.020
(Oogh)

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.560
(Oogh)

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.160
(Oogh)
Matt: Uh.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.700
(Ough)

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.720
Steve: Uhhh, no.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.620
Matt: That didn't happen.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.160
Steve: Okay, well-

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.740
Matt: Okay then, so.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.700
I don't think-

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.920
What is it like a rare spawn or- or something?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
Steve: I have no idea what the hell that was.
Matt: Like a rare- I don't know.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
Steve: It was terrifying.
