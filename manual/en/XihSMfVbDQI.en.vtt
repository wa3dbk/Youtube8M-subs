00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.820
Back in the south, we didn't have this problem

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.740
Oh crud! Look what- Look what it did. It like...*Noise*

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.440
Hey guys it's James Henry II here and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.170
today's video is uh, Kind of a follow up to my
previous video; my unveiling of the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.830
glee series boxset

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.750
My voice is kinda back to normal
kinda not really. I'm kind of whispering again

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.260
too but um

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.619
* Clears throat* so today's video will be the actual uno-

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.619
opening of the season 6, there you go,

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.920
season 6 DVD case for glee

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.560
so here we go.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.000
Always hate these tape things

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.700
Alright here we go, I am about to open it for the very first time.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.540
op

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.540
Okay

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.670
so this little thingy fell out first it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.030
oh it's for the new app Glee forever

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
um I kinda wish- Does anyone remember the
Glee karaoke at that was probably the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.730
best karaoke

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.960
app out there. Cause you could put songs from your own iTunes store on there.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.880
You could record it all cool. But you couldn't share
obviously. And you could like sing with other

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.369
people I remember I had like one of the
top songs because it was really stupid

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.200
It was "And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going"

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.909
and it was also a really weird duet with myself

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.970
Vocal Masturbation

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.570
*laughs* of "Dream On" From season 1

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.369
That was a really fun app

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.710
this one I'm assuming it's gonna kind of
be like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
not like I guess like Tap Tap, You can just like you know: rhythm of the music?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.759
I don't know.  so this is what it looks like
inside

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.860
here are - oop flying out

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.479
here are the discs with the episodes
and it shows their special features there's the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.560
Disc one, special feature

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.159
music jukebox like always. Second One

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.220
is the jukebox, third one is the jukebox. of course the last one

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.289
the special features are the final
curtain call

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.520
Glee: the final curtain call. Not sure what
that's going to be, but I'll watch it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.970
for you guys. Um...looking back The
video yearbook

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.869
Um. *sound* Don't know what that is but it sounds sad.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.790
Um and then music jukebox so I'm going
to pop in

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.030
disc number four; the last disc which has
the better- the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.420
actual special features and we'll see

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.580
how that goes

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.580
Hey guys. Okay so i'm

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.530
I'm on the floor in my room.  um...Here is my bed. If you guys haven't seen it yet. Here is my marvelous bed.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.630
Um, so here's what it looks like for the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.530
the menu for the special
features

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.350
there's you know theres um Noah Puckerman, a.k.a. Mark Salling

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.440
um, there's on the top one , you can see is

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.540
Glee: The final Curtain

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.360
The second one is

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.280
Looking Back; Video Yearbook

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.670
and then of course the Glee Music Jukebox for the episodes on this disc

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.019
So Let's see what

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.390
looking back is about

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.840
I'm not ready for ths.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.460
*Sigh* okay um

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.500
Yes it made me cry.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.750
um it was about  like a 24-minute

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.780
video um of like the cast talking about their entire experiences with

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.850
Glee and up like everything from like Season 1

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.110
to season 6. They signed a yearbook at the end.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.250
There was a segment on Cory Monteith, which was really sad.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.910
but i think the ending was the more sad part. Cause it's like what glee meant to you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.390
and it was just really sad.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.970
like it made me cry!

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.740
If you guys watch, somehow find it online. watch it, it's really good. and really sad.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.120
Okay so now  we are going to watch

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.740
glee the final curtain

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.720
Okay, again tat made me cry

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.510
excuse me *Laughs*

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.500
okay so that was very emotional
too

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.560
it was basically talking about the last
day or the last

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.920
season shooting the last episode
shooting it

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.870
the cast talk about the last moment
on set talking about how

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.690
um

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.420
well how like the whole seasons end with
the characters

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.650
how like they like how they ended it and
then in the very last thing that they

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.709
show was them during the series cast call

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.770
in the choir room for the last scene and that was hard to watch

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.970
um  so again if they have this on YouTube

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.449
or online somehow- I hope you guys can watch it cause it's

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.199
really good. If you guys have season six, watch it and tell me what you guys think of it.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.399
it's really good.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.260
So all in all I

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.270
think that season 6 , or the glee series box set.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.160
is a really great box set but I do wish that they did something kind of

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.820
interesting like individual discs kind of 
like what they do

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.729
with I Love, Lucy. Or any other box set for a TV Series.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.900
Like something cool packaging. This one is just kind of very boring.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.570
it's just like all 6 individual seasons that they already have that you can just buy individually.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.820
They should have like maybe

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.770
booklet or something. I kind of wish they did have the bloopers.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.060
That was something that everybody was looking forward to. but obviously that didn't happen.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.220
So um... hopefully, maybe, they'll eventually release those or something.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.500
let's hope.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.860
Kind of like what Ryan Murphey did with his old YouTube channel where he released those

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.850
un released songs that weren't in the episodes.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.930
I would give this

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.510
a C+

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.510
It's great cause you have all the seasons in this really

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.550
cool packaging but again it's not the greatest thing  out there.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.150
it's not anything special, special.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.790
but I do recommend it so...I will do that.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.210
thank you guys so much for watching this video, as you can see, that is what you

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.010
have in store for this Glee season 6 DVD

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.540
case if you don't have to this in your
country or you know

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.110
this, you can also get them individually
held

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.410
all of these individually, I can link all of them below. Or you can just buy them at whatever store you can

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.670
I mean they're pretty cheap now which
is really sad.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.190
they're cheap you can get them there. I will link those below. If you

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.180
wanna watch glee just watch em, there's a lot on Netflix. Now  there's some on

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.380
Amazon Prime

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.400
You can watch them on YouTube now which is kind of weird, but you have to pay for them.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.960
Who wants to pay for that? No one.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.960
So thank you guys so much for watching this video.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.070

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.690
As you can see; my glee poster

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.790
is still up there.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.790
