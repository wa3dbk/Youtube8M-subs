00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is Jack. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
As everything became manifested in/on this planet, so did the gold; and the problem 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
came when they realized that if this becomes so manifested, they won’t have access 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
here. They need a plan; that’s why Anu went to the Atlanteans and said, “Listen. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We’re going to have a problem. Because everything’s starting to manifest to such an 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
extent that--I’m CERTAIN--one day, we’re not going to get access here; and it’s 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
giving us ALSO an opportunity to exist infinitely.”  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Of course, the Atlanteans LOVED their planet, because it’s them. The planet was as 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
them, was an expression of them; which was manifesting, and they weren’t. They 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
really thought that they would manifest as well, because they were of this planet; and 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they couldn’t understand it.   Then, the Atlanteans said, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
“Okay. You may. You may manifest your plan. Let’s see what you come up with;  

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and then we’ll take it into consideration again.”   Now, for Anu, he knew--‘Shit. Fuck.’ 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
--he had a problem, because he needs gold. If he doesn’t have gold, he can’t exist;  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and it’s going to be a problem, because he exists interdimensionally, not necessarily manifested. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It’s the gold that manifested. He needs to manifest his city here on Earth, he has to.  

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
He has to survive; and for him, he’ll do whatever it takes. That’s interesting, because it  

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
was more about him than anything else. He knew he needed gold to exist, because gold [laughs]- 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
-they believed gold was that which gave them the ability to exist, to shape-shift;  

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to be as ‘what they are’ is from gold/they get from gold. If they don’t have gold, 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
they’re nothing, they’re worthless, they die.  

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, you’re probably asking where the human form comes from; let’s go there. The Atlanteans.  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The Atlanteans had a very fascinating form, which is almost like the human form; 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
though taller, much taller. Slender; all (both male and female) were reasonably slender in expression. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They had feet. They had their hands. They were beautiful, though; they were really beautiful beings- 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.000
-magnificent, flawless, perfect [laughs]. It’s those beings which you see in one moment.  

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Imagine--I’m certain (excuse me, I just have to put this in to kind of explain to you) 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
-I’m certain men see women sometimes (now this is EVEN for MEN, this experience, 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
when I’ve seen males there, in terms of the Atlanteans’ expression), if you see a  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000
woman walking and you just look at her, and you’re just like [“breathless”/in awe],  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and everything STOPS for a moment; and all that exists in that moment is just that woman  

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
walking there--something like that. I’m sure many men have experienced that; 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
hey just can’t take their eyes off a woman. It’s like ‘hypnotized,’ to a certain extent,  

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
like you’re under some spell; that’s what I experienced when looking at the Atlanteans. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It’s not that I see them male/female, per se; it was just their presence. It was just  

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
beautiful. You know, their movement, it was sound--imagine a manifested sound  

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
movement; the flow of it, the sound as their voices that they’re communicating in, 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000
their expression. Yeah, so, in other words [laughs], let’s just remember that.  

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So, the physical human form came from the Atlanteans’ form. The Atlanteans, and then  

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.000
there’s also another planet. The shape, I’d say, comes from the Atlanteans; though,  

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the stability-shape, the more fine-tuning of it, came from another planet. Because  

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000
they realized then they needed a comfortable form in which they move comfortably/easily. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Because they realized they required to develop a vessel; a type of vessel that will sustain  

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 them on this Earth. Now, the PLAN was to basically just form this vessel, be able to come  

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
into it and move around--oh, god, it’s almost just like the Portal [laughs]--like move into it, 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and then do what is necessary to be done, and then move out again. But, that also  

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
wouldn’t work, because the gold was starting to actually manifest, and it’s just  

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
not going to work if they take the gold from here interdimensionally--because it just won’t work. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So, Anu says, “I’ll deal with that later; let me just focus on designing a vessel, a form of sorts”; 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and that’s where Enki and Enlil come in. Now, Enlil was more developed in designing 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the--let’s call it, for instance, ‘what was exactly required for this physical vessel to  

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:28.000
be sustained on this manifested planet.’ You know, for instance, the hairs you have on  

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
your physical body, what it does--your eyes, your eyelids, your hair--things like that.  

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000
In terms of the actual female/male manifestation, like the vagina and the penis--didn’t exist yet. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Firstly, it was merely really just very straight manifestations. You didn’t see, like, the elbow;  

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it [arm] was basically straight. Yet, it was able to move [bend where the elbow is];  

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it was one movement. You didn’t have this little knob there [grabs the ‘knob’ of the elbow].  

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The hands were also very straight, very strong; bigger, actually, than the physical manifestation. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The head was just a normal round head. You had eyes, of course.  

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Okay, I’ll continue in my next interview.   Thanks.
