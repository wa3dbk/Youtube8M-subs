00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:03.940
You watching Unicef television.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.759
Anxious Indian mothers take their turn
to weigh their babies, withered and weak

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.129
barely big enough to tip the scales.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.169
This is the leanest of seasons and all
twenty five children here in this

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.429
nutritional rehabilitation center in Shivpuri,

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.369
are dangerously malnourished by any measure.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.949
There are a hundred centers like this
supported by UNICEF in the state of

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.719
Madhya Pradesh.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:31.150
At the of best of times sixty percent of
all under fives (under 5 years) are malnourished here.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.160
Mostly from vulnerable castes and tribes.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.240
Now with the latest food crisis, many more are being admitted.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.720
Monsoon rains have failed for the
past five years pushing people to the edge. Food 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.370
is a battleground between man and beast, every scrap counts.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.729
For Sunita`s family wheat stocks are running out.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.799
With the price of other staples like
rice almost doubled in six months,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.760
she is left to make stark choices.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.520
Her children are drained and hungry.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.500
Sunita`s son is two years old but
cannot walk.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.750
He was once at deaths door.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.830
At the community center here, his sisters relish a mid-day meal and thats all they will get and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.220
they're not alone.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.810
This year's seventy two percent of
children in the village of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.509
are malnourished. Last year sixty percent
were.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.509
Yet even in a crisis, old traditions and
beliefs die hard.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:16.569
This family had a long walk, in the heat and dust, to the temple, to give thanks for their

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.959
baby boy.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.010
They live on just fifteen hundred
rupees or forty dollars a month.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.259
But they've been saving for a full year
to feed their Gods.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.430
This current food crisis in india

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.530
has opened the lid of what lies behind
child malnutrition and that's it will take more

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.999
than the cost of food.
