00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.250
Welcome to 2 minute neuroscience, where I
simplistically explain neuroscience topics

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.850
in 2 minutes or less.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.130
In this installment I will discuss the divisions
of the nervous system.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.600
There are two major divisions of the nervous
system.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.090
The first is the central nervous system, which
is made up of the brain and the spinal cord.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.160
The second is the peripheral nervous system,
which consists of nerves that run throughout

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950
the body.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.330
The peripheral nervous system itself is made
up of two subdivisions.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.660
The first is the somatic nervous system, which
contains nerves that carry sensory signals

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.690
from the body to the central nervous system
and nerves that carry motor signals from the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.260
central nervous system to skeletal muscles.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.510
The somatic nervous system is associated with
voluntary movement.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.960
When you clicked on this video to play it,
the signal to depress your finger was sent

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.100
from your brain to your finger via the somatic
nervous system.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.989
The second division of the peripheral nervous
system is the autonomic nervous system.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.960
The autonomic nervous system is sometimes
called the involuntary nervous system, and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.300
it is involved in regulating the internal
environment of the body.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.780
It carries signals from internal organs to
the central nervous system and from the central

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.119
nervous system to the internal organs.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.159
In this way, it is involved in regulating
things like digestion and heartbeat, which

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.549
are generally outside the realm of conscious
control.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.579
The autonomic nervous system can be further
subdivided into sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.109
nerve fibers.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.960
The sympathetic nervous system plays a large
role in stimulating and mobilizing energy

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.969
resources, while the parasympathetic nervous
system acts to conserve energy.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.580
For example, if you are in a frightening situation,
the sympathetic nervous system will cause

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.570
your heart rate to increase, your blood pressure
to increase, and your sweat glands to be stimulated.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.280
If you are eating a meal, however, and are
not frightened, your parasympathetic nervous

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.909
system will stimulate digestion, increase
salivation, and slow your heart rate.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.709
Due to these functions, the sympathetic nervous
system is often described as being involved

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.270
in fight or flight responses, while the parasympathetic
nervous system is described as being involved

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.979
in rest and digest responses.
