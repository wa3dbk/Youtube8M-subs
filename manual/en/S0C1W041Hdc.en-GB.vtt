00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:18.130
I've decided to support this campaign simply
because it's Birmingham. I love Birmingham.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.520
Education is a big part of anyone's growing
up into life and also sport. Sport's been

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.619
a great part of my life; I've always loved
and played sport and I got very lucky to play

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.550
it at a great level.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.890
The new sports centre would have made a huge
difference to me, even though when I played

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.170
my sport it was in a different era, but to
have facilities where you can channelled and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.850
directed and inspired and motivated, that's
what great facilities does for sports people

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.809
and athletes --not just the top ones but even
the ones that are coming through. Modern day

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.920
sportsmen need to have great facilities to
show to the athletes that you care about their

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.619
development and that's what great facilities
such as this one are going to offer.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.149
Benefits to the West Midlands and Birmingham
at large is paramount. It's a great city,

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:22.049
Birmingham. It's my home, I love this place
but by and large, the training facilities

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.600
and health and fitness areas in Birmingham
are lacking, sadly. For the second city in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.530
this country they are poor, so this facility
here at the university, that the university

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.700
are building, are very much needed and required
and needed urgently. So for me it can't come

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.700
sooner.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700
What would it mean to have the gym named after
you?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.119
I really feel as though the naming of the
gym should actually, as much as it would be

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.969
a great honour, it absolutely would be an
honour and I would be -- I think it should

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:02.259
probably go to someone, one of the university
alumnis who have obviously had a much bigger

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.170
connection to the university than I have.
So I support the campaign absolutely wholeheartedly

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.280
but as for me, perhaps a table in the bar
or cafeteria or something like that might

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:25.230
be more appropriate for me than actually the
gym itself.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:35.480
Can I go now? [laughing]
