00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.759
If you're like most Americans, or most
people around the world for that matter

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.179
you wake up every morning 
saying "How do I keep President Obama from

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.399
reading my email?"

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:14.089
Well the Russians have come up with an
answer.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.419
They are  buying typewriters for all of their 
secret agents and heads of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.859
their other diabolical agencies.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.029
These folks are all going to use typewriters so
that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.189
they won't be part of the Internet and
people can't read everything they say.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
But,  if you're under fifty, you may ask
yourself

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.910
"What is the world is a typewriter?" Luckily, I  
know what a typewriter iis.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.280
I started using typewriters in the late
nineteen forties I've never stopped

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.680
and I'm here to tell you all about them.  First
we're gonna look at

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.899
some old typewriters so you will get a sense of the history of this wonderful machine,

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.519
and then I'll teach you how to type on a
real

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.570
machine. a typewriter.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.879
This is an Oliver.  This was the most popular

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.269
desk machine for businesses just after

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.390
the her turn-of-the-century. you see
the keys came straight down from the top

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.390
with a very

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.000
easy motion: "Whap!" They made this
wonderful whapping sound.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.200
That's what we've lost with computers: No Whap!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.690
I mean people from Aristotle to

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.150
to Hemmingway enjoyed  that whap.   Well maybe
Aristotle is

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.400
pushing things back a bit far, but typewriters were invented in

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.510
the 1870's, and since then people enjoyed that whap.  And now we don't have the damn

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.810
whap.  Well, what are you going to do. Whap, Whap, Whap.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.260
Now the guy who owned this company --- I suppose his name was "Oliver,"

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.960
but I"m not actually quite sure of that ---

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.880
had this best-selling typewriter.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.570
It was the standard office typewriter.  But he 
was tired

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.940
of  paying commissions to people sold
in stores really so he decided to sell them  by

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.280
direct mail

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.940
That didn't work.  He  went bankrupt or at
any rate it fell off the face of the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.520
earth.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.410
That's why you haven't seen very many of
these machines. They're still perfectly

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.120
good

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.120
They have this very easy motion. This was what we call
a "top writer."

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.579
This is an LC Smith.  Another very popular machine
at the same  time, the

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.369
turn-of-the-century but unlike the Oliver  it kept going.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.019
L.C. Smith became Smith Corona and is still actve in 
the office

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.530
machine business.  This is a great typewriter.  This is the typewriter

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.840
I  learned to use.   They kept
making them for another fifty or sixty years

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.599
pretty much the same.  The colors
change but the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.709
"operating system" --- as we say --- was the
same ---

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.419
wonderful machine. Now, just to get
some sense at all the options that were

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.239
available

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.859
back around 1910, look at this thing.  "What is that?"

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.950
Well this is a wonderful Corona portable.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.659
It folds up goes in a little case but

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.939
unfold it and you have a great machine.
This is something that if you were

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.109
an author  hobnobbing with the rich
and famous

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.430
and. you know, going to whatever, this club or 
that club in New York

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.209
you probably had one of these if it was 
1910 or so.  Notice that if only has three

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.310
rows of keys.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.370
And it has two shift keys.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.420
There was some variation in what we
might call the "operating systems"

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.129
at the turn of the century. Some people
like two shift keys and

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.139
just three rows of keys.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.490
So  could get all the symbols
with just three rows of keys.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.639
But what won out was four rows of keys with

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.370
just one shift key which we still have
on the modern computer.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.189
This is my lovely granddaughter Jamaica and I'm going to
teach her to type on a typewriter.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.799
She's sitting in front of my roll-top
desk which is also a little bit of an antique.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.269
Now we've got two typewriters here
from what I consider the golden age of typewriters ---

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.389
 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.939
thats from the twenties through the
fifties, when

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.460
every decent author had a portable
typewriter.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.859
This is one from more like the forties
and fifties. you can see is not black enamel

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:05.569
 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.560
It's kind of  gray.  It is a very nice
typewriter but the keys don't have

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.650
kinda nice look to them that the older
ones had.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.780
And then in the fifties they began
making these in pastel ---

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.940
ugh.  Then we went into electric
typewriters in various kinds of depraved

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.450
things like that, and finally to computers.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.260
This, on the other hand, is a
typewriter that Hemingway might have

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.530
used. This is a Corona portable,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.230
black enamel, just a wonderful machine.
This is what I do all my writing on.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.830
Of course I have to then do another draft
on a computer,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.980
but this is the one that's fun because
you have

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.040
the Whap Whap Whap and you get to feel the keys hitting the paper.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.140
 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.120
So, Jamaica, it's pretty clear how to use it.  Do you 
have any questions?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.310
How  you how do you plug it in?
There's no
way to plug it in because there is no need to plug it in.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.410
I do.  How  you how do you plug it in?
There's no
way to plug it in because there is no need to plug it in.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.100
 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.750
OK.  How do you turn it on, though?

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.900
Well you don't need to turn it on;
there's no on/off switch

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.450
Where's the command key then?
There is no
command key --- none whatsoever!

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.220
Well, how can I change
this font?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.820
Well you don't choose a font. That's 
 a tremendous

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.890
time saver because when you sit down you
can't spend the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.690
first two hours every morning deciding
which font you are going to work in for the day,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.430
 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.010
because you have absolutely no choice
whatsoever.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.620
Okay. Well then how do I print ?

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.700
Printing is built right in!   That's the charm
of these things,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.040
they have a built-in printer.  You don't need wires, you don't need WiFi.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.400
That's the great thing about
typewriters; that's the charm

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.310
of typewriters, that's what's been lost with computers

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.270
You just push they keys and it prints.   Try
it!
(Under her breath)  Oh My Gosh!

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.550

living through

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.150
laziness and sloth, you can go to my
