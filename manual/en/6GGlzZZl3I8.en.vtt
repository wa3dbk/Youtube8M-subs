00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
Last week we started a mini series in the
Crochet for Knitters series, and I showed

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.430
you how to work a crocheted scalloped edge
to add to your knitted pieces.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.590
And like I said last week, if you get nothing
else out of this series, I think crocheted

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.600
edgings are the most useful part of crochet
– combining crochet and knitting together.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.790
This week I’m going to show you how to do
a picot edging.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.280
Which is definitely the frilliest and girliest
of my favorite crocheted edgings.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.050
There are a lot of them out there that can
get really complicated.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
The ones that I’m showing you are the ones
that I like the best because they’re simple,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.739
and you get a lot of bang for your buck as
far as impact goes, with the way that it looks

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.780
on the finished piece.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.320
Let’s go ahead and take a look.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
Here’s a finished picot edging.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.609
It’s very pretty.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.850
And last week – you can see the difference.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.129
These two knitted pieces are identical, and
you can see how different the pieces are when

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.000
you add the different edgings to it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590
And I’ll give you a link if you didn’t
see the scalloped edge video.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.490
I’ll give you a link to that one.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.340
But this is the picot edge we’re working
on this time.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.100
Let me go ahead and show you how it’s done.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.850
The stitch that we have in the middle, on
all of the pieces, is what I call long moss

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.850
stitch.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.049
And I’ll give you instructions for that
in the video description below.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.289
And to work, um, this edging, I’m going
to start here in the bind off row.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.630
I’m going to go under both legs of one of
the Vs and pull up a loop.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.390
And then chain one, and that’s going to
count as my first single crochet stitch.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.860
And then I’m going to work a single crochet
into the following stitch.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.369
So I go under both legs of the V, grab the
yarn pull up a loop, grab the yarn pull through

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.369
both.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.970
And if you need a slower review of the single
crochet stitch, I’ll give you a link right

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.970
here.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.340
Okay, this is where the picot starts.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.210
I’m going to chain three, and you take a
look at those chain stitches, and they look

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.360
like knit stitches, they look like Vs.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.830
We’re going to stab into the left leg of
the first chain stitch, the bottom one.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.599
Stab into there, grab the yarn pull up a loop,
grab the yarn pull through both.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.940
Okay.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.140
Then I skip the next stitch on the knitted
piece, I’m going to work a single crochet

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.540
into the following stitch.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.209
And a single crochet into he one after that.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.870
And now once again, I chain three.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.959
Stab into the left leg of the first chain,
grab the yarn pull up a loop, grab the yarn

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.989
pull through both.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.800
Skip the next stitch.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.019
Two single crochets into the two following
stitches.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.349
Chain three.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.890
Stab into the first chain.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.310
Whoops.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.569
Okay, let’s go ahead and take a look.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.140
You see the fancy little edge there!

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.599
One more thing I want to show you.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.810
I’ve been chaining three.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.470
For a bigger, loopier, maybe even frillier
look, you can chain five.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:55.770
And then the rest of it is just the same.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.730
You can see the difference between – this
is all very bulky, of course.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.959
You can see the difference between chain three
and chain five.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.860
You have a much bigger picot edge.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.189
Now, um, in this example I am using the same
weight of yarn in the knitted piece, and in

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.530
the edging, and I’m using a crochet hook
that is the same size as the knitting needle

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.160
I used to knit this.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.090
So the gauge works out well for this combination.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.440
If you’re going to use a lighter yarn or
a heavier yarn, or a different sized crochet

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.080
hook, your gauge might not work out like this,
but it’s so easy to figure out.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.740
All you have to do is work up a few stitches
like I have here, and if you find that your

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.190
knitted work is bunching, you’re probably
going to need to spread out your edging a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.190
bit more.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.930
Or if you find that this is bunching – well,
did I just get that backwards?

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.330
If the knitted work is bunching, you want
to spread out the knitted work a bit more,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.530
and if this is bunching, you want to spread
out the edging out a bit more.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.431
Regardless, it’s so easy to just work up
a little bit, see if it’s lying flat, if

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:03.000
it’s not, look at how easy it is to undo
it and recover one loop.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.960
Then, instead of skipping one, you might find
it’s necessary to skip two to spread out

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.400
the edging a little bit, etc.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.690
And then also, these crocheted edgings are
so easy and forgiving with just one loop like

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.680
that, because you can – you might find that
the number of stitches you have in your knitted

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.680
work doesn’t match up to the multiple of
the edging.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.670
And really all that takes is a little bit
of fudging, to skip an extra stitch or two

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.970
somewhere along the edge, to get it so that
it works out and it looks even when it’s

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.970
done.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.620
Now, no one else in the world would probably
notice this, but I happen to know that I fudged

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.050
one right here, I worked an extra stitch in
right here, to make it so that my count was

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.320
right going all the way around.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.680
And this is the back of the picot stitch.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.990
It’s also very pretty.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.310
Actually kind of more rugged looking.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.310
And that’s it.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.819
A simple picot edging.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.009
I’m working on next week’s video right
now, and you’re not going to want to miss

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.009
it!

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.280
You should probably subscribe to make sure
that you don’t.
