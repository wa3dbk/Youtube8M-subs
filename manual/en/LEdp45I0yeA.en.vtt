00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.540
Hi, this is Sveta.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.600
She has some problems with coordination

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.320
compliance with  the rules and self-preservation instinct.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.060
Thus is no wonder that she got lost in the forest even before 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.920
this video get to the point.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.000
But luckily Sveta has has the unique ability obtained 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040
after many years of experience. 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.480
She can get away with it.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.680
Simply put, she can survive in the most ridiculous

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.540
most absurd and most inappropriate conditions.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.540
And today she is going to share her experiences with you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.600
HOW TO SURVIVE IN THE FOREST
 (THE MOST USELESS  ADVICES)

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, you can find everything you need

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.760
for surviving in the forest.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
Most important is to know what to look for and where.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.250
This is bur, for example. You can make very

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.039
tasty and healthy tea from it. For this, take 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.210
the pot from the nearest bush. Usualy they appear after

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 the rain and with fresh water in it. To brew a tea,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.149
 try to make a fire.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.030
This method looks very difficult, dangerous and impractical,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.030
because it is so.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.339
If you did not manage to make a fire, you can heat up the pot another way.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.839
 You would not drink cold tea, indeed.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800
 For this you need a mobile phone or tablet

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.920
Try to use the most powerful game for maximum battery heat.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
If it will discharge with 1% per second, 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
then you are on a right way.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.320
Sveta managed to heat battery up to 100C thanks to 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.800
"plants vs zombies" and she was able to make a fire.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.280
So, now she has to play the real game... 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280
А life-and-death game...

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.080
- I am hungry.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.180
 Sveta is hungry and she started to search for food.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.560
- I found glade with wild strawberry. In the forest, there is a lot of 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.800
 vegetation which will not let you starve.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.210
most importantly, make sure that there is no

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.690
yellow liquid on berries, because it does not taste good:

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.710
wild strawberries with orange juice!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.080
it's getting dark and time too look for place to sleep. Fortunately, Sveta knows how to do it!

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.280
 If "Hunger Games" ever taught us enything, 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.140
this is the fact that it is safer to sleep on trees.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.740
Try to find small and uncomfortable tree.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.380
Because if you feel hard to climb it, 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.840
your enemy from second district will feel it more.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.860
- You know, if you still alive, then you can sleep on the ground.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.209
In The Morning collect dew and greet the sun for 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.601
to charge yourself with energy for all day.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:35.621
- Seriously this is the only useful advice in this video.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.540
Now when you have mastered the basic rules of survival

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 it is the time to find way home.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.400
- For a start, try to determine 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160
where is north.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.680
 Moss on the trees can indicate it. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.000
 Most likely, this method will be useless because you have no idea where is your home.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 But if you  define the location,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.140
 then go north if you are in Eurasia and South America,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.660
  and to the south if you are in Australia, Africa and North America, 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.460
 because it's warmer there.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.440
- If you have a beautiful voice, you can summon animals, which will bring you food.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.540
Strangely, I saw in one cartoon  that it works.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 I don`t know what I do wrong.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.460
And lastly, try to make your stay in the forest

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.720
 most unbearable, 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.560
because otherwise...

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.180
 you are going to like it so much....

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.760
- Sveta! My sister is it you? Oh my God! We searched everywhere for you! Let`s go!

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.860
- What`s wrong! Do you recognize me? 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.720
Let`s go! There is internet in home.Your 15 000 subscribers are waiting for you.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.660
You will make video againe.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.900
...that you would  not want to return...

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.220
Apparently Svete  will no longer shoot videos,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.500
 so now I am her sister  will do it instead.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.060
 I think, that you will not notice any difference, because I am  as beautiful as her just my character is better.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.080
So watch old video with Sveta and subscribe to new videos with me! 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.360
 They will be more cool!
