00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.109
Today we're going to be changing the fluid
in our four wheel drive transfer case. In

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.580
this step, I'm going to demonstrate the proper
service procedure for locating your drain

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.500
plug and draining the fluid from your transfer
case. I'm going to go ahead and roll underneath

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:27.470
right now. You are going to want to make sure
to take your ratchet with you and your magnetic

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.809
tray. Alright. When it comes to locating your
drain plug, the drain plug is going to be

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.449
on the bottom side of the transfer case either
on the right side or the left side. This one

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.809
happens to be located right here. And on the
casting right under Board Warner Automotive,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.929
it says, "drain". Now it's also going to be
indicated by the square fitting that your

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:58.909
extension would fit into. Right there. It
will always be located on the drain or on

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.260
the bottom side, so your fluid will drain
out by gravity. I'm going to take and slip

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.310
my ratchet in. It's going to be a lefty loosey.
Righty tighty tight device. I'm going ahead

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.650
leave my extension inside and slip my drain
plug in the way. Now this is supposed to be

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.290
automatic transmission fluid which has a nice
kind of like a pink Kool-Aid look to it. As

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:48.470
you can see this stuff is severely degraded
and really needed changed. Since it's such

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.080
a small device. The capacity on this is 1.5
quarts. Since it's such a small device. You're

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.510
going to want to drain out as much of the
fluid has possible. So let it go until it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:09.679
stops a dripping.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.209
Once it's done draining. You can go ahead
and insert your drain plug back into the hole

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:26.659
and run it down hand tight. There we go and
we take and plug my ratchet back in and tighten

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.950
it down. You got to remember you're tightening
down into it cast aluminum case with a steel

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.909
plug. So be gentle. Only tight enough to keep
the fluid inside. Don't over tighten it. It's

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:46.849
not a load bearing structure. So over torquing
it will damage it. Right there. That is the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.689
proper service procedure for locating a drain
plug and draining the fluid from the transfer

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:53.219
case itself.
