00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.220
In this episode of alley cat university
we will take you through the steps

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.440
needed to connect your Alicat device
with your computer serial port and

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.920
conduct basic functions to the serial
terminal program.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.900
Things you'll need: your Alicat device, a computer with a serial port and an active internet

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.070
connection, a serial communications cable, called the MD8 DB9, an AC to DC

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.060
power supply such as, Alicat's PVPS
24U.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.240
Many computers these days don't come equipped with serial ports. In their place an RS232 to USB converter can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.300
be used, such as the Belkin F5U 409
pictured here.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.840
First plug in your power supply to the AC wall outlet.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.600
Now place the power plug into the top of your Alicat device.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.640
Next let's verify the communication settings by using the

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.200
front panel buttons to navigate to the
comm RS232 menu. Verify the following

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.010
parameters: the unit ID, the baud rate and
the data rate press the button labeled

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:31.229
main to return to the main screen. Using
your MD 8 DB9 cable plug the d-sub side

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.380
of the cable into an available serial
port on the back of your computer.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.200
If your computer's not equipped with a
serial port you can use the USB to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.850
serial adapter to make the connection.
First plug in the USB side of it to the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.399
computer. At this point you may need to
install drivers in order to support the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.500
USB adapter. Now take the other end of
the adapter and plug in your MD 8 DB9

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.189
cable on the d-sub side secure it using
the two screws.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.340
Finally take the 8-pin mini-din side of
the cable and plug it into the top of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.580
your Alicat. Now that all the physical
connections are made between your

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.879
Alicat device, in your computer we need to download the appropriate communication

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:29.590
software from the Alicat website.
navigate to www.AlicatScientific.com. Once

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.450
there click on the support link, then
scroll down and click on the software

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.960
link. Now download the serial terminal
program to your computer.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.480
With the serial terminal program unzipped to the location of your choice, execute the file

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.260
and note first that the program will ask
you for the comport number that is being

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.099
used by this connection. Type in this
number followed by the Enter key.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.500
In our example the ComPort is number 1
because we have already confirmed our

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.670
unit identifier as being the letter A.
For this unit simply type the letter A

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.510
followed by the enter key. You can now
repeat these keystrokes and receive a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.239
line of data each time an enter is typed.

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.630
If you are unable to locate a
functioning ComPort on your computer,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.819
you can download a simple program to
help diagnose the problem. Navigate once

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.419
more to Alicat software page and
click on the software link for the

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.669
ComPort troubleshooter. Here is how the
program works: once executed, you will be

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.290
presented with a listing of available
ports, by number. Yhen simply enter which

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.489
port number you'd like to test, the unit
ID of the Alicat device and a wait

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.950
time in milliseconds. 100 milliseconds is
a good starting point. Continue testing

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.989
each port until you receive back a line
of data from your Alicat device. Note

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.560
which port had a successful
communication and use this number for

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.260
your serial terminal setup as described
earlier in this video.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.980
This concludes our basic serial
communications tutorial. If you have any

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.550
further questions on this topic, don't
hesitate to ask us via phone or email

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.480
