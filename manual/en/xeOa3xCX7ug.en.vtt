this JCB truck is made from a dozen syringes
and saline tubes. such trucks are used for

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.170
moving earth. join two syringes with tube
filled with water. by pushing one syringe

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.320
other gets pushed too. now make a hydraulic
jack. fix two syringes in a CD box. lift and

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:31.249
lower a truck with an hydraulic jack. this
JCB performs many actions. the first plunger

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.220
makes the jib move up and down. this is the
closeup view. the second plunger makes the

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.580
bucket to swivel. this is the closeup view
of the bucket swiveling. the third plunger

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.720
makes the whole crane move left or right.
here is the closeup view. the JCB can move

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.630
on wheels. the fourth plunger lifts the front
wheel by two jacks. the fifth plunger moves

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.420
the boom up and down. the JCB performs multiple
motions. you can now see the JCB pick a bundle

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.459
of grass, lift it, turn it and keep it aside.
