00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.919
bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: And to a second science
story about developments in growing new tissue

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.120
to replace damaged skin.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.580
Our story was a collaboration by two PBS stations,
produced by Perry Stoner of NET Nebraska and

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.180
narrated by Andrea Kissack of KQED-San Francisco's
"Quest" science program.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.200
And a warning: This story contains some graphic
images.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.450
ANDREA KISSACK, KQED: Leigh Gramke has felt
at home on the softball field for as long

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.450
as she can remember.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.360
LEIGH GRAMKE, burn victim: T-ball when I was
like kindergarten, first grade, a long time

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.360
ago.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.330
MAN: The shortstop, number 12, Leigh Gramke.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.989
ANDREA KISSACK: She ended high school as one
of the state's best players, earning a spot

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.190
in the Nebraska All-Star Game.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.540
In December of 2010, life changed for Gramke
in many ways.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:01.411
LEIGH GRAMKE: I was coming home after a night
and just lost control of my car and went into

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.860
a creek, and the car caught on fire.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.960
A couple just happened to be following me
and saw my lights disappear and pulled me

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.689
out of the vehicle and saved my life.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.490
ANDREA KISSACK: The accident left her with
burns on 40 percent of her body and put her

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.000
on a long road to recovery.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.590
In the U.S., about 450,000 people every year
require medical treatment for burns.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.180
About 45,000 are like Gramke, requiring specialized
care at a burn center.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.180
DR.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270
DAVID VOIGT, Saint Elizabeth Regional Medical
Center: What we talk about is the scar formation.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.149
ANDREA KISSACK: Dr. David Voigt is burn center
co-director and surgeon at Saint Elizabeth

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.299
Regional Medical Center in Lincoln, Nebraska.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.740
He says that, currently, the best treatment
for serious burns is skin grafting.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.090
That's the progress of using a patient's own
skin from an undamaged part of the body to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.939
replaced burned skin.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.370
It's done by removing a layer four-one-thousandths-of-an-inch
thick and hoping it will mesh the two skin

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.370
layers.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.370
DR.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.951
DAVID VOIGT: We obviously can't take very
thick grafts, or else we cause a wound that

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:14.450
won't heal at the donor site, okay?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.770
So the thinner the graft when we place it
on the burn, the more likely it is to contract

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.720
a scar.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.840
Also, the donor sites, they can contract and
scar as well.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840
So that's the downside.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.230
So, if you have a 30 percent burn, you're
going to end up with a 60 percent wound.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.010
ANDREA KISSACK: And skin grafting, which has
been the standard treatment for more than

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.260
60 years, comes with other concerns.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.030
Infections occur during the healing process,
and scarring creates problems that are more

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.030
than just cosmetic.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.030
DR.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.760
MARK CARLSON, University of Nebraska Medical
Center: The scar that comes after an injury

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.180
doesn't resemble the skin.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.470
It doesn't function like skin.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.069
It doesn't stretch.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.270
It doesn't sweat.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.760
ANDREA KISSACK: Dr. Mark Carlson is a surgeon
with dual appointment at the University of

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.160
Nebraska Medical Center and Veterans Administration
Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.580
His lab is one of thousands around the world
attempting to devise better skin replacement

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
techniques.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.580
DR.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.060
MARK CARLSON: One of the important aspects
in wound healing is how much protein, particularly

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.910
collagen, a cell is going to make to aid in
the process of healing.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.019
Based on the results we get with these test
tube experiments, we then try to optimize

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.440
the design of the -- that -- the skin replacement
to put into a living subject.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.970
ANDREA KISSACK: In his research lab, Carlson
is working on a spray-on liquid bandage, which

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.530
could help address the wound healing challenge.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.530
DR.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.930
MARK CARLSON: The liquid bandage is made of
a sugar molecule, a chain of sugar molecules

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.409
hooked together called a polymer.

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.670
It forms a backbone or a matrix.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.840
The body can absorb this, so it's not like
a cotton bandage, where you have to put on

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840
and take off.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.939
You can put this bandage on and leave it there.

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:19.530
ANDREA KISSACK: The liquid bandage research
is part of a project funded by the Department

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.620
of Defense.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.440
The goal is to quickly stop blood loss, which
could save lives on the battlefield.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.830
Carlson's liquid bandage is successfully doing
that on animals in his lab.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.780
The white areas on this pig liver are areas
where liquid bandage stop bleeding.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.259
He calls it a starting point for growing new
skin.

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.530
If he's able to successfully add cells and
growth factors, the bandage could one day

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.050
also regenerate tissue.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.050
DR.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.500
MARK CARLSON: A lot of people call that the
Holy Grail of wound healing.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.030
You know, instead of getting a scar, you get
regeneration.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.660
We're not there yet, but that's kind of the
big picture.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.120
ANDREA KISSACK: While Carlson is trying to
heal wounds from the skin's surface, another

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.030
group of researchers is approaching skin regeneration
from deep inside the body's cells.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.570
At Nature Technology Corporation in Lincoln,
Nebraska, scientists like Clague Hodgson are

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.030
working with DNA to develop new ways to treat
burns or diseases.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.259
MAN: So, it looks like you got a pretty good
yield on this batch.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.130
WOMAN: Yes, I believe so.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.900
ANDREA KISSACK: They have developed genetic
engineering manufacturing called HyperGrow.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.479
It could be a way to dramatically increase
the yield of therapies and vaccines to make

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.760
them affordable for patients who urgently
need them.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.530
For wound injuries, it could shorten the recovery
period.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.880
But all research has a long road before any
products are approved for use in the real

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.880
world.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.880
DR.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.680
MARK CARLSON: In the last 50 years or so of
biomedical research, there's just numerous

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.130
examples of therapies which have been touted,
then when taken to, say, a large animal model

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.060
or even to patients, falls completely flat
and fails.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.360
And then you never hear about it again.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.810
ANDREA KISSACK: Dr. Carlson isn't yet sure
if his liquid bandage approach will make it

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.639
that far either.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.220
But he's encouraged by the amount of research
addressing the issue in biomedical labs in

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.270
Nebraska and around the globe.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.930
For burn victims like Leigh Gramke, tissue
regeneration research could allow them to

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.789
get back in the game of life much sooner.

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.330
LEIGH GRAMKE: Seeing other people run and
going to the gym and doing stuff, I kind of

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.800
want to do that again.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
So.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.750
. . ANDREA KISSACK: And although Gramke probably
won't be able to resume her college softball

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.300
career, she's hoping, by next summer, she
will be spending a lot more time playing the

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.540
game she loves with friends.
