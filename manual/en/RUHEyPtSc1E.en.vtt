&gt;&gt;Amil Gargano: I was born in 1932.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.330
Technology has left me
me in pretty much in the past, largely because

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.650
I tend to ignore it.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:29.600
[jazzy music, heard over car sounds, and elevator
door dinging]

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.270
&gt;&gt;male #1: Can you give us some insight into
what your original

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.500
"Drive it like you hate it" was tapping into?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.290
&gt;&gt;Amil: "Drive it like you hate it" was visceral.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.820
It's personality.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.820
Grab people's attention.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.820
[car engine revving]

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.680
&gt;&gt;male in old commercial: Volvo gets over
25 miles per gallon of gas,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.390
just like the little economy cars.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.720
And runs away from every other
popular priced compacts in every speed range.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.050
&gt;&gt;Amil: In 1962, they were anonymous.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.460
They needed help almost everywhere,
in terms of an identity and a personality.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.130
We said let's make this car brutally real.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.290
And so what happened is that Volvo sales began
to soar.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.899
Up, maybe triple of what it was,
in a four or five year period.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.880
God, I remember getting in the car
with this rally driver.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.310
He said, "Amil, would you like to go for a
spin?"

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.310
[laughter]

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.540
I thought it was the dumbest decision of my
life.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.729
This guy drove like a maniac.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.630
&gt;&gt;male in old commercial: And you can drive
a Volvo like you hate it.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.139
[thump]
Cheaper than psychiatry.

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:34.139
[people laugh]

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.139
&gt;&gt;Amil: This was on YouTube?

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:36.139
&gt;&gt;male #2: This was on YouTube.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:37.139
Yeah, we can look at

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.702
[many chattering voices] yeah, you can see
[unintelligible chatter]

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.380
&gt;&gt;female #1: You can probably see all of your
old work up on YouTube.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.319
You just need to search it.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.789
[Guitar strumming quickly]

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.679
&gt;&gt;Amil: What drives it from 5,000 hits to
the millions?

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.229
What, what process...it can't be word of mouth,
can it?

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.659
What is it that, what is , what is the process
that makes this thing expand

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.659
at such an incredible speed?

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.020
&gt;&gt;female #1: In posting, in like "Oh this
is so amusing it makes me laugh",

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.429
you know, and all of your followers see that.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.310
&gt;&gt;male #3: Now we know who has actually seen
this video.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.060
Where they are seeing it.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.680
What sites did they come from.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.209
&gt;&gt;Amil: Let's keep it hugely informal.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.489
We don't have to worry
about protocols or courtesies of any kind.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.340
First, let's articulate
an objective, then a strategy, then let's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.620
look at the work
to see if the work meets both of those criteria.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.569
&gt;&gt;Aman Govil: He kept telling us every step
like "But why do people buy cars?

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.569
Why, how do you compare it to other cars?"

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.310
He didn't push us towards his ad,
he didn't talk about his ad at all.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.910
He kept going back to the car and how do we
bring out the relationship between you and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.910
the car.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.060
&gt;&gt;male #4: I think we are trying to crack
two things.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.440
One is, um, reimagine this ad, but also to
prove how amazing

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.620
that, that, that contextual advertising could
be or...

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.739
&gt;&gt;Amil: Have you considered taking an actual
owner,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.860
who may have 240,000 miles on a Volvo?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.489
&gt;&gt;male #5: I was looking at the Volvo 100,000
mile club,

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.760
and the guy who started that is a guy who
has 2.7 million miles on his Volvo, one Volvo

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
&gt;&gt;[group cheers] Whoa...

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760
&gt;&gt;male #5: One Volvo.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150
&gt;&gt;Amil: Theres, that's where you sh..., there's
the guy.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.260
You have to get a hold of that guy,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.569
&gt;&gt;male #5 He's, he's in New York.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.959
&gt;&gt;Amil: That to me is great advertising.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.629
When you can take something like that,
and turn that into a nice piece of human film.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.959
That's a great story, boy, that is, that's,
that's real substance.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.959
That's wonderful.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:33.959
[group chuckles]

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.760
&gt;&gt;male #4: How do we tailor that for a banner?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.519
&gt;&gt;Amil: That's your job.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.519
[group laughs]

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.599
&gt;&gt;male #4: Well I mean....

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.599
[guitar strumming]

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.069
&gt;&gt;Amil: The act, the act of just trying to
create something.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.709
And you think
what can I do to make it better?

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.030
What can I do to make myself happy?

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.420
And I think that's the first requirement.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.870
If you make yourself happy,
there's a good chance you'll make someone

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.870
else happy.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.610
And if you're cynical enough to belief that
you're not,

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.560
you're not very convinced about what you're
doing,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.060
but you can convince someone else about what
you're doing, then you're dead.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.450
[guitar strumming]
[oices chattering in background]

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.120
&gt;&gt;Amil: Hi, Amil Gargano.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.530
[voices talking quietly]

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.769
&gt;&gt;Amil: I thought at first, why would anyone
want to go back

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.580
and look at an ad that was done almost fifty
years ago?

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.280
And I thought well,
my goodness, it's an interesting idea that

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.390
someone would try to resurrect
work and see if they could use that as a bridge

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.100
to, uh, the current Volvo marketing, and strategic
considerations.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.750
&gt;&gt;male #1: And when we stumbled on this, this
story of Gordon.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.150
We thought, could there be a better
testament to what Amil was talking about in

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.550
that original advertising back in 1963?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.040
Obviously, we're
looking at this immense relationship that

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.130
he's had with this car, right?

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.539
One hundred and ten tires,
four hundred forty spark plugs, two thousand

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.480
one hundred and forty-three quarts of oil,
and what it really boils down to is three

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.030
million miles worth of memories, right?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.669
So, we've got this huge emotional jackpot,
and using Google Display technology,

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.770
we can actually send those stories direct
to the person they're going to be relevant

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.770
to.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.629
&gt;&gt;Aman Govil: Every ad is a self-contained
story,

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.289
but then you know, you can follow the car
along as it's breaking the record.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.861
Like it's almost a live-streaming from the
car.

00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:17.861
&gt;&gt;Linda Gangeri: Right.

00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:18.861
&gt;&gt;male #5 The car is always...

00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.861
&gt;&gt;Linda Gangeri: The star.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.861
&gt;&gt;male #5: The star of the thing.

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:24.009
Maybe we could actually outfit
his car, to, to, you know, count where he

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.990
is in this reliving of the story,
and then counting up towards three million.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.990
&gt;&gt;Linda Gangeri: So...

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.639
&gt;&gt;male #5: We'll do it very carefully so Irv
won't

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.639
[group laughs]

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.639
&gt;&gt;Linda Gangeri: be too upset [she laughs]

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.639
&gt;&gt;male #5: get too upset but...

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.139
&gt;&gt;Amil: This group has put together, uh, excellent
work, I must say.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.310
And I can say that completely detached, because
I have no vested interest

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.460
in their careers.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.569
[everyone laughs loudly]

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:50.060
&gt;&gt;Linda Gangeri: Honestly, I feel like you
were inside some think tank room with us.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.880
[laughs]
Because, uh, it's, it's so aligned with, um,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.620
we're a humanity brand,
and this is humanity at its best.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.550
So how could you not think this is spot on?

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.190
It's brilliant.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.840
[guitar strumming]

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.300
&gt;&gt;Amil:There it is.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.410
&gt;&gt;Irv Gordon: How are ya?

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.180
&gt;&gt;Amil: Pleasure to meet you.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.849
&gt;&gt;Irv: Pleasure to meet you.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.139
&gt;&gt;Amil: Car is in beautiful shape.

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.720
Is this the P1800 or is this a different...

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720
&gt;&gt;Irv: Nah, P1800S.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720
&gt;&gt;Amil: It's the "S", okay.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.509
&gt;&gt;male #5: It's story...

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:29.200
&gt;&gt;Amil: Oh my God, I thought my wife kept
things, but...

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.270
&gt;&gt;Irv: You can drive a Volvo like you hate
it; they're built that way,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.270
they can take a lot of punishment.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.830
So, this is a hell of a book.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.830
Oh yeah, look at that.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.830
&gt;&gt;Amil: Same car...

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.830
&gt;&gt;Irv: This is mine...

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.830
&gt;&gt;Amil: yeah yeah.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.830
&gt;&gt;Irv:'65 and '66.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.830
&gt;&gt;Amil: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.830
[engine revving]

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.830
[indistinct conversation]

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.830
[music plays louder]

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.830
&gt;&gt;male #6: Okay ready?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.830
We're rolling, so action.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:51.830
[music plays, car sound interposed over top]

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:59.659
&gt;&gt;male #1: We're constructing this banner
ad for it for a tablet.

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:05.760
This is obviously a really rough Beta test,
this is almost like his odometer,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.320
so if you just that little guy across, you
can see that you actually start scrolling

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.340
through the different stories.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.230
And up here, the odometer's changing [Amil
laughs] and on...

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.230
&gt;&gt;Amil: That's funny.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.300
I think you're off to a good start.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.650
It has a nice feeling to it.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.510
There's a lot of nice warmth to the thing,
and I like his homespun kind kind of view

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.479
of life,
and, uh, the fact that you take the long road

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.530
because that may be the best way to go somewhere.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.720
[guitar strumming]

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.900
&gt;&gt;Amil: It was Marshal McLuhan who said, "The
media is the message."

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.930
And I say no, the message is the message.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.160
No matter what media you're in, think about
content.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.509
Content is what matters.

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:45.019
[guitar strumming and engine revving]
