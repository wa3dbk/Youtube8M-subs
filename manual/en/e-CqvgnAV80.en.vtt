Hey everybody, In today's video, I will be showing you how to install the XBOX Controller driver into windows.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, yeah, let me get my controller ready. I'll be right back.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Alright, so I have the controller here, and if I where to plug the controller in right now, since I already have the driver

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
software installed, it would recognize the device and just use it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I'm going to show you how to remove it if you have  a faulty- like, if you have it installed wrong, or any other means.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So go to Control Panel, or right click on Computer and click Manage. You can also go to Control Panel and go to Device Manager.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And, so here you will have your Computer Management window. Just go to Device Manager.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You will probably have- ugh... Let me actually plug it in first...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Whoops, sorry I just hit my microphone

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Alright, Umm... I-... There it is: "XBCD - Xbox Gamepad"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So you can uninstall that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Also uninstall the software.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Alright, now if I where to plug this in, it will not be able to recognize it whatsoever.
