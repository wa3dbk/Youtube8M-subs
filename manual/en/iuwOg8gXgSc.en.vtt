Recognizing a bad repair job, probably we
would see things like mending plates, screwed

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.199
onto the bottoms, where boards were splitting,
stuff like that, where they didn't actually

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.670
take them and repair them, it was just a quick
fix. We would fix that. A lot of times you'd

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:33.710
find it in upholstered goods. Say an upholsterer,
that might not be schooled in doing repairs,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.730
just upholstery, will take the only thing
that would be holding that upholstered piece

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.900
together, was the upholstery and they would
take and actually glue, some of the upholstery

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.970
on there to kind of hold the legs in place
and then they'd get their upholstery on there

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.880
and nobody would actually see anything, until
the legs started wiggling later on and then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.250
pieces break. By then you've paid all that
money, for having your upholstery work done

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.610
and you've got a piece that nobody can sit
in. What we always have recommended is that

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.049
you bring that upholstered piece to us, let
us take it apart and make sure that all the

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.710
works are in good order and that you've got
a solid frame, then take it to your upholstery

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.810
shop, or, wherever you want to have it done
and get it upholstered, after that. Then you've

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.380
got something that's going to last you for
as long as you want to keep that fabric on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:37.340
there. I have run into a lot of things where
people will put a color, like this, in a dark

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.039
Ruben Mahogany piece, like this, for lets
say a veneer repair or they'll put a rectangle,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:54.240
right here in the middle of a piece like this,
instead of using a pointed type of inlay,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.139
so that you could blend it in with your grain.
You'll find like little squares stuck into

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:05.310
the middle of a table, you'll find all kinds
of different things like that, over the years

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.260
and you don't dare say much because a lot
of times it's the wife's husband, so you don't

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.280
want to embarrass him too much. Anyway, those
are some of the things we find. We find where

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.890
the drawers were never really repaired, it
just was refinished, so your drawers, instead

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.880
of sliding in there correctly are catching
on the bottom of the drawer front so you've

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.370
got to repair those edges of all those drawer
sides and then refit the drawer, just like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.840
it's brand new. Those are some of the things
we'd find, on repairs.
