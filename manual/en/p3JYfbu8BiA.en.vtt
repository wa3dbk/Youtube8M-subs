00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.799
Excuse me?
The way to there is over here!

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:12.000
But Rabbit, isn't that them? 
Over there?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Now which are you going to believe:
This official map, or your own eyes?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Look for yourself and you'll see we're right on course!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.769
It's all right there in black and white! Hahaha!

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.410
Why would anyone want to wander around, wondering
which way to go, when they have a map to follow?

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.830
A map is not a guess, an estimation, or a
hunch, a feeling, or a foolish intuition.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.000
Yes, but...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
A map is a dependable, unwavering, inarguably
accurate portrayer of your position.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.770
Never trust your ears, your nose, your eyes.
Putting faith in them is most unwise!

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.770
Here's a phrase you all must memorize:
"In the printed word is where truth lies!"

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.680
Yes, but Rabbit...

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.280
Never trust your tummies, tails, or toes.
Haha! You can't learn a thing from any of those.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Here's another fact I must disclose:
"From the mighty pen, true wisdom flows!"

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.740
If it says so, then it is so!
If it is so, uh, well, so it is!

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.200
A thought's not fit to think,
till it's printed in ink.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000
Then it says so, aha, so it is!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.190
Well, yes, but, I think that...

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.300
Never trust that thing between your ears!
Brains will get you nowhere fast, my dears!

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.850
Haven't had a need for mine in years!
On the page is where the truth appears.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.300
If it says so, then it is so!
If it is so, so it is!

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.080
A thought's not fit to think
till it's printed in ink.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.860
Never differ from or doubt it, (Bother)
or go anywhere without it.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.000
Thank goodness we've got this,
so we don't need to fret about it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.870
If it says so, so it is!
