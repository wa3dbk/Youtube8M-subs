00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.009
I was having a late night drink when a new
client walked in. He looked troubled like

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:25.009
a fish out of water, mainly because he was.
He told me it was a missing person's case

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.279
becuase his friend had vanished. Ah well I
said there are lots more fish in the sea.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.129
Hmm, that's the thing he said, there are not
where I swim. Fish stocks are in deep trouble

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.999
because of overfishing. I agreed to take the
case. The next day I headed for the fish district

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:51.999
but everywhere I looked all the fish mongers
were struggling. SacrÃ© bleu! Pas plus de poissons?

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.170
Down by the docks the fishermen spend more
time on land than at sea. I looked everywhere

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.090
and it was true, most of the fish were gone!
And that's when I woke up, was it just a horrible

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.650
dream? I hit the streets to investigate. There
were fish everywhere. But how could I be sure

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.549
my nightmare wouldn't come true? And that's
when I found my answer. The MSC logo was tagged

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.189
on every fish. But only for fish from fisheries
that have proved they are sustainable. So

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.060
look for this when you put fish to your dish.
And only then will you have sweet dreams of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.060
plenty more fish in the sea.
