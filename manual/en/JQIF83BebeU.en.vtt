00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.620
Following ptosis surgery how long before you
are able to open that eye wide?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.560
I had ptosis surgery 3 weeks ago, the type
done on the inside of the eyelid.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.980
The results have been the ptosis is worse
than before.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.790
I have experienced some double vision and
I am unable to open that eye wide as I can

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.320
on my other eye.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.430
Is this temporary?

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.250
I had my follow up appointment with the surgeon
and he said with this type of surgery, the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.450
lid usually raises in the 1st two weeks.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.790
He has me scheduled to come back in 4 weeks
to check the progress.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.970
Thank you for your question!

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.140
In your question you mentioned that you had
ptosis surgery approximately 2 week prior

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.610
and that apparently, the eyelid level has
gone worse and there's an issue with the timing

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.390
of your follow-up in terms of now and when
you're going to be seen again.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:31.299
Well, I think that it's critically important
that you contact your doctor's office to advise

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.829
them that your ptosis is actually gotten worse.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.369
You see, after eyelid surgery, ptosis surgery
in itself has its own unique challenges.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.110
We're dealing with a muscle called levator
muscle.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.360
When we're talking about a posterior approach
or behind the eyelid, there are a couple of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.969
different procedures that are applied to that
including what's called Mueller's resection

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.200
or posterior levator resection as well as
Fasanella-Servat.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.120
These are names that are technical but if
somebody first is concerned about their eyelid

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.200
height, it's usually associated with some
degree of swelling.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.590
The physical weight of the eyelid can push
the eyelid down as well as the healing processes

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.750
of the muscle and all the other related issues
that occur especially in the first one to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.400
two weeks after surgery.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.440
For your photo, it doesn't look like you're
very swelling so it means with that factor

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.690
eliminated, there may be an issue with the
connection or the way the tissue is supposed

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.690
to heal.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.570
It might have been some stitches might have
been broken or it might have been some separation

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.150
but I think that your surgery may be at least
be informed.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.490
The timing of any revision surgery may be
dependent on when your surgeon was informed.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.950
I'll tell you in my own practice, if such
as thing would have happened, I would prefer

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.700
to find out than sooner than later.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.480
It's a balance of when you want to operate
regarding the degree of swelling and healing

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.660
and what kind of impart there is on the eyelid
height.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.910
When there is a real separation before the
tissue has the chance to develop scar tissue,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.960
there is actually a window of opportunity.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.370
And it's not necessarily within a few days
or weeks, you actually have some time but

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.310
again, it's a matter of what your surgeon's
preference is.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.610
So I that you should insist to have your surgeon
see you sooner.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.090
I would have to, it would be advice for me
to tell my patients, if there are any questions

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.770
or concerns, I would always tell my patients
that I'd rather see them than guess what they

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.770
look.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.150
Even if they show photos or pictures from
their phone, or have someone to take a picture

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.930
with a camera, it's always better to see that
patient infront of you.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.840
And considering that you had your surgery
so recently, I think that would be the best

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.470
thing for you is to meet with the doctor sooner
rather than later, getting an understanding

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.170
of what's going on and what would be the appropriate
next step is.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.569
So I hope that was helpful, I wish you the
best of luck and thank you for your question.
