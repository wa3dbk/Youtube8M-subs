00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.529
mike tyson now wants to be a boxing
promoter that's how he wants to revive

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.170
his

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.230
career NY was talking about press
conference he opened up about some

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.240
demons that he's been facing for quite
some time now let's take a look at the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.660
video

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.799
I have a drink drugs in sick they

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.240
for me it's a miracle

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.580
I've been lying to everybody else think
no soap I'm not

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.580
its mass text a never use again so few
years ago actually

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.610
last year he came out and said that he
had been sober for about three years

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.149
he has been fighting an addiction to
alcohol for a very very long time

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.750
am but now through that a press
conference we realize that he did lie

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.000
about his sobriety

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.930
I you know he has dealt with so many
difficult situations in his life a few

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.660
years ago his 4-year-old I'd

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.760
as a result a treadmill cord wrapped
around her neck

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.840
and of course that was devastating to
him in his wife and you know it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.340
the I can't even imagine going through
something like that so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.369
you it was hard to believe that he could
remain sober after something like that

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.479
because a lot of people do turn to drugs
and alcohol to cope with situations like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:09.900
that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.220
I'm but so I'm torn on Anna because

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.119
look it's a it's very understandable at
the same time

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.380
it provides a an excuse and I don't mean
to give anyone an excuse

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
I'm just saying that I mean when you
lose a child it's so traumatic that I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.340
mean the pain

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.280
you what did he start drugs and drinking
for that following Sunday before

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.210
so in at the same time I can't begin to
imagine is pain

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.470
so it's easy work for me to sit back in
judge trade

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.110
I you look I appreciate it he came out
in this case is said

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.600
the reality and it's really hard for
someone who's addicted to do that and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.420
look he's been clean for six days

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.549
at the moment he said that is your last

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.600
you don't know rate because it's a
constant constant battle

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.079
and so I don't know man it the stories
like this though

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.119
I mean they make me glad I'm not to fame
is too rich

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.319
yep to anything so I want to talk about
a little bit because

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.900
the most difficult thing for people that
are very very successful and wealthy

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.239
is that at some point they will get
demoted unless you are a superstar like

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.290
Oprah media Oprah like she's not

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.300
everyone knows who she is but she's not
like you know the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.739
primary example of success in whatever
and maybe she is troubled by a thirty

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.840
thousand dollar handbag and right time

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.970
right busy what I'm saying I just our
own cable station and it didn't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.819
so far it hasn't gone the ratings are
network which is actually not that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.440
surprising

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.690
at all but people are all over for
because when you're on top people ok

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.500
drag you down

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.170
they do exactly so I can imagine how
difficult that is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.390
to deal with being demoted to be kinda
like a laughingstock because people do

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
laugh at tyson a lot you know the idea
make fun of him

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.390
you know that there is that whole
holyfield incident worry but the guys

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.069
hear of it was unfortunate

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.110
with definitely unfortunate and and so

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.730
I totally agree with you jangling I I
would never want to be

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.920
that famous I mean I want to be
successful I don't want to be so famous

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.349
where

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.239
at some point I'm not going to be as
famous and I'm gonna have to deal with

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:17.700
that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.800
demotion very publicly and you're going
to be like who's that

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.129
why she relevant yeah that guy I don't I
don't know that I'm is

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.750
a you know focus on the this whole
concept love like not be on top anymore

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.400
but I I feel like they have a million
different pressures and they're

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.150
constantly under the microscope

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.470
and mike tyson waterways is you know if
you don't know this whole story

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.700
I saw a documentary on 'em tyson way he
worked super hard he studied

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.959
every major fight when he was younger
right

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.319
to understand every move he worked as
ass off to get to where he was

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.540
so there's a lot that I respect about
him on the other hand will sometimes

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.439
when you see interviews I don't know
views like

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.870
crazy hire some good but he doesn't make
a lot of sense

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.310
also like drama right and it's hard for
a guy

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.680
who sometimes doesn't make much sense to
deal with

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.970
I Tahoe no pressure on you and when you
don't handle it right

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.709
and then you get another tunnel pressure
I miss something like you know that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.970
your daughter's that dodo his daughter
dying a situation explain and that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.910
happens on top

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.910
so there's a lot of sympathy I have for
mike tyson

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.830
and you know I look you I remember he
was on top of the world man

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.070
it but overall whether it's either one
or more points I wonder if I'd be on the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.830
top of the world this is a great thing

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.009
well what is it about society that makes
people want to build celebrities up as

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.949
much as they possibly can and then tear
them down

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.930
you see what I'm saying like I do make
your monthly onesie has your monkeys

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.650
because looked a discrete X from that
I'm you know obsessed with

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.680
they ask my keys to likely put

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.770
your alpha males or or non alpha males
on a TV screen

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.919
so other monkeys and the monkeys bananas

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.210
and if they see an alpha male the give
him the banana they ought they offer the

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.220
TV a banana

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.880
okay if it's not half a mil to spur
software I mean the bed

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.600
okay so there's something in us as

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.690
as close to chimpanzees as we are I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.419
that that set us we want to outlaw
celebrity all my goal here by Ben take

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.199
my banana

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.449
right I but at the same time we're a
little

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.740
Joe's rate and sore like to hear what
others to give us their banana yes of

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.410
course

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.669
and so ever given a bit then to get all
this time like

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.990
David great if he fell off that tree yes

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.900
yes their egos me to go scoop up some
minutes

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.949
some easing okay
