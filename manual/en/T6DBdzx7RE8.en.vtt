00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.240
Oman, a small,
peaceful and wealthy country-

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.320
-of vast deserts, endless beaches,
palaces, palms and shopping malls.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.080
Ancient Arabian hospitality blends in
naturally with modern living.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.800
With its expansive
oil and gas industry-

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
-and government investments
in infrastructure-

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.360
-Oman's economy is growing steadily.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.760
Volvo dealer Genserv, which
supplies construction equipment-

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.720
-is one company that's
benefiting from this building boom.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680
The Volvo business
was started in 1998.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.640
It was a challenging job for us.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.720
Everybody knew Volvo
as cars or as trucks-

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.280
-but not at all as construction
equipment here in Oman.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.200
When we started in 1998,
it was a big job to sell a unit.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
Now in 2010,
we're crossing 300 units a year.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.200
Genserv has shown dedicated focus
on meeting its customers' needs.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.480
We'll say: "We sold you
a Volvo machine, but it is our baby."

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.800
"We will take care of it,
now and after ten years."

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.200
600 km from the capital Muscat,
in the middle of the Omani desert-

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.440
-there's a customer well aware of the
value of Genserv's customer focus.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.640
The international
construction company STFA-

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.440
-is helping build a port and
a drydock in the village of Duqm.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.680
One of the biggest infrastructure
projects in the whole Middle East.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.520
They are helpful for us.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.680
When we need something,
or forget the maintenance times-

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.840
-they remember for us and follow up.
This is good.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.320
The strategy behind
strong customer relations-

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.960
-is to offer the best service
and aftersales on the market.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.720
Genserv has introduced
a toll-free phone number-

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.760
-where customers can call in
with feedback and complaints.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.120
When we receive the complaint...

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.920
...the customer will contact
the toll-free operator directly.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.440
Just one guy. This guy will
register and take the complaint.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.960
He'll take down
the basic information about it.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.200
Our target is always to contact
the customer within 30 minutes.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.480
All of the time,
we are achieving this.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.000
By offering free inspections-

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.840
-Genserv can ensure that machines
are in the best possible condition-

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.480
-even long after delivery.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.440
We will take care of this unit. We
do free inspections and free visits.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.040
As owner of the machine, you will
receive e-mails, faxes and calls-

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.760
-telling you that your machine
is doing well or requires service.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.800
As a customer,
you will appreciate that.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.320
We look after your machine,
which is our machine, after sales.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.880
Genserv recently became
a certified Volvo dealer-

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.520
-according to
Volvo's Partnership Monitor.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.040
The only company coming through the
tests without unsatisfactory points.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.560
But only a few years ago,
the global economic crisis-

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.320
-created huge challenges
for Genserv's operations.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.080
In that period,
everybody talked about saving.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.640
We had to educate the customer
that by taking Volvo machines-

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.040
-you are saving money.
You are not consuming money.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
You are saving on fuel and service,
and it's a reliable machine.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.080
We were educating the customer
that by taking Volvo, you save money.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.840
With the global economy
back on an upward trajectory-

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.440
-Genserv is optimistic
about the future-

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.600
-and expects to grow a lot
in the coming years.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.480
The government has announced
its five-year plan here in Oman.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.440
It is really promising,
with a lot of projects still to come.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.440
We are helping to develop the country
with our Volvo machines.
