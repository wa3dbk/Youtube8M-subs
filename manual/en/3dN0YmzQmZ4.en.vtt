00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.320
Hello everyone. Here we are with 
Cat Wars.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.249
It's a 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.320
really really stupid game, you know,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.669
it has cats in it.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.740
Very similar to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.529
Cartoon Wars.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.390
The idea is to

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.740
create as many guys for your army as 
possible.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.740
Collect resources and then launch your
guys on the enemy guys.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.560
And hope you will win.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.840
Slight twist. you have to build buildings
which then unlock  the various soldiers.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.840
So we'll start sending these guys out.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.760
Create new buildings

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.040
unlocks new stuff.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.380
Upgrade, unlocks new stuff.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.260
It's the usual themes. The game is free to play

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.300
has in app purchases.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Normally what you would expect. 
It's free to play.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.320
Like I say, very cartoony.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.920
But a little bit cuter.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.000
The devs have put quite a bit of time
into this game.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.640
I find it quite enjoyable. I think it's 
going to be a good one for, you know,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.060
20 minutes or so sat on the bus.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.700
Uses an Angry Birds style lock out to unlock
so you complete one level

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.700
unlock the next one and so on.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.239
You can move either using

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.569
things like that or you can use this
at the top, move it back and forwards

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.419
probably come into its own in later levels.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.919
Hooray! There's a win.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.680
Cat Wars. Available on the App Store now

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.569
Well, Android market, well, Play Store, well,
