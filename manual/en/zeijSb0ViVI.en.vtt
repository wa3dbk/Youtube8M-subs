00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.550
I'm interested in writing about common and
ordinary people,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.550
without exalting an individual experience too

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.910
different from that of everybody
else.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.920
 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.050
I think that for my generation and those following
it, relationships have been transformed into

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.050
something uncertain,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.290
that is, there is an
element of uncertainty we accept and consider part of the matter, and this is true as much
for relationships of love as for those between

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.350
parent and child. The horizon of affections
has changed. It does interest me to talk about

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.380
that; I don't know if I'm right or if I have
a conception of how it happens in my book,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.030
much less in reality. La vida privada de los
árboles tells the story of a family constructed

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.140
with other values and with a certain inherent
fragility. It's not the traditional family

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.009
we've accustomed ourselves to think about;
it's one based on another model that I'm interested

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.240
in understanding.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.229
 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.229
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.540
I think that manythings have changed, butthat the dictatorship continues being present.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:35.999
Since 2011 was the year of the student riot
and other kinds of riots, someone might think

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.650
it is something very contemporary

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.449
But the protests of the youth
are linked with what the dictatorship did

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:51.980
to Chile, and any change to the state is linked
with the constitution, the same constitution

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.980
drawn up by Pinochet and his collaborators.

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:06.949
The country is attempting to put itself together
of the past,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:13.999
yet questions of the present again,

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:25.169
rather than trying to cling to an accountstill have to do with the dictatorship.

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:35.029
Pinochet
destroyed Chile in every imaginable sense

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.150
 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.150
for example, people now say that they want
to remove the IVA [value added tax] from theprice of a book, because

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.010
in Chile the book
didn't have an IVA before Pinochet. Things like this go hand in hand, and move progressively.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:05.559
It seems to me that Chilean society is always in that transition

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.040
and what Patricio Guzmán says I share, that there is not a generalised desire to remember with precision

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.990
I think I owe a great deal to literature, because to me it seems that literature has permitted me to understand things I wouldn't have understood any other way.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:47.569
But the idea of pulling out a book when the world is ending, or when one has to go to a desert island... despite all that I love literature, it wouldn't occur to me to pull out a book.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.089
to a desert island... despite all that I love
literature, it wouldn't occur to me to pullout a book.
