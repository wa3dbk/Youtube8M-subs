00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.710
Just because we found methane on Mars doesn’t
mean there are cattle farms on the red planet.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.750
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.040
In the ongoing and imagination-capturing search
for life on other planets, methane is one

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.900
of the gases that gets people really excited.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.520
Methane is an extremely simple molecule made
of one carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
atoms.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.160
It’s one of the greenhouse gases that exists
in trace amounts in our atmosphere, and it’s

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960
created in oxygen-free processes in biological
organisms.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960
A couple of examples: Archaebacteria release
the greenhouse gas in rice fields, and most

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.899
famously (or infamously, perhaps) cows release
methane through flatulence… they fart it

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:44.899
out.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.360
Biological production of methane accounts
for most of the gas’ existence on our planet,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.370
so it stands to reason that finding methane
on Mars would imply that there’s some organism

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.510
producing it on that planet as well.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.609
Except that there are other ways to produce
methane without biological processes.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.859
Methane can come from rocks.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.770
It’s possible for ancient methane to be
released from water-formed inclusions and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.870
cavities in basalt, a type of rock that is
extremely common on Mars.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.110
Basalt can incorporate methane through both
biological and geological processes, like

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.680
the process that turns olivine into serpentinites,
a type of rock composed of serpentine minerals.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160
That methane can be released when the rock
is broken apart, like when it’s drilled

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.860
into, and found using spectroscopy.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.570
And we’ve actually found traces of Methane
on Mars before, granted, a few of those times

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.430
it was in air delivered to Mars trapped in
an instrument, so we were actually detecting

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.430
Earth methane.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.150
The methane we’ve detected on Mars in the
past has been fairly widely distributed over

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.790
the planet in patches that vary over time
suggesting that the gas is released from subsurface

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.870
stores and is destroyed pretty quickly.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.230
On Mars where the atmosphere is thin, heavily
composed of carbon dioxide, and where there’s

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.420
no magnetic field to protect the gases in
the atmosphere, methane lasts only months

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.520
compared to the 300-plus year lifetime it
has on Earth.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.420
The other part of the puzzle is the low amount
of methane on Mars compared to Earth; the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.390
recent spike Curiosity found peaked at 7 parts
per billion.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.530
On Earth, we’ve got about 1,600 parts per
billion of methane.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.060
It’s very possible that the production and
level of methane on Mars is so low to be negligible

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.950
on Earth but are exciting on Mars because
it’s all we have.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.870
It could be something awesome, but it could
also be nothing.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.230
Are you guys on team something exciting to
come from methane on Mars?
