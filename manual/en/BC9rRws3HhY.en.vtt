00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is the Phoenix platform lift at Halfords, County Oak Retail Park, Crawley

00:00:03.413 --> 00:00:08.413
Let's call it down

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:40.847
Here it is.

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:50.552
Let's take it up to one.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:58.641
Oops... you need to hold the button down, even 
 though it was automatic on the way down!

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.251
Here's a view of the shaft...

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.951
Here we come to the first floor.

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:25.638
Let's watch it level.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And here we are at the first floor

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.069
Right let's take it back down...

00:01:42.864 --> 00:01:47.860
I can't get much of a cab view here..

00:01:55.612 --> 00:01:57.610
Almost there...

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:10.100
And here we are.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.030
Right let's open the door...

00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.610
And it will close up...

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.790
There it goes and...

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.000
That's it!
