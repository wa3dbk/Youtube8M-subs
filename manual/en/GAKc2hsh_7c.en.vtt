Tami: The purpose of this module
is to basically emphasize for

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:20.353 line:0%
each and every firefighter
that they are fire behavior

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.422 line:0%
specialists out on the ground.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:26.493 line:0%
We want to encourage people to
be to, to go back to those basic

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.895
assessments that we've
taught them through

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.798
190, and 290, and 390 and 490.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.201
It's a basic preface there, that
people have the skills to make

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:40.039
fire behavior predictions
when they're out on the line.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.141
Narrator: Believe me; I'm
certainly glad I went to that

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.111
fire school with my
neighbors last week.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.879
It's a mighty good training
session; prepared us to help one

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.983
another in case we got a fire.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.985
We learned that a few men
can handle a lot

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.321
of fire when they're trained.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:01.661
You know, I believe I'll never
forget that fire school.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.198
We learned that it took a
combination of air, heat and

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:11.337
fuel to make a fire burn; this
is the combustion triangle.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:17.376
Remove any one of these
elements and the fire goes out.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.446
Remove the fuel side, the
triangle is broken

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.149
and the fire goes out.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.287
Remove the heat side, it is
broken, the fire goes out.

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:32.825
Remove the air side
and the fire goes out.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.261 line:0%
Tami: The fire behavior basics
are, it's a fire behavior

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.664 line:0%
triangle, it's fuels,
weather and topography.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:41.734 line:0%
So when you as a firefighter,
are going out there, whether

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.804
you're going out to, on an
initial attack fire, or you're

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.006
going out to a large scale
incident or you're going out to

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.210
do a burn, you need to be paying
attention to, okay well what's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.244
the weather, what's it been?

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.079
How, how is it gonna to affect
my operations today

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.282
and potentially tomorrow?

00:01:57.282 --> 00:02:00.019
And what are the fuels setup
to be, are you, are you doing

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:02.655
prescribed burn maybe
against some snowpack.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.558
Are you doing a burn when your
fuel moistures are low but

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:09.561
expecting your weather to
help compensate some of that.

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:12.498
Everybody should be going back
reviewing the fundamentals.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.302
The higher up you go in the food
chain, most people, it's very

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.805
easy to lose the basics, and I
think a lot of times when

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:23.243
we're in those higher echelon
positions it's like,

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.611
you forget what
it's like to be on the ground,

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.047
and so I think that
to bring people back, and say,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.115
"No, this is how
it's happening on the ground.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.185
We need to review
this information."

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.188
So it's the beginning of the
fire season and there is a lot

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:39.491
of information out there that we
can collect that can give us the

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:43.996
baseline information to tie it
to the fire behavior triangle.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.499
And there is the old saying
that only fools predict a fire

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.035
season, but I think there are
some elements there that can

00:02:50.035 --> 00:02:53.940
really help preface
the upcoming season.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.543
Whether it's what the fuels are
sitting at based on what was the

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:01.113
snowpack, how much moisture
received in the spring, um,

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.448
maybe how your fuels were
burning when you were doing

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:05.418
your spring burning program.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:08.254
How's the weather setting up?

00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:10.623
Is there a certain geographical
area that's starting to see...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:14.627
fire season
is starting earlier?

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.997
So I've created a baseline of
information preseason, and now

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.933
I'm out on the fireline and I'm
walking the line and I'm seeing

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.368
that the fuels are stressed, the
leaves are starting to curl,

00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:25.338
the colors
are starting to change,

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:28.273
it looks like it's fall,
but it's July.

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:31.177
Those are some of the things
I'm putting in my mind.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.479
Or if I do a moisture probe and
I look at some of the larger

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.416
fuels and they're
single digits already.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.617
Or I'm kicking the dirt or
kicking away rotted logs and

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.354
there's no moisture
left in them.

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.822
You're looking at your current
fire behavior,

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.690
and you make an assessment.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.292
Are your lookouts
in the right place?

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.161
Do they need to be moved?

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.730
What's your communication based
on your current fire behavior

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.533
and what you're seeing and what
you are expected based on what

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.469
you've picked up from your data
gathering or assessment period.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.139
Are your escape routes and
safety zones, are they adequate?

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.607
So what does all this
information mean now that

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:04.043
we've gathered out on the line?

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.279
What it means is that you are,
you have validated your LCES and

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:12.118
now you're ready for your
tactical operations for the day.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.186
Narrator: Don's crew was wasting
a lot of energy trying to knock

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.655
the fire out of a big bush.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:20.626
He had 'em using
indirect attack.

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:23.963
They backed up and made the
line where the fuel was light.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:29.568
They threw extra
fuel out of the way.

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:33.406
Then they burned out the fuel
between their line and the fire.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.207
This burning out was another
way to remove

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:39.378
fuel leg from the triangle.

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:41.814
Tami: We all need to be
responsible for our own actions

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:43.950
out on the fireline.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.551
We can't be dependent on
somebody else to always take

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.488
care of that, take care of us.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.522
And so that comes to the basics
that we need to be paying

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.158
attention to as far as the fire
behavior triangle

00:04:53.158 --> 00:04:56.262
and how is that
going to impact us.

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:57.930
We need to have a really good
understanding of what's the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.933
fuels, weather, topography.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.502
And until we have those
elements, we're not going to be

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:06.138
able to implement our, or
successfully implement tactical

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:08.841
operations until we have our
situational awareness of the

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:12.712
fire behavior and what's gonna
happen with the fire behavior.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:16.649
You've got to be constantly be
keeping yourself abreast of the

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.019
situation, that's the art,
you've got the hard science side

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.289
of fire behavior and you can
have all these models spew out

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.325
numbers and it's black and
white, but until you're actually

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:31.931
on the ground, walking it,
looking at it, assessing and

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.235
reevaluating, does those numbers
mean anything, that's the art.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.871
So you have the hard science and
you have the art side of fire

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.307
behavior. Feedback is really
important in order to have

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:47.113
adequate fire behavior
predictions whether you're on a

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:50.783
initial attack fire, and you're
providing feedback to your local

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.653
FMO, or you're providing
feedback to a fire behavior

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:56.755
analyst or an incident
meteorologist.

00:05:56.755 --> 00:06:00.326
And the feedback is, when you're
out on the line and you're

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:04.730
working in division Alpha for a
week, you are the fire behavior

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.000
specialist for that
particular piece of line.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.069
You know what's been happening,
you know the local wind events,

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.104
you know the little anomalies

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:15.174
that have been happening,
every day.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:18.244
I can guarantee your weather
observations or your weather

00:06:18.244 --> 00:06:21.013
forecasts will be a lot better
if you can provide that

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.915
incident meteorologist some
information from the ground

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.983
to help them get up to speed.

00:06:24.983 --> 00:06:27.286
Same with
the fire behavior analysts,

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.255
if you provide them feedback,
it will only make

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:32.324
their forecasts
that much better.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:35.327
So one of the things that I want
make sure that we include is

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:39.965
making sure that people take the
time out to take the weather

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:43.168
throughout the event, um,
whether it's on the hour or

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:46.839
every half hour, it really gives
people that time to raise their

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.942
head, gather their situational
awareness, take a breather,

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:52.879
look around, what's changing?

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.314
Is there something that needs
to be readjusted based on

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.850
information they're gathering
when they take the weather?

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.419
So many times we get so focused
on getting from point A to point

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.322
B just putting in line, just
putting our heads down and

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.792
digging, that we forget to raise
our heads and really look around

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:09.628
and look at
the changing conditions,

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.597
and I think that's really
important, that's something that

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.164
we really
need to encourage people to do.
