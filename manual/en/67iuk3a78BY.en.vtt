MITCH WALDEN, RENTAL MANAGER&gt;&gt; Today we'd
like to show you one of our larger log cabin

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.790
units that are part of the Cabins at Grand
Mountain, which is part of Thousand Hills

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.550
Golf Resort. This is a 4 bedroom, 4 bath log
cabin and as you can see they're very rustic

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.689
but very nice. They're true Colorado spruce
logs and this one is decorated very nicely

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:33.100
with a lot of mounted animals and a really
rustic feel. Each cabin is decorated by their

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.510
owners so they vary slightly in decor but
the actual layout and build of the cabins

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.969
will be similar no matter which one you stay
in.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.920
Each one has a full kitchen equipped with
all of your major and minor kitchen appliances.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.590
We also include all of the dishware, silverware
and glassware that you'll need to enjoy your

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
stay. As you can see a dishwasher so you don't
have to worry about doing dishes, an oven

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.750
and microwave, full sized refrigerator and
freezer and also a washer and dryer to do

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.891
any laundry that you have while you are here.
Each cabin is equipped with a dining room

00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:16.830
area and also a living room which has a nice
gas fireplace as well as a queen-size sleeper

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.790
sofa.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:27.810
This 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom cabin is actually
a 2 level version-we also have a version where

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.780
all 4 bedrooms are on the same level. This
one actually has the master downstairs as

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.500
you can see through here. King sized bed,
nice lofted ceilings, feels really roomy,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.250
and in here is jetted tub, vanity and toilet
area.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.840
And then the second bedroom and bathroom on
this side is actually up this flight of stairs.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.300
Let's go up and take a look. All of our cabin
buildings are duplexes and these big units

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.800
actually take up both sides of the duplex,
so you have an entire building to yourself

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.780
for you and your party and don't have to worry
about neighbors.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.799
So upstairs is the 2nd bedroom, 2nd king size
bed and then an ensuite shower and vanity.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.689
And these showers are great, they've got the
dual oversized copper showered heads which

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:31.120
are really relaxing. Nice mirrored closet
area over there. There's an elk, take a look

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.079
at this guy, kind of neat!

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:42.000
So this is the 1st side of the cabin. And
what's great about these 4 bedroom units and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.989
all of our larger cabins is that they actually
connect then to the other side so through

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.980
here is the other half, giving you your other
2 bedrooms and bathrooms. But you actually

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.270
have an entire 2nd half so you have an entire
2nd kitchen, 2nd dining room, 2nd living room

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.769
with queen sleeper sofa, 2nd fireplace, basically
two of everything.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.379
Forgot to show on the other side the deck,
the deck furniture, looking out over the wooded

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.879
area of the cabins, as you can tell nice and
peaceful but you're right in the heart of

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.790
Branson. These cabins are just a couple minutes
from Highway 76 right in the heart of Branson

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.069
so when you get this nice secluded feel you're
very convenient to everything you want to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.279
do.

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:38.870
Coming through here, take a look at the 3rd
bedroom which is basically the 2nd master

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.489
set up the same way as the other side. In
here we've got the whirlpool tub with shower,

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:57.909
vanity, and then back out here and up a flight
we have the 4th bathroom and bedroom.

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.349
And all of these units are able to sleep up
to 12 units because you do have 4 king sized

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:15.269
beds as well as 2 queen sized sleeper sofas.
So there's the 4th king bed and again, the

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:25.389
oversized shower with the dual showerheads,
sink &amp; vanity, mirrored closet space and on

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.280
this side they have a great stuffed moose
here. A lot of people request this cabin because

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.349
of the cool furnishings in it.

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.580
So as you can see, very very large, great
sized cabin if you have multiple families

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.810
that all want to stay together or if you just
have a large extended family and everybody

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.629
wants to stay in the same cabin. Also having
both sides like this really allows you to

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.991
spread out-the kids can be one side watching
TV and the adults can be on the other side

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:57.690
watching the news but they're literally steps
apart and everybody has plenty of room to

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.780
spread out and enjoy.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.120
We hope you'll come and check out one of these
large 4 bedroom log cabins for your next family

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.940
or multi-family gathering here in Branson
and come see why the Cabins at Grand Mountain

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.340
are Branson's favorite place to stay!
