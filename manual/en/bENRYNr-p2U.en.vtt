HEROBRINE: I shall beseech my minions to destroy those worthless miners. Then, my reign shall resume on this pitiful world.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What a fool....

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
A god versus a group of worthless souls, the outcome is easy to determine.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Worthless idiots attempting to oppose me; your time will be short, now prepare yourselves.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.000
Have at thee.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Fool! Attacking me head on!?

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.000
You all shall die!

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.000
You bear no chance against me...

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.000
All of your death wishes have been granted...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
D-damn you...!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This is where your life ends; you foul creature!

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.000
Those fools have met their end....
