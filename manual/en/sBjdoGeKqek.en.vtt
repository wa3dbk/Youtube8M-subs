is SEO? SEO is getting your website found

Importance of SEO JupiterResearch has found

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.279
that the average company gets about 80 % of
its commercial search engine referrals from

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.620
organic results and the rest from PPC ads.
The study also showed that 90% percent of

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.871
searchers only visit sites in the first 10
results. If we equate 1 visitor to the website

00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:46.360
with $1, that means 90% of the money is going
to other websites if you are NOT on the 1st

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.840
