00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.070
Hello there.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.900
It appears that it has fallen
to me to tell you 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.100
about the Dominion, and as
your luck would have it

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.970
I am by far the most qualified 
individual to do so.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.900
Shall we begin? 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800
About sixteen hundred
years ago

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.010
the humans of planet Casus 
were chosen by the Eldan

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.130
to establish a star-spanning Empire. And
since that time through intimidation,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.250
political intrigue,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.140
and a score of impressive military
conquests, the Dominion now exists

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.760
as a shining example of 
strength and leadership

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.000
for the rest at the pathetic vermin
that infest the galaxy.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.500
Enough history. To the 
heroes of the empire!

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
The Draken.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.000
Savage warriors, fearless on 
the field of battle.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.400
Not exactly the most 
refined chaps...

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.600
but I wouldn't say that 
to their face.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.049
Mechari. Advanced robots engineered
by the Eldan themselves.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.210
Deadly assassins 
and super agents.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.400
Sense of humor? A bit 
lacking I'm afraid.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.500
And... not going to talk about this one. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.400
Lastly there are the Cassians.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.979
My people, without whose 
continued courageousness,

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.490
ambition, and stalwart leadership
the Dominion would

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.979
undoubtedly crumble.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.640
I suppose I would be remiss if I did not
mention the ongoing conflict

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
with the so-called Exiles on planet
Nexus.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.000
Not to say that this
ragtag alliance of

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.500
of reugees, rebels, and
mercenaries poses any real threat,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
they just need a healthy dose

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.689
of Dominion galactic diplomacy.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.210
Have I made myself clear?

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.489
Good. I would certainly hope so...

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
(O.S.) Can someone get me a drink?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500
(O.S) Something expensive.
