Hello everyone. I'm BOOWHOWOO.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.840
Today, I'll show you some toothpick dancing.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:39.920
Material: water, 5 toothpicks, a dropper (or a straw)

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.560
Abracadabra--- Change to a star!!

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.280
1. Bend the toothpick in the center.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.260
Make sure not to break them completely

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.880
but just bend.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
2. Place the toothpicks

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
radially on the table.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.460
3. Let fall a few drops at the center of these toothpick.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.800
It is not perfect but almost a star.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.440
This is the last time.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.680
It seems it doesn't want to be a star...

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.560
How was the video today?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.280
Please give it a try and have fun!

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960
See you at the next video!!
