00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:10.440
Okay, my name is Lauralyn from the Braiding
Lounge Academy in London.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.660
We are about to show you a quick version of
how to do a beehive on someone's hair.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.790
Okay, so we are going to part the hair from
ear to ear.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.220
I'm going to section that forward bit away
from the back half of the hair.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.630
So now, we are going to put the back half
into a ponytail.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:50.750
We are then going to make a little concoction
with some synthetic hair and a piece of net.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.989
This is going to form our mold for our beehive.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.329
It is a bit of a cheat, but it works.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.880
So we're going to take what we've made out
of the mold for synthetic hair with a piece

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.280
of netting and we are going to pin that to
the midsection of the client's crown.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.850
While you are pinning it, you are pinning
it to shape it in the shape that you desire,

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:30.640
and also the height of the bump will 
be determined at this time.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.030
We are then going to begin to take sections
of the hair and back comb it, with a fine

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.930
tooth comb.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.920
First, take a section from the middle, back
comb it from the root halfway up the hair

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.210
shaft, and allow it to fall over your molded
bump.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.689
We are then going to repeat that on either
side of the mold.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.170
And as you can see already, you can begin
to see the shape of the beehive forming.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:16.319
So you carry on this process of back combing
the hair, so you can begin to smooth it over

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.420
the mold that we have made.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.470
We should cover the three sections with the
hair that we have just back combed, roughly.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.200
You can secure this with a pin.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.260
That is not only going to leave you a section
at the front that you can use to smooth over

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.170
what you have already done.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.010
I'm only slightly back combing these sections
of the front because I want them to remain

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.110
fairly smooth for me to maneuver.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.200
But again, each section that I back comb,
I am then going to tease and mold over the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:08.319
rest of the beehive, using hair spray as any
way you see fit.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:04:24.419
I'll continue to mold this over the back of
the beehive.

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:31.020
And so, we just pin up the side sections.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.860
As you see each section that was back combed,
as I back combed it, I have been molding it

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.930
up into the beehive area.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:58.509
I have secured it with a bobby pin.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:19.789
Okay, and then we take the front section up,
and after it is giving you an option to sweep

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.699
it to the sides and around the side of the
beehive, we are going to be incorporating

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.520
it in, rather than leaving it out.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.087
And we are going to be securing that section
with a bobby pin, as well.

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:47.110
And that is how you do a beehive.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:57.969
Okay, so there we have the beehive.

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.409
Okay now, you can make it as high, or as broad
as you want it on your head.

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:08.340
The shape of it depends on the look that you
are looking for, okay.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:18.039
But that is basically just how you do a quick
beehive by stuffing the hair. .
