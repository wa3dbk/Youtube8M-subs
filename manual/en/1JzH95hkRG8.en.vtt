00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140
♫ ♫

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.300
"Yo, what's up?"

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.700
Heavenira here!

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.420
I wanted to do a Top 5 Best Mine-imator Animators video.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.360
If you do not appear on this video, I'm terribly sorry.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.360
I did my research and I would settle with the following results.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.635
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the video.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.040
Round one, animation.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.460
Everyone that I chose can animate extremely well.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.940
They each have their own methods, but who has the best?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.140
The answer to that is ÜberKiller and XGUNLOCK.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.060
Most of you would probably disagree to that, but hear me out.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.360
They don't only have smooth animation, but they have realistic animation as well. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.180
Frossa's style is the one I use in my animations.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.520
To explain how his style works, you always have to keep the character moving and you must never end of multiple limbs at once.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.180
RedcapCreations and GasCreeper both come in third place.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.180
They both have a very similar cartoon animation style.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.260
Willcraft on the other hand has very fast-paced animations.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.960
This often leads to confusion or headaches for older audiences.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.020
Round two, quantity and duration.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.660
ÜberKiller has an extremely long upload range...

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.660
[Gunshots]

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.060
..and had only one long animation.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.700
"Last night I found something very interesting on your computer."

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.840
Frossa has a very fair upload range that keeps his audience with him.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.460
GasCreeper has a very smooth duration to his videos as well as an upload range.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.120
RedcapCreations makes one and a half minute animations and seems to get things done before a deadline.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.440
Getting things done on time is very unique and deserves a five.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.100
XGUNLOCK hos one to two minute animations and the same upload range as ÜberKiller.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.160
Willcraft has very long animations.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.560
At some occasions, he lacks uploads.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000
But overall, the duration of his animations make up for it.

00:02:25.298 --> 00:02:27.618
I only make one minute animations.

00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:33.598
I upload animations created with Mine-imator as frequently as I could when I started YouTube.

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:40.034
I've currently paused my activity of Mine-imator animations until I hit one hundred subscribers.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.960
Final round, humour.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.020
ÜberKiller has both funny...

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.840
[Power-thump]

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.920
[Repetitive punching]

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.860
"Hey, son?"

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.580
"Could you come in here for a moment?"

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.220
"I need to speak to you about something."

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.560
"Uh, yeah, sure dad. What's going on?"

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.740
...and one sad video.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.020
Although, both funny videos was a parody of another video and reference.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.480
[Pop]

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.760
"Do I have to follow you all day!?"

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.300
XGUNLOCK has his "Hunger Pains" video which keeps you entertained just by the animation.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.760
The "Rumble At Night" animation on the other hand will be very funny for certain audiences.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.460
"The Other Side" and "Hunger Pains" animation didn't have the exact humour as "Rumble At Night".

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.734
The endings made it seem as if the animation was based off a cartoon.

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:38.634
The could have been prevented if the personalities of the characters acted in a more justified matter.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.960
[Sword cling]

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.900
[Slime]

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.480
Even though Frossa didn't make the original "Meet The Team", the jokes are still hilarious!

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.740
"Drawn a picture of me getting hit by a car."

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.600
Watching this series is just as funny as watching the original.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.160
In fact, I hardly see the difference!

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.955
"Here you've drawn me having sexual congress with the Eiffel Tower."

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.020
"Eiffel Tower having sexual congress with me."

00:04:04.254 --> 00:04:09.454
RedcapCreations has very funny videos but always has the same ending to them!

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.400
[Explosions x3]

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.140
Most of the time the characters act in such an odd way it entertains you!

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.800
GasCreeper has one troll reference just like the one I have in my video.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.500

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.240
However, he has one video that has a cliche ending that doesn't make too much audience laugh.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.360
[Explosion]

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.960
Willcraft makes all of his characters have their own unique personality.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.915
He also has a very good sence of humour when it comes to jokes.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.858

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.360
[Explosion]

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.940
I have jokes that are sometimes really hard to understand and ones that make me seem like a jerk like this one.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.440
[Fart]

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.700
I have hostage references, punchlines, trolls, more trolls, and very odd physics in my animations.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.080
However, these jokes probably aren't the best you've seen.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.360
But overall, I don't know what you guys feel like.
