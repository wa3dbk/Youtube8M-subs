What's Up guys i'm Noted from games academy!

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:25.300
i will teach you a really interesting tactic to use to explode to the back room in some round on the bombsite "A"

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:38.200
suddenly you listen some knifes, some wallbangs on the back room and after this things the round becomes very calm

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:47.400
so you said to your teammates
let's explode to the back room take some kill and then we get back.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.133
The idea behide this is just kill someone and manage the advantage

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.833
So if you kill someone get back immediately and found a good position.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:03.433
Try to use this box is pretty good

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:17.833
So the xplode works like that, the guy on the bombsite "A" need to be on this position and the another guy on the cat.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:29.099
the guy on cat need to be very quickly and smart, because his position is very vulnerable for some wallbangs

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.633
so the guy on this position need to be very smart and quickly to make the tactic happen

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:48.033
so this guy need found some good position here

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:53.499
but at the same time need  to be very fast to make decisions

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:02.266
so will works like that guys, will be like a grenade combo, fist its a hegrenade

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:14.232
so when this door open, at the same time the guy on cat makes a flashbang, i'ts just like that.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:25.266
and this will allow the guy rush back to de door, and with him the another guy from the bombsite "B"

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:39.699
first for the grenade you come here, and have this line right here, you place your crosshair slightly below this line and bang!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700
this will open the door easy

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:56.000
one second after your grenade your teammate make his flashbang right here

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.833
and this is a no reaction bang is super effective

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:09.533
a no reaction bang nobody can escape

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.766
so.. is basically like that

00:03:12.766 --> 00:03:18.066
i see the bang but it's impossible to turn

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.232
is really really good !

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:34.766
this tactic can be yoused if the round become to calm and if your partner from the bombsite "B" saw someone on the back room and he said for

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:37.432
you and its a great hour 
to explode.

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:47.499
This tactic needs a very good teamplay need to synchronize the right bangs

00:03:47.500 --> 00:04:01.333
Explode its also great to make when terrorists do grenades on yellow because i'ts the first thing the terrorists do before a rush !

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:15.166
hegrenade mean rush with flashs etc..

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:15.732
this is it guys thanks !
