00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.690
I guess you could call this clash of the titans.
I’m sitting in a Corvette ZR1 and in front

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.390
of me is a chap called Max who is sitting
in a Murcielago SV. Max is Lamborghini's super

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:40.200
hand. A few facts - the ZR1 has 640 horsepower
and it weighs 1530kg and it’s rear-wheel

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.750
drive. The Lamborghini has 670 horsepower,
weighs 1500kg and is four-wheel drive. The

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.540
challenge, can I stay with Max and his Lamborghini
Murcielago SV around the hill route at Millbrook,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:12.560
well let’s see. Away you go Max. Bloody
hell. How good does this Corvette sound! It’s

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.740
actually managing to drown out all the noise
that the Lamborghini’s making and the Lamborghini,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:29.500
as you can imagine, is not quiet. Wow, that
thing might be big but it looks unbelievably

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:48.490
well-planted throughout these corners. Its
rear tyres just look enormous. There is absolutely

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.440
no body roll from that Lamborghini at all
and old Max certainly appears to know what

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:05.380
he’s doing as well. There’s not a lot
of difference when they’re in a straight

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.520
line though. The Corvette is certainly pretty
quick, it’s just the traction. It’s just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.090
that little bit, that little moment when you
exit the corner and you really want to get

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.360
some power on. The Lamborghini just goes,
oomph and flies away! I’ve got to wait a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.980
little bit before I get on the throttle otherwise
the rear tyres light up. It’s a bit front heavy.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.480
Oh my god, that was quite a big one!
I’m really impressed with the Corvette actually,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.360
really impressed. It is miles better behaved,
better handling than a Z06. It’s got a lot

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.360
more sophisticated dampening system on it
and it really makes a big difference. It also

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.720
just handles really honestly, typical nice,
lovely sort of friendly front-engine rear-drive

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:08.579
kind of way. Whereas I suspect old Max up
there, I don’t know, he might be sitting

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.870
there just going for a Sunday stroll but it
looks a little bit twitchy when he really

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.319
starts to go for it. It’s just kind of dancing
around like that now, he’s trying, I mean

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:28.099
I’m trying as well but hmm, what an interesting
contest because they go about what they do

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.829
in completely different ways and yet I think
they get there, or they reach the same result

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.860
almost identically. Fascinating. Good fun
too!
