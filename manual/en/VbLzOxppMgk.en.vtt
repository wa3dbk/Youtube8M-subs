00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.800
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.860
I'm going to show you the new artistic wire
finding forms

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.009
that we've got in and I'm going to show you one as an example of how to actually do

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.340
it

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.099
but as you can see we have a really wide
variety of different

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.399
styles here and we have some that are ear
wires

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.020
some that are like a connector link or

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.480
an earring chandelier finding. We have

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.010
some clasps. There's a whole bunch of
different ones and I'm just gonna

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.200
show you one as an example. They all come with pretty good instructions

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600
so you should be able to adapt it to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.400
whichever style you get. I'll just open this
up

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.920
The one I'm gonna show you is the oval
ear wire

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.130
It's a really nice versatile earring finding. One of the more

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.149
basic ones. Be careful you don't lose this little

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.540
metal cylinder here. It's kind of loose in there

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.760
so the jigs are nice and small, compact

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.110
they don't have a lot of extra plastic on them. It should be easy to store them 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.830
these are great if you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.799
wanna make your own findings and they
will let you make them

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.440
quickly and they're also going to make
it so that they're uniform. So your two

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.170
earring

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.610
hooks will always be the same size and
shape and that's really

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.090
really great especially if you're selling jewelry it can be a big time saver

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.580
so here I have the instructions and
they're really clear and they have photos

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.830
so on the package

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.630
it does give you a recommended gauge range for your wire

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.549
so for this earring hook it says 22 to 24
gauge

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.369
I would probably stick to 20 or 22 because they're soft and if you use a

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.600
24 you're gonna need to do a lot of hardening

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.060
to get your wire to be nice and firm. I'm using 20 gauge

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.400
so just following along with what they got on here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.729
my end of my wire is kinda mangled. I'll just cut that off

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.230
it says

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.450
to use a five inch piece of wire. I
always use a little bit more than I think

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.299
I'm going to need

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.219
now we're going to insert the end of our wire

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.739
through the little hole, there's only one hole

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.010
in this one. So it's pretty easy. Bend
it down

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.829
and hold onto it on the back and now

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.879
all you do is follow along with the instructions. It's going to tell you

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.829
what path to wrap your wire around. You
just do

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.069
it exactly in the order that it says.
So for this particular one

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.499
you're going to wrap clockwise around the
large pin

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.900
and then you're going to pivot around the
smaller pin. That's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.000
gonna give you the bend at that bottom of your ear wire

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.059
and now wrap around the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.290
oval and once you do your first bend you
can let go of the back

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.299
when you're doing

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.489
any kind of jig work it's helpful to kinda wrap past where you need

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.659
to get your wire to really hug

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.790
the shape. Then you're going to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.219
pivot back and you're going to wrap around the little triangle and that's gonna give you

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.200
the little kick back at the end of the hook

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.870
so once you have your piece wrapped
around

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.400
you're going to take this little cylinder

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.319
they call it the pusher tool. What it's for
is

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.919
to push the wire flat

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.329
when you go around in a spiral and you
wrap all the way around

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.829
you going to be layering on top and your
wire will

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.459
go up and so you wanna take the little tool
and just push the wire down flat and

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.499
make sure that it's

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.870
nice and snug to the back. When
you're done

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.109
unbend the little piece at the back

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.150
pop off your earring hook

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.180
you can kinda tweak it a little bit

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.949
make sure the shape is how you like. I'm just going to

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:20.949
clip at the loop

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.050
then you're just going clip at the end here

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.710
now if you're doing a clasp

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.680
or a connector link or something as long as
you've got your

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.180
ends not sharp you're good but on

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.169
a earring hook you're always gonna wanna
make sure that you prepare that

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.599
earring hook to go into somebody's ear.
So there are several different ways you

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:47.180
can do it

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.189
you can use a cup bur, you can

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:55.259
use a diamond file, that what I have, you can just use a nail file

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.389
If you don't have those things all you gonna do, if you have a cup bur

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.900
then you probably know how to use it. We
do have a video on how to use it if you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.310
don't

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.779
otherwise just take your file

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.979
and you're just going to file diagonally

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.419
across the edges of the tip of the wire

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.779
and be careful that you don't scratch the
rest of the wire if you're using a color

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:18.610
coated wire

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.830
because it will scratch off the finish,
just right at the tip

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.330
and you can just kinda go all the way
around the edges and you're just trying to

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.379
make sure that you get

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.139
that nice and smooth

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.409
go all the way around a few times. It shouldn't take that long

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.080
and once that feels nice and smooth and it
doesn't scratch your finger at all and you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.050
feel like it would be comfortable going
in your earring

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.430
then you're done, you can make your second earring hook

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.940
now one thing with the soft wire like
this

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.659
is it is, even with the 20 gauge

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.759
it's so pretty fluid and flexible. So
there's a lot of ways you

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.210
can work harden that, you can use a wire
whacker

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.289
you can hammer it with a nylon hammer, you can

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.500
tumble it if you have a tumbler. There's a lot of different ways to harden that, you 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.360
can also hammer

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.520
just the back part with a regular chasing
hammer, it will flatten it out a little bit

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.339
the nylon options are going to keep the
finish

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:20.589
nice and shiney without scratching the
color but that's also up to you whether or

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:21.909
not you feel like it's strong enough

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.360
or that you need to harden it a little
bit more
