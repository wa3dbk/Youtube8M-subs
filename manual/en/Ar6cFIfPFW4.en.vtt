00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.450
Would you mind telling us what's
going on here today?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.210
COLONIST: Certainly.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.373
We call this the Boston
Tea Party.

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:49.250
All us colonists are getting
together to throw our teas

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.740

And would you mind telling
us why you're doing that?

COLONIST: Not at all.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.640
You see, the king is making us
pay a tax for our tea, and we

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.090
don't like it.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.470

we're throwing everything we

have that starts with the
letter T into the water.

my ties into the bay.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.470
No, see, I thought that
what you were--

COLONIST: Hey, bud.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.680
What should I do with
these turnips?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.547
COLONIST: Oh yeah, throw
them in the bay.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:20.000

order the tamales?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.060
COLONIST: Right here.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.860

Are you--

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.730
COLONIST: Yes, good, good.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.220

CHILD COLONIST: Hello.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.835
Good evening, gentlemen.

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.940
Um, I'd like to help out so I
brought my toboggan to throw

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.750
into the bay.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840

wonderful?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.940
That's the kind of spirit
that'll make

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.150
this country great.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.260
CHILD COLONIST: I guess so.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.840
COLONIST: Yeah, throw
'em in the water

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.800

wait a second.

wrong, Frog?

KERMIT: Yes.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.170
Yes.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.780
I'll say there's something
wrong.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.930
See, this is not what happened
at the Boston Tea Party.

COLONIST: No?

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.550
KERMIT: Mm-mm.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.350
To begin with, the king didn't
put a tax on the letter T or

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.140
things that start with the
letter T. He put a tax on tea,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.855
the stuff you drink,
the beverage.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.720
You're supposed to be throwing
tea into the bay.

COLONIST: Are you
sure of that?

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.360
KERMIT: Of course I'm sure.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.010

don't have to throw my tiara

into the water.

That's no way to
treat a tiara.

better go get the tea.

OK, go get the tea.

in broadcasting that has

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.846

like this, huh?

supposed to be tea bags.

going to make much of a
