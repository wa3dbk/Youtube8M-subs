OBAMA: Now, yesterday I made this same point
at a town hall in Florida.&nbsp;

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.950
&nbsp;
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.960
&nbsp;
I said one thing I’ve learned is that you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.929
can’t change Washington just from the inside.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.259
[MURMURS OF AGREEMENT]
&nbsp;

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.970
You change it from the outside.&nbsp;You change
it because people are mobilized. You change

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.650
it with the help of ordinary Americans who
are willing to make their voices heard because

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.980
that decency and the goodness and the commonsense
of Americans – that’s what moves the country

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.980
forward.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Forward!
&nbsp;

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.190
OBAMA: Now for some reason, my opponent got
really excited.&nbsp;

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.690
&nbsp;
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.460
&nbsp;
He rewrote his speech real quick, he stood

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.250
up at a rally and proudly declared, "I’ll
get the job done from the inside."

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.530
&nbsp;
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.120
&nbsp;
What kind of inside job is he talking about?&nbsp;

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.550

Is it the job of rubber-stamping the top-down,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.040
you’re-on-your-own agenda of this Republican
Congress? Because if it is, we don’t want

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040
it.&nbsp;

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.030
If it’s the job of letting oil companies
write our energy policy – we don’t want

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.030
it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.030
AUDIENCE: No!
&nbsp;

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.540
OBAMA: If it’s the job of&nbsp;outsourcers writing
our tax code -- we don’t want it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
AUDIENCE: No!

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.850
&nbsp;
OBAMA: If it’s the job of letting politicians

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.680
decide who you can marry...

that women should be able to make for themselves,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.630
we’ll take a pass.&nbsp;

AUDIENCE: Yes!
&nbsp;

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.050
OBAMA: And from the day we began this campaign,
we’ve always said that change takes more

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.170
than one term or even one president.&nbsp;And
it certainly takes more than one party. It

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.260
can’t happen if you write off half the nation
before you even took office.

In 2008, 47% of the country didn’t vote

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.859
for me.&nbsp;But on the night of the election,
I said to all those Americans, "I may not

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:31.810
have won your vote, but I hear your voices,
I need your help, and I will be your President."

OBAMA: ...or anybody here who is still undecided,

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.239
I don’t know how many people are going to
vote for me this time around...&nbsp;

I’m not fighting to create Democratic jobs

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.049

American jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I’m not fighting to improve Red State schools

The values we believe in don’t just belong

to workers or businesses; the 53% or the 47%,
the rich or the poor, the 1%, the 99%, these

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.870
are American values, they belong to all of
us.
