00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.350
So the guys have went ahead and put up the
drapes, now we are just going to go ahead

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.590
and put up the swags.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the part that I like to illustrate
for you, and how to go about of doing that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.950
This usually takes two people to go about
doing it.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.930
One person hold the other end of the fabric,
and I'm going to go ahead and work my way

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.380
up from the bottom... towards the center of
the fabric.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.180
In this particular case I have chosen to go
ahead and get the client one and a half widths

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.270
of fabric, simply because I wanted to have
deep swags.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.730
What you have to do is just simply have the
other person hold the other end, and then

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.920
you just work your way up towards the center.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.800
Just simply put pleats inside the fabric and
working your way up.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.579
Once you have it up like this, than what you
want to do is pull the pleats out, and then

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.530
I usually like to go ahead and use one of
our zip locks that come with our packages,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.500
and use this to hold the pleats in place.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.440
I will not over tighten the zip lock because
I will need to adjust the pleats.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.700
Once I'm done with that all I have to do is
just rest it on the back of the peg that's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.410
on the back of the scroll.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.810
And when I have done that on both swags, all
I'm going to do is just simply run another

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:37.440
zip lock between the two zip locks and have
them meet in the middle.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.920
This will bring them together, and all I do
is just simply rest it up there, and then

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.810
I'm going to go ahead and dress up the swags.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.020
To do this is really simple, make sure you
grab the pleat from the very end, and then

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.240
in the center and then create a crease.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.560
As well as the other end you are going to
do the same thing by just holding from both

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.330
ends and creating creases in between.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.690
This will allow you to go ahead and create
nice deep pleats inside of these swags.
