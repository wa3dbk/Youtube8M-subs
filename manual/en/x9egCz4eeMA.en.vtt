00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.600
we have a miracle noble in australia a
miracle

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.429
a baby fell under training and uh...
it's a right

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.999
it served by

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.769
this is litmus kind of story that
normally comes

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.490
uh... turkey

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.370
like this there would be fair credit
that

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.170
but in this case randomly he's not of of
my suspicions but uh... is out of

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.699
australia it's like out of a movie

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.279
the mother doesn't notice that bad

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.490
that

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.690
stroller is basically moving away from
her

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.450
towards the train tracks

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.340
but that it was the way

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.340
just as the train is coming your like

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.500
but it's it's a disaster enabled the
train are come on a candidate worse than

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.680
that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.630
but luckily it's a miracle baby

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.940
and it's arrived

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.410
now the reasons it's arrived apparently
are because train was of course coming

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.520
of stops os

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.210
going as slow as possible

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.909
to was strapped end

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.479
and that they want that apparently
saving its life

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.750
is it never fell out and didn't get
crushed

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.470
the stroller got crushed

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.210
and what they have ended just like

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.260
them i a bruises on the kid the baby had
a a little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.840
bob on the head did nothing big and but
he was dried there you here's

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.369
yes when for those of you do about that
on that's like a hundred feet

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.550
that's a long way to get dragged her
baby

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.150
and uh... so i feel that i think the
baby made it

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.030
and so then it becomes a part of
interesting story as opposed to a is sax

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.260
disastrous it's a miracle

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.280
ameerpet some of you if you still don't
believe

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.630
backup at godaddy with your evolution
injured darwin

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.810
in your court in a speech that bob in
the first at the biggest

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.320
that was the same from

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.899
family matters or whatever that show was
growing pains put it ok summer read up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:54.580
on that

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.319
but to have a miracle that we covered on
the show several

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.440
think about it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.850
but how terrible the field for the
mother at that point artistry yourself

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.630
in the mother she is adding a comment
now

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.270
always that that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.570
at the hospital the mom wasn't much
worse shape than the date but just

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.120

strongly beside ourself which of course

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.319
