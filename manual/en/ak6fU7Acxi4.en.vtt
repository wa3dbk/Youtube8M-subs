00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.480
Today on the edgy veg, we're going to make
everyone's seasonal favourite pumpkin spice

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.910
lattes.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.600
What you will need is; pumpkin, vanilla, maple
syrup, pumpkin pie spice, and almond milk,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.289
with a little bit of nutmeg for garnish.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.830
Take a sauce pan and add 2 cups of almond
milk, 2 tbsp of maple syrup.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.440
You can do one tbsp or two tbsp depending
on how sweet you want it.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.589
I like sweet, sweet is good.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:47.979
Then you are going to add 2 tbsp of fresh
pumpkin, then we are going to take a whisk

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.440
and whisk it together on the stove.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.799
Make sure you do this on a medium to low heat
so that your milk doesn't actually burn, and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:05.030
it should turn a lovely kind of like a light
to orange colour.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.120
Isn't orange great, there is something about
orange that just screams fall.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.050
Maybe it's the changing leaves, maybe it'
all the pumpkins everywhere, maybe it;s marketing.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.030
So once you have your milk a lukewarm temperature,
you can test it with your finger if you want.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.520
Add it to the magic bullet, fill it about
three quarters of the way, because we are

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.740
going to add other stuff.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.980
Add 2 tbsp of pure vanilla extract, and half
of a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.180
What's really great about the magic bullet,
is that you can use this instead of a milk

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.180
frother.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:58.560
So just blend it for about 15 seconds.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.960
So for any latte you are going to need coffee,
I am going to use 1-2 shots of espresso.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.440
Give your milk another quick buzz on the magic
bullet.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.290
Add your coffee to your cup, and then add
your pumpkin frothed milk.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.830
now you can drink it just like that, or you
can add this fun option...

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.130
This is my favourite.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.340
We are going to make a coconut whipped cream.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.889
Add your coconut milk, then we are going to
add 1 tsp vanilla, and at this point it's

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:48.810
optional you can either use half of a tbsp
of maple syrup or you can not.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:01.410
Use your magic bullet to make your whipped
cream.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.400
So you have your whipped cream and you can
pour it right on your latte.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.790
And now you know how to make your own pumpkin
spice latte at home with real pumpkins.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.359
Make sure that you subscribe to the edgy veg,
it's right down there.

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.739
I come out with new videos every Monday.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.650
Cheers.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:41.840
I don't always make pumpkin spice lattes,
but when I do I use real pumpkin.
