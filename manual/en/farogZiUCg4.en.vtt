00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.330
I've got some stains in this cultured marble
counter top.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.099
They're not super bad.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.960
But they are there.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.010
You can see here.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.520
Maybe a cigarette burn.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.450
The nice thing about cultured marble is it
is all the same material all they way through.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.290
So you can actually sand this out.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.260
What I have here is some aluminum oxide sandpaper.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.900
A lot of times this is used for prepping copper
and it is a wet or dry sandpaper.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:50.111
This one is wet a little bit but you can see
it took the stain right out.

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:51.960
See here is a another one.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110
I'll show you this won't clean off.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.920
It doesn't matter what kind of cleaner you
use.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.820
It's like a cigarette burn.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.239
Someone put a cigarette on the end and left
it there.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.019
Maybe something like that.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.019
Anyway.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:15.630
A little of this wet or dry sandpaper 
and it is good as new.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.240
It really doesn't take too much.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.560
Tiny bit of elbow grease and if you want to
you can follow this up with a cultured marble

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:35.860
polish so that it seals it and it is a little
less likely to re stain.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.280
But it is pretty resilient stuff anyway.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.600
It most likely wouldn't re stain.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.370
Anyway here's another little darker spot.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.880
Anyway.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.420
There we go.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.960
Good as new.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:13.730
Nice cultured marble countertop and this also
works down in the basin if you needed.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.560
If you had some discoloration and what not
there.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
Anyway.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.599
Good to go.
