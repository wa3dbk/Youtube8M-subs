00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.139
I have a question for all of the actors.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.520
How does it feel to be an actor?

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.310
You're hungry all the time.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.059
So when they invite you to places for free
food, you go.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.240
But it's great. Especially, you know,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.760
working on something like this and being around
people like these guys

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310
is great.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.740
Um. What's it like being an actor?

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.640
Um, it's kind of, uh,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.260
it can be exhausting and then really really
relaxing at times.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.089
Like, you can get really stressed out 'cause
you're worried about parts or

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.719
you've got lines to learn and then other times
you're just sitting around doing nothing.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.030
So it's kind of a job of extremes.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.219
Yeah, but it's fun. A lot of fun.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.569
You know, it's uh, it's just, it's just being
a kid, but getting paid for it.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.329
And uh, but you know, sometimes the playgrounds,
they're kinda not so great

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.559
it's just like they've got like one, sort
of like, see-saw and a sandbox

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.179
but like when you get to be on a show like
this,

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.819
it's the most awesome playground!

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.039
Yeah, exactly. It's like going to Disneyland.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.829
Actually, it's a dream-come-true, I mean,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.149
when you work on a canvas this big - the show's
amazing so,

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.659
it is literally like

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.479
playing. You know, you get just cooler toys
sometimes, uh,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.700
and Mark, obviously thanks for those toys.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.479
It's fantastic! Great job.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.039
Um, nice to see you. Kid Coulson, ladies and
gentlemen.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.020
He's the man.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.359
Um, when you said that question, I thought

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:42.460
every once in a while I have to remind myself
I'm an actor and not an agent.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.439
I've been playing this guy so much for the
last six years

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.869
and I walk in and there's my plane and there's
my people who work for me, and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.079
there's a bunch of people from Hydra

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.450
and there's a lot of secrets and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.460
there's these guys called Marvel I think it's
just another kind of Hydra, and

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.539
but like, nicer but they keep the same amount
of secrets.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.139
and like, I care a lot about these young people
but then

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.060
these other people are trying to kill them
and aaaaggh.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.760
Those are writers. And um,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.650
So a lot of times I forget that's what I do

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.360
and I realize, oh my God, well, if this is
my job,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.060
I need help

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.569
psychiatric help.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.970
Um, but, um,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.700
I'm the happiest person on the spectrum, I
think, is the way to put it.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.799
It's really fun, as these guys said, when
you're doing it with

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.810
really really brilliantly talented people
like this who kind of come in and,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.360
you know, we're doing, I've said this a lot

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.540
Mark is doing, and Ann is doing, and these
actors are all doing in eight days what

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.030
on any one of those movies is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.819
four weeks, you know, and um

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.269
five, at least. And uh,

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.390
so everyone has to show up and,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.200
you know rehearse it once or twice and then
bring tremendous amounts of

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.470
commitment and reality to it because, you
know, at the end of the day

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.010
we're talking about, well, this person can
turn into anything he touches

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.560
and now he's turned into stone.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.900
And if we don't all completely, really, act
the hell out of that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.650
it starts to feel silly real quick so you're
really depending

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.970
on all these other people who show up

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.409
and have to jump on a moving train

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.150
and make it work - and there is no train

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.489
it's really a couple of platforms with a bunch
of grips around it

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.000
and suddenly everyone's standing there in
magnificent costumes

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.930
and then Mark Kolpack gets a hold of it and
all of a sudden

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.560
it's the coolest train you ever saw!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.540
And we were in Bakersfield

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.239
but now it's the Alps!

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.000
So I race home. I get really mad if I have
to work Tuesday nights

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.769
cause I'm desperate to see what was gonna
be on those carts.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.250
I want to see it turned into a train.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.060
We have really - It's the funnest job in the
world and some days

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.640
people come to visit and by the end of the
13th hour they're like

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.540
I gotta go. This is really hard and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.200
exhausting. Thanks.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.700
Hail Hydra!

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.000
Yeah! Yes!

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.340
You can not

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.909
call yourself Kid Coulson.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.370
[Reed: Sorry]

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.489
I'm not sure you've got a ride home there,
my friend.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.880
You never know who is Hydra.
