00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.089
well yeah we fixing to use our new
cleaned up pot I'm gonna cook some bacon

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.540
but all I had was this frozen bacon
we'll see maybe it maybe you don't milk

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.170
before it burns

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.879
that doesn't sound that never gets old

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.470
all right let's eat but that looks like
it's going to season up real good there

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.180
I want to leave that grease in there a
little while and shush it around and see

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.320
what i realized that i'm going to get a
metal shroud around this or else that

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.420
wind is going to blow the flame out all
right this is the beginnings of my

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.930
sheath now keep in mind this is not with
like runs with knives leather and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.939
outdoors men bound this is not that kind
of quality okay this will be the second

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:25.930
sheath I've ever made I'm going to lace
it up all around the outer edge using

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:36.640
that leftover latigo that I used on the
Warhammer I'm thinking by the end of

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.850
this week I will be able to put my
subscriber appreciation giveaway video

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.159
up and i'll probably leave it up for two
weeks just so everybody has a chance to

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.060
look at it and enter but anyway i'm
gonna get started on this so i'm going

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.260
to do is take my hole puncher outer and
just run an outer edge here punch a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.220
whole bunch of holes and then run this
lace through there all right let me get

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:17.260
started we're getting there that's all I
ball I don't measure nothing okay I do

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.260
measure stuff but I think it's okay to
eyeball some things anyway about halfway

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.269
done with a whole let me get get back at
it that's what it'll look like

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:52.430
now now I'm fixing to lace it up there's
half of it I got to get me another

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:04.069
string here and cut a little point on it
and start on this side okay I kind of

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.470
like that I haven't quite finished this
yet because I want some input I could

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.959
just tie a knot here you know and make a
leave some hanging and make another knot

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.609
and leave a little bit extra hanging to
make a look kind of you know kind of

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.230
attractive but what I'm thinking of
doing is adding just another little

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.859
piece of leather right down here a
little circle the leather that these

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:39.919
would go through and and hold on to and
putting this on it I've had it for a

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.349
while there's a stretch held on by screw
and I thought to myself you know how

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:57.799
cool that would look on a piece of
leather like that I don't know so I'm

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.859
going to put this up with with the
amazing bacon video and let me know what

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.180
you think about that yay or nay and one
more thing I don't know if this is the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.489
right thing to do but my plan is to
submerge this in water and get it all

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.500
wet and then put my knife in here and
get it you know nice and form fit around

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.960
the handle and all that and let it dry
of course I will protect a handle from

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.070
water let it dry with a knife in the
sheath I don't know if I'm supposed to

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.500
do that or not I mean it's not so bad
right now maybe I'll just wet the top

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.320
and kind of press it around the hand
but anyway leather guys if you know what

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.790
you're doing men bound if you can help
me out with some advice I'd be grateful

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:57.310

let me show you that Bank this is the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.940
bank i'll be giving away you know what i
shouldn't show that combination but my

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.460

you what I'm gonna do mmm I'm gonna hit

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.720
the head my wife hold the camera if you
don't know how to open these it's just

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:22.330
like a locker so let's see let's say j
ay ka i'm going to doing this through

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:35.160
the viewfinder so j a go past it the
other way and what was it bc

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:59.260
and then CD man yes it works so it's
just like a school locker whenever you

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.840
know whenever it's a double letter you
stop in between them like that okay you

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.910

open to overseas people I have a lot of

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.070
subscribers from other countries and I'm
really i really enjoy having your

comments and you being subscribed to me
and uh I just like meeting people from

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.710
around the world but i'm not going to be
able to afford the ship any of this

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.310
overseas I've shift a few things
overseas before and it has killed me and

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:55.090
I have a have even less money now than I
did then so I'm really sorry but I'm not

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.490
going to be able to leave this open to
people who are not on the North American

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:07.600
continent actually the United States and
Canada again I'm really sorry uh just

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.580
there's no way i could afford to ship
this overseas at this time and i have

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.680
put this subscriber appreciation
giveaway off for quite a while knowing

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.320
