00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.740
hello everybody in this video we're
going to talk about how-to find

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.509
duplicate files such as duplicate mp3s

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.020
in your itunes

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.059
duplicate photos, duplicate

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.519
program files

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.550
anything that is making your macintosh

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.320
computer run slower than it used to many
times this is due to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.729
duplicate files

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:26.159
so we are going to talk about

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.619
how-to clean out our computer of
duplicate files and keep it running as

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.910
quickly as possible

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.810
so the first thing we want to do is we want to go to www dot 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.240
duplicate file software dot com

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.810
so here we go to duplicatefilesoftware.com

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.180
and then we want to just check out this
program right here

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.510
uh... tidy up

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.010
and that is the program that i use that
as a program that i recommend so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.600
what we're going to do is click this link

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.580
and it will take us to the tidy up

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.790
web page which will then let us download

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.590
the software

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.360
you'll click download now.. for the
sake of this video I've already downloaded the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.290
software

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.890
so once you click that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.880
link

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.360
it will then show up in your
downloads folder,  doubleclick that

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.840
and then you'll be able to install tidy
up and you'll see this screen right here

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.229
the tidy up screen you'll drag that over into
here

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.100
doubleclick that icon

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.880
and it will startup this program tidy up - so
here we are 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.259
there's tidy up and

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.049
as you can see we can search for
duplicates of all kinds

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.590
images, images by EXIF, aperture
photos, iphotos

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.800
music, music by tag, itunes music,
applications, other files and packages

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.770
and miscellaneous and you can select
right here

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.350
what which drive you want to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.079
search for duplicate file so you can
actually do this on a removable drive

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.180
or you can

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.040
zero in on certain folders

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.989
uh... so in the case of

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.629
this example

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.139
you can see that I checked the
macintosh hard drive

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.019
and in this example i chose music i
wanted to find duplicate mp3

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.989
folder files

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.689
that were wasting space

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.509
so i use that

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.099
and

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.729
it takes a couple minutes to scan and
it scanned about a few thousand files

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:47.129
and then the result screen comes up like
this here's the result screen

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.930
so these are all the duplicate mp3 files that it found

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.569
in my folder and as you can see it it
starts to add up... it doesn't look like much

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.799
but it starts to add up at five hundred
seventy nine items in here

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.109
and it's a very cool program because it
easily allows you to compare

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.099
the two files and in most of these cases

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.340
these were just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.619
uploaded

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:13.109
the same day

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.509
and this is just wasted space

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.259
so you can choose

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.929
 to move and copy can choose to burn
the duplicates and then this program

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.229
automatically get rid of the ones you
don't need

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.039
uh... you can also which is really cool
click

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.669
the mp3

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:34.179
it will show you where it's where it's being
stored and it will also show you

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.379
the information about the file

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.569
and the cool thing is that when you
check out the information

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.289
on the file shows you everything you
need to know

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.749
and you can even preview

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.659
like right there which is very cool

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.509
so this is the example of how it would
remove

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.379
duplicate mp3 files and i just
chose mp3s because

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.929
i think a lot of people are looking how to clean up their iTunes

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:01.410
and this is a great piece of software
that will let you do that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.199
and once you clean up your duplicate mp3s,  your duplicate photos

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.799
uh... when you upgrade program sometimes
they leave behind duplicate files

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.329
when you get rid of these things you're
going to see in great difference in the

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.260
speed

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.849
of your mac so

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.249
