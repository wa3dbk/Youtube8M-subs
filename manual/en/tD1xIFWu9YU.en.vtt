00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey guys.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm Grace.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.330
This is Game On and here's the latest gaming
news.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.830
First up, CD Projekt RED has delayed the release
of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt which was originally

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.000
meant to come out later this year to February
2015.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.179
The dev team posted an open letter addressing
those of us who have been waiting for the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.230
game to say it had been a difficult decision
but one they've had to do in order to reach

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.019
the quality of game they'd be satisfied with.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.829
The Witcher 3 when it does finally come out
will be on Xbox One, PS4 and PC.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.440
I've stuck a link to the full letter in the
description below.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.430
Next up if you can believe the image I'm about
to show you that was posted on reddit, Ubisoft

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.699
will apparently be launching a closed Watch
Dogs beta ahead of the games launch on May

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.699
27th.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.149
This listing was spotted on the Xbox Store
now there's a rather questionable grammar

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.059
error in the first line that makes it hard
to believe that this is what it says it is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.721
if Microsoft and Ubisoft haven't double checked
their work but we'll just have to wait and

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.130
see if anything emerges from the rumour.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.251
Watch Dogs comes out on PS3, PS4, Xbox 360,
Xbox One and Windows PC, a Wii U version is

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:16.620
said to be following at a later date.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.620
Are you excited?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.100
I definitely am.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.500
And finally, it looks like the Flappy Bird
creator has had a change of heart and is thinking

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.990
about bringing back the game to iOS and Android.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.180
Dong pulled the game from the app stores because
he thought people were becoming addicted to

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.590
the game and that this was a problem.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.450
During an interview with Rolling Stone Dong
said he's not working on a new version of

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.340
the game but if he did he'd make sure it had
a warning on it about it's addictive nature.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.540
Such a lot of fuss over a bird and a selection
of well placed pipes.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.720
Thanks for watching Game On News.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.410
