00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.600
Senpai?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.540
What?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.220
I suppose you cannot see the aura of misfortune emanating from this woman.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.960
Huh?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.780
All I can see is her aura of pink...
Did you take a spirit photograph or something?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.940
If approached superficially, she's a dangerous existence which will take away more than just your life.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.540
You would do well to be careful.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.780
That again?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.640
What did you do with Ayase while I was away?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.360
N-Nothing that I should feel guilty about.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.160
Why did you stammer there?

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.060
S-Shut up!

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.780
Also, I never asked if there was something to feel guilty about.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.480
I promise, nothing happened!

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.060
Ayase?! Did Ayase hear that?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.620
It just happened...

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.960
Sorry.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.120
Some things you just shouldn't say, you know!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.540
Well, you reap what you sow, right?

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.120
And who's fault is that anyway, huh?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.540
You're overreacting!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.680
Ayase.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.740
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.520
What is it?

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.920
How did you sneak in there?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.980
I'm a model.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.920
Not a ninja?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
You're watching too much anime, Onii-san.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.500
That's true...

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.340
To avoid any further danger, I instinctively refrained from asking anything else.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.760
What's this?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.200
Heh, this is my Ayase photo collection.
What about it?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.660
You're the worst.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.220
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.600
No, you're just disgusting.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.500
You just don't understand.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.340
You seem to be getting along terribly well.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.400
Does it matter?
Getting along with a maid or two makes no difference.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.360
Admit that you just want to hear, "Welcome back, Onii-chan".

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.140
I'm sorry.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.760
It's too late even if you apologize now.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.860
No, I mean... can you say that again?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.640
Die.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.900
It looks great on Ayase-chan, doesn't it?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.940
Sure does.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.580
You should try it out too, Manami.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.520
I just have to say, "Welcome back, Onii-chan," as you enter, right?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.180
Huh?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960
I feel like I've heard that somewhere before...

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.560
What's wrong, Kyou-chan?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100
No, it's nothing. I was just thinking aloud.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.880
You're so funny, Kyou-chan.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.300
Now that I think of it, maybe it would've been better to take a taxi.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.760
I don't have that kind of money.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.660
You, did you just touch Ayase's butt?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.780
It's a misunderstanding!

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.520
I-I've seen this kind of event CG in a certain game!

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.160
Stop talking or we'll get all kinds of unwanted attention here.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.080
Kanakana-chan, you're an angel!

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.980
I knew you'd be here.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.980
You're so predictable it's boring.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.520
Of course I'd be here. Don't underestimate us true fans!

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.260
A true fan of Meruru? Or a true fan of Kanako?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.320
Don't mix 2D and 3D!

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.800
You're treating a cosplaying Kanako as 2D?!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.500
Ah, how hateful.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.760
For the record, I was, at the time, walking home with all the doujinshi that didn't sell out.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.680
Feel my grudge, the grudge of the angel of vengeance.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.960
Death to couples!

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.980
That's how it turned out.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.520
Oh, this is some pretty hot development!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.720
It's like we've reached the climax.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.180
Alright! It's here it's here it's here it's here! The heroine's happy ending is here!

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.980
Wait, why is it Ayase?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.500
What's going on here?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.840
I-I'm sorry, Kirino.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.020
Huh? What's up with this development? This can't be!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.800
Good grief, are you even aware what you're saying?
