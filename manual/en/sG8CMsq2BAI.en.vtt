00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.100
First seen at E3, Counterspy created a buzz
with its period style.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.489
And now upon full release its presentation
hasn't dulled a bit, and terrifically serves

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.989
as a celebration of a bygone era.
But as much as it looks at the positives of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.109
the past, Counterspy acknowledges the negatives.
In-game you play from the perspective of a

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.160
neutral body, attempting to disable both the
US and USSR's nuclear activity.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.400
It's a not so subtle reminder of how close
we came to nuclear war and given the situation

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.080
in Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea,
it's a mightily relevant reminder as well.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.140
Where the game falls short is its gameplay.
The randomly generated levels act counter-intuitively

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.610
to the stealth mechanics. For example you
may be given a room with little cover and

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.110
many foes.
It's also relatively short and just doesn't

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.700
grab the player or compel them to continue.
This reality is incredibly frustrating given

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.689
the ingenuity of Counterspy's ideas, and how
likeable its appearance is.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.000
It still comes in at number 5, and you can
play it on the Sony family of consoles.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.900
Who said a game had to be long to be good?
I don't know, but SFB Games certainly weren't

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.290
listening when they made Detective Grimoire.
The game can be completed in one sitting,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.570
and with a great story, characters, and voice
actors, that time flies by.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.300
Investigating a murder case in a swamp, the
point and click gameplay consists of interrogating,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.260
adventuring and assembling clues.
There are also some rather elementary puzzles

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.000
as well as a feature that lets Grimoire assess
your deductions.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.269
Detective Grimoire will certainly not disappoint
you, and there's not much to critique given

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.449
the game's aims.
Hopefully there are more instalments to come,

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.600
but for the time being you can grab the game
on computer or mobile devices.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.320
As much as indie games look to the future
with invention, they look to the past with

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.180
respect.
And now, after a successful kickstarter campaign,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.030
Shadowgate, a Mac and NES game published in
1987, has been remade by its original creators.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.549
Made during the height of point-and-click
adventures, Shadowgate is set in a castle

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.489
of its own namesake.
The player, coming from a long line of hero-kings,

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.280
must rid the castle of its evil warlock lord
ruler.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.400
Of course, as videogame convention dictates,
the warlock lord is in his chamber at the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.070
very end of the castle, and you must solve
numerous puzzles to reach him.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.720
Anytime you select the wrong solution or fail
to solve the puzzle in time you are killed

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.160
mercilessly in one of many various means,
ranging from a shark attack to suicide.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.910
Apparently at the time, the extensive range
of death scenarios was considered impressive,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.000
we don't really get it, but maybe it was,
you'd have to ask some old person.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.509
Shadowgate is a warm dose of nostalgia for
older players, but also possibly an enlightening

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.000
blast from the past for newer generations.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.200
We've had a few tile-based roguelikes in the
last few months, but Road Not Taken takes

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.710
its own road via its mechanics and story.
Players take control of a black mage-like

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.400
ranger who goes from level to level collecting
kids.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.660
Returning the children to their Mothers is
actually the means by which you clear levels.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.810
Every level has many rooms, and in addition
to beating them you'll want to retain and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.880
top up health and energy for your journey.
With your magical torch you can carry and

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.430
fling objects and even craft on the go; most
of the mechanics are left for you to discover

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.540
and the strategies for you to decide.
The learning curve can be steep, especially

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.480
with particular misconceived moves rendering
levels unbeatable, but it is to be expected

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.370
of a roguelike.
Touching on the story, you can mingle with

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.150
the townsfolk and become friends, lovers or
enemies, all of which have their consequences;

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.570
seen and unforseen.
It's a really nice touch in a genre that doesn't

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.420
usually involve much character interaction.
With Road Not Taken, Developers Spry Fox have

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.340
graduated from their mobile roots and Triple
Town rather seamlessly.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.000
Road Not Taken is on PC, Mac and PS4.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.400
Mind: Path to Thalamus is a first person puzzler
in which you play a comatose patient trapped

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.710
in their own mind.
And what a beautiful mind it is too, with

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.430
every spectacular environment doubling up
as an expression of the patient's emotional

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.140
state.
But most impressive about Mind, is how it

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.390
distinguishes itself from other exploratory
games like Dear Esther.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.550
Firstly, it empowers players with the ability
to change the weather from rainy to day to

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.610
misty to night and so on.
Secondly, it gives the player clear objectives

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.830
in puzzles that are solved by manipulating
nature.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.550
In fact, aside from its presentation, Mind's
strongest aspect is its gameplay.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.170
It's the story where it perhaps stumbles,
with reaction to it varying from heavy-handed

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.960
to intelligent.
Overall, we've found Mind to be a stunning

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.250
and absorbing game above and beyond what anyone
could be expected to make alone, so props

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.530
go to Carlos Coronado for his solo effort.
That's the 5, but before you go tell us what

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.500
your favourite game of the bunch is in the
