00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.029
Today on our 2012 Chevy Impala we're going
to install tow ready T1 Connector part number

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.109
118417.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.320
First we are going to need to access the rear
cargo area.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.450
Then our first step will be removing the rear
threshold.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.630
There are a couple of fasteners that will
need to be removed first.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.730
Now we are going to get our trim tool or a
flat headed screw driver to get underneath

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.370
the threshold and just pry it up.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.510
There's several plastic fasteners underneath
threshold still holding it in place.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.169
Once we have it free we can go ahead and take
it out and set it out of the way.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.300
Now we need to remove the passenger's side
tail light to access the wiring.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.350
We'll remove the cargo hook here first.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.289
This will allow us to pull the cuffing back
and access the other two fasteners holding

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.870
in the tail light.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:01:52.500
We can go ahead and remove 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:12.560
the passenger's side tail light.
