00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
chris wants to know what the difference
of differences are between public

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.049
schools in private schools i think this
is an excellent question that a lot of

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.580
staff high school students have so let's
watch the video animal explain to you

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.489
guys

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:15.169
administers and one of the zone odors

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:20.949
use the deficit in the public collars
and a common cause i mean generally

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.829
private cosmopolitan but i wanted his
sense of what you guys think the

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.699
differences

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.560
okay some public universities are
usually funded by the state and of the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.920
reason why they are subsidized by the
state

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.539
is to keep the tuition cost low now
lately because of budget cuts the

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.549
tuition has not remained low it's
actually increased significantly in a

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:43.800
lot of states up public

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.510
university tuition is pretty compare vol
two uh... truck private university

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.130
tuition which is very unfortunate
however you also have to keep in mind

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.830
that out winning universities being
subsidized by the state they have to be

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.520
here to certain rules whereas a public
university gets the play by its own

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.370
rules in a lot of cases not completely

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.720
so i i i think that's the best
distinction to make how do you have

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.780
anything that such i don't love reading
your second point yeah so at a private

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.180
college they've a lot more control over
the sorts of groups to get formed

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.370
you know what does your free speech
count for private colleges so it's a lot

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.860
more constrained as a public school

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.960
so midget and that's why the major thing
so for instance at some public colleges

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.270
are if you want to create like a
christian group bright if that christian

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990
group discriminates against
non-christians

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.210
it might not be recognized as an
official uh... organization within the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.540
university or it might not get any
funding from the university however at a

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.900
private university

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.719
sure that might happen mouth encouraged
by it might be encouraged so

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.229
you might want to look into the
different policies that a private

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.829
university has risen the public
university

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.809
and then you might make a decision on
where to go based on that alone but also

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:58.739
keep in mind that in most cases public
universities are supposed to be cheaper

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.859
but that's not always the case do your
research
