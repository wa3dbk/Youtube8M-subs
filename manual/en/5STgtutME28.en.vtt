00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.580
This is our newest robot.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.840
So far we are referring him as the Teen Size
Platform

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.110
The idea is that we developed, together with
help from Robotis company and from RoboCup

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.859
federation, teen size robot

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:37.370
like size, about a bit larger than 90 centimeters
for the humanoid teen size class that other

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.510
teams should be able to use.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.370
So we tried to make the robot as simple as
possible and also affordable, so that other

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.090
teams can aquire it and also assemble it.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.930
Maybe repair it if necessary and also make
changes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.240
They are different previous platform.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.850
So one, I think, that we looked at, it was
the DARwIn-OP robot, that is sold by Robotis

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.850
for the kid size class.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.110
I think it is very nice robot but unfortunately,
it’s too small for the Teen Size class.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.490
So we took many ideas from there and tried
to make the robot very simple.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.920
Regards to the DARwIn-OP robot, we have much
more computing power here

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.640
we have Dual core computer and also, I thinl,
the possiblity of dual lens is better and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.270
we will have also better wirelless connectivity

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:44.389
It is not exactly a product, but more like
a prototype.

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:51.639
Currently we make the first prototype walk,
so I think we can produce more of these robots

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:52.729
in the next weeks

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.100
I’m currently working with my administration
and also Robotis company to actually find

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
out a good way how to distribute this robot.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.450
we got support from Robotis to build this
prototype.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.780
Prototypes are quite complicated, regard to
the mechanics, and also maybe regards to the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.670
assembling, to the maintenance

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.480
the biggest advantage of this robot, is clean
and simple design

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:37.569
of course we will use important components
from Robotis, including the actuators, and

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.640
also this electronic controller.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.340
Producing more of this very first version.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.470
I think we can do it in our mecatronic workshop
in the University of Bonn.
