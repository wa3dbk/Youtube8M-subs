00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.170
- What is up, my clan?

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.710
Welcome to Tuesday, day 1033?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.090
Already had lunch with my
friend Fred for taco Tuesday

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.580
and then stopped in the office
to say hello to my old team.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.000
Hello old team.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.420
It was really great to see all their faces

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.330
and say hi and to hear that a lot of them,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.710
are actually watching the vlogs.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.750
So, a lot of them are
watching this right now.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.170
Hi, hello, hi.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.620
But now, I am on my way to a coffee shop,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.050
a nice coffee shop to get some work done

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.550
and then eventually have a little meet up.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.840
Tiffany is out and about with her sister

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.420
and her friends for lunch and shopping

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.500
and I doubt that she's shooting
any video at all right now

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.532
because she's not with the kids

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:42.130
and she tends to only vlog with the kids

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.630
or when the kids are around.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.800
And that's really the
only time she ever vlogs.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.000
Cause when I'm around,
she doesn't vlog at all.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.090
She barely picks up the
camera if I'm around,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.300
she's like, oh I'm off the clock.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.300
It doesn't work that
way, Tiffany. It doesn't.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.920
(loud background noise)

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
You guys, this is awesome.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.050
I'm sitting here at Elevate Coffee Company

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.960
just hacking away on my laptop.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.340
Replying to comments, replying to e-mails,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.540
replying to Tweets.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.782
Watching Youtube videos,

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.090
just soaking in the ambiance,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.960
the atmosphere that a coffee shop has,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.880
even though I have my earbuds in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.090
there's still people walking
in and out, there's music,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.550
there's just the hustle and bustle

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.750
and I could get used to this.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.090
I think I need to do this
at least once a week.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.300
Just find a cool coffee shop,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.590
sit in for, ya know, four, five hours

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.080
and kinda recharge the batteries. Yeah.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.492
(loud background noise)

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:40.210
Alright guys, so people
have started to show up

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.960
for the Wordpress meet-up.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.800
And so, I thought I'd
take this opportunity

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.590
to go grab a quick bite to eat,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.880
since I have so many awesome
choices here at Norterra

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.050
and then head on back for
the start of the meet-up.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.420
And dinner is served.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.670
Going solo tonight, Pita Jungle.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.750
Got cilantro and jalapeno hummus

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.340
with seared ahi tuna.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.170
Some scallops that I already ate

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.800
and some Mediterranean olives. What?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.880
- Hey guys. We haven't vlogged in awhile,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.783
sorry 'about that.

00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:12.090
We've been playing with friends

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.500
and me and Bryce have
been playing with friends

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.992
and mommy was watching TV shows.

00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:19.492
So now, it's dinner time.

00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:22.250
- We're missin' daddy.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.670
- He went to jail.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.622
(laughing)

00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:27.050
- That's not funny, silly goose.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.130
Daddy's at a meet-up, coffee shop,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.283
doin' some stuff.

00:02:32.283 --> 00:02:35.170
So. Yeah, we made dinner
a little simple tonight.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.920
Just a little tostadas, it
kinda looks like sloppy joes.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.920
But it's actually turkey
meat and salsa beans.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.880
Oh, I forgot the lettuce, will
you get the lettuce, Ciara?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.913
- [Bryce] I'll get it.

00:02:48.913 --> 00:02:51.162
- Let's make some tostadas.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.670
I'm gonna make some
tostadas, how do you make

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.590
- [Voiceover] You're gonna need a bigger

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.130
scoop than that, girlfriend.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.960
- [Bryce] (mumbling)

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.500
Let me show you how. (mumbling)

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.210
- [Voiceover] Let's speed
this process up a tad.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.880
Bloop, it's kinda runny.

00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.033
- So much for a big scoop.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300
- [Voiceover] Put some
lettuce, what else do you want?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.170
Cheese? Salsa?

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.782
- Oh yeah, let's do the cheese.

00:03:32.782 --> 00:03:34.050
- [Voiceover] Where is the cheese?

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.300
We're missing everything.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.090
- Mmm.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.670
- Oh man, belly is full of awesome food

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.703
I love Pita Jungle.

00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:44.000
It's probably one of my
favorite restaurants.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.952
I don't get to go there very often

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:47.090
because they're kind of
scattered throughout.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.750
And nothing really, super close.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.457
But, so good.

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:52.992
(loud talking)

00:03:52.992 --> 00:03:54.590
- Am I totally gonna be in the vlog now?

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.000
- [Voiceover] Totally, totally.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.500
- Goodnight guys, see you tomorrow.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300
- [Voiceover] I guess that's it for today,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.710
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.750
- Goodnight, see you tomorrow.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.710
Goodnight, see you tomorrow.

00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:15.630
Goodnight, see you tomorrow.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.550
- Alright you guys, just wrapped things up

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.750
with the North West
Valley Wordpress meet-up.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.460
And, met some really cool people.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.534
A few people actually
already knew who I was,

00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:26.710
watched the vlogs,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.590
so hello to all you awesome people

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.250
that I met tonight, for the first time

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.840
that all knew who I was.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.590
After the meet-up we
stopped and had a drink,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.750
few people had some dinner,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.090
continued the conversation, if you will.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.340
And now it's late and I'm tired,

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.380
and I'm ready to go home

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170
and I have a long drive because I'm like,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.452
again, as usual 45 minutes
away from where I live.

00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:50.300
So, there's that.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.080
Well guys, I think I said
in the coffee shop earlier,

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.871
but this, today was
exactly the type of day

00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.000
that I wanna have in the future.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.550
Like, working at a coffee shop,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.670
at a co-working space, wherever.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.210
Like, up and out of the
house at a decent time,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.130
socializing with people,
getting stuff done,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.710
and just feeling
productive and being happy.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.960
Even though I'm my own boss

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.550
and doing what I want, when I want.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.380
Being at my house and being in my pajamas

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.000
and kind of going throughout the day

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.710
without really showering or moving around.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.130
Like, it plays with my head.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.000
And it kinda sets my mood
and my tone off a little bit.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.130
Definitely felt more productive
getting up out of the house

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.960
and it was a great day,
had a good time for sure.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.050
I have no idea what Tiffany
and the kids did tonight,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.710
I didn't see any check-ins,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.170
me and Tiffany didn't really talk,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.800
so hopefully it was a great video.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.952
If you liked it, give it a thumbs up,

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:49.750
if not, sorry, there's always tomorrow.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.000
Speaking of tomorrow, NFL Experience.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.920
We are going downtown
for the NFL Experience.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.500
I have no idea what to expect,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.340
I got a little, little bit of
a taste of it this weekend,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.500
walking down there for Monster Jam.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.420
There is stuff everywhere,
there is stages,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.460
there's people everywhere.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.050
So, stay tuned, tomorrow

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.800
should be an awesome, awesome day.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.000
We'll see you then.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.300
Vlog on.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.210
Well there you go guys,

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.050
hope you enjoyed that vlog.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.162
If you did, be sure to
give it a thumbs up.

00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:17.250
On the screen, two more really fun videos,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.000
these videos are awesome.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.750
One year ago, we were still dealing

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.210
with our lice situation.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.670
We shaved Bryce's head the day before.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.170
So today, I let Bryce shave my head.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.500
And so, we do that.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.874
Two years ago, really awesome video.

00:06:30.874 --> 00:06:32.210
We were at Walmart goofin' around,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.743
playin' around, came back home,

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:36.533
did some Just Dance,

00:06:36.533 --> 00:06:38.460
did some jump rope in the house.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.960
Just a really fun day with the kids.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
So, check those out.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.840
