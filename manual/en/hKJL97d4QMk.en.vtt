Hi, I'm Tim Gipson. I'm going to talk to you
about how to repair minor damage in dry wall.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.820
Now we're talking about minor damage, we're
talking about something like this where we

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.880
have an old attach point for a wall fixture
or a mirror or a picture or something that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.860
went up on the wall or minor nail holes. Now
a good tip for just doing nail holes, probably

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.500
repainting is actually get yourself a tube
of toothpaste. And you can use the toothpaste

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.270
to fill in those holes. And if it's a you
know, a white paste that's typically better.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.540
That toothpaste will actually dry and give
you a good surface to paint over for that.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.240
So that's just something you can use just
for something around the house. Now if you

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.579
got some larger areas then a good light weight
spackling is useful to have around and good

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.739
for that. And that's what we use for this
particular case. And this is an old attach

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.570
point that we had, and old anchor. So what
you want to do is you want to just take a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:14.170
scoop of your lightweight spackling and you
want to press it in to the area. And typically

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:24.549
anything that we repair like this is going
to be sitting down below the surface. So what

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.690
we want to do is we don't want to have to
do a whole lot of sanding when we use this

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.110
lightweight spackling. So when you fill it
in and you just scrape across and then any

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.630
residual you can just kind of rub away. But
now what we need to do is we need to let this

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.310
dry for about ten to fifteen minutes with
the lightweight spackling. And in some cases

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.510
maybe you should just take something like
a two twenty grit sandpaper or a three hundred

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.240
grit sandpaper, something really fine, and
just lightly sand over this area. But in most

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.850
cases when you're doing minor repairs you're
doing a good job of just filling it in and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.769
then smoothing it off with your putty knife
or with a plastic scrapper. You ought to be

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.290
able to get a smooth enough finish. Now you're
ready to paint over this. Now if it's a larger

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.590
repair you might want to hit this with a little
bit of primer and then come back with your

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.980
paint and that'll keep from any shadowing
coming through your paint. Otherwise you may

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.239
have to put two or three coats of paint over
any kind of a repair, even something this

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.079
small. So I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to
repair some minor damage in drywall.
