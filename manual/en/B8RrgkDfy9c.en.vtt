00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
Since I'm a kid I wanted to be Nipple-Man.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.500
You know he solves crimes with his nipples

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.340
I never got to have a blind date really, unfortunately. I wanted to.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.430
I thought about going online and like
going on a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.800
dating website. At least this process will be anonymous. And it´d be fun.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.410
yeah like I really wanted to know how it like

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.200
works at matching likes and dislikes.
They would have figured out it is you.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.800
Every like is like Drew Barrymore movies - love them

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.800
I actually did struggle with the scenes where I don't like him because I like him so much

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.869
I love him and thought that would be fake and lame

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.130
I was at ease with it, it was fun to be mad at her and not like her.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.789
I was having a difficult time with the liking scenes.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.289
Drew would be like, can we do one more and you look at me like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.549
actually there's a feeling there

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.100
they call action and Drew would hold a picture of a puppy in front of her face

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.600
and I would love the puppy.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.400
You finally go on a date and it's so awful
Belinda, Bunny and onion soup

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.560
you know everything with Dick is so first class

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.000
I don't wanna make you feel lonelier than
you probably already are.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.300
No, I am not lonely.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.090
I always have done the same thing although I did

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.530
have to work in a coffee house for a
while

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.590
and I really had a good time

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.610
but I wasn't, my boss he didn't like me he
didn't feel like I did anything

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.030
As a waitress? Yeah.
Which coffee house?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.700
The Living Room in Los Angeles. I heard about the Living Room. It was like

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.920
a nineties hipster joint laid back and like that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.220
in the hey days of coffee houses. What was your bosses problem?

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.300
He felt I sucked at everything I did.
Were you good?

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.159
I mean I tried.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.510
I really did everything pretty poorly.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.159
You were clumsy? I just wasn´t very good at it.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.060
And then I worked at Music Plus which I
thought I was much better at because

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.700
when anyone came in to rent a movie I knew everything about every movie

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.180
and I love the history of movies and so
that I felt like I was much better at.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.980
But again my boss Whitney he was not cool.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.269
he was like a typical hasher he really hated me

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.480
I don't know why!
He was mad at his name Whitney.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.030
I know for sure since I was a kid I wanted
to be Nipple-Man

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.200
You know he solves crimes with his nipples

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.260
Whenever he hears about a crime

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.900
his right nipple wakes up the left nipple
and they go on put a stop to it.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.489
How about you Drew?
Nipple-Girl, I would think.

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.640
You are known to put that cape on.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.370
But I do get excited when anyone
references Firestarter, because

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.860
I would like that ability. 
That was cool

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.989
You were a young little girl starting those fires.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.500
How old were you?
Seven.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.400
Seven years old and starting fires with your brain.
Thats right.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:26.350
You don't know maybe you did. Mayby you did do it and you didn´t remember.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.940
I think it was real.
