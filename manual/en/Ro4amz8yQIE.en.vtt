00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.350
Today, I'm going to show you how to do the trinity knot

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.190
it's a pretty cool knot. It looks kind of fancy when you've got the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.380
three-way fold. So, it's

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.940
it's not too hard, I'm going to show you how it's done, just pay attention.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.039
okay, now you want to have

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.160
the thick end on your right hand and and the thin end on the left hand

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.439
okay, now, you go about

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.910
belt length, a little bit under your belly, and lined up to the middle.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.099
now, you're going to take the thin end with your left hand

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.040
and make a V and go through the back

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.530
and out the front, like that.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.120
now, you're going to go from the right hand again over to the left

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.120
like that, and go, through the hole again. Now,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.219
you're going to want to tighten that up a little bit right there, okay. Now, with this side,

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.050
you're going to come out

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.050
from the left, cover. Go out through the middle

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.690
Now you're going to go, this part right here

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.010
is a little tricky, you want to keep it a little loose

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.360
go right there through this hole that you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.640
made, and then this thin end

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.250
you're going to go around the back

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.060
folding it, like, without folding it, I mean.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.280
just keeping it straight. See? like at the back end of it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.370
and you're going to come back up and find this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.940
little loop that you just made, and go through that loop

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.940
like that. See? Now you just fix this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.730
and this end right here, you want to hide it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.730
right under your neck like that

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.510
okay. So, just check that it's all good and lined up

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.740
and now you have it. And uh, this looks pretty cool.
