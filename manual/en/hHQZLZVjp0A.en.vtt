00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.968
Hi Guys, welcome back to my channel!

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:05.178
Today, I am going to do my monthly favorites
for August.

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:09.949
I really didn't have much, I've been using
the same things over and over— however I

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:15.610
thought I would mention some things I didn't
mention in my July Favorites today, in my

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.939
august favorites.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.919
I'm a huge fan of powders, I am always looking
for a new setting powder, something that won't

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.898
make me look cakey and that will go amazing
on top of my concealer.

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:34.838
And I have been using the City Color Flawless
finish Mineral Powders.

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:39.099
I have two different colors, I have one in
the color Tan — which is closest to my skin

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:42.739
tone, and the other in the color Natural — which
is a little lighter.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.309
This is probably the color I would be in the
wintertime.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.599
I really do love these mineral powders.

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:50.159
It does have a scent to it…

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.459
And it took my by surprise.

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:55.989
They don't smell bad at all; but if you aren't
a fan of scents, I don't think this would

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.239
be for you.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.018
But, It doesn't bother me or anything… it's
not bad, but there is a scent there.

00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:07.509
It's very buttery in texture and easy to blend
out and it's very light on the skin.

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.649
But it still has a good amount of coverage.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.249
The next product is my sunlight trio by city
color and…

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:16.859
I really like the formulation and the pigmentation
of this.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.629
I have a full video of my city color cosmetic
picks, so I will link it down below, i'm going

00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:23.999
to spend too much time on it.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.660
But, I really do love this — and it's been
an absolute fave.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.809
The last product is my favorite nude lipstick
and this is called kiss me softly by city

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:34.239
color.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:40.189
Its kind of goopy because it melted; I love
this lipstick so much that I actually bought

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.939
3 back ups, because I've been using it a lot.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.349
And I just love that it's the perfect nude
for my skin tone..

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:52.669
It's hard to find something that isn't too
pink or isn't, you know… too white or too

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.039
beige to make me look washed out.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.389
This gives me a nice wash of color; its long
lasting, long wearing and amazing on my lips…

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:05.049
So, that is it for all of the makeup, so we
are moving on to hair.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.749
The only shampoo and conditioner that i've
been using lately, is the NuMe white truffle

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.749
— they look like this.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.399
And, I have been loving these so much!

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.419
They have been making my hair so silky and
so shiny.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.729
Easy to mange; Also, it's stronger!

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:26.439
Like, it's not breaking as much and I really
think it's these shampoos and conditioners.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:32.149
They have a whole line of hair masks, hair
primer and a leave in conditioner that I use

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.149
also.

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.869
But I wanted to talk about these — because,
they are in pumps which is super easy to wash

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:38.869
my hair with.

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.069
I don't have to worry about wasting shampoo
or conditioner on the bath tub floor.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.069
Because I put too much!

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.439
I have a lot of hair, so I need a lot of shampoo
and conditioner.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.289
And I love that they are paraben and paraffin
free.

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:56.990
They smell really good — they are easy to
use, it gives you a nice little sud, but it's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.060
not overly sudsy — which I like.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.759
I like it to actually work without all of
the suds because I want to make sure that

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:04.759
it's cleaning my hair.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:10.979
I had to throw this into my favorites because
it instantly became a favorite a few days

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:11.979
ago.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.849
I've been using this for, I believe, 3 or
4 days I want to say.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:15.939
I don't really remember.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:22.278
But, I've been using the Neutrogena complete
Acne therapy system…

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:23.439
That's the box, I kept the box for you guys!

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.809
I'll make sure that I do a full review, because
I asked on Instagram — if you guys would

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.659
like to see a review of it, and a lot of you
guys said yes…

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.418
So, I decided to give it a try, I've tried
proactive before and I love proactive, there

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:38.168
are a few things I don't like about it…

00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:42.109
The fact that it dries my skin out and makes
my face itchy!I don't know if I am the only

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.109
one, but that's what it does to me.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.448
So I went ahead and gave this one a try — you
get a skin polishing acne cleanser, which

00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:52.119
actually is a good size!

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:55.069
You also get this acne control lotion.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.448
Right here, so you are just going to apply
that t the problem spots.

00:03:58.448 --> 00:04:02.910
And then you get an oil free lion with SPF
15— so that caught my attention too… that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.069
means I don't have to put on extra sunscreen.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.899
So, I've been using all three for the past
few days &amp; I can say, It did clear my breakouts

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:14.248
out, in two days.

00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:15.549
Like, it really did.

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.539
Like I said, I will do a full review for you
guys when the time comes.

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.029
I just want to use it for a little bit more
just to make sure that, you know… that's

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.029
what it is.

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.848
And it's not because I stopped eating something,
or something like that.

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:31.658
So, now that we are done with skincare and
beauty, I do want to mention an App.

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:32.778
That i've been obsessed with.

00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:40.718
It's called "Weheartit" and its like, a fashion
and beauty and quotes and pretty things!

00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:46.348
This whole app has just pretty things and
I have an account.

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.878
I've been with them for a very long time — of
you aren't following me already, I will have

00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:55.759
my information down below in the description
bar of how to follow me and where to find

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.289
it, but it is called "Weheartit" and I absolutely
love it!

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.478
And I highly recommend that you guys check
that out!

00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:02.378
I hope you all enjoyed this video.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:06.618
