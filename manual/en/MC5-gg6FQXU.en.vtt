00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.360
Now that you're feeling more confident with
your skiing and you're getting around the

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.720
whole mountain on the pistes, we're going
to get a bit more adventurous with your skiing.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.070
We're going to look at four things: Carving,
Off Piste, Powder and Bumps.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.160
The technique that you've learnt on the piste
is exactly the same, but there are some tactics

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.030
and a few things to focus on that's really
going to help you pick your skiing up to that next level.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.010
Let's take a look.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.940
Something we haven't really looked at yet
is the Pole Plant. It's going to be really

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.000
useful on bumps, steeper slopes, powder, all
over the mountain. It's going to give your

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.580
skiing another dimension and it's really going
to help link those turns together.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.460
Lets take a look at two main things that are
going to help you with the pole plant. Firstly,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.700
the arm position. It isn't any different to
what you are doing when you're skiing without

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.780
pole planting. Keeping those hands away from
the body out in front, the pole plant isn't

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.759
any kind of reaching movement or any elaborate
arm waving strange thing. So I'm going to

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.000
keep those hands in front and it is just that
wrist action.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.149
Secondly, the timing, this is key. The pole
is going to be coming through nice and slowly,

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.100
through the turn, and then you are going to
release the end of the turn, place the pole,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.789
and then turn round it. Remember, it's always
the downhill pole, you're always going to

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.589
feel you're going to turn around it.

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:43.280
Get the timing right, my pole is coming forward,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.539
I release the edge, I plant the pole, and
start the turn.

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:57.069
So the pole is coming forward, nice and smooth,
pole, turn. Forward, pole, forward, pole.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.569
My hands are staying nicely in front.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.080
Theres no hesitation between the pole plant and the start of the turn.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.670
I'm keeping my hands forward, and using the pole plant to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.060
help link the turns.
