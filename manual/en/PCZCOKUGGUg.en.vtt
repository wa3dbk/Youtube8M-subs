00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.920
So I'm going to show you how to make really
fun and easy Mother's Day cupcakes.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.330
My mom likes to get flowers on Mother's Day,
so I'm going to show you how to make sunflowers

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.950
on your cupcakes.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.280
I already have my green bag and my yellow
bag, and I'm going to show you how to color

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.860
butter cream.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.960
I'm going to need some brown for the center
of my flower.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.940
All you're going to do, in a bowl with your
white vanilla butter cream and a rubber spatula,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.440
is to drop in the color one drop at a time.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.199
You want to start with one at a time so you
can get the color you need, because you can't

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.350
take color out.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.500
Just mix that really well.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.750
This is still looking a little light so I'm
going to add some more brown - about four

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.030
drops.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.330
Mix that really well.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.379
I can get a really good arm workout.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.379
Okay.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.680
So, I like this color, and you'll know it's
done when you don't see any mismatched coloring,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.800
no more white, a nice uniform color.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:22.970
Then I'm going to take our empty pastry bag
with a small star tip and fill it.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.440
I'm going to start with the center of our
sunflower.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.960
I'm going to start right at the dead center
of our cupcake, hover a little bit over the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.180
cupcake, and make a swirl.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.280
Just keep going.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.820
Make it so that it's flat.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090
You don't want any peaks or anything.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.090
Right to the end.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.040
Then we're going to take our green butter
cream with our leaf tip which has two prongs

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040
like this.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.970
You're going to hold it so that it's vertical
so when you hold it to the side it looks like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.750
a little mouth.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.730
At the ends you're going to pipe little green
leaves.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.790
Just short bursts of pressure, and pull it
away fast so you get those really nice peaks

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.390
at the end.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.530
Do that all the way around.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.860
Try to make them the same size, but if they're
not, that's okay.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.959
So, those are our leaves for a sunflower.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.180
Then I'm going to take our yellow butter cream
with the same leaf tip, holding it the same

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.340
way, and just overlapping on our green.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.629
Make these a little bit bigger because these
are our petals.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:31.629
Do the same thing.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.990
Just go all the way around.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.629
I'm letting this hand do all the work by turning
it, and this just stays still and applies

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.349
pressure.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.349
That's one layer.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.110
I like to do two layers, so do the same exact
thing all the way around overlapping our last

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.110
layer.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.110
And there we have our sunflower.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.521
I like to do a bunch of these and put them
all together and give them to my mom so it

00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:57.360
looks like a nice bouquet of flowers.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.739
And who doesn't like an edible bouquet of
flowers.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.109
So that's how you make easy Mother's Day cupcakes.
