00:00:02.482 --> 00:00:04.753
Tell me how to develop Steam games.

00:00:04.753 --> 00:00:07.093
Do you know how to make Adobe Flash games?

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:11.342
That’s more for the cute little webpage
games that you hope are addictive enough for

00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:13.592
someone to pay a dollar for an extra life.

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:18.413
If you can make an Adobe Flash game, you can
develop a Steam game.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:22.452
You can wrap Adobe Flash games in an executable
file for Steam.

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.473
I’d heard it ran the Flash runtime environment.

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:28.513
Steam can run games on XNA and DosBox, too.

00:00:28.513 --> 00:00:31.452
It is actually pretty flexible.

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.522
Except for the digital rights management locks.

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:38.693
That’s the choice of the software developers
who put a lot of games on Steam, not anything

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:39.693
you have to do.

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:44.273
I’d like to use a software development kit
that I can use to publish games for Android,

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:46.563
Apple and other devices, too.

00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:51.543
GameMaker Studio lets you publish games to
Steam, and GameMaker works with the Apple

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:52.593
Appstore and Google Play.

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:57.693
That is an advanced tool, though, probably
out of my skill set and budget.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:01:02.763
So create Java games, though they are resource
intensive and do not run well except on fast

00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:05.513
PCs, though it works fine with Source.

00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:08.713
I’d say Java games were junk except for
Minecraft.

00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:13.053
That’s still junk, just addicting, kind
of like junk food.

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:18.533
Kind of like Adobe Flash, which is so bad
on mobile devices that the new HTML standard

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.763
eliminates it with video and audio elements
instead.

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:25.013
Do not forget there is JavaScript in there,
too.

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:29.492
But you can use Adobe Flash’s ActionScript
to make Flash games for Steam.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:31.673
I’ll consider that a starting point.

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:36.863
Coding the game is just a starting point,
followed by packaging the executable.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.593
The harder part is getting Steam to publish
the app.

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:42.553
You send it to their version of the App Store.

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:46.223
Steam is a lot pickier of games than the Apple
App Store.

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.233
They get a lot of submissions but reject a
lot of them.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:53.823
I’d want to know they will Greenlight the
project before I pour my heart into it.

00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:58.443
Actually, their process for approving games
is running it through Steam Greenlight and

00:01:58.443 --> 00:02:00.263
letting beta testers vote on it.

00:02:00.263 --> 00:02:01.443
*What does Apple do?

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:06.823
Take your fee for publishing it and thirty
percent of the sales, not caring if 80% of

00:02:06.823 --> 00:02:11.322
the programmers get less than five thousand
dollars total for their effort and half do

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:13.552
not break even on development costs.

00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:18.343
I’d want to use what Valve, Steam’s makers,
recommend that we use.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:23.343
Kind of like the Apple App Store having a
natural bias toward Objective C and now Swift,

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.112
Apple’s proprietary languages.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:28.623
Steam’s custom game engine is called Source
Engine.

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.072
That’s written in C++.

00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:33.362
At least that’s not up in the air.

00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:39.623
Actually, Steam does accept games created
in Adobe Air, along with XNA and Adobe Flash.

00:02:39.623 --> 00:02:43.152
As long as whatever they accept is not a flash
in the pan.

00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:48.014
Steam actually worked with Linux developers
to create a Steam-compatible Linux box, so

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:50.332
I think they’ll hit the mainstream soon.

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:54.572
No, just wanted to dedicate the most computing
resources to the game.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:56.342
That’s what you want to do, isn’t it?
