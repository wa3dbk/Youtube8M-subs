00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I can imagine you are sick of the European cars

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You can totally change, and take a look at this Chevrolet Camaro

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Which isn't a 4 cilinder engine, with a small turbo.
But a V6, 3.6

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This car is so big, and I feel really small in here.
Everything is big..

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Not only its engine size, but the car size aswell

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I can hear you think; A Camaro with a V6?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Yes! The 3.6 V6 by GM

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But I can understand you don't know this engine, because it has never been an option in the Netherlands

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And that has a reason..

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The V8 is very expensive because of its emission.
And when you have the option for a V6, the V8 will be useless..

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The V8 costs around 100.000,- Euro.
And the V6 costs around 50.000,- Euro, and has 100hp less

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I would know it!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This V6 produces 305hp, which is 100hp less than the V8

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And I think it is enough. 
The car weights about 1600kg, with an automatic transmission

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And it is very comfortable. You don't buy this car as a sportscar.
Allthough he looks very aggressive.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is a real nice cruiser, on the highway like this, very enjoyable!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And his looks.. totally different than most cars here in Europe, like VW and BMW

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Which are good aswell, but with a car like this you are different than the rest.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
When you buy an American car you have to calculate the differences

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Like the speedometer, it goes till 160.. ofcourse this car runs faster than 160km/h

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But the speedometer is in miles. And the mirrors.. they work as a magnifying glass

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Which I don't like, because we don't have much space in the Netherlands, and this car is allready big

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The comfort of this car, decreases the sportivity. But how sporty do you wan to be with this car?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The automatic transmission is great, and when you drive slow, you can feel the quiet V6

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Low rpm.. Do you want more rpm, than switch to M mode.
Shifting goes with the buttons behind the wheel

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Back to second gear, and if you than push the pedal to the metal, the V6 comes alive
0:04:22.000,0:04:28.000,
But is this my new favorite car? No I don't think so..

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The V8 can convince me maybe, I really miss that sound with this V6

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The V6 is quite calm

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But it runs great.. the only disadvantage is are the windows

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000
They are very low, and take away you sight. Which you really need with this big car

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But I really like this car, it is very different than all other cars

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And the V6... good enough!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Well, we had to do this.. is this American Camaro ''McDrive Proof''?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It is a big car, I think that the McDrive in America is bigger

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But I think we can make it..

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Can I get two hamburgers? Thank you

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Just what I thougt; we have to reverse

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Hello, thank you

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Jorrik: well, we made it
Pieter: yes, we made it, but you have to be carefull, this car is big...
