00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:21.050
I’ve played a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.910
pretty limited number of horror games in my
lifetime.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.279
When I want to be scared, I usually don’t
want to be in control because I feel like

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.401
I’m going to mess up and get myself killed,
but once in awhile there comes a game in the

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:32.259
genre that catches my attention.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.900
The Suffering games were some of the most
horrifying I’ve ever seen, and today we

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.140
have a very interesting beast; a game that
mixes the on-edge tension of traditional survival

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560
horror with investigation similar to LA Noire.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.070
And yes, it is actually scary.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.650
This is Condemned: Criminal Origins for the
360.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.829
Condemned: Criminal Origins puts you in the
role of a detective named Ethan Thomas.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.790
As you’re investigating an extremely grisly
murder scene, you realize that the murderer

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.900
is actually still on the premises.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.960
After chasing him through a series of floors
and buildings, he steals your gun and eventually

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.330
kills both of your partners before tossing
you out a window.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.680
Because it’s your gun, the police department
assumes that you’re responsible for the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.870
murders, and this creates an interesting situation
for the game.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.850
Not only are you trying to track down the
killer, you’re on the run from your own

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.310
department, who seem to fully believe that
you’re the man responsible.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.430
The pacing of the events is especially well
done.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.180
It’s very slow with quick bursts of action
in between.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.200
Gameplay in Criminal Origins is a bit strange.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.760
It’s from a first-person perspective, and
although you start out with a pistol at the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.500
beginning, it’s actually very rare for a
gun to pop up.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.120
Instead, you have to improvise with sledgehammers,
pipes, axes, and even your taser to attack

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.350
enemies, who appear to behave like drugged
out lunatics struggling to regain their own

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.350
sanity.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.620
Out of all of the elements of Condemned, I
found combat to be the weakest.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.549
Blocking is especially hard to time, and whenever
you hit an enemy, they almost always launch

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.660
this massive strike right back that makes
it hard to string a few hits together.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.670
This is why it’s especially important to
use ammo wisely, because a shot to the chest

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.800
can end encounters that might otherwise get
you killed.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.260
Like I said, the game also uses detective
elements to help move the story forward, but

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.260
these are pretty bare-bones.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
It’s usually just a “scan an item, then
call your friend at the lab” scenario.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.220
Now, I mentioned in the past that I’m not
a fan of games that just scare you by startling

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.170
you around a corner, and thankfully, this
game doesn’t do that.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.640
You’ll usually see an enemy running to a
spot to ambush you from, but won’t actually

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.420
see if they get there, setting up some tense
moments.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.510
Sound effects also let you know that something’s
up and the limited light in some areas also

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.020
means that you’ll have to search every corner
to make sure no one is about to sneak up on

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.060
you.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.720
Condemned was a very, very early 360 game,
and it’s sometimes painfully obvious by

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.800
looking at it.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.060
Faces lack any sort of emotion or detail,
and some of the in-game effects look really

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.060
fake.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.910
Voice acting, on the other hand, is actually
excellent.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.120
Everyone I encountered gave a great performance,
even minor characters.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.590
Condemned: Criminal Origins suffers some problems
associated with first-person games focusing

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.970
on melee combat, but it’s still a very interesting,
and fairly scary game.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.970
For best effect, I’d play this one by yourself.
