MUSICIAN: (SINGING) Listen

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.495

How Casey MacPhee the engineer
got his train through.

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:23.184
He faced the toughest duty
an engineer could do.

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:28.154
But he was brave and unafraid,
and he got his train through.

00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:32.130
Through, through, through,
he got the train through.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.615
Through, through, through--

00:00:34.615 --> 00:00:37.597
COOKIE MONSTER: (SINGING) Me

MUSICIAN: (SINGING) Train was
carrying moo cows, and milk

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.583
There were six cars filled with
cookies, and a tank of

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.026
chocolate goo.

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:52.773
The stuff was for the parties
that the kids

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:54.156
would have all year.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.738
And getting that train through
the narrow pass was the job of

00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:58.981
the engineer.

00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.714
CHORUS: (SINGING) Through,
through, through, he'll get

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:03.454

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.915

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:14.140
Oh, this train filled with
stuff me love to eat.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.030
And children all waiting for
it on other side of narrow,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.130
dangerous mountain pass.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.500

[RUMBLING]

00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:52.150
MUSICIAN: (SINGING) But an
avalanche had closed the track

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.330
and covered it with snow.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.250
The snow was deep, the
track was blocked.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.890
There was nowhere he could go.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.230
Casey knew the train
was filled with

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.210
things he loved to eat.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.648
But Casey knew his duty, and
would not admit defeat.

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.145
CHORUS: (SINGING) Through,
through, through, he'll get

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.970
Oh, this very hard choice.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.975
Track covered with snow.

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:28.610
If me stay here and not try to
get through pass, me stuck

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.002

six car loads of

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.765
cookies and ice cream.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:40.188
All alone, with nobody
watching.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:43.010
Oh, me getting hungry.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.860
Me getting very hungry!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.802
Ooh, maybe it not too bad
if me eat some cookies.

00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:54.794

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:56.365

MUSICIAN: (SINGING) Yes, Casey
was a hero, and his

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.440
duty he could see.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.777
Without the cookies
and the milk, no

00:03:17.777 --> 00:03:22.106
parties could there be.

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:31.030
The kids would be unhappy,
so Casey raised his head.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.490
COOKIE MONSTER: (SINGING) Me
forget about the cookies, and

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.750

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.140
