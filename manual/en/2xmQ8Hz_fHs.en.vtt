Hi my name is Greg Goldberg on behalf of Expert
Village. You can check us out a www.minettis.com.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.670
In this segment, we are going to talk about
how to prepare the chicken for the chicken

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.930
Alfredo pizza. Over here I have two chicken
cutlets that have the fat cut off, bones taking

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.880
away and then have just been slice into the
breast right in half. We are first going to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:38.469
add some seasonings. A little bit of salt,
a little bit of pepper, and we are going to

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:55.059
throw those into the pan. Next what we are
going to do is throw a little garlic in there

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.420
and of course, we've already put a little
pit of olive oil down in the pan so the chicken

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:14.450
doesn't stick. Lets turn that up a little
bit there. Get that garlic mix in there. Just

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:30.320
a few minutes we should be good with that.
A little bit more salt. It is always important

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:49.289
to remember to season both sides because you
never know what side is going to be up and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.130
what side is going to be down so make them
both good. Depending of the thickness of the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:36.080
chicken, of course that effects the cooking
time. These are pretty good size cutlets so

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.909
they are going to take a few minutes. The
last thing you want to do is under cook chicken.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:45.909
We got a nice golden brown starting on that
side, time to flip them over. Right now, we

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:46.909
are just trying to scours both sides a little
bit. What that does is conceal all of the

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:47.909
juices and it's going to make that end result
amazing. As soon as they start to cook a little

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:48.909
bit we are going to throw a little white wine
in there. You always want to make sure that

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:57.599
you cook alcohol well when you add it. Get
the alcohol cooked out there and that is going

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:04.140
to make some awesome chicken. All you need
to do from here is let it simmer for a little

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.010
while. The sauce would reduce for a little
bit and you are ready to chop your chicken.
