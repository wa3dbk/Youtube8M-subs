00:00:06.177 --> 00:00:09.177
My dream is to be able to work in an international setting

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.110
and incorporate international healthcare and medicine together.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.480
Medical school is my current dream, I'd say.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.416
An ambassador.  

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:19.252
Be a professor of English.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.390
Work for a publishing company, or as a copywriter for an advertising company.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:24.455
I could see myself in Brazil, traveling with the locals.  

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.135
When a student asks me what they're going to do, 

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.865
I tell them, whatever they want.  

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.829
I had a student who has just begun at the Department of the Defense,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
as an intelligence analyst.  

00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:34.578
I've got a student who's now working for the FBI,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.635
so we have students who work in law enforcement 

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.236
and for the government in quite demanding and interesting jobs.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.773
Teaching, research, actuarial science, 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.399
trading, law school, professional schools, biology.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.614
They go on to work as therapists, they go on to be research scientists,

00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:53.432
industry, criminal justice.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.870
So I have one of my students working at CSI Los Angeles 

00:00:57.168 --> 00:00:59.168
and another one at CSI St. Louis.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.792
German, Russian, Hebrew.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.833
And then she started working for a newspaper, 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.640
and worked for another newspaper, 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.939
is now working for an embassy.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.610
And all of this in four or five years.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:20.076
Top patent lawyers, neurosurgeons. I just think the sky's the limit.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.220
When I tell a student that they can pretty much become anything,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210
I get very mixed opinions.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.225
Because the college is so broad, I'm able to really just 

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.411
gather a lot of information, and take courses 

00:01:38.172 --> 00:01:40.170
that are not related to my major at all.

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:45.400
So I've taken things in political science, in sociology, anthropology, business, geography.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
I mean I like that, having that and being 
 able to get kind of different perspectives.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:55.630
Synthesizing proteins, looking at all the different cellular components, 

00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:59.120
stuff that's really applicable on a real world scale.

00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:01.680
Well the research I currently do is in international healthcare.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:03.970
It's developing programs in rural India.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.920
I hope to alleviate malnutrition and malaria through novel techniques.

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.920
The best experiences in the classroom usually come from having a really good professor.

00:02:11.796 --> 00:02:14.800
Sometimes people may look at the U of I and see 

00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:18.100
that it's a really big institution and it's hard to connect with your professors,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but I think if you really make the effort and take 
 the time to go in to their office hours

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
they'll make that same effort back to be in touch with you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you can make some really good contacts.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.950
We take teaching very, very seriously.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420
It's something that, a lot of time is spent on it, 

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.250
it's not just a second thought after the research

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:38.200
actually teaching is equivalently important to the research.

00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:41.310
That combination means that you get these world-class 

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:45.290
infinite opportunities encapsulated in a place where teaching is great.

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.420
We're talking about the exciting developments in our own research, in our own labs.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So I think we try to share with them 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.690
the rigor that we bring to our subject and 
 also hopefully spawn creative thoughts on them.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.030
That then led to a discussion of the healthcare system,

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:02.160
and at the end of the class, and that was really cool, 

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.220
one of the students came up to me 
 and shook my hand, and said, 

00:03:05.272 --> 00:03:08.270
"Wow, Professor Hilger, thank you so much for letting us talk about this, 

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:11.450
because this really matters to us."

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.490
But you can sort of explore this through literature 

00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:15.560
and this is really what I try to do in my classes.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.970
I emphasize that it's something that you do, 

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:19.630
it's not something that you watch or that you listen to,

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:21.810
but, that you're really going to do something, and by doing something 

00:03:22.612 --> 00:03:24.610
you're going to change yourself.

00:03:23.868 --> 00:03:25.870
Basically, the way research works in the psychology department is

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:28.900
a lot of it is run by undergraduates.

00:03:28.804 --> 00:03:30.800
They help out coding data, running subjects, 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.620
there's tons of opportunities for that to happen.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.990
Actually extracting bacteria that live at about 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
two to three or four miles depth in the crust of the earth.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Identifying those bacteria, determining what they do.  

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:45.440
What they do for a living, what do they eat, 

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.310
what do they take in for nutrients?

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:49.350
Trying to use that information eventually to understand 

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:53.570
how to reduce the impact of oil extraction on the environment.  

00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:56.740
You walk down the hallways, and you see professors' doors are open

00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.160
you can go and knock on them and go and sit down with them.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That openness and sense of accessibility is, I think, very special.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480
Basically, it's whatever you want to do. 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:09.590
A place like Illinois can offer it to you.

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:14.060
I want to get outside my comfort zone, and achieve everything that I can.

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.270
What I've learned here, not just in my classes and through my coursework,

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:20.790
but outside of my classes whether it's in the community or abroad,

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:26.020
will definitely be able to help me not only seek out new opportunities 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.160
but actually be able to participate in and whatever 
 I do take part in, do it well.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.820
This is the College of

00:04:32.775 --> 00:04:34.780
Liberal Arts and Sciences,

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:36.160
where I'm inventing, 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.010
I'm inventing, 

00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:37.680
I'm inventing my future.
