Hola Foodtubers, I'm Omar Allibhoy and I'm very passionate about Spanish food

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm going to be cooking today a classic dish,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.200
tortilla de patatas - a Spanish Omelette

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.580
so I know it's only three ingredients it's super simple but it's about getting those three ingredients really right

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.920
over the years I've been able to cook thousands of Spanish omelettes

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.720
this is the one that I found and it tastes the best

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.760
We need a really hot pan as hot as you can get it. We're going to start pouring the extra virgin olive oil

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.840
be very generous please remember it's an oil that you will reuse again and again.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
Half a litre of oil approximately

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.600
In a Spanish household where we cook Spanish omelettes day in day out

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.760
this oil we just drain it, keep it in a bottle and we reuse it again probably five, six, seven times

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.240
While the oil heats up I'm gonna thinly slice an onion and I'm going to add it in to the oil

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
the only ingredient that can give the sweetness to the omelette is the onion

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:11.220
I put the onion first because it if you do it as a second ingredient after the potato

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.880
He won't caramelize, he will become translucent but that's not the flavour that I'm looking for. Straight in.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.200
Second ingredient the potatoes, nice waxy ones, Desiree, Charlotte these potatoes hold the shape better

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.440
three millimetres approximately not thinner, not thicker the right thickness so that they don't cook too slowly

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.500
neither they fry too quick. Okay add it in, sort of like three potatoes. Every ingredient has sugars

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.940
and a Spanish Omelette even though that you add salt to it it has to feel sweet

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.500
starting to get golden and the potatoes are still completely raw so I'm going to leave these for 10/15 minutes

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.220
until the caramelize properly and they release all of those sweet flavours that will get in to the egg later

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.160
so i've stir this potato sort of like two/three times they are nearly there

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.280
while this finishes I'm just going to break six eggs. It may look like a lot of eggs and a lot of potatos

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.460
but this only is going to serve 4-6 people. So this potato is now ready and you can see just by breaking through it

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.160
put the potatoes on top, drain the potatoes with the oil. Take a look at the onion

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.200
how wonderful, how caramelized, the potatoes nicely fried and now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.100
these potatoes are the ones which I'm going to season with a bit of sea salt. Not whisking the egg,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.880
give it a little mix. This has become quite warm and I just want the potato to soak a bit of the eggs

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.620
and all linger together. If you cook it too quickly it won't taste the same

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.500
and it may look like it's quite runny but after 15-20 minutes you'll see that it won't be

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.760
so i'm just going to cover it with aluminium foil and let it rest for 15 minutes

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.960
okay, this tortilla mix have been resting for 15-20 minutes, it's not that runny anymore

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.380
take a look it has sort of thicken up, all those burnt bits of the caramelisation of the onion has dissolve in the egg

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.340
I have a non-stick pan and all the tortilla mix goes inside then just we are just gonna leave it on high heat

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.320
for about a minute and then lower it down for about two minutes - we'll flip it and do exactly the same

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.780
it's been two, three minutes already and I'm just gonna check it's not sticking just by taking a spoon

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.580
through the sides and just by giving a little shake you'll see that the edges separate

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.220
and all I'm going to do is just to put a bit of pressure in to the plate and just flip it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.080
really naturally, really simple and as you can see it looks nice and golden, all the edges are nicely cooked.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.080
and I haven't stirred or anything this is not scrambled eggs and neither you put it in the oven by the way

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.560
I've seen all sorts of things done with Omelette. Always the plate much wider than the pan and just flip it

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.460
put the end of the omelette at the end of the plate and just slide it in

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.460
and let it cook again on high heat for a minute and low heat for a couple minutes

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.320
This tortilla - it's ready. How do I know? You just need to touch it like a steak and you see if it bounces or not

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.920
Otherwise you just need to pierce it with a knife, or a toothpick and see if it's still moist.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.880
So now it's only the flipping part again. A bit of pressure on the plate, take the handle with strength

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.300
and just turn it around.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.280
You'll have a good looking omelette so now the only way to see if it's properly cooked as we like it

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.700
is by cutting it in two

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.520
What a great recipe, still nice and moist in the middle so let's give it a taste

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.780
The centre is the best bit, to me it's like any good cheese really

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.720
That's perfectly cooked, really sweet. That's the caramelisation of the onion and potato

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.800
and you know what? It still tastes great whether it's later in the night or tomorrow - you can leave it and reheat it

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.800
it always tastes great actually

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.700
Now is when you can feel and see that the three ingredients, the egg, the potato and the onion

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:40.060
has come together in this beautiful tortilla. If you want a really nice drinks recipe to go with this Spanish omelette
