00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.059
My name is Kelly Lehmann

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.800
and I'm in Peace Studies major.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.950
I am passionate about women's rights

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.460
and... dancing

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.679
and singing and performance.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.539
I was involved with my good friend Zoe's

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.720
final thesis performance and being in
that performance was the beginning

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.660
of the coming together of Peace Studies and performance for me.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.280
If performance

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.250
can be a way of expressing

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.949
through art the issues of the world

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.290
then that would my preferred

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.910
method of activism.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.880
The dead Man Walking school theater
project

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.059
was a really exciting project.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.290
I had seen sister Helen who is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.540
the star of the play -- who it's about -- come to Naropa the year before

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.140
and then having the Peace Studies and
the Performing Arts

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
department chairs come together -- start to
organize something together

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.840
was like yes this is this is where I
wanna be!

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.840
I was a guard

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.130
in the play -- a prison guard -- mostly

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.649
and uh yes it brought up a number of things for me.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.909
What a guard might experience watching

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.489
someone on death row. And how they would relate with that person.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.940
Brought up the intensity of --

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.970
the closeness of life and death.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.430
I would like my art to further

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.120
a spiritual path of developing

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.540
selflessness and kindness.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.020
Naropa in one-sentence put me through the ringer

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.290
and it hurt so good.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.320
Going through

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.430
the rough spots is probably the most
beneficial part

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.610
of Naropa because like I've really come into myself.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.180
I was able to myself

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.200
and encouraged to be myself here. I have just completed my

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.680
internship at Peace Jam which

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.290
is a global organization that brings
together

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.010
Nobel Peace Laureates with students.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.459
In South Denver they conduct

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.239
an after school program and so

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.239
I was able to work with about 20

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.630
kindergartners and first-graders. I have
really enjoyed working there

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.910
because -- because of the sense of humor

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.299
of people at Peace Jam and also

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.470
just the importance a letting young
people

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.600
know what peace is and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.480
that there's some alternative to

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.900
dealing with conflicts with violence.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.440
It gives me lots of hope.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.920
While I'm here on this planet

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.940
why not do something

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.660
helpful?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
