00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.480
"The creative mind is the most rare mind
and especially when it's a creative mind

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
with discipline. Architecture already
gives you the ability to have lots of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.120
different types of jobs because you're
never just doing things you know how to do,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.740
you're always doing things that are
harder and more difficult."

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.680
"Learning about Sustainable Design and Coastal Design is important not only in Louisiana,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.340
but in any coastal city around the world."

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.480
"LSU offered me the opportunity to be in a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
big, dynamic environment with lots of
resources that allow you to be not only

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.780
a better designer, but a better team leader.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.140
Not only do you form long-lasting bonds,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.100
but you learn how to work with other designers."

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420
"Architecture never gets any easier.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.480
It's always challenging, it's always new, and you're constantly pushing yourself.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.840
And even when you have a huge
set of skills, there's always something new to learn.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.640
I chose to do the dual-degree here at LSU

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.900
because I don't see them as two separate fields.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.660
I think Landscape Architecture and Architecture are really just the design of space.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.560
You're just working at different scales and with different medium."

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.480
"The world and environment can be sort of intimidating
and, you know, you can't really control it.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.080
So for us, the graduate program offers
that unique investigation to teach the student

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.080
how to be able to do that."

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.000
"The principles of teamwork, discipline, like,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.649
learning how to manage your time,
learning how to work with other people,

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.909
learning how to not give up when a
situation gets tough has definitely

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.780
been beneficial to me."

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.880
"It's a small enough
program to where you know your teachers.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.110
A professor helped get me an externship.
You visit a firm and you go to meetings

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.670
with them and you sit in on design
consultation. And I think that's a really

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.080
unique opportunity that LSU offers."

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.080
"I love LSU because I get to be involved.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.280
It's really exciting to have someone ask
your opinion about what you want to learn

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.580
and how you want to learn it."

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.100
"Art is my first passion, and the need to be expressive was very important.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.960
I really learned the impact of creating public spaces

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.160
for people for a long lasting time."

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.660
"The creative thinker's always imagining what has not happened,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.400
and how then they're going to make it happen.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.500
I don't even actually know if there's another program
that really focuses very actively,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.760
instead of just actively in your mind.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.220
That you actually will discover new things by making things.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.140
We teach them how
understanding their local place

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.120
helps them understand their greater place."

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.780
"Seeing the final product is just like,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.980
'I made that! That's--that's mine!

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.620
I made something really special.'"
