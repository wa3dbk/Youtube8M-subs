00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.360
Did You Know? that there are multiple cancelled Star Fox Games?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.480
The first cancellation in the Star Fox series was a sequel to the original Super Nintendo game, simply named Star Fox 2.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.200
A ROM of Star Fox 2's alpha build was actually leaked online.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.480
The beta build of the game was also leaked in 2002, showing the game very close to completion.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.400
All of the gameplay elements were in place, and besides a few minor bugs, it seemed ready for distribution.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.800
It's said that the game was shelved because Miyamoto wanted a fresh start on 3D Nintendo games using the N64,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760
but there's never been an official statement as to why the game was cancelled.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.120
One thing we'd like to point out, because it's a pretty cool and obscure reference:

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.340
The game's title screen is paying homage to the original Star Fox beta title screen.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.120
The second Star Fox game to kick the bucket was Star Fox Virtual Boy.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.660
Star Fox Virtual Boy was shown as a tech demo, presumably because its space combat was a good demonstration of the Virtual Boy's 3D capabilities.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.180
The game was cancelled, obviously, because of the incredibly poor sales of the Virtual Boy,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.900
and the only people to ever see it were the attendees of E3 and the winter Consumer Electronics Show of 1995.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.480
The footage you're watching right now is the only known footage of the game to exist.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.400
In some respects, the game lives on.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.680
Nintendo released their vision of a 3D Star Fox game with Star Fox 64 3D on the 3DS.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.100
The last Star Fox game to be cancelled was Star Fox Arcade. It was announced alongside Star Fox Assault for the GameCube.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.340
We've heard nothing more about the project since its announcement, and it's assumed to be scrapped.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.120
This is the only image of the game released by Nintendo. The only image known to man.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.680
Now this is a pretty interesting theory. Here you can see Fox McCloud. Duh, right?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.960
Well, take a look at his legs. They're robotic, and so are all the legs of all the other pilots in the Star Fox universe.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.240
The theory goes, their legs were amputated to stop blood rushing out of their upper body and into their lower legs under the intense G-Forces.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.560
This would make sure they don't pass out from lack of blood flow to the brain.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.980
Modern fighter pilots in real life wear tight clothing around their legs,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.980
stopping the blood rushing into their legs and preventing them from fainting, so this is a similar principle.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.560
There is an argument against this theory that the Arwings are actually equipped with a system called G-Diffusion

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.500
that reduces the intensity of G-Forces inside the ship, but this concept wasn't introduced to the Star Fox universe until Star Fox 64.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.100
This metal leg concept is also referenced in the Super Smash Bros. series, where Fox clearly has robotic legs.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.060
In the newer Star Fox games, Fox seems to have normal organic legs with big boots,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.720
but the modern design was remodeled by Rare, not Nintendo, for Star Fox Adventures.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.180
It seems the original vision for the Star Fox pilots was a little darker than we all realized.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.100
There's a hidden Star Fox reference in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
Once you've collected all the masks on the second row of your inventory, you might notice something.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.940
The first mask is the Keaton Mask, a fox.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.860
The second mask is the Bremen Mask, a falcon.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.000
The third is the Bunny Hood, a rabbit or a hare, and the fourth mask is the Don Gero Mask, a frog or a toad.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.260
The fifth mask is the Mask of Sense, a pig. In order, these represent the entire Star Fox team.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.580
In addition to Fox, Falco, Peppy and Slippy, there's also Pigma, who used to be a part of the Star Fox team.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.800
He betrayed Fox's father James and joined forces with Andross.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.480
This isn't the first Star Fox reference in a Zelda game, either.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.580
There's an enemy Arwing hidden in the code of Ocarina of Time.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.740
Though it's not presented naturally in the game environment, it can be accessed using cheat codes.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.980
In June 2011, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata interviewed some of Ocarina of Time's developers

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.120
for his web series Iwata Asks in honor of Ocarina of Time 3D's release.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.680
Satoru Takizawa, who designed many enemies for the game, brought up the topic of the complexities of boss physics.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.740
He revealed that the movement patterns for the boss Volvagia were copied from how an enemy fighter tails an Arwing in Star Fox 64.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.520
The Arwing was inserted as a placeholder so the development team could mimic the movement accurately,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.600
then simply switch out the model for Volvagia.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.120
