00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.850
Valyria and its people vanished in a mysterious
cataclysm many years ago, but some relics

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.160
of this great empire still exist throughout
Westeros. The most well known is Valyrian

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.290
steel, a material so strong and mysterious
very few know how to re-forge and no one has

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.410
been able to recreate it.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.149
This steel was primarily used for weaponry
and is believed to have been created using

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.969
dragonfire, which made a blade so light and
sharp that no armor could withstand it. A

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.630
blade forged from Valyrian steel can be easily
distinguished by its dark ripples, which is

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.430
a result of the blade being folded many times
back on itself.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.000
In Westeros, most noble houses possess a Valryian
steel sword.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.350
The sword named Ice belongs to house Stark,
it is classed as a greatsword due to its size

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.550
and after the death of Robb Stark it was reforged
into two seperate swords for House Lannister.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.189
Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper belonged to King
Joffrey Baratheon and Jaime Lannister, although

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.259
these were not the first Valyrian steel swords
that House Lannister have owned. Previous

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.600
to the War of Conquest, King Tommen the Second
of Casterley rock possessed Brightroar. He

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.249
took this sword and sailed toward Valryia,
neither Brightroar or the King were ever seen

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.880
again.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.929
Longclaw was the Valryian sword of House Mormont
for over five hundred years until Jeor Mormont

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.740
passed the sword down to Jon Snow during his
service at the Night's Watch. Jorah Mormont

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.319
forfeit ownership after he had brought shame
to his family by selling to a slaver.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.380
The Iron Islands have two noble houses that
own Valyrian blades, house Harlaw own Nightfall

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.119
and House Drumm own Red rain. Over in the
Vale, house Corbray own Lady Forlorn and House

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.279
Tarly of the Reach possess Heartsbane.

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:55.200
The last known whereabouts of the Valyrian
steel longsword Blackfyre, was during the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.139
Blackfyre Rebllion. This weapon had been passed
down through generations of Targaryens after

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:05.349
it was brought to Westeros by Aegon the Conquerer.
It was at the center of this civil war after

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.679
Aegon the Unworthy gifted it to his bastard
son, Daemon. After Daemon's death, his half

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.040
brother Aegor Rivers took the blade across
the narrow sea where began a mercenary group

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.549
called the Golden company.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.790
Dark Sister belonged to Visenya Targaryen,
sister and wife to Aegon the Conquerer. Dark

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.840
Sister has been in the Targaryen family since
before the War of Conquest and was passed

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.939
down to Targaryen siblings after Visenya's
death. It's current whereabouts is unknown.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.840
House Royce, Roxton and Hightower have had
ownership of Valyrian swords but it is unconfirmed

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.579
whether the weapons are still within these
houses possesion.

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.549
As well as these swords Valryian steel Daggers
are an expensive and rare item throughout

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.019
Westeros. The steel can also be found in the
Dragonbinder, a relic from old Valyria, and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.469
some Maestors also wear a link of Valryian
steel, which represents the study of magic.
