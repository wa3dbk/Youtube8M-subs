contains 191 pieces, and is recommended for ages 5 through 12.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870
So we get to make the tanker. It's like probably like 12 wheels. You got a double axle in the back.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.250
So we get to make the tanker. It's like probably like 12 wheels. You got a double axle in the back.

So we get to make the tanker. It's like probably like 12 wheels. You got a double axle in the back.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.380
Looks like a gas station.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.570
So we come with a mini-fig.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.630
And we do get numbered bags in here. We'll see that in a second.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.660
And we do get numbered bags in here. We'll see that in a second.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.200
I guess we get to make all this cool stuff,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.640
I guess we get to make all this cool stuff,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.460
and see all the features that it has.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.020
So let's take a peak inside and see what we get.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.020
So let's take a peak inside and see what we get.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.240
Looks like this thing is packed with pieces.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.570
So the bags are numbered. Looks like we get a bunch of plates.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.540
You get a ... "Energy".

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.310
So we get a bunch of stickers..

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.260
We get a long string with a hose spigot attached.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.549

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.110
Get the instruction booklet.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.099
I don't know if this set had one or two instructions.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.350
I don't know if this set had one or two instructions.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.610
Bag number two. Lots of various bricks and plates. I see some tiles in there.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.340
Bag number two. Lots of various bricks and plates. I see some tiles in there.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.119
Nothing else in the box.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.049
So let's put our tanker together.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.159

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.879
Here's the Tanker Truck all assembled.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.019
In a moment we're going to be going through the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.090
various parts and accessories that you do get with this set.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.819

Let's look at the various parts that come with the Tanker Truck.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.669
Here is the mini-fig.

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.419
I like the overalls.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.040
Two-toned.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.029
Comes with the hat.

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.629
Sweet mini-fig.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.540
Does come with the truck.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.449
Now we have the presumably a fire extinguisher.

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.949
Now we have the presumably a fire extinguisher.

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.359
Now we have the presumably a fire extinguisher.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.519
This does go into the compartment behind the truck.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.799
This does go into the compartment behind the truck.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.149
This does go into the compartment behind the truck.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:09.299
Just a simple brick and water spigot.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.939
Now we have the gas pump.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.449
Few things to note here that this does come off very easily.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.619
Few things to note here that this does come off very easily.

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:18.929
This is not really user-friendly

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.629
with the hose and stuff.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.389
I didn't put the sticker on here because I'm probably going to re-use that tile,

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.239
but this is printed on here. Here is the control panel.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.849
I like the printed tiles. I don't know why they didn't print this one.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.599
You also get the valve here to turn of and off the pump.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.239
I like the two-toned effect here with the red stripe.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.549
I like the two-toned effect here with the red stripe.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.669
It's a great idea for a gas pump.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.649
It's a great idea for a gas pump.

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.689
Here are the stickers that come with the set.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.739
Here's the sticker that you would use for the gas pump, and these go on the tanker.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.260
This is supposed to be for the front.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.030
I don't know why they didn't print these on. I'll probably save these for something else.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.139
I don't know why they didn't print these on. I'll probably save these for something else.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.479
And here's some of the various parts you do get. You get an extra spigot,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.019
And here's some of the various parts you do get. You get an extra spigot,

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.919

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.469
and you do get an extra long hose with a water spigot attached.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.249
And some various angle slopes ... stuff like that.

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:17.549
And some various angle slopes ... stuff like that.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.880
And some various angle slopes ... stuff like that.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.880
Just extra knick-knacks that usually come with the set.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.749
Here is the Tanker Truck and it's packed with a lot of features.

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.550
Here is the Tanker Truck and it's packed with a lot of features.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.279
First thing you're going to notice that we do actually get a pull-out hose.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.960
First thing you're going to notice that we do actually get a pull-out hose.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.129
It's on a string. You got the hose spigot.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.460
It's on a string. You got the hose spigot.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.590
It only goes, I don't know,  about eight or nine inches.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.409
It only goes, I don't know,  about eight or nine inches.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.229
And the truck is on three axles.

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.010
And the truck is on three axles.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.379
Take a look at the side here.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.199
You get the ... these are fo-mirrors.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.379
They look really great and the doors do open up.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.379
You can see inside the cab.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:08.379
And the top of the cab does come off.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.270
You do you get your steering wheel.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.719
You also get a mug.

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.899
And, there's room for a mini-fig to sit.

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:22.090
Pretty much only one mini-fig can sit in there,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.710
but it is easy to replace the top if needed

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.050
You got your front here. There's suppose to be a sticker, but I left the sticker off.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.360
You got your front here. There's suppose to be a sticker, but I left the sticker off.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.930
I like the front of the bumper ... the details, the grilles.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.879
I like the front of the bumper ... the details, the grilles.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.630
You get a cabinet here. This is where the little fire extinguisher is suppose to go.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.770
You get a cabinet here. This is where the little fire extinguisher is suppose to go.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:44.969
I like the way they integrated the cabinet.

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.560

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.469
I like the rails for the step-sides.

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.309
This ladder.

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.489
I like the top of the tanker.

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:59.899
You got the two valves here on top. Also your mini-fig can walk on here as well.

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:02.469
I like the use of the grates next to the turn valves.

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.530
I like the use of the grates next to the turn valves.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.639
I like the use of the grates next to the turn valves.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.509
Really great detail.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.280
There was suppose to be stickers on here that says "Energy" but I never put them on there.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.139
There was suppose to be stickers on here that says "Energy" but I never put them on there.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.029
But all-in-all, this is a great little truck.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.939
Lots of detail.

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:20.759
Great!

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.549
Rolls around nice.

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:27.429
And I like the use of the white and you got the red stripe which

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.539
And I like the use of the white and you got the red stripe which

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.199

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.909
does continue onto the container of the truck,

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.419
does continue onto the container of the truck,

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.280
as well as the green on the bottom.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.549
They really thought this out really well.

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:45.949
Nicely done.

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.979
The Tanker Truck is a terrific set for any Lego builder,

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.259
and will fit with any Lego theme,

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:52.809
and will fit with any Lego theme,

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:55.699
and has lots of play time.
