(SINGING) From homes
of Saints glad songs

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
arise, for there
the Lord is King.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.400
There faith is learned
and prayers ascend,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.500

scriptures old are loved,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.600

too, all thanks

God's truths protect
the hearth from wrong

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.900
when error's ways allure, lift
minds from self to nobleness,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.300
keep thought and action pure.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Then sing, O Saints, in hymns
of praise; sing thanks to God

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.200
on high, whose counsels
kept in homes on earth

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
bring heaven's glory nigh.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.200
From homes of Saints
glad songs arise,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.600

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.300
There faith is learned
and prayers ascend,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.700
