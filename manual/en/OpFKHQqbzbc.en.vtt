Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking
Traditional Irish Scones

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.380
Hi Bold Bakers! Today is a very special St.
Patrick's Day collaboration with fellow Irish

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.860
YouTuber, Donal Skehan. Donal is a great chef
and he makes beautiful homemade dishes. Here's

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.349
a little note from him.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.210
(Donal)
Hi Gemma! Donal here. A big welcome to Hoke.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.710
My hometown just outside of Dublin. I hope that
these scenes aren't making you feel too homesick.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.750
I just want to say a big Thank You for taking
part in my big St. Patrick's Day collaboration.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.140
I cannot wait to see what you come up with.
Over on my channel, I'm going to make the

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.290
most beautiful, warm and comforting Irish
Apple Crumble. It's totally delicious and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.750
served with whipped cream. It is a thing of
true beauty.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.939

Happy St. Patrick's Day and I'll see you soon.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.330
I'm really looking forward to Donal's Apple
Crumble and I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.250
the perfect traditional Irish scones. So let's
get baking!

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.650
When people ask me what Ireland is like, I
tell them about the beautiful green landscape,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.080
the great people, and just about our overall
culture in general. And a big part of our

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.990
culture is the food. It is simple, great ingredients.
And a perfect example of this is that Irish people

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.600
love a good cup of tea and a freshly baked
scone. It cannot be beat!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.549
So we're going to start out in a large bowl.
Add in your flour, sugar, salt and baking

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.990
powder, and then mix them together.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.850
If you follow me on Instagram, you'll recognize
this Mason Cash bowl. I absolutely love them.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.479
It's what my mom used for baking when I was
growing up. So I brought it from Ireland to

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.090
California because I like it so much.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.429
To this we're going to add in our cold, cubed
butter and we're going to rub it in with our

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.590
fingertips and get it nice and small. This is
a little bit of a messy job but you don't need a

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.889
machine so it's really good.

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.189
Because we're making Irish scones, I'm using
Irish butter. It's really good for baking

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.679
and it's nice and salty.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.429
Just rub it through your fingers and the result
we're trying to get is kind of like big and small

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.219
bread crumbs. The good thing about this method
is the rougher the better, it doesn't all have

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.939
to be uniform. Ok, perfect. This is what we
want. It was nice and fast. As you can see,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.249
there are some big lumps of butter. There
are some small lumps.

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.520
These are all going to melt differently and
give you a beautiful, flaky scone.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.380
If you're going to flavor your scones, you
can add something in at this point. I'm going

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.340
to add in raisins but you can use blueberries,
maybe chocolate and orange, any flavor you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.209
like. But just do it before you add in your
wet ingredients.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.120
Now in a jug add in your milk, cream, and
egg. And whisk all together. If you don't

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.230
have cream, you can use all milk but cream
makes a really nice light scone.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.060
Now add your wet into your dry ingredients.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.099
My secret to perfect soft scones is very simple.
Don't overmix your dough. You never want to

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.040
overmix flour. I know you hear me say it a
lot but it's true. So you want to go in with

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.680
a nice big, open hand, move around your ingredients
until they form a dough and then stop. As

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.209
you can see, my dough is starting to form
a ball. Now I don't want to put in any more

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.049
liquid in here, I'm just going to bring it
all together with my hand and scoop up those

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.110
dry bits. Any loose raisins, you're coming
with me too. Now that was nice and fast to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.450
bring this dough together.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.209
Now we're going to flour our surface and cut
out our scones. Pat out your dough with your

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.980
hands until it's around an inch thick. We
want nice thick scones. Now use a cutter to

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.900
cut out your scones. Making dough is one of
my most favorite things because you can always

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.090
tell with your fingers whether you're on the right
track or not. Now place your scones on a lined

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.930
baking tray. This dough is looking really
good. It's soft and easy to work with. With

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.650
the scraps you have left over from cutting
out your scones, push it all together gently

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.110
form a new dough and keep on cutting until
it's all gone.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.849
Sometimes with the last little bit of dough,
there's a little nobbly guy but he'll still

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.900
taste great so put him on there too.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.500
Before our scones go in the oven, we're going
to glaze the top. And I'm going to show you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.790
a little trick that my mum showed me.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.579
I think cracking a whole egg for glazing is
a bit of a waste so what I do is with the

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.640
jug that I had the milk and the egg in, there's
a little bit always left over in the bottom.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.719
And I put my hand in there. I don't even use
a pastry brush and then just glaze the top

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.140
of the scones. This will give them a lovely
golden brown finish when they're done. At

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.319
this point you can actually freeze your scones,
and then when you want to bake them take them

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.069
out, let them defrost for a few minutes, and
then bake off lovely fresh scones.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.959
These guys are ready for the oven. We're going
to bake them off at 350 degrees F or 180 degrees

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.900
C until they're beautiful and golden brown.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.900
If you like this recipe, then I have over
60 BIG &amp; BOLD baking videos that I know you'll

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.940
love so if you haven't done so already, don't
forget to subscribe to my channel.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.370
Our timer has gone off so let's check on our
scones.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.970
Our scones are out of the oven and they look
and smell amazing. They're beautiful and brown

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.500
all over and even on the bottom. This is exactly
what we want. As you can see there are lovely

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.860
layers from rubbing in that butter. What you
want from a good scone is to get a lovely

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.820
all over color like this. Now I'm going to
show you how to make these little guys BIG &amp; BOLD.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.680
If you haven't been to Ireland, you might
not be familiar with our cuisine. One thing

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.620
we do very well is we use really good quality
ingredients to make beautiful, simple recipes.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.250
I went to the famous Ballymaloe Cookery School
in County Cork where Darina Allen taught us

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.680
that simplicity is best. She used the best
quality for her amazing recipes and that's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.289
what I try to do here on Bigger Bolder Baking.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.440
That's why we're going to finish these scones
off with butter, jam and freshly whipped cream

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.509
and we have something beautiful.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.319
Freshly baked scones are one of life's little
pleasures and when you make this recipe you'll

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.550
know what I mean.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.889
If you're going to make scones, you might
as well go all out and do it right. This is

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.460
really good. Now I'm going to have to make
myself a cup of tea.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.210
Don't forget to go over to Donal's Channel
and check out his Apple Crumble and all of

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.300
