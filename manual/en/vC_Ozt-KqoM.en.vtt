Knit Two Together, Purl, and Bind Off in the
description below.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.789
So, to make our Elf Skirt we will first create
a Slip Knot.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:23.850
Working from the edge of skirt and using the
Long Tail method, Cast On 72 Stitches with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.659
your main color.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.840
Mine is red.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.770
Row 1, We will be Knitting two together, and
then Knit one.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.799
Repeating that.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.939
Knit two together, knit one.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.130
Knit two together, knit one.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.859
And
when we are done we go from 72 down to 48

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.259
stitches.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.229
Now on Row 2 Same Pattern.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.570
Knit two together,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:14.280
Knit one and when we are done with that row,
we go down from 48 stitches to 32.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:30.720
Okay, one more time on Row 3, Knit two together,
and Knit one and now we have 21 stitches remaining.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.540
On Row 4, we will Purl
On Row 5, we will Knit.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:49.710
Now if you would like to make this little
stripe like I have, it is time to switch colors,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:57.470
and on
Row 6, simply Purl and on Row 7, simply Knit

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.780
And Switch back to your main color.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.560
Row 8, Purl
Row 9, Knit two together, then knit the entire

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.730
row for 20 stitches remaining.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:23.610
On or last two rows, we will knit the two
by two rib stitch.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.840
On Row 10, that is Knit two, purl two
And continuing on just knit two purl two,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.670
knit two purl two and it is exactly the same
on Row 11.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.030
knit two purl two, knit two purl two.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.170
All the way across.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.710
And Now we Bind Off.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.800
Taking our skirt, put the two ends together,
and just quickly Seam it Together using your

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.680
Tapestry Needle and yarn.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
