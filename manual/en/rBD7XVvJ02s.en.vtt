00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:04.945
-Megch, my Pokemans. Let me show you them.

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:06.477
-Shut up!

00:00:06.477 --> 00:00:10.471
-I can't wait to travel to the city and get my first gym badge.

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.632
It's gonna b--

00:00:19.263 --> 00:00:22.021
Hey, how the hell do I get around this thing?

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.797
-Oh, Snorlax? You gotta wake him up to get him to move.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:27.695
-Wait, can't I just walk around him?

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:28.954
-No, you freakin' idiot.

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:30.989
You gotta wake him up with a Poke Flute.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.033
-And where do I get one of those?

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.292
-[groans] You can get one from that guy over there,

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:40.289
you freakin' jackass. Man, none of you kids know anything.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.993
[dramatic music plays]

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.545
-Hey, that old guy said you have a Poke Flute.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.171
Can I buy it off you or something?

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:52.406
Hey! Can I buy a Poke Flute?!

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:57.329
-I can't talk to you unless you walk in front of me, dumbass.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.726
-[scornfully]: Fine.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.695
-Where do you think you're going?

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:04.606
Let's battle!

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.686
-No, I don't wanna battle; I just wanna buy a Poke Flute.

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:08.986
-Well, I you want a Poke Flute,

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.112
you're gonna have to battle me first.

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.156
-Yeah, okay, whatever.

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:14.784
-Let's battle!

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:24.167
-All right, Pikachu, I choose you!

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:27.254
-Pikachu!

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.171
-Ha, you're done for this time.

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:30.424
Since our last battle,

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.093
I got my Pokemon up to Level 100.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.849
Prepare to lose. Go, Metapod!

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:40.347
-The hell is that?

00:01:40.347 --> 00:01:42.376
-(electronic voice) Metrosexual hipster.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:44.605
Dresses like a flamboyantly gay man

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.834
to stand out from the rest of the male crowd,

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.853
but always ends up looking like a complete tool.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.525
-No, the Pokemon.

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:52.501
-(electronic voice) My bad.

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:54.739
Metapod: completely useless Pokemon.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.742
-Useless? My Metapod's level 100

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:00.495
and he's so bad-ass, that I stopped him from evolving

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:04.331
into a girly little butterfly. You don't even stand a chance.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.043
-We'll see about that.

00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.544
Pikachu, use Slam!

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:10.679
-[gallops]

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.133
Pika!

00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.693
-All right, Metapod, it's time to destroy him.

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:21.153
Use Harden!

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:22.825
[ching!]

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.939
-Uh... all right, Pikachu,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.931
use Thunderbolt!

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:34.760
-Pika...CHU!

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:42.377
-My Metapod's gonna get so hard in this battle.

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:43.167
-Ew.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:44.872
-[chuckles creepily]

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:47.626
-Metapod, Harden!

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.294
-Use ThunderShock!

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:49.961
-Harden!

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.295
-Use Scratch!

00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:52.798
-Let's hit him with a Harden!

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.258
-Hit him with a Slam!

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.587
-Penetrate his defenses with your Harden!

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:57.980
-Use Scratch.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.652
-Harden! Harden!

00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:01.092
How 'bout a Harden?

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:06.247
-Just one more hit and your stupid Metapod is dead.

00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:09.314
-Metapod, use Max Potion!

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.838
-[growls deeply]

00:03:14.838 --> 00:03:17.198
All right, Pikachu, come back!

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:21.743
Now, go, Charizard!

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.411
-[roars]

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.330
-All right, attack his Metapod with--

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.875
Wait, why can't I just use my Pokemon to attack you?

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.711
-Me? Uh... 'cause it's, uh...

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.045
against the rules?

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:36.758
-All right, Charizard, use Flamethrower on Metrosex--

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.566
-Okay, okay, fine! Here's your stupid Poke Flute.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.822
-Wait, this isn't a Poke Flute.

00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:48.181
-Look man, if you really wanted a Poke Flute,

00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:50.503
you could've just bought one from the guy over there.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.848
-[groans softly]

00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.772
Here.

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:59.284
Now give me a damn Poke Flute.

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:02.367
-Of course, but first you have to battle me...

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.370
and my six Metapods.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.788
-Motherfu--

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:09.125
-To see bloopers from this video and more,

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.209
like Pikachu peeing on Metapod,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.794
click the link in the description below!

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:15.713
-Let me out of the ball, motherf--ker.

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:20.004
-Quick! Use subscribe attack by clicking the yellow button!

00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:22.362
I sure do love this music.

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:25.488
Only problem is I always get this nostalgia boner

00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:28.120
and it's not exactly a good time,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.691
considering my mom's staring at me.

00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:32.552
Hi, Mom. [Captioned by SpongeSebastian]
