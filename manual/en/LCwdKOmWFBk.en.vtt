Hi, I'm Eldad Sameach - Dr. Fix It Yourself.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.260
In this video I want to show you how to replace a hard disk on your computer.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.340
Let's do that.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.880
First of all, we disconnect the computer fro all its connections.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
The computer has 2 covers, one on each side,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.780
One cover is closed to the mother board,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.540
And this is not the cover we need to remove, we need to remove the cover on the other side.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.520
Removing this cover allows us access to the hard disk drive (HDD).

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.180
We need to open 2 screws,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.380
Which hold the cover in place.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.440
We hold the cover and pull it backwards.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.660
And lift it up.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
This is the hard disk,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.040
To replace it, we need to take care of 2 things:

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Its mechanical connections,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.480
And its electrical connections.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.360
The hard disk is wired with 2 electrical wires:

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.960
This wire is the data cable,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.940
It connects at one point here,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.440
And to the mother board here,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.820
And the other wire is the power (voltage) cable.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.880
Obviously, those wires need to reconnect to the new hard disk,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.200
So we need to pay attention where every wire is connected,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.720
In order to reconnect them with the new hard disk.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.960
We disconnect the data cable,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.200
Disconnect the power (voltage) cable,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.580
We unscrew the screws that hold the hard disk to the chassis (frame).

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.400
In most cases, the hard disk is mounted with only 2 screws on one side,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.120
If we try to pull it out and we encounter resistance, probably there's another screw or two on the other side.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.120
If that's the case, we'll need to open the other cover as well.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.360
This is the hard disk,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.640
Here goes the data cable, and here goes the power (voltage) cable,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.140
These connections are irrelevant.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.920
We'll replace this old hard disk with a new one.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.120
This is the new hard disk,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.800
It looks exactly the same,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.500
Except for its technical specifications.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.840
A reminder: here goes the data cable, and here goes the power (voltage) cable,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.080
We can connect the cables prior to mounting the hard disk in its place,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.200
The data cable has an alignment, and can connect in one direction only,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640
If we try to reverse the direction, it won't fit.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.880
Data cable - connected.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.220
The power (voltage) cable also has an alignment, and can connect in one direction only.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.740
Connecting the cables while the hard disk is in our hand is easier. We just have to ensure they stay connected.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.740
We slide the hard disk back in place,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.280
Align the hard disk holes with the chassis (frame) holes,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.020
And fasten the screws. One screw,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.480
And another screw.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.480
We fasten them mildly, they don't carry load.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.800
We ensure that loosen wires and cables don't touch any rotating parts, like these 2 fans.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.920
We place the cover back in place,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.840
Mind the bulges here, that need to slide into notches on the chassis (frame),

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.040
We place the bulges on the notches, and push the cover forward.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.100
The "click" ensures locking - it's in place.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.680
And screw the 2 screws back.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.260
One screw,

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.700
Second screw.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.520
And we're done.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.860
