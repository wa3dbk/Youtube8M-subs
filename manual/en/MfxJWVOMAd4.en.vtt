00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.012
CASEY CORMIER: We just learned how to do hammer-ons
and pull-offs and then hammer-on and pull-offs

00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:09.290
combining them, and earlier, we were learning
about rhythmic playing, now we are going to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.370
do pop and slap. Now, pop and slap technique
is a really popular thing for playing funk.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:31.640
Slap, pop [PLAYS SLAP AND POP], those are
the offbeats again and the staccato feel of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:43.860
what we are doing. Okay, the important thing
here, if we can use now [PLAYS SLAP AND POP],

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.890
especially with our pops, we can do your hammer-ons
and pull-offs so we can even do more with

00:00:50.890 --> 00:01:16.289
our pop and slap lines [PLAYS BASS LINE].
We can do hammer-ons and pull-offs with the

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.310
slap too, though, it's more common to use
the hammer-ons and pull-offs when you're doing

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:48.719
the pop. You can also use with the pop, you
can do double pops [PLAYS DOUBLE POP], just

00:01:48.719 --> 00:02:12.470
so you know, using your first finger and second
finger. Maybe if you want to [PLAYS BASS LINES],

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.180
and triplet pull-offs [PLAYS TRIPLET PULL-OFFS]
if you got open strings. So, try to use, put

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.900
and combine your pop and slap style with your
hammer-ons and pull-offs to create some cool

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.580
funk sound.
