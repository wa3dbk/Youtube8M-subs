Hi, I’m Amanda Taylor, Horticulture Agent with 
the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service. 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.840
Today we’ll be teaching you how
to propagate a butterfly bush at home.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.450
Propagating at home is fun, easy, 
and a great way to save money.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.650
The cuttings we’re taking today are softwood
cuttings, named for their succulent growth,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.286
because they haven’t become woody yet. These
cuttings are the most easy to root, and they

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:40.300
can be taken from most woody 
plants between May and July.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.833
The shrub that we’re propagating today 
is a butterfly bush. 

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.660
It’s a great pollinator plant

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.400
and blooms from June to August here 
in the Piedmont of North Carolina.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.490
Materials required for propagating include:

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.760
A pair of sharp pruners

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.110
A container with drain holes

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.260
Moistened peat moss

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.680
Perlite

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.370
and plastic wrap

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.903
Nearly any container can be used to root
cuttings, just make sure that it has drain

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:11.250
holes in the bottom. 
Once you have your container, 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.060
you’ll need to mix equal parts
peat moss and perlite together.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.926
To take your cutting from the butterfly bush,
you want to find a stem on the upper portion

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:21.880
of the plant, avoiding any 
flower buds if you can.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.880
Cut a stem that’s four to six inches
long. Remove the stems from the lower

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.280
one-third to one-half of the plant, and stick
into your mix that you’ve made.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.960
Now you’ll want to water this and place
in bright, but indirect, sunlight.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.670
To prevent this cutting from drying out, 
you can cover with plastic wrap

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.869
and mist regularly.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.060
This cutting will have developed roots in
three to six weeks. To test if it has roots,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.299
gently tug on the stem. If you feel resistance, 
then you’ll know that the cutting has rooted.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.450
Propagation at home is fun and easy. If you’d
like to learn more about propagation, 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.050
