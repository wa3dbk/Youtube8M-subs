00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.739
This is the hot hatch we've been waiting
for

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:10.139
Based on our 2013 car of the year and sharing
similar mechanicals to the Golf GTI, the SEAT

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.139
Leon Cupra should be very good indeed.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.839
So what do we know about the SEATLeon Cupra?
Well the first thing is you can get a whole

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.430
range of different models.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.510
The entry-levelversion is a 3-door with a
manual gearbox and 261bhp, or you can get

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.770
a 3 and a 5 door with a manual or 6-speed
DSG with 276bhp.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.690
All versions are front wheel drive but do
come with the front limited slip differential

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.690
and adaptive dampers a standard. Now both
those things are optional on the Golf GTI.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.100
The styling is actually quite restrained for
something this fast.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.480
There's a deeper front bumper, full LED headlights,
19-inch wheels on the 280 models and around

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.910
the back, 2 oval exhausts.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.050
When the standard car looks so good that's
hardly surprising.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.050
It seems SEAT wants to ditch the boy racer
image for a higher class customer.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.540
It's certainly classy in here - you get all
the same high-quality switchgear that you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.130
would in the standard Leon but with a few
little extras to make it feel a bit more special.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
The first is this flat-bottomed steering wheel
here and you've got these great figure-hugging

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.120
sport seats you can see behind me and a few
badges sprinkled around and that's about it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.860
What you really want to know is what's this
thing like to drive - well its a lot of fun.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.910
the steering it's quite light but
its really really sharp and into a tight corner

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.410
like this and get back on the power, you feel
the limited slip differential

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.650
shuffling the power to the outside wheel with
the most grip and slingshotting you out the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.660
other side.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.020
The engine? Well it's really smooth you can
hear that it sounds great. It doesn't quite

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.830
the snap of say a four-wheel-drive Golf R
but it's very quick nonetheless.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.100
Now SEAT is dropping hints that this car could
even be

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.740
the fastest front-wheel drive hatch ever to
drive around the Nurburgring. We're going

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.480
to find out for definite at the Geneva show.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.070
The big surprise for me driing this Curpa
around is just how easy it is to live with.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.670
You got these adaptive dampers so put it in
comfort mode and it floats around just as

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.570
comfortable and quiet as any other Leon in
the range.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.750
Then put it in Cupra mode and it firms up,
everything becomes that much more sharp and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.750
you've got yourself a properly focused hot
hatch.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.930
The Leon Cupra has always been a bit of a
bit player in the hot hatch game, but believe

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.600
me that's about to change.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.980
Not only does this car look great, it drives
brilliantly too and represents excellent value.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.310
You get the front
differential and the adaptive dampers standard

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.569
and you get a lot more power than a Golf GTI
but despite that it only costs around Â£500

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.200
with more than a GTI model for model.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.620
Whichever way you look at it, that makes it
a bit of a performance bargain.
