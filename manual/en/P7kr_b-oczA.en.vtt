Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of
Expert Village. Today, I'm going to show you

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.429
how to make a really great, really simple
chicken recipe. It's baked chicken with pearl

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.379
onions, bacon, and mushrooms. I'm going to
show you a really, really quick and easy way

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:21.199
to peel garlic. This is a tremendous time
saver. This one just peeled itself, look at

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.419
that. It just fell right out. I'll just nip
the end off, and move it over here. How about

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.660
that? Actually, I'm still going to need to
crush it. What we're going to do is take our

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.550
garlic, and take the flat part of our knife,
set it on top of the garlic. Then we want

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.710
to put our hand on top of the flat part of
the blade, making use we're aware of the fact

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.309
that there's an incredibly sharp blade there.
Take both hands and give it a good smash,

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.950
and you'll see what happens is that the paper
just falls right off. It's magical. Then you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.399
just cut the end off, and there is your crushed
garlic. I want to go back to that piece that's

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.960
already peeled, and I'm going to give it a
good crushing. The reason I'm crushing this,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.220
not leaving it whole, is to expose the inside
to whatever is cooking, so I can get the juices

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.120
to go inside. Otherwise, it will seal up on
the outside. I'm also going to give those

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.790
a really rough chop in a second. You can see
how you just crush it, grab hold of the end

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.770
of your paper, and it just falls right out.
It's almost like magic. You can do multiple

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.900
pieces at once. You just want to make sure
they're about the same size; that's the only

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.130
real criteria. If they're not they won't crush,
or maybe the bigger piece will keep the smaller

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.610
piece from crushing right. Then you're just
doing the work twice, and at that point you

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.140
should have just done them separately. The
one thing I am going to do that's important

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:55.070
is to lop the ends off,
because that part doesn't cook, and it probably

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:05.890
doesn't taste very good. It's like eating
a little piece of wood, far from ideal. After

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:24.550
we get all these trimmed off, I'm going to
take my garlic, and chop it just a tiny bit.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:35.650
I'm just going to give it just one pass, nice
big chunks. I'm going to use my knife as a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:48.850
spatula, (which I do all the time) scoop it
up, and move on to our next step. Off we go.
