00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.120
Hi I'm Tricia, an organic gardener.  I grow
organically for a healthy and safe food

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.390
supply,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.849
for a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.639
for an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.720
Today we're going to be installing a
three-pound package of bees with the queen

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.159
into the new hive.

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.300
but first i need to make the syrup,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.980
get my smoker going and get suited up.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.969
When your introducing a relatively small new
colony into a new hive

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:31.189
they'll need to put all their resources
into drawing out new comb so that the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.440
queen bee can lay eggs to grow the
population of worker bees.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.020
The comb is also used for storing
pollen.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.240
To help the bees draw the comb as
quickly as possible

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.090
your going to need to provide them with some syrup at this critical time.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.320
Simply mix one part pure organic cane
sugar with one part hot water

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.090
and then shake to dissolve and let it cool
before giving it to bees.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.010
I filled up this clean spray bottle with
water

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.300
spraying the bees will calm them down

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.040
but more importantly weigh them down
so their easier to install into the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.010
hives.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.229
Another way to subdue the bees and make
them more docile

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.140
is to give them a few puffs of cold
smoke.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.369
Each time you head out to check on your
hives

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.140
you'll light up a smoker,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.499
fill it full of fuel, light a match,

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:19.770
close the lid

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460
and use this bellow to encourage burning.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.430
Well it's time to get suited up

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.380
i'm gonna put on a full suit

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.870
with a veil and gloves.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.300
The elastic and zippers make the suit both
easy to get on and off as well as

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.090
secure.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.380
Bees generally sting dark colors

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.460
so it's important to wear white as much
as possible.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.490
Bees are particularly attracted to hair
or anything that loosely resembles a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.250
bear.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.299
So most people where a veil at a
minimum.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.550
These gloves provide extra protection and
ventilation for warm days.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.730
Always have your bee brush and you're hive tool.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.730
I've already set up my hive stand, the solid
bottom board, the feeder and the first

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.939
brood box.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.270
I'm just gonna insert my sugar syrup
now.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.350
Remove the three innermost frames to
create a space to pour in the new bees.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.310
Using a clean bottled water mist the
bees lightly

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.369
to prepare them for being transferred
into their hives.

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.039
Generally package bees will come with a
can of syrup that the bees have been

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.579
feeding from.

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.449
Gently lift it out of the box and set it
aside.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.680
Pull out your queen cage,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.689
brush off any bees that are on the cage
so that you can see the queen,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.469
make sure that she is alive and set her aside.
Now your going to pour your bees into the

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.549
hive

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.799
you may need to give the box a hearty
shake

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.969
to get the bees to fall into the hive.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.090
There'll be some bees left in the box, set
it down on the ground facing the hive

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.109
entrance.

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.509
The remaining bees should find their way into the hive.

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.559
After a few minutes the bees should be on
the foundation and out of the bottom of

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:51.989
this hive.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.749
Once this is the case gently place each
frame back into the hive.

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.809
We're gonna remove the tack at the end
of the queen cage

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.179
slide a finger over the end and don't
let the queen escape.

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.269
Insert the queen candy halfway into the
hole.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.089
The screen of the queen cage should face
down into the hive

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.040
The bees will eat away at the sugar candy
for two to three days to release the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.999
queen.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.659
Bend this piece of metal to hook it over
the top of a frame.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.869
Place your inner cover on your hive and
then your outer cover.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.539
You'll leave the bees alone for eight days.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:28.649
The worst beginner mistake is opening
the hive too often and too early.

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:32.799
This can result in a slowing down the
bees progress and worse,

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.869
accidentally rolling or killing your
queen.

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:39.189
On day eight you can take the covers off
the hive,

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.699
gently lift that outermost frame out of
the hive

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.879
and then slide the center framed towards
the edge.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.729
This will allow you to lift out the
center frames without crushing any bees

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.729
especially your queen.

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.059
When you hold a central frame up to the
sun you should see eggs.

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.980
They're little white dots a smidge smaller
than a grain of rice.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.059
When you see this you know your queen
is laying and your off to a good start.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.910
Gently set the central frames back
inside the hive,

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.969
slide the frames inwards and place the
eighth empty frame back in on the edge.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.459
Once the bees have filled up most of the
frames in the first brood box add the second one.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.559
 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:22.419
After both of the brood chambers are nearly
full of comb you'll be ready for your

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.629
queen excluder and honey supers
one-by-one.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.589
Now your a honey bee keeper,

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:29.589
grow organic for life.
