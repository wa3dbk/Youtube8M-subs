00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.120
Before I discovered the Cadets...

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.280
...before I found out it existed...

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.280
...I've always wanted to join the Job.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.520
I've always wanted to become a police officer...

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.760
...when I was older.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.760
So it's helped me...benefitted me massively...

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
...being a cadet.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
The skills I've learned and been taught have obviously..

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.240
...helped me get in as a Special Constable and now a full-time police officer.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm out on a response team most of the time...

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480
...so I'm out in the back of a car...

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
...answering 999 calls.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.480
If I'm not doing that, I'm with my Safer Neighbourhoods Team...

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.480
...which generally means I'll be out walking the streets on foot.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.560
Quite recently we took part in a march, 
 myself and a few of the cadets...

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.360
...in front of some quite big name celebrities...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440
...up in London...

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
...which could be quite daunting, it certainly would have been..

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.920
..when I was younger, at school. I was very shy at school.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
I never thought I'd ever be doing anything like that.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
Well I've been involved with the Police Cadets...

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880
...for about five years and I can say I personally...

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
...what I like and find very attractive is seeing how...

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280
...young people have achieved and grown over the years.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
I know of stories of people who have been excluded from school...

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.480
...and, you know, you just see them turn their lives around.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
They join the police service and they come back and pass that on.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880
And then, may perhaps become involved as a volunteer or...

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
...staff members and help other young cadets coming into the units.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
