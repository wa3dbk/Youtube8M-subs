What's going on Internet? It is your boy Eric
Bandholz back again with another awesome episode

00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.400
from Beardbrand. I hope all is going well
on the other side of the Internet. There's

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.600
been some recent news within the bearding
community that I wanted to spread with you,

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:00.800
and it's a little bit different than what
I normally talk about. Paul Roof the founder

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.000
of Holy City Beard and Moustache Society was
recently let go from his teaching job at Charleston

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.200
Southern. He is a professor, or he was a professor
at Charleston Southern University down in

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.400
Charleston. And the reason behind his firing
was his photo or his image of himself during

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:01.600
a beard competition was put on a beer can.
Now this was not something that he's collecting

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:01.800
royalties on. This is not an image that he
owns. This image is owned by a photographer

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.000
and it was taken back in 2006 I believe. And
the company, Holy City Brewing Company, is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.200
actually using the proceeds to raise money
for women in cancer. So there's a lot of good

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.400
going on.
In addition to that Paul Roof is a fantastic

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:02.600
man. He's of course a beard ambassador. He
has done great things for the breading community.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.800
He has raised thousands of dollars for charity
over time. He has influenced probably hundreds

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.000
if not thousands of students over the years
and has been a pillar of positive aspects

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.200
for the Charleston community. Us beards men,
we can't sit by and let an organization like

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.400
Charleston Southern University do this to
their employees. To just with no disregard

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
let a man go from his career...it's 
just messed up. It's really messed up. There's
a lot going on right now in support Paul Roof.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
I encourage you guys to read up more about
the story, get more background information,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
become more educated. I've got tons of links
below in the comments. I'd check them out.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.200
There's going to be a links for local media,
what's going on. There's going to be links

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.400
for how to support Paul by donating to charity.
Hopefully you can share this video with your

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.600
friends and colleagues and other beards men
out there and help raise awareness for the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.800
cause. And let's do something different. Let's
support a man out there who needs our support

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.000
and change some lives. As always thanks for
watching, thanks for subscribing. Cheers,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.200
and beard on.
