00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:07.299
So this is basically my map, from idea to
actual specific style lines. And now the final

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.500
thing that I'm going to do before I turn it
in into a pattern, and turn it in into an

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.460
actual dress, is I'm going to make a little
details, little notes so I know right here

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.869
that this is a gather, so I'm going to and
just write gather. And then maybe, maybe these

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.430
are top stitch done, and I want it, because
this is red polka dots, that I might want

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:38.700
this like top stitch in red. So I'm going
to put top stitch in red and you know, maybe,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.160
maybe these seams are top stitch as well,
so I'm going to make those notes. And then

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.670
the pockets, right, that's getting confusing
over there, so I'll write over here, I'm going

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:01.699
to say they're wrap around the sides and I'm
also going to say that this has to be interfaced,

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.780
with interfacing which kind of structures
the fabric, so we get more of the structure,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.190
you know, just adds structure to your thin
silk because we want this to be you know,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.950
supple, but the pockets need a little more
structure, cause they're more tailored. And

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.260
then over-all what I really think is that
this should be cut on the bias. And cutting

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.940
on the bias means that you know, we have a
piece of silk here, here's your silk, and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.910
you want to cut the dress out here. It will
hang straight but actually it?s going to have

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.230
some, the fabrics going to have some stretch,
its going to hang better if we go ahead and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.450
place the pattern this way. This is kind of
how all the dresses were built like the 40's,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
where they drape really beautifully, they
all hang down and you don't need a zipper

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.990
because it will be stretchy because the fabric
is going to be wove in this way and its going

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.330
to stretch rather than being you know, up
and down. We want to go for this, worst.worst.you

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.080
know that intersection. So I'm going to put
a note says cut on the bias, just so I remember,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.170
that that's how I want to constructed. And
there we go. Now you're ready to take it to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.920
the worker and turn it into a pattern.
