Hi my name is Karl James, owner of Creolesoul
Catering in Round Rock, Texas and on behalf

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:12.450
of Expert Village I'm here to show you some
creole shrimp sausage recipe. Okay now we

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.170
are going to our peppers and we are in the
two different types of peppers. In this recipe

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.490
we are going to use our Serrano's and we are
going to slice them in half like that. This

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:36.500
is where our heat is going to come from. So
basically in quarters and we are using seeds

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:50.730
and everything with these. Turn those and
make little slices. Once again everything

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.900
we are doing here we are basically going to
be adding to our mixture and then sent through

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:17.049
our grinder. Do a little rough chop on them
in our Serrano's. (cutting Serrano peppers)

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:32.200
Move the Serrano's in here and then the next
pepper we are going to use is going to be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:45.200
a red chili, they are dry red chilies and
dry. Cut them with a knife. The thing about

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.079
them is that they are dry so you can acutely
just take them and just break them apart.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:02:16.940
Throw the steams away.
This is going to be our layers of heat.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:26.220
You know you take it a judge how hot you want
this to be. The reason I'm cutting as much

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.830
peppers as I am, really doesn't necessarily
mean that I'm going to use all of it in this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.920
recipe. Sometimes what I would do and since
I'm cutting and chopping I would get it prepare

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.420
and I take some in a bag and put it away for
later. Anyway here are our peppers.
