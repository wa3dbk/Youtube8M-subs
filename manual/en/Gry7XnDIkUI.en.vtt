Hi I'm Pete from Jamie's Food Team and today I'm going to 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.530
show you how to prep squid for salt and pepper squid in Jamie's new

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.610
Comfort Food book

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.380
Okay, the squid at the top has got a couple little wings here, which are fine to eat

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.060
Great in things like soups and stews

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.980
Further down is the squids head. It's got its eyes.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.540
and it's got its tentacles here. Can you see?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.800
his little tentacles and he's got two long ones

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.840
Right in the middle, there's a beak, a little squid beak. You cut that off because it's actually a bit tough to eat.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.320
First thing we're gonna do , is grip the squid head and just pull it.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.340
With a sharp knife I'm going to cut under the eyes

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.660
So there's the tentacles

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.020
Push the beak out the middle... Tentacles

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.050
Where as you go, in here, there's a whole load of stuff

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.320
Poke your fingers up inside and here's comes the quill 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.180
It looks like it's made of plastic.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.500
You can see why it's called a quill, because it looks like one of those old fashioned pens people used to write with.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.800
I'm going to take the back of the knife squeeze all the other stuff out.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.260
Pinch the wings like that and just pull them away

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.680
from the body and it takes some of the skin with it, you see?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.940
There we go

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.520
Next step is to open it out

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.080
Push it up inside, it comes out

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.920
and this is the inside of the squid head

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.550
A small eating knife and this is just sharp enough to do the job I need it to do.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.440
I just drag it across the surface

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960
You see it's not cut, it's just scoured. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.760
 and that's all you want to do

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.660
 Turn the squid around

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.420
and do the same in the other direction

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.700
So we get the nice cross effect

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.720
and there... is your squid body all scoured and ready to go
