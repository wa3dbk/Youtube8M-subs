Hi, I'm Alois Rosario from PingSkills. Xavi
from Spain has asked us a question about Patrick

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.500
Franziska's reverse pendulum serve into a
shoe. It looks something like this.

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:23.640
So Xavi wanted to know how Patrick gets that
ball to curve so much on the table. Well one

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.210
of the secrets is to not have too much forward
momentum. If you hit the ball fast even if

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.570
the ball is spinning really fast it's still
not going to turn quickly. So the first secret

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.230
is to hit the ball quite slowly with forward
momentum. The second really important part

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.579
is to brush the ball on contact. It needs
to be a really nice fine brushing contact

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.579
to generate a lot of spin. So you do need
a lot of spin and you need less forward momentum

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.399
and then the ball is going to really start
to curve around.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.410
The other thing that Patrick does is he puts
a little bit of backspin and sidespin on the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.750
ball. By putting a little bit more backspin
the ball is going to stop quicker, it's

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.800
not going to go off the end of the table,
and it's going to turn more quickly and that's

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.530
how he gets it to go towards his shoe.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.940
OK Alois that was a great explanation. One
thing I was a little unclear about is you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.340
said you don't want a lot of forward momentum
but you still need a lot of spin so do you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.900
still need to swing your bat fast but not
get forward momentum? How do you balance those two?

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.420
It's a really difficult thing and that's what
makes serving so difficult. What you are trying

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.120
to do is you're going to get your bat moving
really fast, as fast as you can but by getting

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.120
a really fine contact the ball doesn't go
so fast forward. So if I get a really flat

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.970
contact then the ball is going to go bang
and go way too fast with my bat moving at

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.340
this speed. With my bat moving at the same
speed but getting a fine contact then the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.800
ball isn't going to go as far.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.800
Great tip!
