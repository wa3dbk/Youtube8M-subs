Rushang: Hi. This is Rushang with CompanionLink Software.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In this video, we'll show you how to synchronize Outlook 2010 with your BlackBerry device.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, keep in mind, Outlook 2010 comes in two editions: 32-bit and 64-bit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Many people using the 64-bit edition of Outlook 2010 have said that their synchronization doesn't work.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You can visit BlackBerry support forums to get RIM's official statement on their support for Outlook 2010 64-bit.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the meantime, CompanionLink supports both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Outlook 2010.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, what do you need in order to synchronize your BlackBerry to Outlook 2010?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
First, you'll need BlackBerry Desktop Manager installed on your PC.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can get the latest version from BlackBerry.com.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Second, you'll need CompanionLink installed on your PC.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can download a free 14-day trial from CompanionLink.com/downloads.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's completely free and fully functional for 14 days.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We also offer free support.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Once installed, configure CompanionLink to use Outlook as your PC software and BlackBerry as your phone.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
You can choose any combination of Outlook Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, or Notes to synchronize to your BlackBerry.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You can also choose to sync one-way or two-way between Outlook and BlackBerry.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Data will go into the built-in Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, and Notes apps on the BlackBerry device.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
CompanionLink also supports categories.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So, if you've categorized your Outlook contacts, those will remain intact on the BlackBerry device in the address book.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Once you're done with the configuration, click on the Synchronize button within CompanionLink. This will begin your synchronization.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
