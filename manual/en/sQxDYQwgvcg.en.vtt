00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.650
Technological breakthroughs have brought
a revolution in the way we live

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.760
the way we think...

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.240
Nowadays communication is solo
accessible

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.550
and instant

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.530
that almost every barrier has been
broken.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.210
E-mails, Smart phones, social media

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.910
were all created to enable us to be
connected to the world

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.210
and a click away from each other.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.770
Technology amazes me and makes me wonder

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.980
what else can we do?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.530
Imagine if you had a cool machine at home
and all you have to do is plug it in and Boom,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.230
you are Napoleaon or... who knows? Julius
Caesar.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.510
Imagine a world where in a few minutes
you could connect with the past

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.400
and relieve history?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.730
ANIMUS makes this world possible...

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.160
Created by Abstergo's incredible
research into genetic memory,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.030
ANIMUS gives you the chance to game within the past.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.320
Let me show you what animus can do...

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.260
You can relive the American Revolution

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.189
and discover lively cities and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.009
wild unexplored lands.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.240
Choose your favorite hero

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.760
and customize him as you progress.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.830
ANIMUS offers multiple game modes:

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.020
such as domination and Wolfpack

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.030
domination is a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.420
4 versus 4 4 team base mode, where each
team needs to attack

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.799
and defend as many territories as possible
to score points.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.990
wolfpack is a 2 to 4 players
versus AI mode...

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.659
In this mode every second counts as you
need to hunt AI targets...

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.239
ANIMUS allows you to connect,

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.189
collaborate and challenge your friends.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.829
With a true competitive ranking system,
your skills are evaluated and ranked

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.469
against other player's performance.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.749
ANIMUS rewards dedicated players in
various ways.

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.069
