00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.040
Here are the top 10 most secret highest security
places on earth.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.190
Some are now open to the public, but were
once top secret

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.490
1.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.640
Secret Vaults of The Mormon Church - Known
as Granite Mountain, the world’s largest

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.410
collection of genealogical records is housed
in a secure vault located in the mountains

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.270
near Salt Lake City.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.200
The LDS church built Granite Mountain in 1965
to preserve and protect important church records,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.650
including its vast collection of some 3.5
billion images of family history on microfilms.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.300
2.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.600
Tumen River North Korea, China, Russia Border
- Within 1 mile, you can go from North Korea,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.730
to China and end up in Russia.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.900
This of course, makes this a good place for
those who want to defect.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.700
It is well guarded by North Korean soldiers
for this very reason.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.210
3.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.740
Korean Demilitarized Zone - The Demilitarized
Zone or DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula almost

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.030
in half, crossing the 38th parallel on an
angle.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.290
It was created as part of the Korean Armistice
Agreement in 1953 and is one of the most closely

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.250
guarded border regions by 2 opposing nations
anywhere in the world.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.550
By the way, we are technically still at war
with North Korea.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.550
4.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.060
The Greenbrier Underground Bunker - Carved
deep into the mountainside beneath one wing

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.590
at the Greenbriar hotel is an emergency Cold
War fallout shelter.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.631
This was once a top secret U.S. government
relocation facility for Congress, and the

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:54.740
president in the case of a nuclear attack.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.090
Even though this was once a top secret and
highly secure area, the Bunker is now open

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.340
to the public for tours.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.469
5.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.471
Cheyenne Mountain Complex - Built under 2,000
feet of granite this bunker is built to deflect

00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:10.129
a 30 megaton nuclear explosion.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.439
It has multiple sets of 25-ton blast doors
and another for the civil engineering department.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.629
The doors were made so that they can always
be opened if needed.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.689
The facility contains a network of blast valves
with filters to capture air-borne chemical,

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.060
biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.280
6.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.889
HavenCo - HavenCo is a data hosting services
company founded in 2000 to operate from Sealand,

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.870
a self-declared sovereign nation that occupies
a former World War II defensive facility at

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.019
sea located six miles from the coast of Suffolk,
England.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.810
It was built to house data completely immune
to government prying eyes.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.310
It closed in 2008 and no one knows why, but
was revived in 2013.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.829
However at the press time of this video, their
site was offline.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.829
7.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.349
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York - This
is where approximately 25% of the world’s

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.480
gold is stored.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.769
It is extremely well guarded and the actual
vault is eighty feet below street level and

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.889
fifty feet below sea level.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.629
The perimeter of the building is guarded by
well-trained sharp-shooters.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:23.999
8.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:31.250
Babylon, Iraq - Following excavations in the
early 20th century, European archaeologists

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.199
claimed they found features such as the remains
of the famous Ishtar Gate, but why are portions

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.699
of this site not viewable from Google Maps.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:46.310
What are they hiding there and why is it so
difficult to even find on Google maps?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.310
9.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.400
Fort Knox United States Bullion Depository
- Fort Knox not only stores thousands of tons

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.029
of gold, but it supposedly contains important
historical documents such as the Declaration

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.129
of Independence and the Magna Carte.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.589
The security is extreme and the facility is
also protected by a 22-ton blast door.

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:15.510
Interestingly though, there are conspiracy
theories persisting that there may be no actual

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.080
gold in Fort Knox as Congress itself is not
allowed to audit or open the vaults.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080
10.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.509
Area 51 - This may be the most secret location
and military installation on earth and has

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.120
been for more than 60 years.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.520
Ever since a supposed alien spaceship crash
at the site in 1947, Area 51 has been rumored

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.860
to hold all kinds of secrets from the well
known Skunkworks aircraft development program

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.760
to the studio where the moon landing was said
to have been faked.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.150
The entrance looks remote an almost abandoned,
but just get close to the front gate and see

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.420
how fast security is on top of you.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.840
We recommend you stay clear of Area 51.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.139
