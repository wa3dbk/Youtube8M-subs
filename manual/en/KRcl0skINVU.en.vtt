00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.680
Hello, my name is Loren Green, I'm an elementary
music teacher near Austin, Texas. I've been

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.230
playing the clarinet for fifteen years, and
teach private clarinet lessons as well, and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.140
today I'm going to tell you how to begin to
play the clarinet. So first we're going to

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.120
start with putting it together. You can start
with your bell. That's the very bottom, and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.940
the next piece that you take, is this large
piece. This is for your right hand. This cork

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.510
should be well lubricated with cork grease.
You twist it in, and then you have those two

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.989
together. The next piece you put on is the
top joint. Again, you need to keep that cork

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.729
lubricated or it won't go in very well. So
now you have that much. This is your barrel.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:54.559
Your barrel is what connects your joints to
your mouthpiece, and that goes on the top.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.640
Then you have your mouthpiece. A good thing
I like to do when I'm putting my clarinet

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.449
together, is have my reed already soaking
in my mouth, so that by the time I get everything

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:14.490
together, it's almost ready to be played on.
So you put your reed right here on the mouthpiece,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.960
making sure that it is perfectly in line with
where the hole is. Then you put your ligature

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.469
on, and tighten it firmly. The first step
to actually playing, we're not even going

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.423
to push any keys down. So the embouchure is
the position of your mouth. You want to make

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:45.310
sure that your chin is flat, that your throat
is open, that your tongue is high, and that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.369
your mouth is completely sealed around the
mouthpiece. If you have air leaking out the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.020
sides, it'll make a sound, and your air won't
be going through your clarinet, which means

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.060
you won't be making a sound. It's going to
take some getting used to to make that reed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.359
vibrate. You have to start with a pretty soft
reed if you're a beginner, a two and a half

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:13.790
to a three, and if it's still not vibrating,
just keep working at it, and blow very hard

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.300
with your abdomen until you get the air to
come out. The air should be warm, and it should

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.050
be moist. If you can put your hand in front
of your mouth, and make hot air come out,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.990
that is the proper air. If it's cold, you
need to open your throat more. Like other

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:38.110
woodwind instruments, your left hand goes
on top. You start by putting your left thumb

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.130
on this back key, leave this one alone for
now, and then your right pointer finger goes

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.140
on the top key right there. You just walk
it down, covering those holes. Now if these

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.580
holes aren't sealed, you're not going to make
a sound. You can continue down, but the first

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.010
thing I would do, this is your proper hand
position, and you can find fingering charts

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.730
on line, but first, I would just try to, again,
play without any keys covered, working on

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.500
that, and then adding one finger at a time
as you go down. So that's how to begin to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.320
play the clarinet.
