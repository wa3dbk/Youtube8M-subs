00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.600
Like, at train stations now, for a while, they've had this white strip at the edge of every platform

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.200
with blue text on it that reads "Night Safe Area".

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.500
Now, when I think about areas... that are safe to be in at night...

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.480
...train station, as a whole...

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.000
...doesn't place very highly on the list.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.500
But the edge of the platform? It seems like a strange way to accelerate natural selection to me.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.500
Who would have thought that Cityrail is nothing more than the inner workings of a top secret genocidal regime! 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.000
And why is it that the age of sexual consent is sixteen, while the age at which you can watch pornography is eighteen?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.400
Does that not sound fuckin' backwards? I mean, sex is the only act I can think of where you're allowed to do it...

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.000
...two whole years before you're allowed to watch someone else do it!

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.400
A sixteen-year-old can guy can legally, with a sixteen-year-old girl's consent,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.360
have her take her clothes off, stroke his cock, suck his cock,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.000
have her pussy licked and fingered, her ass licked, fingered and fisted, her breasts groped, her toes sucked;

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.440
he can fuck her missionary, doggy style, cowgirl, cowgirl reverse, spooning, sixty-nine, against the wall, down the hall—

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.000
—and he can ejaculate into her mouth at the end of all that—

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.500
—but that same sixteen-year-old boy can't watch a girl taking her clothes off on the internet 'cause it might be a little confronting for him!

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.600
And then you've got Julia Gillard, who doesn't wanna legalise gay marriage

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.000
because she likes the traditional view of marriage: that it's between a man and a woman, and that's the way things should stay.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.500
This is the first female Prime Minister we've had, the first unmarried Prime Minister we've had, and one of only two openly atheist Prime Ministers we've had.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.250
Julia Gillard SUCKS BALLS at maintaining tradition!

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.000
She comes into Parliament House, pisses all over tradition,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.000
then goes running for a mop when it comes to the 'evil fag menace!'

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.700
Not that her opposition is any better. I mean, I saw a truck once in Sydney labelled 'Abbott Removalists'.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.600
I'm like "Fuck, why aren't you in Canberra where your skills are needed?"

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.650
(FYI: 'Tony Abbott' is the name of our Federal Opposition Leader, while Canberra is where Parliament House is).

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.120
But the whole gay marriage thing makes no sense when you think about it.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.600
'Cause gay adoption is legal, gay sex is legal, even gay porn is legal,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.400
but for some reason, gay marriage is illegal.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.200
Technically, it's more legal for a gay couple to adopt a five-year-old,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.000
and raise that five-year-old on the money they make selling their amateur sadomasochistic porn,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.600
which they film in their basement while that kid sleeps,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.000
than it is for them to get married and raise that kid with the financial benefits they'd get from being married, like the tax breaks and whatever not.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.000
That's what the government likes to call 'family values'.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.000
Really putting the needs of the kid first there, I can see.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.000
The whole language surrounding sex just doesn't make any sense.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.880
Like, my mum came into my room once and said that her boyfriend had invited her over for what she referred to as a 'sleepover'.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.040
I'm like "Yeah, a 'sleepover'. I hate to break it to ya mum, but nappin' and fuckin' aren't the same thing."

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.000
'Sleeping together'—
sex doesn't involve sleep!

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.000
You can have sex before sleep, you can have sex after sleep, but you can't have sex while you're sleeping!

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.000
You can fuck someone who's having a sleep, but that's—

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There are certain people who know that from first-hand experience!

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.000
—but that's not sleeping together; that's fucking someone who's sleeping!

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.700
If you're both sleeping while fucking, that spells sexual health problems to me. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.200
My favourite one, though, would have to be 'screw'.  I've never understood this.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.400
'Cause 'nail' I can understand—that's straight in and out—but 'screw'? 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.000
It just seems a bit impractical to get down there...

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.500
...stick it in...

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.500
...and then rotate around...

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.400
then rotating the other way when you hit the bottom.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.400
Half of it isn't even screwing; half of it's un-screwing!

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.500
Makes you pretty tired as well. Maybe then you'd truly be sleeping together.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.000
I've been Liam McCann. Thank you. Good night!
