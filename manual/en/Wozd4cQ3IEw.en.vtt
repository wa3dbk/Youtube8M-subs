“Aluminum in Vaccines vs. Food”

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.190
Speaking of toxic metallic elements,
there continues to be growing concern

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.260
about aluminum exposure and the
development of neurodegenerative diseases,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.449
such as Alzheimer’s.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.670
But how are we exposed to aluminum?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.289
This is how much we get cooking
acidic foods like tomato sauce

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.730
in an aluminum pot for an hour.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.480
Aluminum is also added
to childhood vaccines

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.530
as an immune irritant to improve efficacy.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.960
But it’s come under fire
from some parenting groups.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.860
This is how much you get
smoking a pack of cigarettes,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.680
and this is how much you get if you use
aluminum-containing antiperspirants.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:00.649
But researchers just found a food item
that blows these other sources away.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.510
What do you think it is?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.390
Is it Brussels sprouts?

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.870
Many of you wish it were Brussels sprouts!

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.140
Cheese, chicken, eggs, fish, or shellfish?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.850
The highest natural levels
of aluminum are found in shellfish,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.140
but the highest level
overall is in cheese.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.720
Why?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.450
Just like the poultry industry
adds arsenic to chicken,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.510
the dairy industry adds
aluminum to cheese,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.140
the #1 source of aluminum in the diet.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.530
Why would they do that?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.340
The aluminum salts produce a “smooth,
uniform film around each fat droplet”

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.250
to prevent something
called fat “bleeding,”

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.140
and to give the cheese a softer texture,
and “desirable slicing properties.”

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.509
So if you’re a parent worrying
about the aluminum in vaccines,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.870
every grilled cheese sandwich you give
to your kids is like injecting them

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.319
with a dozen aluminum-containing vaccines.
