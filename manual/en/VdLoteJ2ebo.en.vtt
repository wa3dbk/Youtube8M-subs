Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.280
On today's episode let's talk about deleting
photos from iPhoto.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.570
So I very often get questions about deleting
photos from iPhoto.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.270
Sometimes it can be tricky if you don't understand
the difference between events and albums.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.520
Here in iPhoto in your Library you have different
selections starting with Events.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.310
Events basically have individual photos in
them.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.970
Every photo is in at least every event and
exactly one event and no more.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.649
Now people like to create albums.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.929
Albums are listed down here where you can
create albums and put photos in them.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.320
You can put photos in many different albums
or not have a photo in any albums at all.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.219
So the difference between Events and Albums
is very important when you are trying to do

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.469
something like delete photos.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.760
An album really doesn't have any photos in
it at all.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.179
Albums are just basically lists of links like
bookmarks in a browser or a playlist in iTunes.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.969
It just links to different photos that may
be found in different Events.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.570
For instance I can create an album called
Scenery and link to different photos that

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.500
have something to do with scenery or whatever
I want.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.880
These can be in all sorts of different events.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.320
In Events basically an event is like a roll
of film in an old fashioned metaphor.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.220
You have different photos grouped together
usually from the time you took them.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.890
Every photo is exactly one event and it's
only one event.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.740
Now if you are looking at Events and you want
to delete a photo it is very easy.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.939
You can go into an event, you can select a
photo like this one and you can delete it

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.070
by going to Photos and Move to Trash or Command
and Delete is the shortcut.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.109
When you do so, it will make sure that it
is what you want to do and it sticks it here

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.109
in Trash.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.909
In trash you can see that it is there and
I can actually go into Trash and treat it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.990
like a normal photo like in an album but it
is in the trash album rather than anywhere

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.380
else and I can put it back, basically undo
it.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.899
So I go back to the Event and it's there.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.240
So deleting photos from Events is very simple
and straight forward.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.470
Now if you go into an album like Scenery or
Animals here I've got the same photo and if

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.760
I select to delete it you can see that the
Command D shortcut, this menu choice here,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.470
is now Remove from Album, no long put in the
trash.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.180
So what will happen it will even warn me and
say do you want to remove the selected photo

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.180
from the album?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.049
So I will say remove the photo and it is no
longer in the album.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.549
If I go back to the Event where I know the
photo is you can see the photo is still there

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.520
in Event it is just no longer in this album.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.190
It also doesn't effect other albums.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.439
So for instance let's undo that so we put
it back there.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.050
Let's go back to the Event and I can take
that same photo under Scenery.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.909
Now I look at Scenery and I see that picture
there and I see that same picture there under

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:55.909
Animals.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.189
I select it and Command Delete, Remove Photo,
you can see it is still under Scenery there

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.420
and of course it is still under its Event.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.439
The photo really isn't deleted at all I have
simply removed it from that one album.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.930
So let's undo that and you can see it is back
in those two albums.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.270
So how do you delete photos completely if
you are just looking at them in an album.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.879
Well the easy answer is that you never delete
photos from an album.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.140
You remove them from an album and it will
be gone from that album.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.780
If you really want to delete them, if you
want to get rid of them forever, you go into

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.159
Event and you delete it from the event.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.330
However sometimes people will go and fill
up an album with photos they want to delete.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.110
So say I want to delete all of the photos
here under Scenery.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.810
Just want to get rid of them.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.409
I could go and select one, Control click on
it and say Show Event.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.870
Now it goes into the event that has the photo,
select the photo and then delete it.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.840
But that could be a lot of work if I have
a ton of photos that I want to delete.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.359
So there is one other trick.

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.319
You can Select All, Command A to select all
in this album, and you can go to Events to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.319
create an event.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.719
What will happen here is basically it will
move all the photos from the original event

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.170
into a new event.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.260
It warns you about it here.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.069
A photo can only appear in one event at a
time.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.969
It will remove it from all the events that
it is in, it can be spread out through the

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.960
entire Library, put them in one single event.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.780
Once they are in that one single event you
can go to that single event and delete them

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.910
from that event, thus deleting them completely
from your Library.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.320
Now another way to do that without creating
an album is say you want to go to Events or

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.010
Photos which is basically a list of Events
as well it is just that it lists them in a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.030
way that you can see photos across multiple
events.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.800
So say I want select a lot of different photos
to delete.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.320
I could select them here, and select another
one holding the command key down so I'm selecting

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.270
multiples across multiple albums and then
hit Command Delete to put them in the Trash.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.540
But say I want to review them all first.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.150
What I could do instead is to flag them.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.130
So Flagging basically creates a special album
here and its very easy to flag.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.780
You click the little flag there at the top.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.740
There is a real easy way to do it inside of
here.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.470
You can hit Command period or this menu item.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.140
So I can go through using the arrow keys and
flag different photos I want to delete.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.310
Now if I go to my flagged photos I can see
that they are all listed here.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.400
It is the same deal here as if this was an
album.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.700
I can't delete them from here.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.100
If I hit delete it simply unflags this.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.500
So what I can do instead is I can select all
of these and do the same thing here where

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.560
I create an Event.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.030
I can actually not even have to select them
all, I can Create Event from Flagged Photos.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.330
So basically remove them all from their current
Event, create a new Event and from there I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.910
can delete the Event thus deleting all the
photos.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.340
So you can use flagging, then create new event,
then delete the event to delete photos kind

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.300
of with a review process of your own in the
middle.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:59.270
Of course, if you do decide to delete photos
notice that you, let's go there into the Event,

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.840
and you can see there is the new photos that
I have created, this untitled Event here,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:11.080
and I can Command Delete it and you can see
that they appear under Trash.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.440
So I still have the ability to Undo what I
have done here at the last minute I can put

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.400
them back, right there, and I can select multiple
ones and Put Back right here.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.310
So I have a chance to undo it or I can Control
click on Trash to empty trash.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.120
You can also go to iPhoto and Empty iPhoto
Trash and there is the shortcut for it.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.310
Another thing you may want to do is to actually
archive photos that you are deleting.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.620
Maybe you just want to delete them from your
iPhoto Library and you want to archive them

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620
somewhere.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.430
Like burn them to a DVD or stick them on an
old external drive.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.300
You can basically go into your flagged photos
there just before you go to delete them or

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.870
go to the album just before you delete them
and drag and drop them into a folder.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.120
You can see now that these photos are stored
there, copies of them are stored there, so

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.290
now I can delete them knowing that I have
copies there as backup.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.940
So I hope you found this look at deleting
photos from iPhoto useful.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:29.830
Until next time this is Gary with MacMost
Now.
