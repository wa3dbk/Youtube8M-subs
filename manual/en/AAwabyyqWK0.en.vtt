00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.540
As I said in this video, we CAN fold a single
piece of paper in half more than 8 times.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.620
Current record is 12 folds.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.469
But why stop there?! Hypothetically speaking,
if the average paper thickness is 1/10 of

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.469
a mm, how many half folds we have to make
so that the final paper is one km tall?

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.429
How many folds to reach the space a hundred
km above us?

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.610
How many until we reach the moon?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.870
The sun?

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.400
And now the final one... how many folds we
would have to make so that the final piece

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.400
of paper is 93 BILLION light years or the
diameter of the observable universe?

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.030
wait for it...

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.030
Yeah! I was surprised too. But we're not talking
about linear growth here... 1,2,3,4,5... we're

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.540
talking about exponential growth...

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.630
Another example is even better

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.370
As the story goes, a thousand years ago a
mathematician named Sessa invented the game

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.860
of chess. After showing the game to the king,
he was so pleased that he gave the inventor

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.760
the right to name his price.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.910
Sessa, being very cunning asked the king this:
that for the first square of the chess board,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.430
he would receive one grain of wheat, two for
the second one, four on the third one, and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.580
so forth, doubling the amount each time...

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.950
Surprised by the Sessas modesty, king said
yes.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.950
Soon after, he realized his mistake! For the
first 10 squares he received 1,023 grains

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.970
For the second 10, 1,048,575

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.520
on the 32nd square, he received 2,147,483,648

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.530
and for the last one, 9,223,372,036,854,775,808

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.930
Total number of grains: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.930
That number is 
so huge that I can even... imagine it. If
each grain weighs 30mg, then all of them would

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.070
weigh 500 BILLION tons... if average size
of each grain is 4 mm, then putting them side

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.870
by side would take us to the Alpha Centaury...
and back! That's more then 8 light years!

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Exponential growth is everywhere around us,
yet it's so hard for us to understand it.
