00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.070
Hey, my peeps.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.990
So this morning, we
are going to just do

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.600
a very simple
single French braid.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.000
I almost said single strand.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.600
But we've had lots
of people ask just

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.630
for a basic one French braid
down the center of the head.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.920
So we are going to start
by just taking a section.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.810
And I start from ear to ear.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.680
You can start up
higher if you want,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.830
but I like the way it looks
just right around the ears.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.335
And go ahead and comb
it so it's in place.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:40.765
You're going to divide
it into three sections.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340
So you have a section on the
left, section in the middle,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.990
and section on the right.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.180
Now you're going to
take the left piece

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.870
and cross it over
that middle piece.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.400
So now you still have three
sections, left, center,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.720
and right.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.380
But now you're going
to cross it over.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.750
Cross the right piece
over the center piece.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.720
So you're just basically
trading on places.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.970
Now you're going to pick up hair
and add into that left piece.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.210
And again, you have your
left and your center.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.010
You're going to switch them.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.490
And then you're going to add
in hair on the right side,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.910
to the very right piece.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.360
So you can see I still
have my one, two, three,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.240
or left, center, right.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.020
Now I'm going to take
that right piece,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
cross it over the center piece.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
And you can see we're beginning
to start the French braid.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.210
Now, the trick is just
learning the fingering skills,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.640
and you'll eventually
get that mastered

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.680
and it becomes really easy.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.340
Now I'm adding hair
into the right piece.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.400
Here's my center
piece, right here.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.630
I'm going to cross
over the center piece.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.270
See how it's crossed.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.120
And now I switch my
fingering and add hair

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.000
into the left side.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
And switch your fingering.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.070
Add to the right side.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.070
Cross it over.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.850
Switch your fingering.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.860
Add to the left side.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.930
Switch your fingering.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.090
Add to the right side.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.700
Switch your fingering.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.900
And there you go.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.310
You now have a French braid
down the back of the head.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.680
And then you just continue
it like a traditional braid,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.290
all the way down to
the end of her hair.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.920
And then secure it
with an elastic.

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.860
If you're having trouble,
a good way to start

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.200
is to try just practicing.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.780
But you can practice
with yarn, or string too,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.980
until you get the fingering
a little bit better.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.570
And I promise,
once you've learned

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.030
that, it becomes
really, really easy.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.200
And there you go.
