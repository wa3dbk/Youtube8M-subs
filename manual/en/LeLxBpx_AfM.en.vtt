00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.541
- Hey guys, today we're
doing a collaboration

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:10.332
between me and Diana, Sweet and Salado.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.109
She's doing a steak recipe

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:13.803
and it's gonna have a tomato sauce.

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:15.964
Now it's not like the
Italian tomato sauce.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.529
Please go over there,
check out her recipe.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.642
You click this and it'll pop up.

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:24.566
Anyway, since she's doing a
steak with a tomato sauce,

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.503
I'm doing a Colombian style beef stew

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.672
with a real heavy tomato
influence in the stew.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:32.891
Anyway, I'm gonna get started

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:34.556
and I hope you enjoy the recipe.

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.807
We have two pounds of
beef that's been cubed up

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.856
and we're gonna season
that with salt and pepper.

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:40.646
Quarter teaspoon of cumin.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:43.920
We're gonna add two tablespoons of flour.

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:46.497
And give it a good mix.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:49.237
We're gonna add some oil to a hot pan.

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:52.487
And we're gonna add about
one cup of chopped onions.

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.762
After the onions have
softened up a little bit,

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.420
we're gonna add two
cloves of minced garlic.

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.087
And then we're gonna stir this and cook it

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.146
for about another 30, 45 seconds.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:04.636
Then we'll add our seasoned beef

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:06.257
and try to sear it up a little bit.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:11.028
After our beef starts
to get some color on it,

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:13.686
we're gonna add one 14
ounce can of tomato sauce.

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.923
Then we'll add two bay leaves,
just because I like 'em.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.826
And we'll add four cups of beef stock.

00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:24.120
After it comes to a boil,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.236
we're gonna remove any
foam that comes to the top.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:29.272
Then we're gonna cover it,

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:30.763
turn the temperature down to low.

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:32.366
Depending upon the cut of the meat,

00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:34.136
it'll take an hour to an hour and a half

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.911
'til it just starts to turn
tender and at that point,

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:39.105
we're gonna put in two cups of potatoes

00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:40.724
and two cups of carrots.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:43.668
Then we'll put the lid back on

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:46.321
and simmer them until the
potatoes and carrots are tender.

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:48.565
Occasionally, you wanna
check your vegetables

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:49.803
to see if they're done.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:51.638
Yeah, this potato is not quite ready.

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:53.762
But you don't want to
cook it to mush either.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.350
Just before serving, you
wanna remove the bay leaves,

00:01:57.614 --> 00:01:59.416
because you don't want
anybody to choke on one.

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.075
And remove any excess fat.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.464
So let's serve some of this up.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:06.830
Doesn't that look good?

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.893
Now I'm serving this with some avocado,

00:02:09.893 --> 00:02:12.583
tomato and cilantro rice.

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.936
So, how does lunch taste?

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:27.561
One great thing about Colombian food,

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:29.783
there's no crazy flavors
or anything like that

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.339
but it's simple and prepared correctly,

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.060
absolutely wonderful.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.170
And this dish is a prime example of that.

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.485
Simple ingredients, prepared simply

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:40.570
but done right, excellent.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.435
And with the cilantro rice,
it's gonna be perfect.
