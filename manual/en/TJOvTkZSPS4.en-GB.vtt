Hi guys,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.140
Today I'll be showing you how to make this
delicious stuffed seitan holiday roast

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.499
with awesome mushroom
gravy to go with it.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.240
It makes a great centerpiece but you're probably
going to want to make a few more dishes for

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.980
your Thanksgiving feast. Thankfully, this
video is part of the Epically Ethical Thanksgiving

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.810
collab with 8 of my favourite vegan youtubers
led by the wonderful Emily from Bite Size

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.390
Vegan. Be sure to check out their recipes.
I'll link them in the description box and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.509
at the end of this video.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.429
So let's get started with our seitan! The
dough is super easy to make; first gather

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:38.429
up your flavouring ingredients. I used garlic,
ginger, miso, onion powder, poultry seasoning,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.239
vinegar and a touch of sugar for balance.
Check out the description box for the all

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.210
the amounts.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.219
Combine that with hot water in a blender...and
blend it. Now empty that into a large mixing

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.449
bowl and add your vital wheat gluten and your
chickpea flour. Mix it around until it forms

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.460
a dough then go in with your hands and knead
it for one minute but not longer than that.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.719
Afterwards, you can leave that alone for a
bit to rest while you grab your stuffing.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.949
What? You don't have classic bread stuffing
just ready and laying around? Check out this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.640
3 minute video for the uber easy instructions.
Basically, you just saute some celery and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.390
onion, add broth and mix in some dried out
bread cubes.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.829
After your dough has rested for a couple minutes
to allow the gluten strands to relax a bit,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.030
roll it out on a flat surface. You can see
I sprinkled a little chickpea flour but that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.259
was totally unnecessary. The gluten doesn't
really stick. If it does, just wet it a little.

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.479
You want to gently smush it out into a rectangle
shape about a foot long on one side. Then

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.790
add about a cup of stuffing to the third closest
to you. Don't add too much stuffing though.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.909
Now roll it up. Pinch the sides so they come
together but don't worry too much about it

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.909
sticking together, it will be fine once you
cook it.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.500
This is the part where you choose your own
adventure! You can steam and bake it or just

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.920
straight bake it.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
To steam it, wrap the loaf up in a piece of
wet cheese cloth. Use it to tighten up the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.210
roll a bit and tuck the end of the cloth underneath
the roll to secure.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.250
Now steam that on high for one hour. Don't
forget to check the water level every so often

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.149
to make sure your steamer doesn't run dry.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.420
When you have 15 minutes left on the clock,
start preheating your oven at 375 degrees

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.819
Farenheit or or 190 degrees celsius.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.680
Afterwards, the loaf will have puffed up a
bit. Carefully remove it from the steamer

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.260
and unwrap it. If the cheesecloth sticks,
wet it with some water and it should release.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.800
Leave it on a baking pan lined with parchment
paper.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.879
Now add a glaze. Mixed together some lemon
juice with garlic, brown sugar, olive oil

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.010
and a little salt. Brush this all over your
loaf and reserve the remaining liquid.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.340
Now we can bake that for 30 minutes. At the
halfway mark, flip the seitan over and brush

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.540
on the rest of the glaze then put it back
in to finish baking.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.690
And that's it!

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.040
If you want a firmer loaf or just don't feel
like doing the extra work, you can simply

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.239
bake this.

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.129
Take a large piece of foil and oil the middle
part where the seitan will touch it. Then

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.610
roll it up firmly and twist the ends like
a tootsie roll.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.690
Then bake that in a preheated oven for about
one hour and fifteen minutes at 375 degrees

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.840
farenheit or 190 degrees celsius. For this
method, you have to have it give it a quarter

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.879
turn every fifteen minutes or so to that it
cooks evenly and doesn't burn.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.690
While your seitan is cooking, you can make
your mushroom gravy. You'll need a whole bunch

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.390
of mushrooms of any mild variety (I used 8
oz), 2 cups of vegetable broth, a clove of

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.799
crushed garlic, a few sprigs of fresh thyme,
and some olive oil, some wheat flour, cornstarch

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.620
or tapioca flour.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.060
Slice or chop up the mushrooms first, how
big depends on your perference.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.799
Heat a saucepan on medium to medium high heat
with the oil, then add the salt, garlic and

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.439
mushrooms when it's hot. Cook this for about
10 minutes while stirring regularly, until

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.930
the liquid has pretty much evaporated.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.049
Add the flour, cornstarch or tapioca flour
in and stir that while cooking for about a

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.189
minute.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.000
Now add your stock and fresh thyme. I'm using
a teaspoon of vegetable stock powder and a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.519
teaspoon of nutritional yeast mixed with water
but you can use whatever kind you have.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.470
Then turn the heat to medium low and cook
for about 15 minutes until the gravy gets

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.489
thick. Simmer it for longer if you want it
even thicker. Taste it and adjust for salt

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.409
and pepper.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.610
When the times up on the oven, be very careful
when removing the seitan. And be careful when

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.709
you unwrap it too.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.750
See, it got a bit toastier on one side because
I forgot about turning it at the end.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.640
Leave the seitan cool a bit before slicing.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.860
The baked seitan is a bit dry on the outside
so you can moisten it by brushing on some

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.660
vegetable broth or the same glaze that we
put on the steamed seitan.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.660
The texture is firm, kind of like tofurky.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.690
The steamed seitan is more tender but still
firm. The outside is a little sticky, a little

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.990
lemony, and the stuffing inside is more puffed
up from the additional steaming moisture.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.690
Last but most definatly not least, top the
seitan with your rich, savory mushroom gravy.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.840
Now for a taste test. Oh yes, tender, hearty,
delicious. I have to admit, I left the camera

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.860
rolling will I stood there nomming on this.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.110
Enough taste testing, time to plate! Serve
this with your favourite Thanksgiving sides

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.770
