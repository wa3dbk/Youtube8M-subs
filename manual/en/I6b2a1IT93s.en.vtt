WHITNEY TESLER: Hi. My name is Whitney Tesler
on behalf of Expert Village, and I'm here

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.530
to talk to you today about how to become a
vegan. Another one of my special little treats

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:20.029
is this Ah!laska brand organic cocoa. You
just mix it with soy milk, warm soy milk or

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.810
you can put it in a microwave and it's hot
cocoa which is really good this time of the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.089
year, and it was hard for me to find it for
a while there but this brand was really good.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.730
There's some others also; Dagoba brand makes
some. Let's see. Oh, soy milk. Soy milk is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.320
always good to have on hand. I like the light
version. It comes in vanilla, chocolate, plain,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.960
light, calcium-enriched, pretty much whatever.
Silk brand, I think, is the best, but that's

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.500
my personal preference. There are so many
brands out there to try. I even got my boyfriend

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.700
to start drinking it and using it in his cereal
too and he's not vegan. So, it does tastes

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.840
a lot like milk and it's just a matter of
getting used to it. But you can use this in

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.559
cereals. You can just drink it straight up.
I use it to make macaroni and cheese and sauces,

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.369
also to make hot fudge; just mix this with
a little bit of dark chocolate or semisweet

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.771
morsels and that's really good also. This
is another great product to have on hand.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.220
It's a raw wheat germ and I usually just sprinkle
it into my yoghurt or you can put it on your

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.460
cereal. And I don't know if you can see it,
but it's just little flakes and it comes from

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.180
the wheat kernel. It's actually the most important
part of it and a tiny fiber. It's got about

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.389
4 grams of fiber per tablespoon or 2 tablespoons,
so it's really a great addition and adds a

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:41.630
little crunch to your yoghurt which I like
a lot. Lastly, Vegenaise is a really great

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.969
product to have on hand. It tastes just like
mayonnaise if you ask me, and I just spread

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.060
it on sandwiches, ham sandwiches, burgers,
pretty much anything where you could use mayonnaise.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.920
You can make dips and stuff also. And a teaspoon
of that is not the best for you but it's better

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.899
than mayonnaise; no cholesterol and no trans
fat so that makes me feel good.
