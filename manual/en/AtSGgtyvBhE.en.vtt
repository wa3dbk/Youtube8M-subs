Hi, welcome to Lachlan Likes A Thing, a show where I take a thing

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.450
and see whether or not I like it. Now the thing we're looking at in this video is the new

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.490
backlit Touch Cover 2 for Microsoft
Surface

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.219
and Surface Pro tablets. In this video
I'm going to give you some comments about the

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.969
design and usability of the new Touch
Cover 2

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.080
compared to the old Touch Cover 1
and the old

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.510
Type Cover. Also in this video I'm
gonna show you my performance on some

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.619
typing tests

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.689
just to give you a general idea of what the
accuracy is on the new Touch Cover 2

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.559
compared to the old keyboards.
Anyway let's have a closer look!

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.230
Now I have really mixed feelings about
the original Touch Cover and here

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.710
it is attached to my Surface Pro. One
thing I really like

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.079
about the original Touch Cover is that
because it's much thinner than the Type

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.500
Cover

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.670
when you fold it over on the Surface it's much more flush

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.770
with the top at the Surface - it feels more like a part of the tablet.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.879
The other nice thing about the Touch
Cover is that when you fold it backwards

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.500
to use the Surface like a tablet

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.109
your fingers aren't pressing down on
the keyboard keys - there's just a flat

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.719
surface

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.510
it feels much more grippy and more
secure. The other thing I really like

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.710
about the Touch Cover

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.689
is that it's actually spill resistant, so you know if you're going around

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.340
brushing your teeth by using your Surface
you don't have to worry about

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.979
water messing up all the keys. Unfortunately

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.939
I found the original Touch Cover was
just not very accurate for typing

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.000
and I found that I really couldn't type on it for
very long because all the typos

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.909
would annoy me. Now this is the new
Touch Cover 2 and I got one of these

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.430
because apparently has everything that I
like about the original Touch Cover

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.700
while at the same time Microsoft claims that
they were able to dramatically improve

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.240
the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.310
accuracy of the typing performance on
the Touch Cover 2

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.829
by dramatically increasing the number
of sensors throughout the keyboard.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.240
The also added a backlight to the
Touch Cover 2 which is a really really

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.200
nice addition.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.689
At the same time they've also made
the Touch Cover 2

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.920
slightly thinner than the original
Touch Cover and they've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.610
even made it slightly lighter than the
original Touch Cover

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.060
and it's not a huge difference but
because the Surface Pro is already such

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.500
a bulky tablet

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.590
every little bit counts. Now before I get
into what typing is like on the new

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.479
Touch Cover 2

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.270
there was one small physical difference that
I wanted to point out between the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.709
old Touch Cover and the new Touch Cover.
Now on the old Touch

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.739
Cover, on the folding mechanism there's
actually

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.340
a second band right in the middle here
between the docking

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.510
part and the keyboard which adds a bit of
strength and rigidity to the folding

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.270
mechanism.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.430
Now they've actually removed that
section on the Touch Cover 2 - you see

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.750
that that's completely blank

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620
so it's a little less rigid the old
Touch Cover design.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.569
Now I only noticed this because I'm a
lazy person and I like to use the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.280
Surface Pro lying down a lot

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.500
and even though Microsoft probably
wouldn't recommend this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.860
when I'm lying down I sometimes use
the keyboard just to prop up the weight

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.750
of the Surface Pro just a little and 
this is something that I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.760
really wouldn't encourage you doing on
the new Touch Cover

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.629
because with the lack of that
internal support here

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.650
you can actually see that the cover
actually folds a lot more along that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.269
area

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.379
and it's not not very rigid and I think it
would be really damage the Cover

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.129
over the long term. Now I'm going to show you some
typing tests and then I'm gonna give you my

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.760
conclusion about what typing is like on
the new Touch Cover 2.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.709
Now I'm just using a free typing test
that I found over at

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.300
10fastfingers.com. This is not gonna
be a scientific test because it's not real

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.409
world typing

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.120
but I'm going to give you average results
over three runs compared to the original

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.269
keyboards

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.400
and then maybe you can get an idea on
what the accuracy improvements are like

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.190
on the new Touch Cover 2.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.390
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.740
 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.870
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.870
 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.300
Now again that was not a scientific
test in

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.510
any way shape or form and in the real
world if you're making a whole bunch of

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.400
typing errors like

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.310
I was you probably slow down and kind of
check what you were doing

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.370
but what the results seem to suggest is that I'm not really doing

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.910
any better on the new Touch Cover 2 than I
am on the original Touch Cover

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.880
and what the results seem to indicate that maybe I'm actually doing a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.880
little bit worse

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.389
on the new Touch Cover 2. I would take
that result with a grain of salt.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.530
My general impressions using the
Touch Cover 2 over the past few days

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.220
is that it feels a bit more accurate, a
bit more sensitive than the original

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.010
Touch Cover

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.419
but unfortunately it's still not
nearly as good to type on

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.729
as the Type Cover and thats number
one because

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.410
I don't really get a good sense of where
my fingers are on the keys

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.139
at all times. The other issue is that I
still don't think it works very well

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.389
at all when you're trying to use this on
any surface that's not just a flat desk.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.930
Another issue I find with the
Touch covers is that on because they're

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.419
a little inaccurate I find myself

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.200
unconsciously typing on the keys harder and because there's no key travel

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.880
my fingers actually start getting a bit sore after a bit of typing

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.120
so unfortunately I'm not really enjoying
typing on the new Touch Cover 2

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.740
and I'm gonna have to go to the store and
exchange this for

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.479
one of the new Type Covers to get
that awesome backlight! Anyway please click
