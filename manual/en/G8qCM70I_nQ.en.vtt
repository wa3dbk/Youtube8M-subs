00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.600
Okay, now we're going to talk about numbering
your files or pictures in the Canon 40D. The

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.420
first thing you need to do is make sure your
camera is turned on and active and then press

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:23.830
the menu button. You'll end up here on the
LCD in your menu options and what we can do

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:32.809
is go ahead select the first wrench settings
menu there and scroll down to file numbering.

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.589
In the file numbering menu there are three
different options. The first option, the continuous

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.969
option will number your files from one to
nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:52.770
continuously no matter if you're inserting
a new memory card or not. All of those pictures

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.870
are going to be numbered that way and will
be easy to organize on your personal computer.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.510
The auto reset file numbering method, automatically
resets the count to number one whenever you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.160
insert a new memory card. So let's say you've
shot three hundred photos, you swap out a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.040
card, put a new one in, the first photo is
going to be numbered one and the last one

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.230
will be the last number that you shot there.
The final option here is the manual reset

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.300
option and that option basically, whenever
you select this option, the next picture that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:41.210
you shoot will start with one and what you
can do is shoot say thirty photos, maybe some

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.270
at a location and then you drive to another
location and you want to start a new folder,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.250
starting at one. What you do is select this
manual reset option again and that will create

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.740
a new folder with all of the photos that you're
shooting at that location. So when you get

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.940
back home, you'll have two folders or three
folders that contain all of the photos at

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.170
those separate locations. It's a good way
to organize your photos on location. So those

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.459
are the three options. I'm going to go ahead
and select continuous file numbering method

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.600
here, and that is selected and then I'm going
to go ahead and press menu, and now I'm ready

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.999
to shoot.
