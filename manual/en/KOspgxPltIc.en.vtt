00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.440
Well hello everyone.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.670
And welcome to my newest series on the Help
Desk TV network for the latest operating system

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.270
release by Microsoft codenamed Windows 8.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.470
So far, Microsoft has only released the Development
Preview, so we will be limited in showing

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.270
you all the new features.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:38.410
But as the releases continue, we will be here
for you to show how Windows 8 has been reimagined.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.780
In this first video, we will briefly show
you how to get around the new Metro UI and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.710
shut down the system after your done for the
day.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.540
So now you’ve installed the Windows 8 Developer
Preview Release on your desktop.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.239
And you’ve re-booted the machine, only to
find yourself on this screen.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.540
As you ask yourself, now what?

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.880
What you see here is the new Windows 8 lock
screen.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.000
There are 3 ways you can proceed forward from
this screen:

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.170
1.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.789
By using your mouse, just drag the lock screen
up off your desktop

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.330
2.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.750
Also, you can just double click anywhere on
the screen

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.790
3.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.729
And finally, you can just press any key on
your keyboard.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.729
Once the lock screen has disappeared, you
are now brought to your log on screen.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.649
Go ahead and type in your password.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.140
And there you have it folks.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.899
The NEW Windows 8 Metro UI.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.380
Apps are now represented as tiles as opposed
to icons because there is more space to show

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.890
app data in these tiles.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.459
You’ll notice several of my feeds update
in real time.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:19.189
A new feature for this new Metro UI.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.390
Although the new Windows 8 environment is
heavily designed for the touchpad, you can

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.480
move around with your mouse or keyboard.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.489
First, just scroll the Metro UI with your
mouse using the scroll bar along the bottom

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.760
edge.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.230
Clicking on a tile will open that app on your
screen.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.329
To return to the start screen, just hover
the mouse on the lower left corner of the

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:59.110
screen until the ‘Charm’ menu pops up,
and select ‘Start’.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:10.219
If you want to visit the Windows 7 legacy
desktop, simply click the ‘Desktop’ tile.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.760
Clicking the ‘Start’ icon in the lower
left corner will, as you guessed it, return

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.230
you to the start menu.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.341
When you’ve had enough of Windows 8 for
one day, and you want to shut it down, you

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:26.730
can either:
1.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.150
Use the Ctrl-Alt-Del key combination and select
how you would like to proceed, or

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.150
2.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.150
Open the ‘Charm’ menu by hovering in the
lower left corner, and selecting ‘Settings’.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.360
There you can now click on the power icon
and choose how you wish to proceed.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:00.150
I hope you enjoyed todays look into the new
Windows 8 platform here on Help Desk TV.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
