00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.970
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and since Arrow
totally got renewed for season 3 early I thought

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.440
it would be fun to talk about the top 5 stories
that they should adapt from the comic books

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.990
as well as some of the new characters they
should introduce next...Hint Hint.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.990
Ravager and Jericho.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.880
Just to clarify though, when I say it was
renewed early.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
What that means is that most shows don’t
get renewed until after their season is over.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.890
So the fact arrow got picked up again halfway
through it’s season means the CW has a lot

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.890
of confidence in it.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.119
Six Seasons and a movie confidence.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.119
ha ha.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.910
And I said it before, but here’s some more
evidence, Caity Lotz is sticking around.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.840
She will be back next season as the canary.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.470
So fear not for her death this year.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.210
I’ll also be doing this same type of top
5 stories video for the flash next week, so

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.330
if you’re finding me for the first time
be sure to subscribe to get it.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.580
So first let’s talk about just straight
up comic book titles and then specifically

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.210
some cool ways they can change things to make
them fit better..

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.220
Number 5 - Road To Jericho.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.580
This featured The Red Hood, jason todd attacking
Speedy and Oliver tries to deal with him and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.930
eventually it turns into one villain after
the other tag teaming him including Deathstroke,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.500
Merlyn, Brick and Constantine.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.010
At the end of the story, he also ends up asking
Black Canary to marry him.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.940
There are a couple aspects of this they could
change.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.670
Because a lot of the batman characters are
tied up legally with Fox’s gotham tv show,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.940
they could use slade’s son Jericho or even
ravager to come after Roy for revenge in the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.230
wake of the season 2 finale.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
We don’t know what’s going to happen this
year with Slade’s character, but it will

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
not end well for him.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.910
He won’t die, but he will be beaten badly.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.470
I think of all the new characters to bring
on next year, his children have been the most

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.010
referenced people the past two years that
we’ve never seen.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.620
Bringing them on would be a way in to Young
Justice and eventually Teen Titans.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.700
Number 4 - Archers Quest, who wants to go
on a road trip with oliver?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.530
This story is all about Oliver reclaiming
really sentimental personal items from all

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.570
over the world.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.630
Including family heirlooms.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.770
They did a brief team arrow road trip to russia
this season already in a diggle-centric episode,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.320
but it would be a good opportunity for a Roy-Oliver
ramblin’ man story that let’s them travel

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.909
outside the city.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.720
Or they could swap the Roy part for Felicity.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.060
Raise your hand if you want to see an Oliver-Felicity
road trip

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.979
Them sharing a motel room would cause tumblr
to explode (make noise).

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.640
Number 3 - Hard Traveling Heroes, Green Lantern
Crossover anyone?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.650
This is also a road trip story but it’s
also a green lantern crossover.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.100
It’s Oliver, hal Jordan and Black canary
solving problems as they travel through the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.560
midwest jack kerouac style.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.170
The story was originally from the 70s and
is super political, but they could use it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.720
as an opportunity to swap hal jordan for grant
gustin’s flash.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.270
Imagine oliver and barry on a road trip, with
some of the comedy flowing from the fact that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.420
barry is stuck traveling at human speeds in
a jet when he could just run way faster.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.470
It’s unclear how substantial crossovers
are going to be between flash and arrow characters,

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.580
but it’s likely that they’ll involve major
villains.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.470
Last year’s arrow road trip was a psuedo
suicide squad story, so oliver could always

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.260
get involved in a flash rogues story.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260
This was also the comic that dealt with Roy’s
heroin addiction.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.260
They kind of already did that with the mirakuru
storyline, but they could still use the serum

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.260
as continuing allegory for addiction.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.260
Number 2 - Longbow Hunters.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.260
This is where it starts to get dark.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.640
Longbow actually features an aging Oliver,
which they would have to fudge a bit on, but

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.290
he tracks down a serial killer while black
canary tries to take down a drug circle.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.470
It’s the story where Oliver first meets
shado, which they’d have to change just

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.640
based on her being dead on the tv show.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.680
The reason it’s super dark is because Oliver
ends up murdering one of the villains he finds

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.370
torturing Black Canary.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.770
Arrow kind of did this during season 2 when
count vertigo was going to inject Felicity

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.090
with the mirakuru serum.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.380
So technically the tv version of oliver has
already gone into that territory.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.390
Some changes they could make would be again,
swapping the shado character for ravager or

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.670
even Sin who should get a slightly expanded
role next year anyway.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.819
They could even swap oliver and black canary’s
roles.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.129
Remember, she’s only just left the league
of assassins, so she hasn’t pacified herself

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.069
in the way oliver is trying to this year.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.050
Remember he’s all about not killing people
anymore, but that’s still something Sara

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.280
is dealing with.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.819
Number 1 - Cry For Justice.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.300
This is a longshot, but it’s such an epic
story it has to be mentioned.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.120
Oliver basically goes nuts in this story after
Prometheus chops roy’s arm off and eventually

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.280
results in the fall of green arrow storyline.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.152
It’s a story about how oliver is undone
as a person after his family and his team

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:54.599
are decimated.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.940
Right now they’re kind of teasing this with
slade’s storyline in present day.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.350
Slade is going to try and destroy oliver’s
life by destroying everything he loves.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.750
What they could do that would be really epic
would be having oliver cross the line a little

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.970
going after villains and have amanda waller
send the suicide squad to stop him.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.970
It would be like the government going after
team arrow with their own team of supers.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.850
I don’t think they’ll do a story that
dark, but it would be awesome to see amanda

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.879
waller and oliver go after each other.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.000
All that being said, here’s a bonus choice
because arrow has also been borrowing stories

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.419
from the batman universe and all over the
greater dc universe.

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.419
Kingdom Come.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.029
Think of it as being like a dc version of
days of future past.

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.900
You could even involve a practical time travel
aspect to the story via the flash and STAR

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.900
LABS technology.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.740
Maybe something more technical than the cosmic
treadmill, but it would just be a story where

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.370
you have oliver try to prevent a much darker
timeline from actually happening.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.979
It would even be a way to kill a major character
like Felicity or Thea or even Oliver himself.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.669
And then fix everything by the end as if nothing
bad ended up happening.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.349
Now it’s your turn, which DC story do you
want to see arrow do next year.

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:02.029
Next week I’m going to do my top 5 new characters
arrow should introduce.
