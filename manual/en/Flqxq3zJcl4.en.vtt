Welcome aboard Temptation. My name is Mike. 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.000
Over here we have Brad and we got Steve on board the boat as well today. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We’re going to head out from the marina.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.050
Start searching for the dolphins straight away.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now guys these are one hundred per cent wild dolphins that we’re playing with today. 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.000
We don’t feed them. We never have and we never will. 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.000
All the interaction we get today is due to the dolphins’ sense of curiosity and their fun loving playful nature. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.000
So whatever happens this morning guys, is totally up to the dolphins.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Guys we need everyone on board to get behind the crew. 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.000
Use your eyes and try and find the dolphins for us as well.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Guys we need everyone on board to get behind the crew. 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.000
Use your eyes and try and find the dolphins for us as well.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Do you see dolphins every day?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.000
Every day.  I’ve been out here now for nine years, never been out and not seen dolphins.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Apparently we have dolphins straight ahead of us.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.000
Just out here guys, we’ve got our first pod for the day. There we go! 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.000
We’ve even got one of our locals in there guys, named Jake.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
There was a mother and a baby and they were about three metres below us 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.000
and they swam kind of straight through, just straight past.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.000
 It was excellent.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There was a mother and a baby and they were about three metres below us 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.000
and they swam kind of straight through, just straight past.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
How’d you go mate?

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.000
I missed it.
You missed it. Oh bugger.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I missed it.
You missed it. Oh bugger. 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
My mask wasn’t fitting well, 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.000
so I had to fix it once in a while and have to look for the dolphins. 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.000
So all these things happening all at the same time. It was quite…  it was difficult.
