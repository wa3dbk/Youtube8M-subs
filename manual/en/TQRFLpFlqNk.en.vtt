00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.320
Let's take a general look at the user interface.

00:00:06.093 --> 00:00:16.609
3ds Max is a Windows application with a title bar, and a menu bar that starts
with the Application menu, followed by Edit, Tools, Group, and ending with Help.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:27.840
All the menus are neatly arranged according to their functionality, such as
Object creation, Modification, Animation, Rendering, and so on.

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:36.873
Right below the menus is the main tool bar, where you can access important
basic functions like Move, Rotate, and Scale.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.580
This is also where you'll find the Material editor,
and Render dialog, among others.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:52.170
You can access other toolbars by right-clicking an empty gray area
of the main tool bar and then choosing the toolbar you want to view.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.210
Toolbars can be floating, but you can also dock them
to the left, bottom, right, or top of the screen.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:08.342
You can also make a docked toolbar floating again
by tearing it out into the viewing area.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.790
To close a tool bar, you can click the Close button, or right-click
an empty gray area of the main toolbar again and disable the option.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.400
The next bar down is the Modeling ribbon,
which contains all the tools you need for polygon modeling.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.100
These tools are only available when you select
an editable polygon object and enter the Modify mode.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.770
You can collapse or expand the ribbon,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.360
and like the main tool bar, you can drag out the ribbon
and dock it in a different location.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.720
Let's put it back here for now.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.540
The right hand side of the screen features the Command panels.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.990
You'll spend a great deal of time there as this is where
you can access most of 3ds Max functionality.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.800
In fact, many of the commands found in the pull-down menus
and Modeling ribbon are also in the Command panels.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.470
There are six command panels in all:

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.250
Create, Modify, Hierarchy, Motion, Display, and Utilities.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.170
Each one has its own set of important features.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.806
For now, we'll concentrate on the first two, Create and Modify.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.520
As their name implies, the first is used to create geometry and the second
to change parameters and modify the shape or aspects of objects.

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.137
Let's take a quick look at the Create panel.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.100
By default, it's set to Geometry, which are objects that have a volume.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.810
There are other types of objects, such as 2D splines,
lights, cameras, animation helpers, and so on.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.800
At the Geometry level, you can access additional 
types of 3D shapes from the drop-down menu.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.310
Press C to change the view and let's create a box.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.170
Even though you can see the parameters of this box in the Create panel, it's 
good practice to always go to the Modify panel to make necessary changes.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.320
You can change the box values in a number of ways.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.010
For example, you can click in a field and enter a value.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.180
You can also click the spinners to change the value incrementally,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.390
or you can drag on the spinners directly.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:28.120
Sometimes, a Command panel can become too lengthy for the screen
resolution available, especially if it contains many different rollouts.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.690
This can be seen in the Display panel.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.960
This panel includes options to hide or show objects,
or to freeze objects in case you don't want to select them by mistake.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.940
Click any rollout to expand or collapse it.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.920
When the information is too lengthy, you can scroll the panel up or down,

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:52.814
either by dragging the scroll bar or by placing
the cursor in a blank gray area and dragging up or down. 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.510
You can also click the panel and use the mouse wheel to scroll.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.670
To access many rollouts at the same time, you can drag
the Command panel to the left to give it more room.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.170
The working area, where you view and modify your scene,
is obviously very important.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.724
We take a closer look at it in the movie entitled,
"Working with Viewports".

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.730
Right-clicking in the viewport opens the quad menu, which provides
quick access to common commands related to your current selection.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.860
You'll find the animation slider bar and
the timeline at the bottom of the screen.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.350
This area has to do with object animation and also includes buttons
for animation modes, animation filters, and playback controls.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.820
For a closer look, see the animation movie called,
"Using Simple Keyframing."

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.380
The bottom-left portion of the screen
contains an area for Max Script users.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.770
Transform type-ins are at the bottom-center of the screen.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.480
You can use these to enter precise X, Y, and Z values
to position, orient, or scale a selected object in space.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.930
For more information about these, see the movie entitled,
"Transforming Objects".

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.930
Finally, in the bottom-right portion of the screen,
there are two rows of icons for viewport navigation.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.900
These are essential for properly viewing the scene,
zooming, panning, and orbiting around.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.120
See the movie entitled, "Navigating the Scene".
