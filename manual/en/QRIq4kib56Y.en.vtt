Welcome friends.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.700
Chris here with Partsfish.com

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.180
Today we will be going over the 2014 Shoei
RF1200 helmet.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.520
Lets start with the shape of the helmet.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:38.370
First thing Shoei did was reshape the bottom
of the helmet.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.680
It is now the lightest snell helmet on the
market.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.890
The new shape now pushes wind around much
better and reduces wind noise with still being

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:03.500
able to hear your motorcycle and cars on the
road.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.860
Next lets talk about the vent system.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:23.430
Up front there is a nice large vent, up top
there is 3 vents and in the back 4 vents to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.010
push hot air out.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.580
Air flow in the Shoei RF 1200 is amazing.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.280
Like everything else on this Shoei RF 1200
the sheild is amazing.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.960
It blocks up to 99% of UV rays and gives a
perfect field of view thanks to Shoei 3d molding

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960
system.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.079
This gives this full face helmet a open face
helmet view.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.479
Also on every RF 1200 is the pinlock anti
fog system.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.289
Perfect for cold weather and humid days.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.830
The interior of the RF 1200 is the 3D Max
dry system.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:23.170
It absorbs sweat twice as fast as a standard
nylon interior.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.340
It conforms to the riders head for a excellent
fit.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.430
The Shoei RF 1200 comes is 22 colors and styles
to choose from, and with Shoei's commitment

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.709
to excellence the RF 1200 comes with a five
year purchase date warranty, or a 7 year manufacture

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.400
warranty, which ever comes first.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.310
