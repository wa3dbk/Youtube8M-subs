Hello everyone, my name is Greg Eleftheriou 
and welcome to this video!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.700
In this video, we 're going to talk about chord voicings.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.800
So, the whole concept is how we can get away from a typical power chord progression,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.000
and add, replace, or change the position of some notes,
in order to make that chord sound more interesting.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Right now, I'm going to play for you Example #1, and then I'm going to explain all the voicings I used.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, I'm gonna take the riff from the beginning.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I used a minor voicing.
This one.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is a pretty cool voicing, 
because the most special note of the chord, the third,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is on top of that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I use: Root note - 5th note - minor 3rd.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's the famous add9.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Root note - 5th note - 9th note.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That's a minor voicing again.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
add9.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's a major seventh voicing.
Root note - 5th note - major 7th.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This works fine when you use that in the sixth degree
of a natural minor scale.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's a minor voicing again.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.000
Minor, add9.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's a major voicing.
Root note - major 3rd - octave.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.000
And if I move my octave one step lower,
it becomes a dominant seventh chord.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Root note - major 3rd - minor 7th.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, actually in the example I do this:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Which is a minor and an add9 voicing,
but I replaced this A note with my open A string.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.000
This is a power chord.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Right now, I'm going to play the whole example
slower for you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You can use those voicings, with your clean tone as well.
So here comes Example #2.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Where I'm gonna show you, only the new voicings 
that I haven't shown to you until now.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.000
So in this example, let's take it step by step.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.000
That's a minor seventh voicing. I have my:
Root note - 5th note - minor 7th.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That's a major seventh voicing. I use:
Root note - major 3rd - major seventh.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the same voicing one string higher.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
That's a major voicing. It's pretty known.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.300
Root note - major 3rd - 5th.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.300
And if I move my 5th one step higher,
it becomes a 6th.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.500
Root note - major 3rd - major 6th.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.500
And that's a minor voicing.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
Root note - minor 3rd - 5th.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So, that was all the voicings for this video.
You can always take those voicings and experiment.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Try to use them, try to replace them, try to add them if you want to a song/riff of yours.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Try to use them wisely and try to find a way
 that they can work for you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.500
So, that was all about this video.
Tabs and a diagram, with all these voicings are free for you.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.500
That was all, thank you very much for watching
and I hope you find it useful.
