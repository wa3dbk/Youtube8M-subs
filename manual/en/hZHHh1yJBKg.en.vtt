00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.130
now

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.130
that chronicle of higher education in

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.409
did this incredible story about as someone
who refers to himself as the shadow scholar

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:19.320
now the article does not share his identity
so we don't know who he is specifically but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
he wrote this incredible article about how
he gets paid

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.890
two thousand dollars or more to write

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.869
essays and papers for college students now
this is not news this is something that we've

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.270
heard about before

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
but people are so unaware of powell

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.750
often this happens okay it's not one college
student

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.750
for every fouls and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.220
this shadow scholar says that he is made of
very very good living doing what he does in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.350
fact he made sixty six thousand dollars last
year just by writing papers for college students

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.840
who wanted sheet

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.030
so um... first of all let me just tell you
that the reason why this is so problematic

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.100
is because

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.330
their are

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.729
so many people in college right now getting
higher education

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.729
that no nothing

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.620
that cannot construct as simple sentence

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.540
and he gives an example of that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.920
one of the people that came to him and asked
him to write uh... paper

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.850
was this one add business nature

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.800
and the business major uh... he quotes verbatim
in his article

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.270
so she emails him several times and she asks
in for help on this paper

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.909
on business ethics okay how funny is that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.700
sellecca some bachelor topic of the paper
cell i have some of her uh... emails i want

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.670
you guys to read it i'm gonna read them verbatim

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.880
you guys if you'd be amazed at how many grammatical
and spelling errors that are in each sentence

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.759
let's put the backup

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.189
uh... first one is you didn t business affects

that was the first email that she sent

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.519
and amazingly enough he actually understood
that sentence because he deals with so many

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.879
people who

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.259
are like this

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.639
but anna

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.439

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.889

me continue

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.040
shimoga right desperate

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.309
surpassed spring project

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.569
or project itself

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.759
that's a spelling that survey and that's what
she wrote in the email next one

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:51.370
thanks you so much for the chapter is going
very good the professor likes it but once

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.319
the following suggestions please what do you
do you think

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.140
and that

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.049
it's incredible unlike and actually reading
uh... the words

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.079
you know the correct way she special so many
things wrong and you wouldn't understand what

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.879
i'm saying if i would agree to the way she
stuff

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.749
spelled it

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:09.849
but uh...

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.930
so but go ahead here's what i don't really
know the professor a

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.029
like she comes up to a man has that ms

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.879
presumably a very good paper

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.489
but the show star road

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.049
but she's done in his eye

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.489
here take pay pal

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.349
fit is blood

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.250
hi and would need your

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.329
reinstall

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.360
it's difficult as i believe it now out of
this lady

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.530
by this paper you're upset the right now i
guess so you're saying and one of the arguments

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.289
that the shadow scholar makes is that

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:44.829
professors have such a heavy workload and
they're so busy with so many different students

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.309
that if they don't have the resources to investigate
things so they're not paying close enough

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.790
attention so you know oftentimes arsenal come
out so that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.019
come out to them and let

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.460
even if you have a hard time writing you can
still communicate verbally

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.759
right these students obviously have an issue

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.169
constructing sentences on paper okay so with
this particular student she first came to

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.779
the shuttle scholar asking for help

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.329
on the ethics paper right

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.119
after he wrote the ethics paper

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.679
the professor needed her to make changes

00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:19.660
so shit

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.070
you know how to make the changes

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.430
so she have to go back to stop at this shadow
scholar

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.440
and asked him to make the changes and she
had to pay an additional money for that

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.879
and she decided

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.460
it is a pretty good uh...

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.810
paper on ethics and i'm trying to get my pt

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.750
h_d_ in business

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.610
so why don't i ask and or paid him to turn
this intuit these days

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.240
and he did

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560
this woman somewhere in the world has a p_h_d_
in business

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.320
and it does not know

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.039
anything about business doesn't even know
how to construct a simple sentence any email

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.490
unbelievable

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.479
i am sorry for your first

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.310
uh...

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.580
net and decided to everyone badass period

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.389
managed care does scholar of like the ability
of professional wrestlers and

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.340
remnants

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.279
uh... sandoval

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.879
what did you speak is here to actually get
that you gave him absolutely

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.400
young lady let me just say something real
quick and how these stories have we done about

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.580
education

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.840
putting i think that

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.979
about how we want to go to college but we
can afford it

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.830
this girl is i mean this woman is getting
a p_h_d_ in business icn she's taking out

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.029
loans for it

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.610
what are you got your money's worth and get
that education why are you wasting your time

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.410
and you know the shadows caller kind of explains
it a little bit he says that a lot of the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.009
people that come to him

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.880
art uh... either rich kids that are lazy

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.679
or they art english as a second language students

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:50.400
so

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.909
it did have a lot of articles when it comes
to obscene education

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.520
either they didn't get that property s_l_
uh...

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.509
in the high school so it all carried out the
college in there and a lot of trouble so there

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.959
are a lot of different factors that come into
play

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.190
but it's a good language at given

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.770
over more of pastime but i bet you are the
great majority a rich kids

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.230
'cause you're thinking like i don't know what
i was saying is

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.090
why bother getting a p_h_d_ and the way to
do with it the minute you walk into somebody's

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.340
room in the l_a_ mediate he's done that is
your gun late i mean

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.159
what's your point why do we saw them money

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.420
college at the alleles for the school

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.059
but you also at the gala mister baby travelers
com

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:33.179
that they've been right so and the reason
is the one of our prestige they wanted to

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.330
come to be able to tell my mom and pop pop

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.009
of desire that the shooting of my bag on the
system and

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.080
right around that now i absolutely city is
a and you know

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.870
he actually uh... writes about the rich kids
and he says that he loves when they go to

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.550
him

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.150
because they're usually the ones who knows
that they with their what they want their

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.300
the ones

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.889
will come from the rich families and they
know that they're gonna grow up to inherit

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.009
some sort of business

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.260
so they know how to box people around

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.909
so this shadow scholar describes them as

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.039
a student to know exactly what they want they
discussed at the directions there just lazy

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.610
so they don't carry out what they're supposed
to do for their college education it's an

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.240
incredible story
