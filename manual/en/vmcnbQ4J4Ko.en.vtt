00:00:01.028 --> 00:00:03.368
By David and Erik

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.823
Robert Snuse

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.611
Iceberg! But that's impossible

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:28.580
I'm falling

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.067
Abandon the ship!

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:44.454
The ship is sinking

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:45.539
But that's impossible

00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:48.406
Over here! Help me!

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.931
Look! Robert Snuse in the water

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:56.401
Help me up!

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.069
Unfortunately, the chest is in the way.
As you can see. 

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:05.000
But.. but... don't you understand?
I'll drown!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.742
You should have taken 
some swimming lessons

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.810
Somewhere in the pacific...

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:39.200
They treat me nice. They must think
I'm a god or something.
