00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.110
singh rand paul

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.429
wet to howard university of course the
preeminent historically a black college

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.599
to make the case

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.399
religion for out

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.829
them voting republican and all boil down
to basically

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.240
fitted to the summit weeded out she said

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.109
weed

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.939
dixiecrats and lincoln

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.710
and that's of course

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.159
lincoln was a republican

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.419
democrats in the south pre segregation
to implement that segregation which is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.089
totally truman and of course after
johnson signed the civil rights act they

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.230
all left the became republicans

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.410
uh... and then where ru rans paul's
right man for all definitely has some

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.630
good things to say about the drug war so
credit is due

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.690
but the other thing is that firsters
just two things that i live here

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.780
rans paul as we know

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.870
is on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350
record

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.429
opposing the most important

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.740
and vital aspects of the civil rights
act

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.940
secondly maybe less importantly we also
know these kind of a pen dot just sort

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.240
of the knowitall

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.819
quickly some sound

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.060
uh... of of grandpa limit

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.100
uh... but first i just want to pull out
this little nugget

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.110
because when he was

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.680
here howard university which is related
searches whole areas and of itself

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.570
and he's trying to make the case for the
republican party

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.480
so we asked the audience of young

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.960
you know african-american students
scholars professors academics many many

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.420
preceded him in the credit where credit
is due

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.520
i did to grandpa props for for showing
up in trying it out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.710
raihan yeah a lot of newt gingrich in
that regard newt gingrich is always game

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.970
to go anywhere talk to anybody so sure
credit

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.800
out

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.450
if you know if the chamber of commerce
invited me i'd go

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.340
plate i have a as i'm sure that you

oso yes absolutely go and talk to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.210
i'd like hell

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.870
pac money to help

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.450
i'd be charles to me

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.689
equivalent to african-americans the red

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.589
it

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.269
has shows you tighten this the vital
grandpa lives

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.269
so uh... so they are guy opposes the
frigate civil rights act

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.969
anyways not because he's a racist per se
but because of moron

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.179
he's albany alz these

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:28.589
rule of very educated african-americans
he says

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.499
did you know

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.410
basically lincoln was a republican

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.160
and the first black legislators and the
founders of the n_ double a_c_p_ with

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.810
everyone know that they were all
republicans

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.040
he asked her for a down doubly c_p_
uh... the founders

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.170
we think he's talking to a move like
three-year-olds and so this will get so

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.219
his speech was interrupted by

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.119
yes

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.909
came the booming response from you
believe the entire audience

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.560
who appeared offended

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.819
pepole it even raise the question

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.889
just unbelievable in the sky eclipse
quick

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.709
hey do you know like basic history

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.869
howard university students

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.619
yes

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:12.729
then as you can imagine because ramp all
uh... when he was running for senate

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.129
basically said

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.939
that he opposed the civil rights act or
the part of the civil rights act where

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.119
uh...

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.139
uh... are private businesses will be
forced to desegregate we think we have

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.499
sounded in talking to the wall street
journal

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.289
uh... when he's running for senate

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.270
let's hear it from paul respond to sir

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.140
i like the civil rights act in the sense
that it ending discrimination in all

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.169
public

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.089
uh... domains and i'm all in favor of
that

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.930
dot

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.039
you had to ask you about

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.419
i don't like the idea of telling private
business owners are poor racism i think

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.119
it's a bad business decision ever
exclude anybody from the restaurant

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:57.199
but at the same time i do believe in
private ownership

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.479
so that is really clear that basically
means

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.599
rams paul would be okay

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.299
the civil rights act only applied to the
public sphere which bear mighty pretty

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.949
much wants to completely eliminate

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.349
so you're pretty much in his ideal world
basically almost talking about

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.319
courthouses

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.259
everywhere else interesting that he will
get to the one place is cool with

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.250
african-american visit inside the court
slit

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.139
but to the fairies been critical drug or
but basically saying

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.649
yeah but doubt that's the reality like
besides a car besides public spaces

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.059
which he pretty much totally wants to
destroy it

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.820
he doesn't want the civil rights act
should applied

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.210
uh... to private property that's what he
said that's the most significantly i

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.389
wonder what he considers private
property

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.000
restaurants where civil rights workers
went and i i'm sure then is reduced to a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.039
lot of people who are very different
meanings of private property

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.019
him

00:04:54.019 --> 00:05:00.319
i'd hello right i do get that i'm not
even going to go that but fair point

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.810
how does ramp all respond to this and
anders iran paul where you think you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.330
like he's very

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.080
delusional

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.410
and he's pretty mendacious so

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.960
your i was expecting him to soft pedal i
was even expecting him if he did this

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.710
speech in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.400
tried them

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.870
maybe make some moves

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.899
two maybe even say well

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.199
i've kinda revise my thinking he come up
with some you know

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.789
uh... silly way of justifying his
position or creating a new position

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.929
but he said in response to a question
about this quote

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:33.150
i'd never wavered in my support for
civil rights or the civil rights act

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.479
sells his answer

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.210
and uh... so

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.419
what he says i don't think the

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.070
figures

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.380
just like ramp paul appears to be living
in like some nineteen forties fantasy he

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.240
doesn't seem to realize that the
government funded invented internet

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.959
exists and people can google what he
said

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.430
on tape

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.169
you it's funny i heard i was reading i
couldn't watch the shame of it because

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.650
it was happening live yes they do in a
shelf right but i was reading uh... a

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.939
wrap-up of it

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.710
and um... someone did say to him that
question is who was asking a question

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.699
did stand up and say something like

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.119
how do you want to keep saying that

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.770
allocated unfortunately continues i
don't know what he his response to that

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.439
was but i mean

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.840
the guy clearly

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.159
clearly

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.429
went bad thinking he'd be able to

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:27.529
tool whitewash thing is i guess you
could say

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:30.689
hahaha fact

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.990
i guess in one week look inside you to
despite the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.029
government-funded internet owns rant
paul

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.569
because i'd i just thought i

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.059
huseyni wise and distortions all the
time but in today's age digis

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:49.659
straight-up i didn't say that when
anybody can access what you said in

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.989
twenty seconds

00:06:50.989 --> 00:06:53.219
usually the used anymore

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.409
so i i don't know what's going in spine
inside me and paul said but suffice to

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.449
say he's an extremist

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:01.050
he's crazy

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.940
and he ran on opposing the civil rights
act which isn't

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.110
really think about that think about you
went back to the or fifties and sixties

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.419
you saw the civil rights movement

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.509
anger prime take away was

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:17.879
marginally those

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:22.229
poor restaurant guys that that want to
serve ice cream to inscri counters i

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:24.849
feel like they were a little unfairly
run over

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.719
grandpa did public history instead
public first-ever libertarian to step

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.500
foot in howard university

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.919
credit card

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.969
after when i think uh...

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:38.340
rent panchkula make allot more history
and not good ways

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.639
has public reserve
