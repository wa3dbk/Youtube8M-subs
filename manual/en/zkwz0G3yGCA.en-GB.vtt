00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.649
Mumbai: The financial capital, notorious for
its traffic snarls, has achieved a first in

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.300
the country after a city-based pizza outlet
used an unmanned drone to execute a delivery

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.830
by taking the aerial route recently. "All
of us had read about (global e-commerce giant)

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.680
Amazon's plans of using drones. We successfully
carried out a test-delivery by sending a pizza

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.720
to a customer located 1.5 km away from our
outlet on May 11," Francesco's Pizzeria chief

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.140
executive Mikhel Rajani said. He stressed
that this was only a test-flight but its results

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
confirm that it can be used routinely in a
few years. A four-rotor drone took off with

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.929
the order from its outlet in central Mumbai's
Lower Parel area and delivered it to a high-rise

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.010
building in adjacent Worli area, Rajani said,
claiming that it is for the first time that

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.839
the ubiquitous drone has been used for such
a purpose in the country. The eatery, which

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.329
has been in operations for two years, has
made a video of the delivery, he said, adding

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.539
an auto engineer friend helped with making
the flight possible. Rajani, who comes from

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.130
a family that is into textiles, said the drone
saves time and costs for a company like his,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.630
which would otherwise depend on a two-wheeler
borne agent to deliver the pizzas. "What we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.409
have done now will be common place in the
next four-five years," he said, adding every

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.009
such customised drone costs around USD 2,000.
At present, there are certain restrictions

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.170
on the regulatory front like the drone not
allowed to fly above 400 ft altitude and barred

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.640
from flying over security establishments,
he said, adding the American Federal Aviation

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.560
Authority's regulations on usage of drones,
expected next year, will help. Apart from

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.560
that there are technical difficulties like
a limited operating radius of 8 km after which

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.020
the batteries go dry, he said, adding proper
infrastructure like having charging stations

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.110
can help. Even though the four-rotor version
drone had a limited carrying capacity, he

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.709
said the payload capacity can be increased
to 8 kg in case of an eight-rotor drone.
