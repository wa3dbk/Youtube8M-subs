00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.300
Well, after the match (against Argentina) on Tuesday

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.200
we had the idea of organizing a little 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.200
impromptu birthday party.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.460
We got hold of this restaurant

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.940
and then thought: "Let's do something special".

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.400
So we managed to invite some special guests all the way down from Italy, as well.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.020
And that's how the whole evening came together.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.420
 I do hope it was one big surprise for him.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.700
I think we've got people from all over the place here tonight.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.700
 A lot of close friends of his, Gökhan's parents 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080
and people who grew up with him in the Olten area in particular.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.540
I had a great time with them, before I became a professional footballer.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.620
I mean, I spent good times with them on a daily basis back then.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.320
Now they're here and following my great career as a pro up until now,

00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:56.548
seeing them again 

00:00:56.774 --> 00:01:02.274
makes me feel as if I'm ten years old once more.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.680
 And I feel young again, just like in the "good old times".

00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:10.194
I really enjoyed them all making the way to the party.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.340
My first meeting with Gökhan was playing football in the streets on a red turf 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.020
or an indoor tournament and that's how that all came about.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.000
And by sheer accident, we also share the same birthday.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.420
He's got a big heart,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.720
he is very much down to earth,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.320
he truly is a person that lives honesty and correctness

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.973
and he's got that family flair about him.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.900
I mostly appreciate Gökhan for his willingness

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.340
to remain the way he's always been and for keeping his feet to the ground,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.020
after everything he's achieved so far.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.880
Honestly, I feel very good in shape, I feel very fine in general.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.060
I feel young, yet experienced.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.200
And I like that a lot.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
When I think back to my time in Brazil with the "Nati" (the Swiss national football team),

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.860
the experience in general has been very important to me personally.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.860
I mean,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.700
our team can be proud of an exceptional World Cup.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.880
Personally, I had a great World Cup, as well.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.080
Those World Cup games are very important to us.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.440
So that in the future, we can become an even stronger Swiss squad.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.880
And I can sense how the team has gelled even more now

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.180
following the defeat against France.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.820
Only that way, you can hold up your own right against bigger footballing nations.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.640
I think Switzerland has to adapt that mindset:

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.200
That you can only achieve something when everybody is pulling on the same string.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.020
Gökhan is in our hearts, in the hearts of the "tifosi" because he's an exceptional guy,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.180
because he's a very decent guy and because he's a great champion,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.000
and most of all, the Napoli fans have completely taken him to their heart.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.540
He is our pillar in the centre!

00:02:58.594 --> 00:02:59.774
We wish you well, Gökhan!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.000
Happy Birthday!
