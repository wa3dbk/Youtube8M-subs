00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:08.219
The Cherry Picker. In the previous series
we did the slow Cherry Picker or the Tic Tac,

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:23.970
which is this. Now, a slight variation of
this, is this. The Cherry Picker is the most

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.770
difficult part of both of those tricks combine.
So what you're doing is the balls are traveling

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.610
in an upside down pyramid in a circle and
you're grabbing it at the apex, shoving it

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:53.100
along an imaginary line and dropping it. So
this is what the Cherry Picker looks like.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.590
Okay. Now the most difficult part of this
is two-fold. It is having the throw be the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.040
right heights that you don't have to reach
for it, so that it looks as though the top

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.510
is on a shelf and you were just pushing them
along a shelf. That's the most difficult part

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.740
I, is getting the throw to stop at its apex
right on the same plane every time. The difficult

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.800
part II is the release. When you're releasing
it on the other side, you don't want to throw

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.530
it, you don't want to flick it and you definitely
don't want to push it down. You need to be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.420
able to drop it which is much harder than
it, than it sounds. It's very hard to move

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.730
your arm that quickly and then drop without
having the ball continue along its path and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:52.500
fly out. So the way to start is, start with
your Tic Tac and instead of doing the Tic

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:03.140
Tac part, try to move it over. Okay. It's,
another way would be to practice your under

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.899
arm throw and instead of doing a chop downward,
this, try to move it over. And eventually

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.290
with enough practice, you'll be able to get
them to sit in the same spot. And obviously

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.190
the further you can move them over, and the
wider you can make that triangle, the better

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.180
the trick looks. So that is the Cherry Picker.
