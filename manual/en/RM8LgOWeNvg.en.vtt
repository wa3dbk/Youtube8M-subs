00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:10.202
Hi! 
My name is Stacey.

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:12.409
  Life as a student
 can be hectic.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:15.543
We all have to keep track
 of classes we attend,

00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.017
readings to complete,

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:18.419
assignments to work on,

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:20.381
and that's on top 
of our social life 

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:21.558
and work commitments!?

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:26.053
In this video, 
I'd like to show you

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:28.564
how you can make
 time management much easier

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:29.678
by using the right tools

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.256
and keeping in mind
 some simple steps.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.068
[Sigh]
Ok, let's begin.

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:39.672
The first step is to identify 
all the reoccurring events

00:00:39.676 --> 00:00:42.263
in your schedule 
and add them to your agenda. 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.440
For example, you should 
insert all the classes, 

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.944
tutorials and labs 
you attend each week.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.451
 Yes, you need 
to put them all in.

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:53.986
And make sure 
to indicate the time 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.072
each one begins 
and ends!  

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.927
Electronic calendars
make this step a bit easier

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.785
since they usually have
 a "repeat" option 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.932
so you don't have 
to duplicate the event by hand.  

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:05.992
While we're at it, 

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.169
why not block Friday nights,
 for some fun.

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.830
 It may sound silly, 
but students need to plan 

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:11.673
for some time off

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:14.262
 if we want to be productive
 the rest of the time, 

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.902
So make sure schedule a bit 
of time for yourself everyday

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:19.614
 whether it's for watching
 your favourite show

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:20.943
or calling a friend. 

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.913
Of course, you will also need 
to add appointments, 

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.911
work shifts, hockey practice 
or group meetings in there, too.

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:29.910
I've learned 
the hard way

00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:32.744
that if I don't do it 
right away, I'll forget! 

00:01:32.748 --> 00:01:34.458
 I hate that sinking feeling

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:36.877
of realizing that I forgot
 to meet someone!  

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.731
Alarm and remind functions
 are perfect 

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.446
for alerting me 
of appointments. 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.850
Sometimes I even set 
more than one alarm -

00:01:46.854 --> 00:01:50.109
one for the day before 
and one the day of the event!  

00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:55.623
What I like most 
about smart phones

00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:57.018
and other handheld devices 

00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:59.092
is that I have them with me
 wherever I go.

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:01.985
So, I add details,
like things I should bring,

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.295
the address 
or even bus directions! 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.065
If you want to access
 your schedule

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.935
from different places
 or devices,

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.929
there are terrific online tools
that allow you

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.425
to synchronize your agenda
 so you have the same details 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.837
on your computer 
as well as your handheld device. 

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.518
One of the most challenging aspects
 of time management for me

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:22.133
 is scheduling time 
for on-going schoolwork, 

00:02:22.137 --> 00:02:24.984
like projects, 
essays and assignments.

00:02:24.988 --> 00:02:28.506
Because these tasks are 
more complex and need to be done

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.690
over several days 
or even weeks,

00:02:30.694 --> 00:02:32.109
I used to procrastinate

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:34.646
by doing all the easier things
 in my agenda first,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.826
pushing that project 
to the next day, then the next.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.759
Well, you get
my point.

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:43.656
Finally, I found a solution.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.665
I've started to look
at each assignment

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.506
as a multiple-step process 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.999
and schedule some time
 for each step.  

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.777
I actually feel less stressed,
 because I only need to focus

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:55.477
on one step at a time. 

00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:59.673
A good rule of thumb is 
to cut a large assignment

00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:02.204
into a minimum of 6 step.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.037
First, understand 
the assignment

00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:07.109
 and select a topic,
 if needed.

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:09.481
Next, decide how you will do
 the research.

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:14.007
identify what class notes, books,
and other resources you will use.

00:03:14.011 --> 00:03:16.651
Then read
the supporting material,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.038
and make notes of how
 it relates to your assignment.

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:23.103
Make an outline or a mind map
 of what you want to use or say.

00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:25.466
Don't forget to identify 
which resources

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.499
you want to use
 in which section.

00:03:27.503 --> 00:03:28.635
Write a draft.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.965
Finally, edit and 
proofread your work.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.862
So, as soon as I know
 I have an assignment coming up,

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:40.380
I take the time to put each
of these steps in my schedule.

00:03:40.384 --> 00:03:41.747
You need to be honest,

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:44.234
and schedule enough time 
for each task.

00:03:44.238 --> 00:03:46.885
For example, I will have
 to give myself

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.514
a lot more time for writing

00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:50.948
than I would 
for choosing a topic.

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:54.675
Well, I hope you've found 
my suggestions helpful.

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.312
Try them out
 and then adapt them

00:03:56.316 --> 00:03:58.341
to fit your own personality
 and schedule!

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.223
