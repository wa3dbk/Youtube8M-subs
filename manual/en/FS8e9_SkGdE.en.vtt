Hi, I am David Clemen on behalf of Expert
Village and today we are going to learn the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.009
basics of drawing. Now that we have used the
gesture drawing and we have laid out our initial

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.299
concept, I did not particularly like that
layout so I turned my paper because Jeffrey

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.910
has such a long neck I want to compensate
for that and be able to get Jeffrey and his

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.000
entire head in this still life. So I am going
to come back, pull in my book here. I am just

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.719
going to loosely lay it out again. I am still
doing a gesture drawing. Once I get the composition

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.780
I like, then we can go to the shading and
really get in depth with this to make it a

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.559
nice piece. But we kind of have to get our
composition right or how we would like to

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.840
see it first before we start shading. There
is no reason to shade anything if you do not

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.460
like the proportion and the composition. I
am going to come in here with my sculpture,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:13.720
going to do this. Now, I am actually going
to start on Jeffrey's head on this one. And

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.900
I come up here. He has got those little giraffe
horns, I don't even know what those are called,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.060
but they are there so I got to get them. Alright,
come in and get the nostril. See how that

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.530
jaw line is there? A human jaw from the side
is pretty much the same way. I believe that

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.710
is called the mandible. I am just going to
come in here and just indicate that. I have

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:44.280
got this really long neck. Okay, it comes
out here and then you see how the chest actually

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.590
drops down to nothing where you can't see
it. So I go like this and from my angle his

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.970
hip actually starts way up here. Going to
do this, get the knee it goes down. Going

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.420
to get this, it comes in here. I have got
this big chest now. See, if you were to think

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.980
about it his ribs are right here in his chest
just like a human, his ribs go down in there.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.590
Alright, and now I have got my gesture drawing
of the still life and I can get ready to move

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.590
on and start shading now that I like this
composition a lot better. And there it is.
