The White Bed
Stephen Whitehead

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.200
My name is Steven Whitehead, I've been a bedding 
stylist for about fifteen years and I work

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.689
with pottery barn.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.859
The white bed has a certain mystique and
you go into a beautiful spa hotel the beds

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.379
tend to be

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.160
variations of a white theme, and it allows people
to completely unwind and just be.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.860
I think for a lot of people they think that
white is very delicate,

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.800
when it's soiled, it'll let you know,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.599
as I would want my favorites to do and I would
say the majority of the bedding that pottery

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.680
barn sells is machine washable. It's
very easy to care for and you can trust

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.250
that when you start to build a collection
of white bedding that it's always going to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.090
go together it's always going to be classic,
it's always going to look good.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.539
The great thing about building

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.679
a collection of white bedding is that
it's so easy, you add a new element,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.680
a new coverlet, a new sham, 
a new decorative pillow

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.170
and all of a sudden you have a beautiful new room.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.400
It is timeless it's classic and you will always
be able to use it.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.130
The nice thing about the white bed is that it can
take on any number of personas, it can be

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.119
very clean and masculine, very

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.319
organized and geometric, it can be very romantic
with ruffle with

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.080
beautiful heirloom linens,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.690
it can take on any type of identity you need it
to take on. Seasonally you can do lightweight

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.070
wool blankets, lightweight cotton blankets so
that you can do it from season from summer

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.980
to winter to spring. There's always an appropriate
bedding that Pottery Barn sells that will work

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.810
for any season of the year.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.370
One of our tricks of the trade to use a little
bit of water and a spray bottle to ease out wrinkles.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.200
You could use this in your guest room if you
want to freshen

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.429
a duvet or sheets before your guests arrive
and what we've done too do is to add a little

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.390
bit of lavender so that the water has a slight
scent and just freshens the linen,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.020
and it makes it really welcoming to your guests.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.640
I think it's important in your linen closet
or whatever storage you have is that,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.289
first of all, edit, get rid of anything that
you don't use that doesn't function for you

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.010
that's too small, that's dated,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.270
and then make sure that you fold your linens
so that everything that you own is in plain

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.500
view that you can access it that you can
see what is in your entire collection. That

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.819
way you can rotate

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.359
you can make sure that your're utilizing everything
that you own and your fabrics are going to wear

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.109
more evenly that way and you'll enjoy them
for a much longer time.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:26.980
The bed is very important. We spent probably a third
of our lives in bed. It's a space of renewal,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.500
and you want to have that space be tranquil and
inviting and you want to have

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.360
the best sound asleep possible.
