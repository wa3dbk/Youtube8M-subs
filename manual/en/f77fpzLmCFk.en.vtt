00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.080
Then, I can't teach you much about clock repair
in a short clip, but we can talk for a minute

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.940
about why a clock may not be running. Seems,
as I'm doing clock repair work, people are

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.260
often surprised, even angry, if their clock
has stopped, and I ask: "well, when's the

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.860
last time you had it serviced?" And: "Oh!
We've never had to have this serviced. This

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.580
clock's been perfect for years." And, that
explains why it stopped now. You can't, if

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.110
you think about your car, you wouldn't brag
about the fact that you haven't changed the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.561
oil in ten years. You, this clock is a machine,
the same way other machines are, and they

00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:38.340
require service. In this case, particularly,
it's a fairly primitive machine, without sealed

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.390
bearings, without a lot of fancy technology
to keep it running, really unlike your refrigerator

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.940
or, or other appliance in your house, which
is of much more modern construction. They

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.710
need service, and they will stop if they become
dirty and worn, which is usually why they

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.790
aren't running. You have with this here, where
all of these shafts are turning inside, bearings

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.710
which really are just holes drilled in the
front plate of the movement. Those holes can

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.300
get worn egg-shaped just from the pressure
and the dirt, and eventually, if they're worn

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.010
egg-shaped enough, the gears don't mesh properly,
the clock stops, and then someone like me

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.970
has to do what's called bushing, when you
put a, a sleeve back in that worn bearing,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.970
so that it turns properly. Also, too, just
dirt builds up, and all of these bearings,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.280
they start out with just a little bit of oil,
it's open to the air, the oil dries, thickens,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.090
collects dirt, and you have too much friction
for it to go. So, you talk about clock cleaning,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.340
but that really isn't as significant as what
has to happen when a clock has to get taken

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.580
apart, and deal with that wear and tear. The
bigger issue to pendulum clocks is uneven

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.210
ticking. I have a machine here that amplifies
the tick. Right now, even this is a little

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.820
bit out beat, but probably still working.
You listen closely, you hear a short and a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:02.190
long. I can make that worse by unleveling
the clock. If I level it better, I get a nice,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.050
even tick. The clock's in beat and it'll keep
running. Many times, particularly with newer

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.380
pendulum clocks, if they're out of beat, that's
the only problem, and here you level the clock,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.420
or you injust, adjust it internally so the
clock is ticking evenly.
