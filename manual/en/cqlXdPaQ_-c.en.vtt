Hi, I'm Michael Burton, with michaelburtonfilms.org,
located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and we're

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.950
here talking about, using Microsoft Windows.
What I want to talk to you about now is, how

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.190
to change the power settings on your computer.
Let me start out by saying, that Windows XP

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.839
is a registered trademark of Microsoft, and
I am in no way affiliated with Microsoft.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.259
There are two main ways to change the power
setting in your computer that I'm going to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.830
show you right now. The first involves, just
simply right clicking on the desktop, scrolling

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.250
down to the properties menu, this brings up
your display properties. If you notice, across

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.320
the top here, there's a few tabs. We're going
to go over to the screen saver tab, this brings

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.140
up your screen saver window, as currently
right now, I have no screen saver, as you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.080
can see. But down here, is your monitor power,
monitor settings, you see there's a button

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.900
here called power. Go ahead and left click
on the power button, this brings up your power

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.850
schemes, and your power options. As you you
can see right now, under power schemes I have

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.390
it set to home office or desk, because that's
what my computer is, it's from my office.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.000
If you hit the drop down button, you'll see
that they have a number of different schemes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.610
We have portable laptop, we have presentation,
always on, minimal power. You want to set

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.910
this to basically what you use your computer
for, that way the computer can- they're kind

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.570
of like presets almost, but then you can scroll
down here, you can either save it, if you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.070
do like me, I come down here and I do some
customization where I want the monitor turned

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.729
off after 20 minutes, and as a matter of fact,
I'm going to pull up the drop down menu, scroll

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.280
down, and turn that to, never, I never want
my monitor turned off, I turn my own monitor

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.040
on and off. It's a pain for me to have to
come back, and wiggle the mouse to get the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.650
monitor to turn back on, so I just turn on
and off the monitor at my own will. I have

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.340
the, turn off hard disks, to never, I have
the systems standby, the system hibernate,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.409
to never, never, never, because I'm usually
rendering video clips on the computer, or

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.370
I'm downloading video clips, and if they it
goes to standby, or hibernates, or the disk

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.570
turns off, then that really messes up my video
download. So you can customize this however

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.890
you want, and then go up to save as, and save
your own power scheme that way. If you ever

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.130
need to use another project scheme, then eventually
come back to the one you created yourself,

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.090
or you customized, it'll be real easy for
you to come under you drop list here, under

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.270
power schemes, and choose it that way. Lets
close down this window, let me show you one

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.130
other way to get to your power options. The
other way, is to go to the start menu, and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.470
to pull up your control menu, which is on
the right hand side of the start menu. You

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.430
see the button over here, under, performance
and maintenance, go ahead and click on that.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.569
When you pull this up, you notice down here,
on the bottom right hand corner, right above

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.099
system, is the power options, right there,
it's pretty self explanatory, brings up the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.200
exact same screen we were just on with the
power schemes. Again, showing that my monitor

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.090
is set to 20 minutes, I'm going to go ahead
and click that on, never, and the reason why

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.070
that didn't stay, is because I didn't click
apply. So you go down here, to the bottom

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.160
right hand corner, you click apply when you
have your settings, and then you click okay.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.489
And that's how you change your power options.
