00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.310
when taking any photograph you need to
think about the light and the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.639
composition of the shot

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.380
as a rule bright clear days are better than grey ones

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.439
and to get the best view it's worth
spending some time to walk around and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.419
look at your subject from as many
angles as possible

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.100
ideally you also need to make sure the
subjects sit straight and level on the horizon

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.760
that your uprights don't tilt

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.760
this helps to create a more realistic looking
image with greater use possibilities

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.860
there are occasions however

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.890
when using the dynamics created from
shooting the monument from below can

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.240
create impact and drama that will help
an image sell

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.770
do what our clients do

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.040
ask yourself

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.250
what is the most interesting or
recognizable element of the monument

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.030
you are taking a picture of and always
remember if the monument in your picture

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.260
isn't immediately recognizable then it's
probably not going to sell

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.340
to illustrate the main do's and don'ts i'm
going to use images of the calgary tower

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.890
in canada

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.970
in this shot the grey day makes the tower look 
flat and dull

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.330
also the building in the foreground
completely dominates the whole picture

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.939
making this image look more like a
snap shot

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.710
that just happens to have the tower in
the middle of the frame

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.240
you can also see that the name to the hotel
is clearly visible

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.220
which is something to avoid

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.270
this is a real picture killer

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.109
this shot is too dark and the buildings
creeping in from the sides of the frame

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.090
draw attention away from the tower

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.870
this viewpoint also means the
recognizable top part of the tower

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.740
is just a small circle in the sky

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.850
here the tower is bigger in frame but
it's still not a good shot

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.210
it's too dark the streetlight is very
distracting and the tower appears to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.290
be leaning way over to the left without
reason

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.949
the light is better in this shot giving
the tower an upbeat feel

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.399
the colors are vivid and the shape
of the tower has more impact and good

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.519
contrast

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.919
creatively this is an interesting image
but as you can't see the iconic shape at

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.290
the top of the tower

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.139
this shot is not very commercial

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.069
this shot ticks most of the boxes

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.349
the light is good giving the tower a three
dimensional appearance the colors are vivid

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.439
and the tower how has a crisp outline
against the sky

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.989
the iconic shape of the top of the tower
is also a visible

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.759
making this the most commercial image so
far

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.809
even so it's not the most interesting
or creative image of the tower i've

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.429
ever seen

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.779
this shot works on every level

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.450
the viewpoint works really well

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.830
the light is good and the use of
buildings in the foreground draws the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.209
eye to the tower

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.839
which helps give it a sense of place and scale

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:20.369
what makes this shot really stand out is
the light on the foreground buildings

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.989
given the position of the sun these
buildings should be in dark shadow

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.109
but here

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.329
the photographer has cleverly used the
reflection from the buildings that are out of frame

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.229
on the left to make the foreground
buildings

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.249
one of the most interesting and creative
aspects of the image

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:39.540
there's also great balance to this
image

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.859
this combination of direct and reflected
light doesn't happen all of the time

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.799
but the more time you take to plan your
shots the more you will begin to notice

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.349
these sorts of opportunities and learn to
make the most of them

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.930
this last shot is a real creative example
which also stands out from the crowd

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.810
this may look totally different from the
last two shots but it still has the crucial

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.659
elements present

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:10.139
being well lit and shot from an angle that
means the tower is instantly recognizable

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.540
once you start factoring in these basic
rules they become second nature

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.099
you will notice shots like this all of
the time

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.260
and that in turn will greatly increase
the creativity

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.920
and commercial potential

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.120
of your photography

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.350
to summarize

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.340
what you need to get right of you to get a great setting shot of a monument is

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.119
a building that people will recognize

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:34.649
shot when

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.610
the light is at it's best

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.300
from a good position

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.479
using the right composition

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.340
which helps create

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.640
the right balance
