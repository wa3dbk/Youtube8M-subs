00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.430
LONG: For the past five years,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.230
I've lived in a part of Los Angeles

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.730
that is known as Frogtown.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
And it happens to coincide

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.000
with a very large,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.260
but little-observed, landmark,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.000
the Los Angeles River.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.560
It's this bucolic stream with

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.630
about 125 different species of birds,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
and there's just all this life there.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.360
And everything on the streets

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.630
of Los Angeles, everything that can roll

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.260
or get caught in a torrent of rain,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.360
just comes down and into the river

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.100
and it gets caught in these trees

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.230
that grow up through the concrete.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.700
What I discovered recently

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.130
walking over these things

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.330
that under my feet

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.230
were these amazing marks

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
made by the excrement of the blue heron

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.300
and the white egrets.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.130
And they trickled down the sides

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.360
of the concrete and as they do,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.030
they make these forms that to me,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.130
always look like creatures, sometimes

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.360
even like the birds themselves.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.630
They have heads, sometimes beaks,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.600
appendages, and they can be

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.300
as long as 20 feet.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.330
And once I started seeing them

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.560
as these creatures,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.700
I couldn't un-see them.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.030
What I would do is, I would

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.600
take photographs of these excrements

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.260
and then I would have them produced

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.430
using albumen photography,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.160
which is a 19th-century process.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.730
It uses egg whites as the emulsion

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that suspends the gold or silver pigment.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.560
And for me, the egg sort of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.400
is bringing back another aspect

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.600
of the bird and materiality.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.100
Then I would see them

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.230
three-dimensional,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.300
and I got very good at interpreting

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.230
flat things as 3-D,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.260
and welled up these structures,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.160
almost like line drawings,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.730
and then I would

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.460
start to gather all these things

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.230
from my walks

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.160
that I would bring home in the backpacks

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.460
and grab these things and mix it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.330
with the plaster and paper-mache

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.200
and some glue and start putting it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.000
all over the steel armature.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.430
And these are all things in the river;

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.630
I mean, the river has it all.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.460
It has American flags and baby strollers.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.600
You know, everything that goes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.300
through our lives ends up

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.630
down in that river.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100
I don't make the kind of art

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
that starts with an idea.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.500
I work from my experience,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.230
my materials, my presence,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.660
my joy, my anger.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.500
And so when I talk about digestion,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.530
I'm talking about how for me as an artist,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.760
I process these things and output it.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.160
I want the work to just be floating

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.500
and strange for the viewer,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.660
to have that strangeness that I feel

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000
in the river of seeing an automobile

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.130
stuck in a tree.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530
I mean, it's so riveting and beautiful.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.700
And that's what I'm after,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.100
this sense of imbalance and beauty.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.200
.
