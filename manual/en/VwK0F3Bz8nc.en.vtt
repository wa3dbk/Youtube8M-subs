Today you're going to learn how to make a very simple garlic tomato dal

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.539
you know this is very easy to make but
nice and flavorful

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.840
we only add chilli powder to make it more

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.039
spicy. This particular dal we do not add

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.170
oil or anything just we cook this with butter, add

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.800
cumin seeds and garlic you know you can add lot of garlic

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.840
and just let this garlic cook in the butter

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.370
this on a slow flame till this butter melts

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.000
and the garlic also slightly gets color
look at this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
the garlic is nicely colored that is when at

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.510
tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, wow and as soon as you add tomatoes

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.199
add chilli powder also, for this we're going to add little bit of extra

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.500
chilli powder but you know you can always add little less if you want to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.730
add some soft and cook it on a slow flame

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.150
till this tomato get nicely mashed

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.250
now just add some water and then

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.640
mix with this tomatoes, here I have got tuvar dal which I have

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.200
boiled it till the dal is nice and soft

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.390
and you know we're going to cook this tomatoes for two more minutes then we're going to add

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.380
the dal. Now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.520
look at this, the tomatoes are nicely
mashed up, in this

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.509
add dal, add the entire of it, if you notice that we did not bad any of

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:29.950
the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.079
other coriander powder or curry leaves, 
green chillies

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.280
anything because we cook the garlic, red chilli and the tomatoes

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.329
that's it very simple and very tasty

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.479
Add little more salt if needed, adjust the taste

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.130
and let it come to one boil and switch off the flame. If you are making

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.570
any other vegetables

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.619
which are fried or have got lot of masala
