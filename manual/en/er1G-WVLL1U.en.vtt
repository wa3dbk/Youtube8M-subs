00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.890
So here we are in Lyneham.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.210
This is where I live.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.050
This is my beautiful house.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.370
We can go for a tour.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.330
So this is our little living room.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.330
This is our access to our—

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.450
Very unkept backyard.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.010
Managed to get out own veggie
patch growing as well,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770
which is great, so,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.850
Spent the past couple
of months to have that going,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.130
so we've got all our own
vegetables at the moment

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.570
which saves a bit of money.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.250
It's a bit time consuming though.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.130
I'll show you the bedrooms.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.490
Yeah, this is mine.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.250
It's not very clean, I'm sorry.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.730
Best advice is, get a bed base.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.210
I slept on 20 milk crates for
a period of about six months.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.370
And it wasn't good.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.090
Fantastic furniture,
hundred-dollar bed base.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.530
There's three of us in the house.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.450
We've been here for about
a year and a half.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.250
And it's great.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.290
Because, you know,
we're really close to uni

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.930
and lots of friends around
in the area.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.890
But moving out was a very
important experience

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010
and uni wouldn't have been
the same without it.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.050
It's, you meet new people.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.050
And you learn to live on your own.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
And you learn how important
making time for study is,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.770
because you've gotta
take care of yourself

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.250
and you wanna get out and see
your friends at the same time.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.570
Keep your house clean,
and do everything like that.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.450
So, you learn a lot.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.770
Going for ANU, I guess, it was...
it has such a good name.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.170
And that's not to say that
the other universities don't.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.530
But it's just that the courses
I wanted to study

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.410
when I was at college,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.330
I discovered a love of
philosophy and English.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.850
I wanted to continue that.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.650
So, I love the coursework.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.890
It's fantastic.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.450
And the lecturers, it's amazing that
at such a reputable university,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.090
you can just email
a doctor of philosophy

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.930
or a professor of this and that.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.090
And you can just walk up
to their office

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.010
and go and talk to them
about anything.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.650
And it's great.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.010
All three of us in the house
are vegetarians.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.450
So there's a lot of
fruit and vegetables.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.330
So it's very hard to try and go through
everything without letting it go off.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.210
And there's a lot of beans.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.650
There's a lot of frozen lentil patties.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.930
All good.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.410
You can come meet
my beautiful bike.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.850
So this is a purchase
from ANU, actually.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.130
They hold a market at ANU
every Thursday in Union Court.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.770
So I picked up this beauty
last year for 100 dollars.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.330
And I named it Shaquille.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.650
'Cause it's big and brown.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.050
So yeah.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.970
Shaquille's helped me get around
Canberra for a bit over a year now.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.410
Great being close to uni.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.850
It's great when you have
to hand that assignment

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.890
in that's running a bit late,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.570
you don't have
to worry about parking.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.930
It's nice to get out in the fresh air

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.050
and just see other people
riding around.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.690
And that's refreshing
in the morning.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.890
I'm pretty spread out
across the campus.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.210
So I've got some lectures
in the law buildings,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.810
I've got some in the
Manning Clark just here.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.930
And I'm over in the Coombs building
on the other side of the uni as well,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.250
so, it's good having a bike
for that reason as well.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.770
You can get around uni easily.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.530
But it's good.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.130
They finish the lectures
five minutes early

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.370
and start them five minutes late, 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.130
so you always get in
between classes.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.090
And yeah, it's very easy
to work your way around.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.130
It's the Chifley library.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.970
So this is probably the main
library for the art students.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.970
It's between this
and I'd say Hancock,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.490
the science library,
they're the two busiest.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.450
It does get a bit difficult at times,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.450
Having to juggle between
having a girlfriend, boyfriend,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.690
or working all the time,
paying your way,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.170
and all the assessments.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.810
Generally, the assessments
are pretty well spaced out.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.330
I have an essay this week,
an essay that week.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.570
But this time of year, 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.290
the end of the year
it's a bit difficult.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.770
Exams are coming up and
everyone's stressing out a lot more.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.890
But generally, the university, 
the lecturers try and help you a lot.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.330
So, this is the café I work at,
called Ona.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.610
Yeah, I'm here every Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.450
From open to close.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.890
So that works out being
about 35 hours a week.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.250
Sometimes 40.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.130
Yeah, it's a really good
working environment

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.090
and I work with a whole
bunch of other students.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.890
So they understand that
when it comes to exam time,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.610
it gets a bit harder.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.490
End of a long day of lectures.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.050
So, it's Thursday afternoon.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.170
Everybody heads to the bar 
so let's check it out.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.330
And it's great, 
it's a good meeting place,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.890
so at the end of a week,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.290
everybody's done what they've done
on their uni work for the week,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.970
so the next step is
to head to the bar.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.410
As an undergrad, 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.170
going to the ANU,
and living in Canberra,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.210
it's, I couldn't picture it
being any other way.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.810
I've had such a great time here.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.810
I've learned so much.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.090
The courses are fantastic.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.010
I've made so many friends.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.090
Living in Canberra's fantastic.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.690
And for anyone that asks whether
or not they should go to the ANU,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.970
I would always say, "Yes."
