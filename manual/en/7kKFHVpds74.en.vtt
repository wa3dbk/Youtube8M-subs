00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This monster is the Century SM, Spodding Machine

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a seriously powerful application rod, with its 4.00lbs test curve, you're going to need about 4oz of weight to get this thing even moving and it will handle spods up to 8oz, so it is a very, very powerful rod

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The idea behind rods like this, is that if you were using a rod, a long distance rod, if you are using the FMA or an SP or something in the distance range

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's no good fishing at those sort of ranges if you can't get any bait out there at that range, so the idea with this being as powerful as this rod, is that you can get bait out at the same range you're planning on fishing at

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As we have touched on already, the autoclave process is going to really help to reduce the test curve decay 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And probably the spod rod, marker rods to a degree, but spod rods more than any other rod, are going to be more susceptible to test curve decay, like I said, it's going to be minimum of 4oz up to 8oz, repetitive casting, spod after spod, you know, most guys will put 20 spods over each rod 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Every one cast you make with one of your fishing rods, you're going to make 12 to 20 casts with this one, with probably twice as much weight

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the autoclave process really comes into it's own with this, as does the ATT, the Anti Twist Technology

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I can't think of a rod that needs to be more accurate than the Spod rod 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Once your rods are accurate, and they are clipped up and on the spotch, you need the bait which is synonomous with the Spodding approach

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You need a rod that's going to have no torsional load, and it's going to get your bait out in a straight line all the time and that's what the ATT is all about

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The build on the spodding machine, very simple, it is a rod that is designed to do a job 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The butt section is again very thick, very powerful, plenty to hold on to there and the abbreviated handle, your hand isn't going to slip with this one at all

00:02:35.000 --> 00:03:01.000
1k weave, minimal graphics, a little bit of duplon, Fuji 20mm reelseat, plain black whippings, and as we move down, 50mm Century SiC reelseats to compliment the Marker rod perfectly

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is a specifically designed tool to do a job and is probably better than any other spod rod on the market
