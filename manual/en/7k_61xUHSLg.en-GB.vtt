00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.999
One of the great things about EE TV is the
way it works with compatible phones and tablets.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:20.500
You can use either device as a touch control
for EE TV, watch recorded or live programmes,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.750
and even access replay around the house wherever
your wifi reaches. And its super easy to set

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.890
up, here’s how.
Firstly, you’ll need the EE TV app. If you’re

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.829
on an iPhone or iPad, you’ll find it in
the Apple App Store or if you’re using Android

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.659
it’s in the Google Play Store.
Once you’ve got the app on your phone or

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.749
tablet, you just need to link it to your EE
TV box. To do that, open the app

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:55.839
and you’ll see your EE TV box listed here.
If you’ve got more than one EE TV, it might

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.739
be hard to identify them. To work out which
is which, go to your EE TV and open status

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.340
in Tools and help.
You’ll see your MAC address here.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.400
Choose the matching address on your tablet.
That’s it-you’re paired.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.030
The app lets you use your device as a remote
control.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.530
To bring up the remote function, tap the remote
button in the top right corner of the screen.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.780
You move between your remote screens by tapping
on the icons at the top.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.810
Use the app to change channels, schedule recordings
and quickly enter words and numbers with the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.120
keyboard. The buttons all work in the same
way as your actual remote.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.421
The EE TV app means everyone in the family
can watch all around the house. In fact, you

00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:56.680
can watch wherever your wifi stretches.
Tap the left hand side of the screen to hide

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.600
the remote. Now you can control your box as
you would if the tv were in front of you.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.110
If you decide you’d like to stop watching
on your device, and start watching on the

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.200
telly, simply flick it across
and your show stops on the tablet and starts

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.370
on the big screen.
