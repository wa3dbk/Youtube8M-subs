00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.200
The Brazilian IT Market has been shown

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.500
a two digits grow for the last two years, 
and this year shall not be different.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.400
I am here with Luciano Corsini,
President of HP Brazil

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.900
to know his opinion about
how will this market develop.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.000
Luciano, what is your perspective for the Market this year?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Renato, thanks for the opportunity.
I also thank to Futurecom for us to have this talk.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.329
I agree with you.
The Technology Market

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.770
shall grow with a strengh of two digits this year

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.900
and based on what the institutes, 
who analyze the market, are projecting,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.000
not only for this year but also for 
the horizon of the next three years, it shall mantain.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.300
It may seem a paradox or counter intuitive
compared to what we are seeing

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.300
if compared with the political-economic
 scenario in Brazil for this and next years,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.800
specially considering that is
an Election and World Cup year.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.400
inflation pressure, rising interests rates

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600
GDP decrease pressuare, and so on...

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.500
But the Technology Market turns out
having alternative opportunities, even in a situation like this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.800
because other segments such as
Manufactures, Finances, Telco and all others

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.800
need to search opportunities

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.000
to reduce costs, optimization, automation,
process improvements, operations efficiency gains

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.500
and Technology has been and always will be

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.600
an argument in which the investments
allow the companies to be competitive,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.100
even in a political-economic pressure scenario
as we will be witnessing this year and next ones.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.000
That is why the Technology Market continues
 to have two digits strenght to keep growing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.600
What has HP done in the Telecommunications Market?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.300
HP has, probably, the biggest presence,
as Techonology company

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.000
in the worldwide telecommunication companies,
and it is not different in Brazil.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.800
We have a huge presence in infraestructure area:
Servers, Storage and Networking,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.200
and also in Applications with specific systems for
Telecommunications companies,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.000
whether it's Voice, Data, Wireline or Mobile.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.600
How is Cloud Computing impacting the business of HP?

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.800
The Cloud Computing impacts
in a very expressive way HP businesses,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.000
whether in the provision of infrastructure or services.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.400
In fact, Cloud Computing is part of 
a grand worldwide strategy of the company

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.900
and is based on four pillars:
Cloud, Big Data, Security and Mobility.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.500
and that meets what we call
the New Style of IT,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
And why?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Because large corporations have to adapt nowadays
to the situation of their users demands.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Increasingly, this is forcing the companies
to be prepared, to have more agility and mobility,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:23.500
allowing their users to have information available
anywhere, anytime and in any used device.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
This is forcing the IT areas to migrate

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.600
to that opportunities or solutions,
never losing sight of security of the environments.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.000
So, based on this overall strategy
and responding to your question,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.600
Cloud brings exactly the
flexibility, scalability,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.600
the chance for you to use
the infrastructure of technology not losing the security.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.600
However, not having to make greater investments, anymore,
in environments that had large idle stance.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.600
but making and elastic usage
according to the cloud availability.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.779
A lot of people has been talking about Big Data,
but what is really happening?

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.800
What is happening actually nowadays is that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.600
companies are still starting
to make use of these alternatives.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.200
Big Data is much more than to work data,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.300
In the end, basically, you need to collect data
for any source of information,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.800
whether structured or unstructured.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.000
There is a study that demonstrates
only 15% of the data are structured

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.500
coming from the famous Data Warehouse
or from common BI usage,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.800
but this is the data you already have
and is structured in your database.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.800
Big Data goes beyond that,
and you can collect data from

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.500
digital and analog media,
photo, video, text, social networking

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.100
by any means and for any type of information technology.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:11.800
The management and the availability of that data sum
as intelligence and as information

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.800
for the company to make use of it
in order to become more competitive,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.400
more agile and stay ahead of your competition,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.300
that is the big leap ahead from the usage of Big Data.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.000
I think that companies are still understanding how that works,
what are the business applications

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.500
and also the transformation 
of the entire processing of this large mass of data

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.800
and the availability in Near Real Time.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.500
In other words, what before took days, weeks or months

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500
ends up being released today,
by our solutions, in a few hours.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500
So, this possibility of having access to information

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.200
and make available so quickly,
causes companies to have greater agility

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.100
to react to this kind of information.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.520
I think this is growing,
but is still on a starting point, I would say...

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.600
Mobility brings many challenges to companies such as
the management of heterogeneous environments and safety.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.500
How to face this situation?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.200
HP has a complete suite of
security, management, and control software

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.200
Perhaps it is the most complete suite of 
control,  management and security software in the market

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.000
This ends up being a nightmare for
CIOs and infrastructure systems staff.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.500
We play a lot with it,
because in fact, there is a study that shows,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.300
about 10 or 15 years ago,
the perception of the use of technology in companies

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.300
was much more advanced than in our homes.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300
And this inverted over time.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.900
The perception that exists today your at your home

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.500
is that you have available
a more advanced technology than at the company.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300
So that pressure comes from outside to inside.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.300
But the CIO, the technology area, can never lose sight of

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:11.300
security, operational continuity, contingency 
and adaptability to company's funcionalities,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.300
the availability of these features
without harming the performance,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.300
so, in fact, 
our management, control, security software

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.900
and even the devices we offer to corporate users

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.300
allows the technology areas

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.900
to keep providing this flexibility

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.300
without losing the operational continuity and security.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.900
I talked with Luciano Corsini, President of HP Brazil.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.300
Thank you Luciano.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.700
Thank you Renato.
