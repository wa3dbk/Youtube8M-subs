best android racing games

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:10.540
These are the

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.559
best racing games available on Android and the Galaxy S4. First up

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.160
Pocket Rally, a game that's come on in leaps and bounds since it was first released

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.009
phenomenal graphics really fast gameplay
and they've tweaked things as they've been  going along

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.970
based on feedback from purchasers. Well worth  getting as you can see the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.640
gameplay is really nice and the cars handle beautifully. It feels like

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.990
rallying but in your pocket.best android racing games

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.750
At number 4 we have Need for Speed Most
Wanted probably one of the most wanted

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
racing games that you'll find on any platform on Android certainly on the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.630
Galaxy S4

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.750
it flies along

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.690
easily some of the best frame rates you'll see

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.940
phenomenal graphics best android racing games

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.520
and really solid gameplay

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.249
a little bit limited at times

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.950
but overall this is one of the best racing games you'll be able to buy

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.650
with the added bonus of no

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.940
inapp purchases

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.270
adverts or annoying nag screens

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.390
Need for Speed Most Wanted is a fantastic title.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.620
At Number 3 is Riptide GP

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.560
a faster game on water has never
been made in my opinion

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.330
with great graphics and this is some of the most beautiful water effects that you will

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.440
ever see in a computer game, let alone a mobile game. best android racing games

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.100
Fast furious action and even better it supports the Moga controller as well

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.340
so you can utilize this game just like you would a full console experience.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.780
Plug your Galaxy S4 into a television
set and off you go, absolutely fantastic.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.850
At Number 2 is Real Racing 3 the third part
of the Real Racing series from Electronic Arts it

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.270
really sets the bar high for what graphics on a mobile platform should look like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.009
and most certainly it is the most gorgeous
looking racing game that we've ever

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:55.900
played best android racing games

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.280
The gameplay is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.480
on par with that of Gran Turismo or Forza series although the inapp purchases do mar the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.119
experience somewhat it is nice that this is a free to play title.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.579
And our Number 1 racing game on Android and Galaxy S4 is Carmageddon maybe

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.569
not the most graphically beautiful game but 
certainly the game play is second to none.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.499
This is a remake as it were or port of the original title from 16

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:27.620
years ago now and it looks fantastic
it plays fantastic and you will not find

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.589
a game with more fun packed in for your couple of pounds

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:36.489
with tons of levels crazy cars and absolutely  bonkers power ups Carmageddon is our

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.379
Number One racing game. best android racing games
