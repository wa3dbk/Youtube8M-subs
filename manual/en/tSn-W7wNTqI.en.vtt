00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.640
I'm Marty Piazza and we're in the Surgical
Neurology branch of the National Institutes

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:33.360
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.449
So I'm looking kind of at a general disease
process that occurs in a lot of brain tumors.

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.410
I'm looking at edema which is a type of slowing
or fluid collection. It's associated with

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.269
tumors and looking for ways to combat that.
It's a major cause of morbidity and mortality

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.949
in brain tumors because it causes pressure
on the brain and since the brain is in an

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.530
enclosed space, you can have a lot of complications
with that and so it's a big issue to be addressed

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.420
especially since a lot of brain cancers aren't
curable.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.320
When I was younger I moved around a lot. My
dad is in finance. My mom was an English teacher.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.490
Around fourth grade I moved to this area in
the Washington DC area and spent a lot of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.869
time kind of in the shadow of NIH but I never
really got a chance to work here until now.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.770
I went to college in Princeton and I studied
chemistry there and that's kind of where I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.310
fell in love with the lab environment. I did
solid state physical chemistry which is very

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.609
different from the type of research I'm doing
now. But just that kind of mindset that you're

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.020
trying to find a question and answer it, that
no one else knows about it. It's really exciting

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.939
to be able to do that.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.719
So once I graduated from Princeton I went
to, I did a master's in biophysics and physiology

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:59.619
at Georgetown, just up the road from here
and that kind of solidified my desire to go

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.009
into a medical career path. And I went to
medical school, got involved in a lot of clinical

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.009
research but I was kind of wanting to get
back to that lab environment and so that's

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.750
kind of what led me to this program. So one
thing you don't really get exposed to unless

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.680
you kind of know where to look for this is
this ability to kind of answer questions that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.860
no one knows the answer to. And so that's
what's really exciting about medical science

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.400
because it's not, I mean there's so much that
we don't know about the human body and about

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.470
disease processes and what not and so the
only way to learn more about it is to participate

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.860
in the research that's going on. For me that's
what's the most exciting part about it is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.060
that no one else knows what I'm doing and
being able to not only execute the experiments

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.090
but being able to talk to other people who
know, who are knowledgeable about these disease

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.159
processes and kind of collaborate with them
and that's really exciting for me.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:58.569
Most of the work I do is looking at MRI scan
which is what we use to look at brain problems

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:07.450
and brain disease processes. And I also do
a lot of tissue preparation and staining for

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.720
different proteins that we see in brain tissue
in the microscope and I also along with those

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.239
goes a lot of pipetting and stuff like that
so it's, I get to do a lot of different things

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.680
and wear a lot of different hats which is
really exciting.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.489
Someone explained this to me when I first
got here and I think it's very true is that

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.049
medicine is all about, you have a disease
process and this is how you fix it. This is

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.610
what is known. This is how you do it. Whereas
research is very different. It's, this is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.329
how people â€“ this is what people think. We
want to disprove them and figure out another

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.689
way to fix the problem better. And so that's
kind of what, that's not a mindset that I

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.620
am used to and it's something that I'm learning
and I think it's really exciting that I actually

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.310
get to participate in that fixing of a problem.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.659
The best advice I would give is probably,
if you're interested in science get involved

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.290
in it early. There's a lot of opportunities
for high school students and college students

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.099
to be involved in research and a lot of people
don't know that. I didn't know about it. And

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.420
so further down my career path and I wish
in high school I had gotten more involved

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.549
in research and there's lot of opportunities
at NIH to do that as well and so that's, that'll

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:26.520
be probably the best advice I could give.
