You can create a host, access to a host or export a file

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.400
that you'll install via a USB stick to another PC.

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.277
But the starting point is always a Samsung PC.

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:22.274
If I now create a host, it's going to ask me "Shared Folders",

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:27.976
and there, you can select the folders you want to share, thanks to this software.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.386
And it gives me an authentification code.

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.301
This PC has become a host, and I'm going to access to it.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:51.701
The connexion is a bit like when using Bluetooth.

00:00:55.759 --> 00:01:09.340
It's going to show me an interface from which I can access to the distant computer.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.300
Now I can send or receive file with the WiFi.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:24.644
So it's ad-hoc.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:52.517
 I'm going to send that in C:.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:14.009
Here it is.
