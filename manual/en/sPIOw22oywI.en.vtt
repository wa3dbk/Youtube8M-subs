00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.710
regular my had a son

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.479
amo like I'm work

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.240
meet Potter are you coming

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.479
yes I'm not yes XK

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.479
them

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.749
T

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:47.020
do

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.680
oh my god does this have the imagining a
more dramatic life than the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.290
the the dedicated going on yeah it
starts out where he imagines

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.870
you know doing or saying things in a
much more a roadway or

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.020
do you imagine himself as a more road
figure is a mountain climber whatever

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.270
I you know it is these were quick little
moments but

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.300
and weird actions yeah how this is very
strange mystery

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.940
yeah that's very strange overdone CG
action scene with Adam Scott them

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.270
it somebody else RI the yeah

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.160
say okay I'm torn on this because the
debtor to shamelessly feel like ben

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.900
stiller's mid-life crisis maybe

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.960
record he stars in a he directed it and
you get to make himself has her like

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.820
figure

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.790
and do all the thrilling thing you know
it later on in life it's really be a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.760
heater craft

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.770
it is because shamelessly heart teggy

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.190
and Canada pandering kinda beating over
the head with the important to finding

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.300
yourself and what I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.910
well as weird about is the fact that II
when

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.120
you star in the movie The you have
written and directed and you give other

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.390
people dialogue about how awesome you
are

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.580
that's always creepy to me like that
just the the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.910
really hard for our I he at least Cole
Road right thing the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.459
that James Thurber wrote the rights
reserved

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.850
short story and hated the day k version
I did you like this gun

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.370
salaries dark yeah there is a dark
comment on the story

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.209
and it's not long enough to that's why
that but I mean you have a dedicated

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.430
added he hated AK and added the song to
song sinister rose on

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.790
so there's no musical component they
probably a little bit

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.570
with a low battery very heavy-handed
anything on track is very heavy-handed

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.320
the young singer but it's not unusual
but not okay I

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.760
the test is really impressive I mean
anything paper

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.360
right champagne and Kristen wearing
Shirley MacLaine and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.250
Patton Oswalt and Adam Scott than after
hard Kathryn Hahn I just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.200
I don't know I it the more you find out
that you know Walter

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.550
as a teenager was a slight champion
skateboarders other human brains that up

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.400
again and he can

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.920
skateboard through Iceland it's a cool
sequence that looks great with all the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.660
while I'm thinking

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.079
Ben Stiller is creating this movie about
how awesome Ben Stiller is about

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.010
everything anything either disconcerting

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.100
yeah I big-budget movie the whole so I
might as well use really pretentious

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.920
ass you know that the plotline love the
movie where he's missing this

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.560
picture and into the ham-fisted
symbolism that comes out by the end of

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.290
2014

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.660
actually is right I'm like it when he
had to find my car

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.660
yeah I did not I'll completely predict
where the picture I was all along

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.910
yaaaa just hit somebody famous for the
McLean as his mama sure everything was

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.800
Sean Penn as the photographer the
chasing after a individual moment I I

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360
have heard there were

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.639
swim in a much better much more
interesting movie I think

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.930
if it wasn't supposed to be Walter Mitty
he took out the fantasy sequences

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.040
hi I think that would have been a sh a
sharper more interesting movie

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.540
just getting my room just forget about
around like not she's not the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.880
but notice that many without water many
rite II you know I don't

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.380
I think it can loses the center what
walter mitty spot you know the

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.100
the water body story is you know
somewhat related to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.060
you can argue thematically it's about
what to write about about men women

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.830
lives a quiet desperation in this
fantasy life and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.680
and how in a modern society pigeon holes
people

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.840
and and you lose your sense of adventure
I think this movie

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.930
loses all that and

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.550
ignores that in favor of look awesome
Instagram yeah right now

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.600
didn't he didn't write it yeah yes to
cast who also wrote

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.990
oh yeah I'll it is our pursuit of
happiness him and the weatherman not

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.330
terribly subtle

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.770
movie yet but they are to men I newman's
Ultra II will see the who shot this

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.970
movie because it is boardroom table look
at

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.760
I am but yeah I just it became an
advertisement for Ben Stiller after why

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.250
would really got on my nerves and

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.070
am and I you know I could I buy
predicted story beats I found it too

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.660
up its own ass all ultimately I'll have
a problem I

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.450
think that the really high on that now
you are going on a five-point

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.040
type on 15 501 c is for

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.800
that's what I do I hand it's pretty
close to everybody else to do I want to

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.170
at work yeah on a on Rotten Tomatoes so
others the secret life of Walter Mitty
