Hi, this is Brandon with Shotgun,

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.134
and I'm excited to give you a tour of Shotgun for Games, let's take a look.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.466
Shotgun helps you to track all your Projects,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.366
which are comprised of things like Assets, Levels, and the work that needs to be done to complete them.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.033
Here are a list of assets being built for my game.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.066
Clicking one will show its details on the right.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.266
The overview shows me all the activity happening on this task like status updates or notes given from review.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Tasks help organize the work that needs to be done,

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:34.966
and can quickly make assignments or change the schedule.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.366
Versions track the media that artist submit for review.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.633
Clicking the "Play" icon, let me view the media right in the browser.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.999
I can even see the levels in which this asset appears.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:49.933
These connections go both ways.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.767
So in viewing the details for a level,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.466
I can see a list of all the assets appearing in that level.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.899
Back on the "Assets" page.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.366
In list view, I can see a live spreadsheet of everything being built for the game.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.433
These views have been built with producers in mind,

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:09.499
and include powerful features like filtering and layout customization.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.933
By helping producers get their information out of spreadsheets and into Shotgun,

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:18.300
the entire team has access to this important live production information.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:23.333
Artists have their own set of tools to help them stay organized and keep track of their feedback.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:27.999
The "Inbox" shows me all the activity across my tasks and the things that I follow.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.933
I can follow people, assets and tasks.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:35.633
They get notified when somebody else finishes their work so that I can start on mine.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.300
In my tasks, I can see a list of everything assigned to me.

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:42.333
When I click on the texturing task for this asset that I'm working on,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:48.599
it shows all the details about that task including things like notes and versions I've submitted.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.933
I can also launch straight into the programs that used to do my work.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:55.299
For this texturing task, I've launched into Photoshop.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:02:00.133
A series of apps loaded inside allowed me to pick up where I left off,

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:05.533
make my changes, and publish my work when I'm done.

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.699
Because Shotgun knows the name of the task and asset I'm working on, it handles all the naming.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:14.933
It puts my work in the right location on disk or a source repository like Perforce.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:19.133
This saves artists valuable time, and lets them focus their energy on the art.

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.333
In addition to Photoshop,

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:27.966
we also support out-of-the-box integrations with Maya, MotionBuilder, 3d Studio Max and many more.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.599
Meanwhile supervisors following their artists will receive notifications in their Inbox when new work is ready for review,

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:39.333
play media, annotate frames, and send notes directly back to the artist.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:45.199
Since all this happens within the browser it's easy for teams to give and receive feedback no matter where they are.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:50.433
Artists will receive that feedback in their inbox and then get back to work on the next iteration.

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:53.833
