00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.860
How to Make a Classic New York Cheesecake.
Cheesecake was once served as an offering

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.590
to Roman gods. This heavenly dessert is now
available to anyone! You will need 1/4 c.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.960
plus 2 tbsp. melted butter, divided 1 c. graham
cracker crumbs 1/2 c. sugar, divided 3 large

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:34.870
eggs 1 1/2 c. sour cream 2 tsp. vanilla extract
16 oz. full-fat cream cheese A 9-inch springform

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:43.890
pan Small and medium mixing bowls A hand mixer
and a cooling rack. Step 1. Heat the oven

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.730
to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and grease the bottom
of the pan with 1 tablespoon of melted butter.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.719
Set aside. Step 2. Combine the graham cracker
crumbs, 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.809
of sugar in a small bowl with the large fork.
Mix until the crumbs are coated with butter.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.811
Step 3. Empty the contents into the prepared
pan and push down firmly on the base. Use

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:14.090
your fingers, or the back of a fork, to form
a solid crust. Step 4. In a medium bowl, blend

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.960
the eggs, sour cream, and vanilla on medium
speed with the hand mixer. Add the cream cheese,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.860
Â¼ cup of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of butter.
Mix on low speed until combined. Using cream

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.420
cheese at room temperature will make it easier
to blend. Step 5. Pour the cheesecake filling

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.409
over the graham cracker crust and spread evenly
across the pan. Step 6. Bake the cheesecake

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.619
for 50 minutes to an hour, then broil for
five to eight minutes, or until the top begins

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.649
to brown. The cheesecake is done when the
center jiggles slightly. Step 7. Remove the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.330
pan from the oven and set on a cooling rack
for 10 to 15 minutes before refrigerating

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.259
it. Leave it to cool and set for at least
three to four hours, or overnight for the

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.930
best flavor and texture. Did you know Authentic
New York Cheesecake is served without any

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.360
toppings.
