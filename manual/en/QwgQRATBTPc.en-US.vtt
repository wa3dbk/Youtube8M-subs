00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:09.714
Hi girls! In this video, I will show you the must have nail art tools

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.600
For beginners or for those who want to update their tools.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.942
Since there are many nail art shops.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.228
And regularly new products.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.220
You're pretty much spoilt for choice.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.457
So here's what's you need to start with nail art.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:28.142
So first of all, to apply nail polish, you'll need

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.171
Obviously nail polish but a base and a top coat.

00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:34.170
It's pretty much important.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.200
These two are from Poshé. I use them all the time.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.171
I love them. The base helps to harden my nails.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.571
They will help to protect your nails and your designs.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.485
You'll also need wooden sticks or toothpicks

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.542
To clean when you overflow with your nail polish.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.457
They will help you to clean the excess.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.485
Don't forget to buy pure acetone

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.971
and a nail polish remover from your drugstore.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.657
And a flat brush to clean correctly your nail polish.

00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:08.650
If you want to see how to apply a nail polish on your nail,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.200
Just follow the click of this video.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.771
I really advise you to buy a sponge

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.371
to make fashionable gradients on your nail.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.228
It doesn't take much time to do with pratice.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.714
If you don't have to buy them,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.028
you may use those that from parcels or even from an old mattress.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.571
But since it is quite aerated, it will make small blotchy patches on your nails.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.942
For a perfect gradient, you'll need to buy

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.000
latex sponge use for makeups.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.342
You may find them in makeup shops like Sephora

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.340
but they might be quite expensive.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.657
Otherwise, you may buy them from Réserve Naturelle, from Chinese shops

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.942
and even from hairdressers' wholesaler.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.657
I've bought these at 1,50 € and I'll be using them for quite a long time.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.514
They are great.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:13.657
For those who want to make advanced nail art,

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:15.650
You will need brushes.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.771
If you need brushes to make some practices

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.057
Just buy a set of brushes like this one.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.057
They are available on online nail art shops.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.742
Even at lower prices on Ebay or Amazon.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.400
They will cost you about 10 €, you won't go bankrupt.

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:37.542
It contains about 15 brushes.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.485
It is a complete set with a liner brush, a dotting tool,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.742
a fan brush, a square brush and many others.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.857
They are quite good even though they are made with synthetic hairs.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.028
But they really worth it.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.657
I still use them.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.371
The only thing is that the detail brush is a kind too thick.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.057
So, if you really want to make detailed designs,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.314
You will have to buy good quality brushes.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.371
The first one is the Tartofraise brush. It is a thin and short hair brush.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.685
I use it almost all the time to draw spirals, arabesques and others.

00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:22.428
For those who want to make one stroke designs

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.000
You will need the EF Exclusive brush.

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:28.514
It is a square brush.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.542
I use it almost all the time.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.628
I've tested many square brushes, many of them suit.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.457
The square brush from the set is good too.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.685
And you'll see, with time and practice,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.628
You'll have your own preferences for the brushes.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.142
But for the one stroke, the brush from this set will suit.

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:50.885
If you want to have the references of the brushes I've mentioned,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.114
Refer to the video's description.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.085
Many of you ask me about my favorite paint brand.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.885
I haven't tested them all

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.742
But I really love the Jo Sonja's paint.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:04.740
They are available in small and big size.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.885
Since I love this brand, I've never tried the other brands.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.542
But there are many other good brands

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.542
like the EF Exclusive paints.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.028
And even the Polycolor paint.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.914
If you use these brands, you got it right.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.342
In addition, contrary to what people think,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.771
You should never start your training with poor quality tools.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.114
If you do so, you won't learn the reasons why the paints are unsuitable

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.828
why they don't work or why they slip.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.057
You should use good quality products!

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.485
And if you want to make a test, buy only the needed colors.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.885
I really recommend good quality paint and brushes.

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.228
And if you want to train yourself,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.857
Since you cannot make a new design on your nail every day,

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:57.850
Here are some solutions.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.685
You may use these practice wheels.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.028
They are easily available online and from hairdressers' wholesaler.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.800
They are quite good but the only thing is that you can only use it once.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.457
I use them as a nail art display.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.285
You may also find these fake nails online.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.571
The size 0 is the biggest.

00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.570
And the size 9, is the smallest one.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.857
You may train yourself on these.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.371
They are easily found and are cheap.

00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.370
They are useful.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.685
In the beginning I use to train myself on my nails.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.057
But this tends to make your nails become weak.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.514
So, prefer fake nails for training.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.971
And finally, let's talk about the rhinestones, glitters,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.914
even scotch tape, just like in this video.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.400
You can make cool designs with it.

00:05:55.657 --> 00:05:59.600
Here are some of my liner brushes.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.257
They have their own containers.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.257
And are from Artclub.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.828
I love them! They have thin hairs and take time to dry.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.342
With a liner brush you can do many designs.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.371
Here's an example in this video.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.200
I hope that this video has been useful to you.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.428
See you soon for surprise on Youtube! Bye!
