00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.580
The shuffle and swing rhythm is based on the
8-note triplet.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.350
So the 8-note triplet is played tri-pl-et
tri-pl-et tri-pl-et.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.299
This rhythm is really popular in American
music in particular.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.960
We hear it a lot in the music of the south,
rockabilly, country, blues especially.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.030
We hear it in music from Chicago, specifically
blues.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.530
We hear it from Elvis and rockabilly, Chuck
Berry.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.050
The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Cream, The Rolling
Stones.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.550
These guys were all imitating the same blues
sound, so you get this same rhythm, this infectious

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
shuffle.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.660
I like to think about playing the shuffle
rhythm like a drummer plays a ride cymbal.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.399
We have the quarter note, and then we have
the pickup beat.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.149
But we hear the pickup beat as a sort of kickoff
into the next chord.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.000
So instead of thinking about it like tri-pl-et
tri-pl-et tri-pl-et tri-pl-et, but stopping

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.280
them each time.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.150
We think about it as like let-tri-pl let-tri-pl
let-tri-pl, and that last 8th note pushes

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.630
into the next chord.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:20.149
So the idea is that you can play maybe down
a pentatonic E-scale and you can play.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.179
Something like that; something as simple as
that to get used to playing that sound.

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.469
Now the trick is, as a bass player, sometimes
we'll only be playing in the quarter note.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.100
Maybes it's the drummer's job, or maybe it's
the guitar player, or someone else to really

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.859
be playing those pushoffs into the next beat.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.229
So one trick is to even have that be audible;
even have the shuffle be audible, when you're

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.740
playing just quarter notes.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.810
You really need have to internalized the beat.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.919
You really need to be able to feel the shuffle
deep inside.

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:58.759
Once you have that internalized, you can hear
it even if you're not really subdividing the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:13.330
beat as a shuffle.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.480
And that's how you play the shuffle and swing
rhythm on the bass guitar.
