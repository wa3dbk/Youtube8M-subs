Hi, I'm Jay French from jayfrenchstudios.com,
and I'm going to teach you how to draw a rose

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.050
and stem. When you're drawing this, of course,
you're going to do a rosebud, so get a basic

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.980
shape in. You want an oval for where your
bud's going to be, and a crooked line for

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.930
your stem. The bottom of a rose where it meets
the stem is, essentially, a starburst. If

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.460
you were looking...if you were to cut the
rose off right at the stem -- cut the stem

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.860
completely off -- and look at it from the
bottom, you would actually see a starburst

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:43.720
 -- something like this: long, thin leaves.
So with that in mind, just do...of course,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.040
we're going to be looking at it from the side,
so you just get a couple of them in there,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.550
and maybe one foreshortened to show that there
are more. Now, for your rosebud, and of course,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:04.600
this is your main part, you want to do -- following
your general oval shape -- basically, a teardrop

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.680
shape that is a little curved and a little
angled. Get another one in that's underneath

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:22.420
that. From there, you can make a curved one,
another curved one, until you have an entire

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:34.530
rosebud. Get some shading in there.
Or if you're doing it in color, you'll add

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.150
your color at that point. You noticed I added
extra lines to show the curvature of each

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.560
of those pedals. And your stem's just a basic
shape with little crooks to it because natural

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:02.880
roses and in the wild and nature always have
that crookedness to it. Add some thorns,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.349
which are always angled upward and are always
curved. If you go into shading them, they're

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:24.519
always darker on the tips as well. Add some
leaves. Roses have notches on their leaves.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:36.029
Shade as you see fit. You notice I have them
kind of curving. Get some vein lines in there.

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:42.670
And there you have a basic lesson on how to
draw a rose and stem.
