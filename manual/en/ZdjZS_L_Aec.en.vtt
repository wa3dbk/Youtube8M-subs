00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.740
What a great salvation is ours.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.919
That you would take away all our condemnation

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.650
and lay it upon your Son.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.650
That He would die once and for all, for the
sins of His people.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.609
That He would expiate our sin, that He would
carry it outside the gates of the city,

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.230
so that it would be ours no more.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.640
That you have taken our sins

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.100
and you have removed them as far from us as
the east is from the west.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.799
That Father, we stand before you, clothed
in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:49.500
We are not boasting in our own righteousness,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.909
but we are boasting in what you have done
for us.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.140
And we accept is; and we rejoice in it;

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.920
and we stand in it.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.339
And Lord, we thank you for the work of regeneration,
whereby you changed us.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.049
You took out our heart that hated you, and
replaced it with a heart that loves you.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.750
You took out our heart that loved sin and
hated righteousness,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.420
and you replaced it with a new heart recreated
in your image

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.960
in true righteousness and true holiness.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.159
And we thank you Lord, that we no longer belong
to the kingdom of darkness,

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.299
but we have been translated into the kingdom
of your dear Son!

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.299
And we so appreciate, dear God

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.960
that we no longer are slaves to sin,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.960
but can offer the members of our bodies as
slaves to righteousness.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:00.500
And that we have victory, even over sin, even
over the Devil, even over this fallen world.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.950
Not by our own hand, but by the power, and
the glory and the honor,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.729
and the greatness of Jesus Christ.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.890
And we stand in this inheritance that you
have given us.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.890
And Lord, we will not allow anyone to rob
us of this great gift, or take away our joy.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.680
Be glorified, Lord, in your people, and let
your people know that they are loved;

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.130
they are forgiven, they are changed, and they
are being changed from glory to glory.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.830
And that one day they will stand before you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.890
without spot, and without blemish.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.700
And oh, God, the one who has the smallest
repentance,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.510
the one who has the smallest faith, let them
come

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.440
and drink of that fountain freely!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.440
Oh, God, there may be people here this morning
who are saying,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.860
“But is this for me? Is this for me?”

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.470
Oh dear friend, do you want it? Do you desire
it?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.850
Then come!

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.900
Are you thirsty?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.820
Come!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.350
Are you hungry? Come! And drink freely, eat
without cost!

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:31.000
Oh, God, that salvation may visit many, many
households.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In Jesus’ name amen.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.980
I don’t care who you are, I don’t care
what you’ve done,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.830
Jesus Christ is a mighty Saviour.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:50.080
There is an old, Calvinistic hymn that says
the following:

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.960
“Sinner, do not wait until you think you're ready,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.580
or till you think that you are repentant enough,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.060
or till you think that you believe enough.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.550
Because if you wait until you are ready, you
will never come at all.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.580
Are you sitting there right now, thinking,
“I’m lost, I’m lost.”

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.990
How do you know that?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.230
Sinners do not know that.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.709
Wicked hardened hearts do not know that they
are lost.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.280
But if you truly know you’re lost, that’s evidence of a work of God!

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.759
You say, “Oh, I desire to be saved!”

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.900
You do?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.129
Where do you think that desire comes from?

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.020
It comes from Him!

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.520
So come to Him!

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.199
Believe in Him!

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.020
Throw yourself upon Him!

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960
Cry out to Him! “Oh God save me!”

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.869
And He will be mighty to save. He is a great
Saviour.
