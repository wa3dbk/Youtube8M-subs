"How to Do Face Painting:
Dalmation

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.759
So now we're going to learn how to do a dalmation.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.070
This can also just be a simple dog.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.980
To start we're going to sponge on white.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.230
Kind of whisp up some fur in the middle.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.499
And then make about a little bit of a triangular
shape.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.200
Make his ears.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.390
Now that you've added the white I like to
add the tongue so that it has a little time

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.040
to dry.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:06.170
All doggies need a tongue.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.560
Do a teardrop in the tongue.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.140
Add some fur.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:02:03.429
What we're going to do for the ears is just
do a teardrop up on his ears.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.859
Black dot, couple of black dots.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.410
We're going to just rim his eye using his
eyebrow as a guide.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:21.180
Just kind of do a big squiggly outline circle.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.400
And that is how to do a Dalmatian or a simple
dog."
