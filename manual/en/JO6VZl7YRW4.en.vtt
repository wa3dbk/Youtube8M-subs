00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.149
Hi. On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Gnobo
A. Calypso, also known as Bryce. And, I'm

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.610
here to tell you about astrology. Okay. Now's
the fun part. We're going to discuss some

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.050
characteristics and traits of the twelve astrological
signs. The first one that begins the cycle

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:30.230
of the Sun going through the different astrological
signs is usually happens at the Equinox, and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:40.120
that's when Aries comes in. Aries is symbolized
by the Ram. Aries is also symbolized by the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:52.380
planet Mars. And, Aries becomes a very masculine,
fiery vibration. Most Aries people will war

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.550
for an ideal. They'll war for a purpose. But,
mostly Aries people will war for the underdog.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.140
They'll war for the right of the underdog.
Aries people are usually very self-centered.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.299
Everything revolves around an Aries person
from the time that they get up to the time

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.789
they go to bed. They become very masculine
about this, be it male or female, masculine

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.490
actually means to be very expansive and extroverted.
So, Aries people are very extroverted. But,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.869
it is, it does become about the Aries until
it involves an underdog or an ideal. Like

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.830
an Aries will fight tooth and nail to the
nitty gritty if he or she feels as if something

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.079
is not right or if justice has been thwarted.
An Aries person because it's Mars which is

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:58.819
a very warring energy will commit war very
quickly. Aries people also tend to be quite

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:08.209
promiscuous. And, they don't, they don't usually
offer a very stable relationship. Hopefully,

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.910
they're Sun sign is enhanced by a good Moon
sign that can mellow that out some or by an

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.900
Ascendant. But, if they have an Ascendant
like in Scorpio, it would be really hard to

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.270
keep this Aries person down.
