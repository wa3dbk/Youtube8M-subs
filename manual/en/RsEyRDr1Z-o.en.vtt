Hi, it's Binky from Made In Chelsea, and welcome
back to my series of Binky's Boutique with

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.389
Videojug.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.090
In this week's episode I'm going to show you
how to do modernized 60s eye makeup.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.220
I'm now going to use the Daniel Sandler Eyeshadow
Palette, and it's called eyeshadow quad, and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.310
I'm going to be using this light pale color.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.970
With my brush I'm going to brush it over my
eyelid.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
It doesn't have to be too thick.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.980
White eyeshadow is really iconic for the 60s
look, so that's why we're using it first.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.930
Next I'm going to be using this Clarins liquid
eyeliner.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.199
I'm not going to use too much, I'm going to
literally just rest it above the eye line

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.350
and make a little graphic sweep across.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.230
I'm not taking the flick too much out of the
eye line.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.080
So I've taken an angled brush, and I'm going
to use the darkest color, and I'm going to

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.440
go along the socket of my eye, start from
about there, and just take it down.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.870
As you can see, it does take a little bit
of practice.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.830
It's quite a difficult look to try and get,
but it is a great look when you've mastered

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.900
it.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.660
Just join it along your lash line like this
as well, and join the eyes together.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:38.210
I'm going to use the darker shade again, and
draw two little lashes, one right here,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.210
and one there.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.510
I'm going to be using the Guerlain concealer
pen now under the eyes because it will clear

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.580
up any of the black marks you might have got
while trying to put this on a hundred times.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.120
It brightens the eye and takes any redness
away.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.400
I'm going to be using the blackout mascara
to do loads of lashings on your lashes.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.080
You can't have too much mascara for the 60s
look, so layer upon layer upon layer to get

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.990
like a really false, thick lash effect.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.150
It does really contrast well with the white
eyeshadow and the black line behind.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.241
It's really good to let this mascara set for
a bit and then add more layers, because that

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:22.489
means they're thicker lashes, and that's what
we're going for.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.019
I'm going to finish this look off with a really
pinky, pretty gloss lip.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.209
This gloss is from Clarins

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.379
and it's got a lovely high shine and a really
good smell.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.659
I absolutely love this look and I really hope
you do to.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.280

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.690
I'll be back next Friday doing a really pretty
spring summer makeup look.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.780
I'll see you then, bye bye!
