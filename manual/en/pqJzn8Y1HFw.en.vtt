00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.100
Hi. Itâ€™s Mr. Andersen. And this is AP Physics
essentials video 100. It is on transverse

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.369
and longitudinal waves. And this is the Kola
Superdeep Borehole. It is a covering over

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.609
the deepest hole that humans have ever dug.
The Soviets did this in the 1970s. They got

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.640
around 40,000 feet below the surface of the
earth. It got incredibly hot. They could not

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.509
keep drilling but it is really deep. If we
were to look at the earth however that is

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.500
barely scratching the crust. And so you might
think to yourself, how do we know what the

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.390
inside of the earth looks like if we have
only been able to dig and little bit into

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.309
the crust. Well it is thanks to waves. Seismic
waves, waves produced through earthquakes.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.949
Some of those are transverse waves. Those
are waves where the oscillation is perpendicular

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.070
to the motion of the wave. And those ones,
like all waves, cannot make it through the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.129
solid inner core but also cannot make it through
this liquid outer core. But the longitudinal

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.670
waves where their oscillation is in the direction
of the motion can still move their way through.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.240
So we are looking at those waves on the other
side of the earth to figure what the inside

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.500
of the earth looks like. And so waves are
simply ways to transfer energy through disturbances

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.430
or through oscillations. And they come in
two forms. We have longitudinal waves. That

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.780
is where the oscillation is in the same direction
or parallel to the propagation or the movement

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.310
of the wave itself. We also have transverse
waves. And transverse waves, the motion in

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.640
this case would be left to right, but the
oscillation is going to be perpendicular to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.910
that. And so all of these can be mechanical
waves. Mechanical waves, like the seismic

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.840
waves in the earth require a medium. They
require something to go through. And they

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.390
could be longitudinal or transverse. However
electromagnetic waves, like the light that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.030
you are receiving right now is only formed
in transverse waves. It does not require a

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.820
medium for it to move through. It can move
through a medium like right now it is moving

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.320
through the air inside your room. An interesting
characteristic of transverse waves is they

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.509
can be polarized. And so we can use thin slits
to only let certain transverse waves through.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.110
And so energy can be moved from point A to
point B in two ways. It could be a particle

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.550
that we simply fire a particle from A to B.
And we could move B. But we could also use,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.590
in this case, a medium and at point A we could
make oscillations which would generate waves

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.810
if B is a piece of paper on that it would
float and move away. So we are transferring

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.340
energy from one point to another but there
is no particle that makes it there. Remember

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.950
that those waves can be either mechanical,
so the waves we would find in an ocean or

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.690
the waves of sound are all mechanical waves.
But we can also have electromagnetic waves.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.290
And those electromagnetic waves can move through
no medium. They can move through space where

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.520
there is nothing. And so if you were to really
see an explosion in space, you would not hear

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.990
it because there is no medium for those mechanical
sound waves to reach you. But you would definitely

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.209
be able to see it. And so the two types of
waves are longitudinal. Longitudinal are waves

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.160
where the oscillation or the disturbance is
in the direction that the wave is moving.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.130
So you can see in this first animation that
we have the wave moving from left to right

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.970
and we also have the oscillations moving from
left to right. An example of this could be

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.569
a pressure wave. An example of that could
be like the sound waves that you are hearing

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.800
right now. I am vibrating the air which is
vibrating this microphone which is vibrating

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.849
your speaker which is vibrating the air near
you and then you can hear that. But everything

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.560
is in the same direction. If we were to look
at this simbucket simulation down below the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.430
green particles, as they move back and forth
is transferring energy from left to right.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.370
That is represented by the dotted line right
here. But you can see that the particles are

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.400
moving in the direction that the wave is actually
moving it. And so that is a longitudinal wave.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.349
What does a transverse wave look like? Well
I always think of the T in transverse. It

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.630
tells me that it is going to be perpendicular
to the motion. So if we were to do the same

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.500
kind of an animation, right here again, the
propagation or the movement of the wave is

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.790
from left to right but you can see that the
oscillation is up and down. An example of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.739
this could be a rope wave. If you attach a
rope to a wall and just simply oscillate it

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.569
or light could be an example of that. If we
look at simbucket simulation down below, this

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.490
time we have a rope wave. It is going from
left to right, but know where the oscillation

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.409
is. The oscillation is up and down. Another
interesting thing is that the rope is not

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.840
moving, it is the energy that is moving from
one spot to another. It is not like the air

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.889
moves, it is the energy moves through the
air itself. And so one interesting thing about

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.949
transverse waves is that they can come in
many different directions and since it is

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.139
perpendicular to the motion we can have a
grid or a slit or some kind of a filter here

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.509
that will only let transverse waves that are
going in one direction through. And so polarized

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:04.300
sunglasses work like that. This is an image
where we have no polarizer on the bottom.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.669
And so we are getting light in all directions.
But then when we are using a polarizing lens

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.669
at the top then you can see the photographer
on the inside because light is only coming

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.509
out through the car itself. And so did you
learn to use visual representations of longitudinal

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.139
and transverse waves? Have you learned how
to use a model to study them? And then in

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:29.279
AP Physics II, do you understand the importance
or polarizing as a way to limit only a certain

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:36.279
direction of transverse waves moving through?
I hope so. And I hope that was helpful.
