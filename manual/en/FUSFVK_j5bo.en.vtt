00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.610
Welcome to Tundra Restaurant Supply.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:14.200
In this episode, we're going to show you how
to add or replace casters to your equipment.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.810
So casters come in all different sizes and
varieties.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.509
Unfortunately they're not necessarily all
compatible with all brands,

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.270
So what you're going to want to do is try
and identify

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.269
What kind of model number you have of your
equipment,

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.130
Or you can measure the whole centers on your
existing casters.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.689
Today's demonstration we're using our Frymaster
Fryer.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.379
You can locate the model number on the inside
panel of the door

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.829
Or you can check our other video, "Hot to
locate model numbers on your equipment."

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.219
If it's in a tricky spot you can always get
an extendable flashlight to get to those hard

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830
to reach areas.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.220
Currently we're measuring the centered holes
of our existing legs or casters.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.829
In this case, I've started the center of this
screw on 1"

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.760
Just because it's a little bit difficult to
get to the edge of the tip of the measuring

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
tape.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.429
You can also notice that it gets all the way
over to 2-3/4".

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.590
Minus the 1", the distance of these two centers
is 1-3/4 inches.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.500
You'll want to do the same thing for the opposing
direction as well.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.940
Here we can notice it's 3 inches.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.000
You can either search by your model number
on the piece of equipment,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.430
Or you can certainly put in the dimensions
of your hole centers.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.380
Also be sure that when you're searching for
replacement casters

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.310
That you look for a caster that has a wheel
diameter large enough

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.610
To be able to put your equipment's bottom
edge approximately 6 inches off the ground.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.490
Also be sure that before you do any kind of
repairs or move any of your equipment

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.690
That everything is turned off, disconnected,
drained,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.560
And cool before you start doing any work on
it.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.260
Also keep in mind as your replacing your casters,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.870
You might want to have some wedges to be able
to balance your equipment upright

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.840
While you replace your casters or legs.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.030
Or have an equipment dolly or a second hand

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.360
To be able to stabilize the piece of equipment
while you're working on the casters.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.030
That's how you identify and install replacement
casters for your equipment.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.640
Surely at times it might be easier to lay
your equipment on its side

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.420
To do its replacement maintenance.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.870
However, be sure that if you're working on
a piece of equipment with a compressor,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.989
That you wait a full 24 hours once you place
it back upright

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.590
Before you plug it in to allow the fluids
to get back into the compressor.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.510
I'm Chris for Tundra Restaurant Supply.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.489
Join us again next time.
