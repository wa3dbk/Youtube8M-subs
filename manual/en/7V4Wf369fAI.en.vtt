00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.330
thrill quick before we get the
voicemails meal armstrong passed away at

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.370
inch eighty-two over the weekend the
first person to walk on the moon unknown

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.849
test pilot before of being an astronaut
n_b_c_ news was the first two reported

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.469
but they reported that

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.499
astronaut neil young

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.970
had passed away now of course

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.689
rocker neil young

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.429
is perfectly alive kind of a weird thing
to report interesting thing about neil

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.669
armstrong's of course the entire
controversy over there's one step that's

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.300
once popup what we are ten that's one
small step for man one giant leap

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.460
for mankind apparently

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.990
the actual uh... comment was supposed to
be beds one small step for a man one

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.009
giant leap for mankind because saying
that's one small step for man

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.410
is kind of the same as mankind in
incrementally it made sense

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.080
interesting after as having very good
grammatical sense here is the actual

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.090
idea what he said

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.390
eventually armstrong did say

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.160
sounds like i didn't really say i meant

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.060
i messed it up i for got the word let's
take a listen

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.050
graham program

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.510
family hopeless until march and their is
a bit of static

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.650
where you would hear

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.430
which was kind of what you armstrong and
many others were pointing to for many

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.560
years eventually saying

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.090
acted out of work

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.750
graham program

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.180
that little static right when he says
the man who were maybe there was a

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.510
nightmare what do you think that time

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.960
yeah i think it's possible that there
was enough but you can weigh uh...

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.830
the act was more important than uh...
the neustine are

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.470
battle

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.360
so uh... api condolences that everybody
involved that was very sorry to hear

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.490
about is passing but very interesting
guy course we accomplished incredible

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.900
yeah

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.690
no one else to say that there is a first
man in the mood to me

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.770
and many people say he still can't see
it because they think it was staged but

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.060
that's a story for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730
as shown in spirit if there is u_s_
