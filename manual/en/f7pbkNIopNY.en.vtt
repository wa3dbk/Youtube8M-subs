00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.270
While Ernests Gulbis was busy making headlines
in Delray Beach, we were compiling the latest

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.190
and greatest stories from around the tennis
world.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
Hey Tennis Fans, I’m Blair Henley and welcome
to the Tennis Now News Update.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.700
The 24-year-old Latvian was once believed
to be the next big thing, reaching a career

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.380
high ranking of 21 back in 2011, but Gulbis
hasn’t exactly been a model of motivation

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380
and self-discipline.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.730
Of course, that was then…and this is now.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.531
Here’s what he had to say this week:
Quote “I was really getting pissed to see

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:40.059
who's in the top 100.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.420
There are some guys who—I don't know who
they are.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.250
Some guys, I'm sorry, with respect—they
can't play tennis.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.629
I don't know how they got into the top 100.”

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.179
So now that Gulbis is fired up to beat all
the no-names in the top 100 who can’t play

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.230
tennis, he has successfully advanced to his
first quarterfinal of the year in Delray,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.350
beating Sam Querrey Thursday in a third set
tiebreak after the American, who is already

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.830
in the running for the most uninspiring player
on the ATP tour, double-faulted away the last

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.340
two points of the match.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.750
Gulbis kept things exciting, not only showing
fans how to properly break a racquet, but

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.090
also how to hit a technically bizarre forehand
that somehow seems to work.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.250
To each his own, as they say.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.759
John Isner and Tommy Haas have also advanced
to the quarterfinals in South Florida.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.540
Rafa Nadal and David Ferrer are one step closer
to meeting in a much anticipated final in

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.100
Acapulco, but Nadal will have to squeeze by
countryman, Nicolas Almagro, first.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.911
Ranked No. 12, Almagro will be Rafa’s first
run-in with a top 15 opponent since his return.

00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:36.911
The semis in Dubai are also set, with Federer
pitted against Berdych, and Djokovic taking

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.911
on Del Potro.

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.480
Maria Sharapova turned some heads off the
court at the post-Oscars Vanity Fair party

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.590
in Los Angeles last Sunday, and everyone seems
to agree that she looked stunning.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.460
And there is one thing we know for sure…she
looked better than she did at last year’s

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.549
Vanity Fair party.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.549
Fun fact?

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.420
Sharapova is a card-carrying member of the
Screen Actors Guild.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.430
On Oscar day she tweeted: “Four hours of
training in the morning, a baby birthday stop

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.340
by and now the Vanity Fair party.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.149
I've seen it all today!”

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.950
Finally, Rafa Nadal gave us some more of his
thoughts on the doping topic, agreeing with

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.640
Roger Federer that positive tests should immediately
be made public.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.740
Currently positive tests are only announced
if the player is deemed guilty by an anti-doping

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.740
tribunal.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.760
Given that the ITF has reported around 54
positive tests, but only 22 anti-doping rule

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.150
violations since 2007, we’d say a little
more transparency is probably a good thing.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.530
That’s all for today’s Tennis Now News
update!

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.530
What do you think of Gulbis?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.050
Did you like Maria’s dress?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.600
Do you think positive tests should be announced
immediately?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.000
Let us know your thoughts in the comment section
