00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.440
Reverse single crochet is a great way to finish
off any garment whether it's a crochet garment

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:17.880
or knit garment. So, just for review, crochet
stitch is work from right to left

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.600
and you're going into the stitch in front
of you. Reverse single crochet, you're going

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.280
backwards into the stitch you just made. So,
you go into the stitch, wrap the yarn, bring

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.969
it through. You got two loops in the hook.
You have to twist your hook around and then

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:48.809
slip the yarn through those two loops. So,
you go through the next stitch to your right.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.180
Bring a loop through. Twist the hook over
under and around and draw the yard through.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.219
Go again to the right. Draw your yarn through
two loops twist it under and draw the yarn

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:15.029
through. So, you can see I'm getting this
corded edging along the crochet. So, you're

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:23.880
just going to draw the yarn through two loops.
Twist it. Bring it through and you would work

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:35.200
that across your whole row and this makes
a nice finishing off of a blanket or it could

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:47.169
be a neckline of a garment. It's also called
the crab stitch, the shrimp stitch or the

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:58.489
reverse crochet simple crochet and into my
last stitch and around and there you have

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.429
corded edging.
