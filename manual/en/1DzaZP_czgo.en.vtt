Hi, my name is Reena, I'm from Nail Creations.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:17.289
I'm going to show you how to create nail art
designs, nice and simple.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.689
I'll show you how to create simple Christmas
nails.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.429
We've just put a clear base coat down on the
nail bed.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.410
We're going to paint them red.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:51.650
Nice thin coat, you only need one layer.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:01:03.840
Make sure you don't bleed the red to the cuticle,
it would be a nightmare to clean up after,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:15.740
and always seal the ends so that the polish
last you longer, and then you get the hologram

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.600
glitzer, and you're going to position it on
the top.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.270
There's no right or wrong way of doing this.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:38.840
you use quite a bit of the polish quite thick
to make sure that the glitter goes on evenly.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.219
Make sure you seal that with a very good top
coat to make it last a lot longer.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.950
Always seal the glitter on the ends.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:02.039
Stops the nail polish from chipping, and that's
how you create Christmas nails. .
