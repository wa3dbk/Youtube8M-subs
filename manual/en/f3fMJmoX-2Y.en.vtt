00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.090
&nbsp;

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.010
Josh Byerly/STS-133 Descent Commentator: Space shuttle Discovery now on final approach to the

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.290
Kennedy Space Center. Just more than 30 seconds to go.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.020
Discovery's gear is down and locked.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.013
Main gear touchdown.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.270
The nose of the shuttle being rotated down toward the flight deck.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.203
The parachute being deployed.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.746
And nose gear touchdown and the end of a historic journey.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.416
And to the ship that has led the way time and time again, we say farewell, Discovery.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.856
Steve Lindsey/STS-133 Commander:  And Houston, Discovery for the final time, wheel stop.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.046
Charlie Hobaugh/CAPCOM: Discovery, Houston, Pinto, great job by you and your crew.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.290
That was a great landing in tough conditions and it was an awesome docked mission that you all had.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.150
You were able to take Discovery up to a full 365 days of actual time on orbit.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.993
I think you'd call that a fleet leader and a leader of any manned vehicle for time in orbit.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.893
So, a job well done. We'll meet you in the post-landing tab for post-landing. Currently no Deltas.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.310
Steve Lindsey/STS-133 Commander:  And copy that. Scorch we're headed to 53 and I'd like to thank you and your team

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.366
and all the orbit teams for a fantastic mission as well as the Expedition 26 Team on orbit.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.173
And I'd also like to thank KSC who has given us a perfect vehicle from start to finish on her final flight.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.470
Charlie Hobaugh/CAPCOM: Well said on all and we totally agree. Thanks
