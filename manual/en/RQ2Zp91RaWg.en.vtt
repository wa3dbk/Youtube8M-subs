00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.200
Hello, this is Scott and this is the Hyper
Report.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
Here are quotes for various items.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.100
First...

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.410
Chinese Gold Reserves

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.620
In 2007, Chinese gold reserves surpassed 7,000
tons, by the end of 2014, although there is

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.490
no official documentation, it is estimated
that the Chinese

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.189
gold reserves are 9,816 tons.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.360
The U.S. Treasury officially holds 8,134 tons,
but, the gold has not been physically audited

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.900
in decades.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Next...

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900
10 Consequences

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.450
As Greece goes on 'Double-Secret Probation',
here are a few of the 10 consequences of Greece

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.060
voting 'No' on banker slavery err... austerity...

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
1.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.280
The horrid conditions in Greece will get a
lot worse before they improve.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.280
2.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.400
All parties involved will find themselves
slipping into their Plan B mode to minimize

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.480
the damage...

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.900
In short, here comes the Drachma!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.900
3.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.379
Greece will likely never restore its status
as a full member of the euro zone.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.379
Next...

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.379
Secret Vatican Treaty

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.540
After the Vatican signed its first treaty
recognizing Palestine as a state in June,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.470
officials won’t allow Israel to review the
document.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.470
The agreement

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.860
formalized relations between the Vatican city
state and the fictional state Palestine.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.860
Next...

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.040
U.S. Mint and Silver Price

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.650
Just as silver hits record 2015 lows, the
U.S. Mint runs out of physical silver.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.750
This should make the price go down in this
mixed-up warped financial

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.750
system.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.370
After all, this is to be expected when people
choose a free Hershey's chocolate bar over

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.750
a 10 ounce bar of silver worth over $150.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.270
Anyway, with

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.430
glitches in the financial markets, that resulted
in the New York Stock Exchange trading halt,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460
will anyone start waking up?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460
Next...

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.460
Sanctuary Cities

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.890
In the wake of last week’s shooting death
of an innocent woman at the hands of an illegal

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.620
alien in San Francisco that prides itself
as a 'Sanctuary

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.140
City' for illegal aliens, Democrats, like
Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton (Sound

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.130
of witch's laughter), are suddenly shocked
by something they

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530
themselves set up.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.350
It appears people are going to need to protect
themselves; therefore, that will help gun

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.350
sales.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.530
Speaking of gun sales...

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.530
Next...

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.530
Gun Sales

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.940
According to the FBI's background check data,
background checks for gun sales spiked 11%

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.480
in June compared to last year for a total
of 1.53 million guns

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
sold.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.980
Of course, with Obama promising that events
in Greece and Puerto Rico will not cause a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.459
global financial crisis, you know you’re
going to need all

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.000
the protection you can get.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.980
Remember, don't forget the ammo!

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.980
Next...

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.980
69,000!

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.350
EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy claims that
fighting climate change could prevent 69,000

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.560
deaths from pollution in the year 2100.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.600
Are you kidding me?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
The

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.060
EPA budget for 2015 is $8.2 billion and we
get this non-sense?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.030
We have 400,000 people dying each year from
medical mistakes and this woman is warning

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.200
that 69,000 people will die in year 2100?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.000
Finally, please prepare now for the escalating
economic and social unrest.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.620
Good Day!
