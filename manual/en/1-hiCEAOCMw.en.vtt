Hi, this is Stephanie Sanders from Tomato's
House of Rock, and I'm going to give you some

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200
tips for improvising.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.100
Improvising really opens up your imagination,
to take you wherever you want to take your

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.700
audience, take the other musicians that you're
playing with.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.230
It's so open, you can really take it anywhere
which can sometimes feel a little overwhelming

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.480
or intimidating.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.800
One tip I really like to start with, especially
if you're really just beginning with the idea

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.649
of soloing is, try just using one note which
I know sounds crazy but you'll actually find

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.649
there is a lot you can do with one note and
that sometimes limitations can actually be

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:51.910
extremely liberating.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.390
If we think about one note, we can really
think about the rhythm of what we want to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.000
do with this one note.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.940
For instance, if I'm in the key of A minor,
maybe I want to choose C to be my one note

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.940
that I'm going to apply.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:26.850
I might have a solo that might be..

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.219
Just right there I got to say a lot and it
was just with one note.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.009
Try that, start with one note, if one note
feels good, maybe bring it up to two notes

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:58.729
which again, you're going to have even more
options suddenly now... and you can keep going

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.729
on from there.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.649
I would say try this exercise all the way
up to four notes.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.979
Once you're at four notes then it's really
fun to just open it up and try anything.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.610
Go from there, because once you've had those
limitations a lot of ideas are going to start

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.890
to build up in your mind and then when you
finally do allow yourself to go off, you'll

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.640
see you have a lot of inspiration, a lot of
ideas to work with.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.290
Another tip, when you're thinking about taking
your solo is to think about it as a story.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.790
That means you're going to want to have a
beginning, middle and an end.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.500
Hopefully if you're really thinking about
the momentum, it has that place that it starts

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.470
out and then it rises up to its peak just
before the ending and you bring it back down

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.470
again.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.650
To keep that idea of energy and emotion as
your meter for your solo, it'll really give

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.030
you some nice places to go.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.040
Just a small example, again I'll be in my
A minor pentatonic here, I'm going to have

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:12.940
a starting place, maybe something just very
simple and slow, that would be my starting

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.940
place.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.630
The middle, I want to go away a little I want
to get a little bit more interesting so now

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:28.060
maybe..

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.890
Now the story is going somewhere, now I'm
going to want to the point where I'm really

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:50.840
getting up near the top.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:11.870
Now we're going to bring it back down to close
it for that ending.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.940
If you're feeling like challenging yourself,
if you can remember what your beginning idea

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.860
was, if you can bring the solo back to something
similar to that original idea, it can really

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.300
tie together the solo nicely.
