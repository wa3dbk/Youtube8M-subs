00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:21.290
Hey guys, Paul at Rapids Wholesale, I’m
going to show you a quick easy way to get

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.490
your keg beer green.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.540
If you have one of these picnic pump things
it’s really quite simple.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.820
If your style picnic pump has a screw top
and a vertical pump lever this, unlike a bronco

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.550
pump all you have to do is to get green into
the keg, is to follow these simple steps.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.230
What you do is physically unscrew the top
here of the picnic pump.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.409
Ok, and then you’re just going to pull the
assembly completely out.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.030
There is going to be some grease likely around
the o-ring.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.460
That might be kind of nasty so set that aside
carefully.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.960
Now all you gotta do is take your vial of
green food dye or teaspoons or whatever have

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.879
and dump it right into that cylinder.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.661
See this is the air cylinder that pushes air
physically into the keg and pressurizes it

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.090
so it will come out the nozzle.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.370
Now if you put the green food coloring in
there when you go to pump on it, it’s going

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.080
to push that food coloring through into the
keg also.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.650
So once you’ve dumped . . . i’m pretending
i’m dumping green food coloring in there,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.230
you’re going to replace the pump unit.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.360
Wanna make sure that the o-ring slides in
there nicely.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.020
Again it’s going to be maybe slightly greasy
which is gross, but only for a moment.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.640
And then you can continue to go ahead and
tighten down the top of your picnic pump.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.290
And then as you pump, now you’ll be pushing
that green food coloring physically into your

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.060
keg so don’t have to put a drop in each
glass as you supply your friends at your party

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.490
with you know, holiday green beer.
