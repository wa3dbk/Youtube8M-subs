All right folks, in this clip, I'm going to
teach you how to draw a basic jeans and t-shirt

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.589
outfit, for a cartoon character, and the way
you draw the t-shirt is, we're just going

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.209
to come in here and we'll draw a little loop
for the top of the shirt, just like that.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:21.330
Come on down the sides and draw the shoulders,
and you just kind of follow the shoulders

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.900
down the side, and draw the little t-shirt
sleeves right there. You can draw a few wrinkles

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.560
in it, if you want, as you kind of come on
down. Draw the bottom of the t-shirt just

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:41.390
like that, and obviously, you can make the
arms, kind of like, hanging by the side, or

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.649
even in what will be the pockets. It's up
to you, so you could come in here, and draw

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.110
one of those pockets now. Another hand hanging
there. Come on down this way, just kind of

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.460
go right into the pants, just like this. Come
down completely to find where the knee is

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.330
going to be. That's usually a good idea, and
kind of work your way down to a steady wrinkle,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.940
until you reach the bottom, just like that.
Draw two lines straight across, and kind of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.240
work your way back up in sort of a wrinkled
way, until you get to where the top of the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.880
pants would be, just kind of go like that,
and if you want to , you can add some detail

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.440
to the top, like maybe some belt loops, just
like that. Well, maybe add the other pocket

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.530
over here, just so there's a little bit of
continuity. That works, so you just kind of

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.460
work your way down the pants. You could add
some wrinkles in here, and then of course,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:02:00.119
just add the shoes at the bottom. Simple little
laces, and that ought to do it. Jeans and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:00.909
t-shirt outfit.
