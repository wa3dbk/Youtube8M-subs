00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.859
if we need anymore sign of desperation
from the running campaign the romney

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.970
campaign is now coming out because
they've they're really having dog

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.269
problems mitt romney has a dog problem
of course putting his ivor center on the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749
roof of the station wagon years ago

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.579
and uh... driving across the country
while the dive defecating fear cat

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.449
colloquial e known as bromley countless
you know that story

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.380
became a recently again because and
ronnie against aidid

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.579
the dog love did the dog loved it

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.480
so what is the ronnie campaign doing
this is this is really incredible

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.940
now with the daily callers noted noting

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.260
in president obama's bestselling memoir
dreams from my father

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.030
president opa not recalls being fed dog
in the as a young boy in indonesia with

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.090
his stepfather lolo so toro

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.130
he says little oh i learned how to keep
small green chili peppers rawa dinner

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.950
plenty of rice and away from the dinner
table i was introduced to dog me

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.670
snake meat tougher and roasted
grasshopper

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.820
so this is from after obama's mother
married so toro obama lived in indonesia

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.970
from uh... but sixty seven to seventy
one roughly was six to ten

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.600
so what we're seeing ladies and
gentlemen

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.980
is the romney

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.540
side of things

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.730
after this revelation irani stafford twi
did something about that picture of a

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.440
problem with the doggies chilling in
light of this news about eating dog

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.980
there's a comparison between being an
adult and making the decision to strap

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.990
your dog to the root of your car

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.000
to being seven years old in indonesia

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.579
and being fed a piece of dog which in
that culture i mean first of all obon is

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.200
not deciding to say you know what i've a
value-added what animals are okay even

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.280
which are and i'm gonna go seek out
eating dog

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.149
it's it such of bogus comparison

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.259
it's a sign of desperation doesn't
that's all it is yes they have to

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.319
somehow make some type of

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.830
comparison

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.410
there's no attempts in

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.920
you had to say well rani did was okay

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.560
they're just trying to make it look like
a bomb is guilty of some things on the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.540
same thing exactly right because there
is no way to say that what he did was ok

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.979
also relief than what the overall romney
campaign hopes is going to be a huge

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.349
story little bombing accidentally
stepped on and aunt when he was five

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.400
years old

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.449
not fit to lead al-anon aunt

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.079
inept little six latency what do you
think when you hear the stuff that i was

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.719
something like this resonate with people
or will they be able to make the

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.809
distinction a seven-year-old kid in
indonesia uh... having a bite of dog is

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.930
very very different than an adult mitt
romney's wrapping the dog to the roof

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.290
on my have an effect in the immediate

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.600
aftermath but i don't think anyone for
member this even like a week from now

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.769
that

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.450
