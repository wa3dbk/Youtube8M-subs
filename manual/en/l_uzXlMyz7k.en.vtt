Hi. I'm Erik Bosse. I'm with the Aldredge
Bookstore. I'd like to talk about signed and

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:12.040
inscribed books. Sometimes a signed book can
be something as simple as an author writing

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:24.960
their name on the book. Just a simple unadorned
autograph. Sometimes it can be a little bit

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.720
more involved. In this case we'd call this
an inscription. We have the author?s signature

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.700
at the bottom. And it is an inscribed presentation.
And in this case it's to another literary

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.080
figure who's also involved in the same genre
as this author. Which even adds a greater

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.690
collectability to the book? Which brings up
to the question of, if you go and you get

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.421
an author to sign a book for you, by having
him or her inscribe it to you, is that really

00:00:55.421 --> 00:01:03.260
going to help it's value. Well, only if you
happen to be an important person. Often times

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.240
you'll often find the books that are published
and sold in a limited signed situation. Here

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.619
we have a set of Arthur Making books. Limited,
numbered and signed by the author. This is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.390
not a case of somebody going out and having
a book personally inscribed or signed to you.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.399
But the question comes up, can you be sure
that this signature in a book, it's not a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.579
special limited signed edition of the book;
it's not an edition where the publisher is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.079
vouching for the legitimacy of the signature.
Well, how can you be sure? If you didn't walk

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.920
up to the author and have the author sign
this book how you can be sure that this is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.670
a legitimate signature. And that gets into
some difficult territory. That is why if you're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.060
going to be collecting these sorts of things
it's best to deal with reputable dealers that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.950
specialize in signed inscribed books.
