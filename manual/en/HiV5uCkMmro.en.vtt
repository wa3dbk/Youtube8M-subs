00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.726
- Ooo Waaah!

00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:03.933
It is Time Lord.

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.738
Time for the Doctor Who tag!

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:07.812
"Come along, Pond."

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:08.983
"Allons-y!"

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.828
"Exterminate!"

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:15.291
Okay, number one, who's
your favorite Doctor?

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.158
David Tennant.

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:17.531
Daddy David!

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.622
He will always be my Doctor.

00:00:19.622 --> 00:00:21.149
This is Scottish, Doctor.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:21.982
(laughs)

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:25.272
In my mind, he plays the Doctor perfectly.

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:27.910
In his episodes, he's
made me so emotional.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.680
Number two, what's your favorite

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.977
Doctor Who story or episode?

00:00:31.977 --> 00:00:33.644
"Vincent and the Doctor."

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:36.421
This episode is raw and touching

00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.513
and painful and deep

00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:41.940
and just...

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.773
(sighs)

00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:43.861
It's wonderful.

00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.694
Depression is real and
horrible and difficult,

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:53.328
and for someone who has
suffered depression in the past,

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:58.012
this episode really meant a lot to me.

00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:00.297
Depression doesn't just go away,

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:02.966
it's something that you
have to constantly fight.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.965
It's an invisible monster
that only you can see.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:10.461
It is, it's so hard,

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:12.494
it's so hard to fight it off,

00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:15.913
but you can never stop fighting,

00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:17.657
you can never stop trying,

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:18.714
and remember this,

00:01:18.714 --> 00:01:20.623
this is my favorite
quote from the episode.

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:23.150
"The good things don't
always soften the bad things,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.153
"but the bad things don't necessarily

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:27.982
"spoil the good things and
make them unimportant."

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:31.052
Number three, who's
your favorite companion?

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:32.183
Wellll!

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:34.855
Even though Ten and Rose are my OTP,

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:35.827
and I ship them, and I love them,

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:37.076
and I will always love them,

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:38.214
and they are perfect together,

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.477
I think that my favorite companion

00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:43.269
would have to be Donna.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.563
Donna is just the best!

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:46.654
My queen!

00:01:46.654 --> 00:01:48.831
She was the first companion of the reboot

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.868
not to have a crush on the Doctor.

00:01:50.868 --> 00:01:54.868
She makes fun of him,
insults him, yells at him,

00:01:55.975 --> 00:02:00.522
and is never impressed
by him, and I love it.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:02.970
And their chemistry, perfect!

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.432
Also, instead of just being
blindly loyal to the Doctor,

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:10.327
Donna was the first
companion to really question

00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.070
what he was doing and the
decisions that he was making.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.264
Donna is the best!

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:17.052
If you don't like Donna, then you know

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:19.081
that's your opinion.

00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:20.051
(laughs)

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:24.637
Number four, what was the
first Doctor Who story/episode

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:26.041
you ever watched?

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:28.990
"Rose," yes, I started with Nine.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.692
Don't skip Nine!

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.599
"I give you air from my lungs."

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.801
(exhales)

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.478
Number five, what's your
favorite series or era?

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:40.081
David Tennant is my favorite Doctor,

00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:42.535
so the David Tennant era.

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:45.855
David Tennant's era has love, heartbreak,

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:48.155
frustration, anger,

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:49.857
and it really shows

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:51.567
his love for the human race,

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:54.254
and just the Doctor saving the day!

00:02:54.254 --> 00:02:56.799
The Doctor being the Doctor.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.059
He's just my favorite.

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:59.389
I love when he saves the day,

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:00.825
that's when I start crying,

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.375
or if it's a Christmas episode,

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.020
I love every single Christmas
episode, and I sobbed.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.523
Or if David Tennant's hair
just looks extra flawless,

00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:09.950
then, you know, I also start sobbing.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.426
There's a lot of tears involved .

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.733
Number six, what is your favorite

00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:17.833
pre or post-regeneration story?

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:18.666
Ah!

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.686
I love when Matt Smith becomes the Doctor

00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:23.049
because he just explodes into the role

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.929
with energy and quirkiness

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.464
and fish fingers and custard!

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:30.719
And it's just

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.587
it was needed.

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.033
With David Tennant leaving,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.248
I really needed something different.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:38.501
I really needed something
to keep me going,

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.058
and, Matt Smith, you kept me going,

00:03:40.058 --> 00:03:42.670
you adorable little cupcake of

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.087
a human, Time Lord alien man!

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:48.150
No eyebrows!

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.212
Ooo!

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:51.495
And I loved Amy's introduction as well.

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.230
"The Girl Who Waited."

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.986
"When I was a little girl,
I had an imaginary friend.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.575
"His name was the Doctor."

00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:00.632
I just love Doctor Who so much!

00:04:00.632 --> 00:04:04.715
Oh, you little sonic, but
you don't work on wood.

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.152
No boners for you.

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:09.782
What is your favorite
TARDIS desktop theme?

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:13.032
Okay, Matt Smith's TARDIS was

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.402
gorgeous!

00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:16.288
Are you kidding me?

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.904
That's some Whovian
space porn right there!

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:20.387
This is my TARDIS.

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:21.220
(bangs)

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.716
It's bigger on the inside.

00:04:22.716 --> 00:04:26.591
Last question, who's your
favorite villain or monster?

00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:28.291
"I am a trash can.

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:31.401
"Fear me, fear me!"

00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:34.818
Don't blink!
