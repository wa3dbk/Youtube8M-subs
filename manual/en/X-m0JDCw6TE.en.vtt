00:00:02.076 --> 00:00:03.109
- [Voiceover] What I've drawn for you here

00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:04.014
is the human brain.

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:04.967
And this is what you would see

00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:06.070
if you were looking at someone

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.509
and they were standing in profile,

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.133
or if they were standing
sideways in front of you.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.385
So this would be the front of their head,

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.208
so their eyes, and their nose and mouth

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:15.868
would be located down here.

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.654
This would be the back of their head.

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.488
And this would be the top.

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:24.050
And then down here would be the bottom.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.734
And we refer to this area,
this big one right here,

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.312
which is the first
thing that you would see

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:34.039
if you were just looking at
the outer portion of the brain,

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.565
we call this the cerebral cortex.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.659
And you might notice something
about the cerebral cortex

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:40.275
right away,

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:42.318
which is that it looks kind of wrinkly.

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:43.200
And it actually is.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.733
Rather than having a smooth surface,

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.078
it actually has a ton of bumps and folds.

00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:48.634
And this is actually extremely useful,

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.479
because it allows the cerebral cortex

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.195
to have a greater surface area.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.111
It allows it to have
room for more neurons.

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:56.906
It gives it an increased cellular mass.

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:58.407
We usually split the cerebral cortex up

00:00:58.407 --> 00:00:59.915
in to four different hemispheres.

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.251
The first is the frontal lobe,

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:03.186
which I'm shading in blue right here.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.298
The next area is the parietal lobe,

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.520
which is back here, towards
the top and the back end.

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.370
We also have the occipital lobe,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.169
which I'm going to color in pink.

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:18.876
And then finally we
have the temporal lobe,

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.828
which I'll draw in violet right here.

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:25.075
The frontal lobe is comprised
of two main regions.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.642
Those include the motor
strip or the motor cortex,

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.895
as well as the prefrontal cortex.

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:40.938
The motor cortex or the
motor strip is responsible

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.679
for our body movements.

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.466
In fact, if you could
peel back someone's skull

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.698
and electrically stimulate

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.125
different areas of the motor cortex,

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.038
you could make someone's
hand twitch or their leg move

00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.477
just by stimulating that
area on their brain.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.291
The frontal lobe also contains
the prefrontal cortex,

00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.077
and this is the part of the
brain that's responsible

00:01:57.077 --> 00:01:59.921
for what we refer to
as executive functions.

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.057
Things like thinking and problem solving

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:04.599
all take place in the prefrontal cortex.

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:06.957
Not only that, but it also
helps to supervise and direct

00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:08.675
all of the other areas of our brain.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:10.811
Another part of the frontal
lobe that's worth mentioning

00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.191
is referred to as Broca's area.

00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.257
And this is a part of the
brain that's associated

00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:16.998
with speech production.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:19.692
Let's move on to this
yellowish-orange portion here,

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.983
which we said was the parietal lobe.

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:28.130
And this part of the cerebral
cortex is also important

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.778
for a number of different tasks.

00:02:29.778 --> 00:02:31.392
One important part of the parietal lobe

00:02:31.392 --> 00:02:34.209
is the somatosensory cortex.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:40.554
And this is the part of your brain

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:42.191
that's associated with feeling.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:44.594
And by that I don't
mean emotional feeling.

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.556
What I actually mean is
that this part of the brain

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:48.435
receives information
from all over your body

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.432
about touch, and pressure,
and temperature, and pain.

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:53.498
So the motor cortex would
help us reach forward

00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:55.112
and grab a cup of coffee,

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.318
but the somatosensory cortex
is what would allow us

00:02:57.318 --> 00:02:59.292
to feel the pressure of that coffee cup

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.010
or tell us how hot it is.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.229
And you might be thinking to yourself

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.376
that these two things seem like
they're intimately related,

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:05.271
and they are.

00:03:05.271 --> 00:03:06.095
In fact, even though we say

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:07.895
that they're in different
lobes of the brain,

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:10.054
they're actually right next to each other.

00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.434
So this side of the brain,
to this side of the crevice,

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.895
within the frontal lobe
is the motor cortex.

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:17.600
And right next to it,
in the parietal portion

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.735
towards the back, is the
somatosensory cortex.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.139
And together they can be thought about

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.631
as the sensorimotor cortex.

00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:30.395
Our parietal lobe is also responsible

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:33.861
for spatial processing,
or spatial manipulation.

00:03:38.198 --> 00:03:39.286
And by that I mean

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:43.622
that it helps to orient yourself
in three-dimensional space.

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:45.201
But this part of the
brain doesn't only help us

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:47.082
understand where we are in space,

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:48.359
but it helps us to understand

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.797
the space around us more generally.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.074
For example, if I wanted to reach out

00:03:52.074 --> 00:03:54.140
and grab a cup of coffee
that's in front of me,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.135
I could use my prefrontal
cortex to plan the movement

00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.759
and my motor cortex to
complete that movement,

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.721
but I also need my
parietal cortex to tell me

00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:04.032
where that coffee cup is in front of me.

00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:05.611
And without that, I
wouldn't actually be able

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.398
to reach out and pick it up.

00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:08.978
Other things like knowing how to navigate

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:10.719
around your house or your town,

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.079
that's also what we
mean when we talk about

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.480
spatial manipulation
or spatial processing.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.301
Our occipital lobe, which
is in the back of our brain,

00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.247
is responsible for
things related to vision.

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:25.861
We may see with our eyes that
are in the front of our head,

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.162
but after collecting that information

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:28.160
from the world around us,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.134
that information actually gets transported

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:33.024
all the way to the back of
our brain for processing.

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:35.083
So let's put vision right here.

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.141
Another term that you might hear

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:39.674
in association with the occipital lobe

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:42.099
is the term striate cortex.

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:44.973
And this simple refers to the fact

00:04:44.973 --> 00:04:46.385
that if you looked at the occipital lobe

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.933
under the microscope, if
you looked at those cells,

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.757
that they would appear
striped or striated.

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.217
The last lobe of the brain
is the temporal cortex,

00:04:54.217 --> 00:04:55.283
and that's in violet.

00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:58.471
And this is the part of the
brain that's responsible

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.369
for auditory processing.

00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.101
As was the case with vision
in our occipital lobe,

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.493
information comes in through our ears,

00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:10.206
but it is processed in our
brain, in our temporal cortex.

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:11.922
Another important area
in the temporal cortex

00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:14.884
is what's referred to as Wernicke's area.

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.216
And when we talked about
the frontal cortex,

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.575
we talked about Broca's area,

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:25.013
which we said was responsible
for speech production.

00:05:25.013 --> 00:05:28.077
Well, Wernicke's area is
responsible for language reception

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.317
and language comprehension.

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:31.269
Before I end this video,

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:32.768
I just wanna take a moment to point out

00:05:32.768 --> 00:05:34.415
that the different lobes of the brain

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:37.874
do a lot more than just the
things that I've listed here.

00:05:37.874 --> 00:05:38.990
However, in general,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.593
these are the things that
you should think about

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:43.025
whenever you think about the
different lobes of the brain.
