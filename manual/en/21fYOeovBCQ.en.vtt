00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.809
Sometimes I feel making a comparison is like
ripping off a medical adhesive strip - you

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.660
know it's going to hurt, but sometimes it's
needed. So yes, Magnetic Baby by Bravery Plus

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.270
has many similarities to Super Mario Galaxy,
but - and this is the important part - beyond

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.910
this the challenging physics based puzzle
platformer feels like an entirely different

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.910
beast.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.190
For starters, the somewhat bizarre landscape
presents a unique obstacle in more ways than

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.260
one. Ultimately your aim is to collect as
many of the three stars on the level as possible

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.040
before reaching your 'girl', but each platform/planetoid
possesses a magnetic field that glues you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.890
to its surface. Thankfully you can roll your
way around, gaining momentum before flinging

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.560
yourself off, potentially entering in to an
orbit or pulling yourself in towards another

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.770
platform to continue your quest. The strange
shape of each platform increases the challenge

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.100
of this task and this is all before even basic
traps such as spikes or blades enter in to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.100
the picture.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.440
After acquainting yourself with one of three
available controls schemes (either tilting

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.309
your iOS device, using a virtual stick and
button or dragging the screen) you'll need

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.720
to start picking up some 'tricks of the trade'
by learning how to effectively launch yourself

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.130
around a platform to gain momentum; learning
optimal jumping points for height versus distance;

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.119
and when all else fails, learning how to precisely
time and avoid the many traps that can get

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.549
in your way including portals and lasers.
It's far from a safe world, but instant restarts

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.320
provide some succor should you fail to stay
alive.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.979
With 63 currently available levels you'll
have plenty of time to gawk over the luscious

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.829
hand-painted visual style and the detailed
animations of your character as he responds

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.970
to your actions either by getting dizzy, grimacing
at a speedy change of direction and taking

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.970
a rough landing.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.500
It's only real short-coming is the inability
to shake the feeling that your success on

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.130
some levels has more to do with blind luck
than that of considered planning. The physics

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.859
are incredibly consistent and easy to get
a feel of, but at times it also feels like

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.999
you're being guided, making what would otherwise
seem like a failed jump in to a miracle hail-mary

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.549
play where you sweep up three stars and rescue
the girl in one go. Later levels do curb this

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.299
slightly thanks to the many ways in which
you can die, but it's a hard feeling to shake.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.869
If you can master the controls and like a
good challenge wrapped up in a pleasing package,

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.020
Magnetic Baby is destined to make a home on
your iOS device.
