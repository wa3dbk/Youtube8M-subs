(Door opens)

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:03.035
(Door closes)

00:00:03.416 --> 00:00:07.929
[singing/humming]

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:09.210
OH…heh...
Hello There

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.102
Hello There
How are you?

00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:11.040
…yes…
…yes…

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:12.824
You are here for the
virtual haircut?

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.218
Yes…Yes…OK…
I will go get Luigi.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.456
He will come and
cut your hair.

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.450
I..I'm Manuel…
Just…just stay right there.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:22.584
(Knocks on door)
Uh…Luigi?

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:24.810
(Knocks on door)
Luigi?

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.777
(indistinct voice)
(Opens door)
Ah…Luigi…

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.028
It's Manuel here

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:30.498
The person is here
for your virtual haircut.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.230
You better come up.

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:32.496
Grazie
Manuel

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:33.944
I come right now.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.216
Uh…OK
He…He is coming up

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.711
right now and
meanwhile

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:40.181
I will go over here
and play music

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.514
on the guitar because
that is what I do here

00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.505
at the barber shop.

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:53.920
(Opens guitar case)
(Gets guitar out of case)
(Moves chair)
(Plays guitar music)

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.238
Ah…It's so nice to see
you.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:00.149
Welcome to the 
Starkey Cetera Barber Shop

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:05.037
and your virtual haircut.
I'd like to start the demonstration

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.095
by moving over to your
right hand side

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:09.428
and picking up this bag.
(bag shuffling)

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.990
If you just hold still
for a second,

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.781
I'll put this bag
over your head...

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:17.456
(puts bag over your head)
…just like that.

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:20.103
The bag over the
top of the head

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.214
And now I'll take the bag
off.

00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:25.699
(Takes bag off)
There we go.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.267
The only I did that
is because

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.356
all of the fancy barber
shops do that.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.467
What you're listening to
is I move off to your

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.328
right here and very
quickly wash my

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:36.755
(sink turns on)
hands.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:37.959
(Phone Rings)

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:39.088
(Phone continues ringing)
Manuel?

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.536
-What?
-Could you get that please?

00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:43.525
-Hmm…yes…hmm
-Ah…Thank you Manuel.

00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:46.087
(Puts guitar down)
Let me finish washing

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.124
my hands here.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.082
Just bear with me for a
few more seconds.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.443
Ah…There we go.
Ah…yes.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.395
As I was saying…

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.996
All we are doing is
using your head...

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.319
(Taps Mic)
as the listening port.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.431
And we have 2
microphones

00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.261
one on either side of the head.

00:02:06.582 --> 00:02:09.265
in the same position
as where your left…

00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:13.215
(Snaps fingers)
and your right ears are.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:15.517
(Snaps fingers)
(Manuel talking on phone)

00:02:15.624 --> 00:02:18.010
Your brain is doing
all of the work

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.717
telling you where the
sounds are coming from.

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.066
Ok. I'll get the scissors.

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:27.808
(indistinct)
(begins clipping with scissors)

00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:31.864
Now as I begin clipping
and I bring the clippers

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:33.237
closer to your ear.

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.814
Very close to the right ear…

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.986
Follow me as I move around
the back of the head

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.090
to the left ear…

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.055
and up and over the top
of the head.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.547
OK.
(Playing guitar)

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:52.359
Now…you can get the same
effect better with the

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.067
electric razor.
(Turns on razor)

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:56.781
I'll first bring it close
to your right ear…

00:02:56.804 --> 00:03:00.975
(Cuts hair with the razor)
It's perfect.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:03.003
(Cutting continues)
and around the back…

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.244
(Cutting continues)
and onto your left.

00:03:05.244 --> 00:03:07.989
(Cutting continues)
Ah…There.

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:12.152
I think that looks wonderful.
Manuel…What do you think?

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:15.858
Huh? What? Hmm…Wow…
Yes…yes…

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:17.809
It looks wonderful
Luigi.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.103
-You do such nice work.
-Ah…Thank you so much, Manuel.

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.421
-So fast too.
-Now.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:28.133
As I walk around,
I just want to tell you once more

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:31.640
that your ability to hear
where I am

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:36.794
as I walk around the room
is simply the amazing power of

00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:40.469
your brain,
calculating the tiny

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.754
differences, or cues
in sound intensity

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:48.749
and arrival time from
two open ears.

00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:55.642
And unlike any other hearing
instrument, only ONE has the

00:03:55.642 --> 00:04:00.003
digital algorithm that
negates its own physical

00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:05.455
presence in the ear
to fully restore those

00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:08.848
differences.
That algorithm is called…

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:11.134
(whispers)
CETERA

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:14.962
Heheheheh.
Well, Thank you

00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:17.204
Thank you so much for
stopping by the

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:19.019
Starkey Virtual
Barber Shop

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:22.114
Goodbye
and arrivederci.

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:27.085
