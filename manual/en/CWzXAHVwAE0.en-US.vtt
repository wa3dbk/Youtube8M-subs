00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.300
TIME HAS PASSED
HOW MUCH IT HAS!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.000
I ALREADY FEEL
LIKE I AM TRAPPED.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100
DOWN MY FOREHEAD
RUN DROPS OF SWEAT,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.700
MY VISION GETS BLURRY
I FEAR THE THREAT.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.800
THERE'S A LOT OF COLDNESS
CAUSE DEATH APPROACHES

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.100
TO THE HUMAN BEING
STATIONED IN FRONT,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.100
FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE
SAME AS I DO,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.100
NOT WISHING THE CONFLICT
THAT BRINGS PAIN TO US.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.400
TIME STOPS IT'S MARCHING
I CLOSE MY EYES

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
AND I COME BACK HOME
THERE, MY DAD AND MOM

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
SHOWER ME WITH LOVE
GREAT MEMORIES,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.900
WHAT A FEELING!
I OPEN MY EYES

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
AND THE MAN APPROACHES
NOT EVEN NOTICING

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.500
MY PRESENCE.
I GET READY FOR THE SITUATION

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
I HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
I PRAY TO MY LORD!

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.000
TIME HAS PAST.
HOW MUCH IT HAS!

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.900
I'M A GREAT WARRIOR
I'M A GREAT SOLDIER.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.200
BUT NO ONE KNOW
HOW I FEEL...

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.700
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO CAUSE THEM PAIN.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.800
A MESSAGE I BRING
TO THE WORLD

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
OF A GREAT SENTIMENT,
A DEEP FEELING,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.700
FILL YOUR HEART
OF LOVE AND PEACE

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000
AND ON THE PHASE OF EARTH
BROTHER HOOD MAY REIGN.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.100
TIME STOPS IT'S MARCHING
I CLOSE MY EYES

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.500
AND I FIND MY LOVE,
AND NEXT TO HER

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
THE FRUIT OF OUR LOVE
IT'S OUR SON,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.800
A GIFT FROM GOD.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
I OPEN MY EYES
AND THE MAN PULLS AWAY

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900
NOT EVEN NOTICING
MY PRESENCE.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400
I KNOW IN HIS SOUL
HE FEELS JUST LIKE ME.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.900
HOPING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
PRAYING TO HIS LORD.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
OH LORD
LISTEN MY LORD

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.400
HEAR US
HEAR US

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.800
AND BLESS US
SON OF GOD

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.800
OH GOD
LISTEN, MY GOD

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.100
HEAR HIS VOICE
TODAY I ASK

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.000
IF I'LL COME BACK HOME

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.200
I BEG YOU TO STOP THE WAR, BUDDY
I WANT TO GO HOME

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.500
AND THAT'S WHY I SAY

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.200
TIME STOPS ITS MARCHING
I CLOSE MY EYES

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.000
I'M GOING BACK HOME

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
LISTEN. 
GOD, HEAR MY PRAYER

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.000
CAUSE
I DO WANT TO GO BACK HOME

00:03:43.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
TIME STOPS ITS TIME
I CLOSE MY EYES

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.800
I'M GOING BACK HOME

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.300
THE FEEL OF A SOLDIER
AT A BATTLE FIELD

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000
GIVING HIS LIFE
TO DEFEND HIS COUNTRY

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.900
TIME STOPS ITS MARCHING
I CLOSE MY EYES

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.500
I'M GOING BACK HOME

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.300
I WANT TO GO BACK
I WANT TO GO BACK

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.600
TO MY LOVING COUNTRY
LAND OF MY LOVE
