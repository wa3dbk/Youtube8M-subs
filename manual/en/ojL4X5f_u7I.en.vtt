Hello again everyone. This is Terry Bowden
with Expert Village. We're taking a look at

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.450
templated websites okay? And just to kind
of show you it's a little easier to use these

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.730
in the fact that they're pretty much already
made. The templates are already set for you

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.840
and all you have to do is move pictures around.
You can use their library or you can upload

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.870
your own photos. Of course you have to put
in your own text. I mean we have to put in

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.090
our own information, right? They can't do
it for you. So let's take a look. Now we have

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.890
permission from the Actors Club, which is
actually one online, and they're live okay?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.600
But we have their permission to go in and
take a look at their site so I can show you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.480
a little bit of how to use it. Okay. The first
thing we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.899
go to ADD. Now what that is is add a page.
Okay. And let's take a look at all the different

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.210
pages that you can add. You have the standard
web page, which has up to five or six photos

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.870
that you can put on there. Okay. There's the
photo album. And this would be really good,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.190
and I think this is what they're using. Of
course we're not going to show any photos

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.740
on here because of some of the actors and
we don't have their permission, right? But

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.220
this is what they use to put all their actors
photos on the page. So if you were selling

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.740
something online you could put all your products
on there see, the photos and descriptions,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.470
so you could sell them a lot easier than just
having text on the screen. So very, very good.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.120
Also there is a product catalog where you
can also put your items on there. And that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.680
gives descriptions, okay? You have a guest
book, message board, contacts pages. I mean

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.070
the list goes on and on and on. The calendar
is very, very useful if you want to put events

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.909
or different things that are going on with
you, your family, your business and so forth.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.040
Maps, polling booth. All that with just the
click of a button. So let's add a page okay?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.100
I don't think they'll mind. All right so let's
add a photo album page. Okay. We click on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.900
photo album and it comes up the title of our
photo album. We would put photo albums on

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.670
there, right? We'd put something else. So
we could just highlight photo albums and change

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.380
it at will. So if we wanted to put up, let's
just say this is what they did, actors? We

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.069
could put actors. And what will happen is
you add the page. See that click to show,

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.700
add the page and voil`! There it is. So we
go into it. It's already added the page and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.620
we've just got to put a title under the page.
And we change it, we just leave it actors.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.270
We go down and we can put text all in here
in our text boxes. Hit save changes. Look

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.440
at there. Actors. We have made a page. Of
course there's no content on there but you

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.050
see my point? Very, very easy. One click there's
actors at the bottom of theirs. And of course

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
we'll go in and change it okay? But when we
come back we'll take a look at managing pages.
