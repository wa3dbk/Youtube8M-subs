00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.900
well I got my doors done and I had old
doorknob that uh I took off one of my

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.310
doors in the house and used here and I
don't know what happened but somehow I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.590
miss measured by two inches I don't know
what I did was I even wrote the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.759
measurement down when I measured this
doorway to cut my wood here and I even

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.280
wrote it down wrong so I don't know how
it happened but I think I'm going to put

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.489
a 2x4 across the top there and then just
a little piece of siding up here and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.460
some caulking and who knows maybe nobody
will notice it but I'm no professional

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.239
carpenter I make mistakes
I just hate it I made a mistake right

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.050
around here where it's facing the house
all right I'm going to start my trim I'm

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.229
going to repair my mistake and I should
be for the most part finished with this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.070
today
all right see you all right there's a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.200
this side trimmed out done I'm going to
cock over my nail holes hit it with a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.950
coat of primer and then on this end here
the eaves coming out three foot adding

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.000
some 10 and this is where I'm going to
stack my firewood back here for the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.560
house and in my shop okay I'm going to
trim out the front side and the doors

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.590
and be done with outside all right I
added a 2x4 to the top of this door that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.630
I screwed up mismeasured and

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:13.480
added a piece of siding to it from a
distance they don't look too bad but I

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.620
have a friend who's a carpenter I'll see
if he picks up on it he doesn't notice

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:27.740
it then I I'm good to go well I'm done
I trimmed it out and I'm standing in the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:38.350
shadow of my shop here because the Sun
is right on the camera I got some a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.740
little bit of work to do as far as
cocking the nail holes and then I'm

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.570
going to put a coat of primer on it oh

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:00.980
and my mistake up there when I when I
get some caulking on that seam and fill

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.100
the nail holes I don't even think it'll
be noticeable and it just be between me

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.090
and YouTube that I made a mistake
and used an old lock that I had laying

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.620
around had to do a little whittling to
get it to fit but it works I'd be able

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.450
to lock this all right that's one
project down what I'm going to do next

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:39.080
is I'm going to add three feet off of
this Eve here and put some tin on it and

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.600
right below here is where I'm going to
start stacking my firewood keep it dry I

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.420
don't know what I'm going to lay down
here on the ground if I come across some

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.209
four by fours or maybe some landscape
timbers or something just to keep the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.570
wood up off the ground but this
afternoon I'm going Ace Hardware to buy

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.540
some pipe and some sheet metal so I can
install my stove

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.159
and I'm putting my stove and that corner
down yonder and I'm moving them shelves

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.570
and everything I'm going to put the
shelves over on this wall and the stoves

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.040
going in the corner I'm going to get
some of that cement backer board nailed

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.590
to the walls where the stoves going to
be going and then when I extend this

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.639
roof out I'm going to be scabbing on to
these here three feet in and three feet

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.360
hanging off when I'm done with that I'll
close these young otherwise I'll have

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.930
sparrows and all kinds of birds trying
to live in here alright I'm going to put

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.139
this up I really can't do that much
right now because it's still too cold

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.639
the paint and it's too cold to get the
caulking to stick to the to the wood
