00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.059
G'day everyone.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.860
My name is Daniel O'Grady and welcome to another
Wasabicars video.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.930
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.110
I must apoligise.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.210
It's been six days since posting my last video.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.449
What's up with that?

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.449
Ohh, crazy.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.890
Anyway, I'm coming back better than ever with
this beautiful first-generation Nissan Silvia.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.420
Oh, my God.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.620
Usually when I see cars from Nissan... of
this age, they're usually Datsuns.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.530
You know what I'm saying?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.040
But, this is a Nissan.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.750
An old car with a Nissan badge on it.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.530
It just blows me away, actually.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.269
And, just check out the badges.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.269
Aaa-mazing.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.280
This is the second time I've seen a first-generation
Silvia.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920
The first one was a red, blob of a car.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.269
Sort of rough and rusty.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.409
I got to see under the hood of that one, so
that was great.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.199
There was a 1600cc engine.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.619
It had twin SU carburettors.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.000
It was great to be able to see that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.490
These cars were hand-built and hand-formed.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.920
It's hard to convey that to you, but the experience
that I had lifting the hood of that rough

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.670
one, it weighed a ton.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.830
It was just so heavy.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.689
Heavy-gauge steel.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.369
Something that really stuck in my mind; It
just made me wonder how a 4-cylinder engine

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.890
produced enough power to propel this car down
the road.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.320
Certainly the brakes would have to be up to
scratch to stop this car that weighed a ton.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.670
Anyway, pretty cool engineering for back in
the day.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.579
I think the platform... yeah.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:52.860
This has the same platform as the Datsun Roadster,
which I call the Datsun Fairlady.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.030
Because, in my life I've seen dozens of them,
and they've all been Fairladys.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
I'm only lived in japan, and I've only seen
them in Japan.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.219
I've only lived in Japan?!?

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.450
Well, I've only seen them in Japan, sorry.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.450
So...

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.619
Fairladys, then they put this body on top.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.160
I believe there was a German gentleman, Goertz(?),
who had a hand in designing this car.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.989
And, the same gentleman had a hand in designing
what ended up being the Toyota 2000GT.

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.260
So, some European influences there.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.950
I'm sorry, that's all I can recall at the
second.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.099
What a stunning car.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.030
Check out the interior.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.230
I mean... clean!

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.680
Just how well treated was this car?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.250
It just does my head in, in a good way.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.250
Just amazing.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.200
(makes crazy noise)
Okay, guys.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.650
Before I go, I've got some awesome news which
I'm going to drop in my next video.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.950
Stay tuned or that.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.950
I've got some great news.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.940
I'm going to be traveling in December, checking
out some stuff, so I want to tell you all

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.980
about that in my next video.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.170
I will leave it here for now.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.239
Guys, if you pick up a Wasabicars T-shirt,
you will look cool.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.620
And, it might be very cool if you are living
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.370
But, if you are living in the Southern Hemisphere,
a T-shirt would be... well, cool.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.450
Thank you so much.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.450
Take it easy.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.590
See you!
