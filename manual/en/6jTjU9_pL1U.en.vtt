00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.560
There are times when, you might feel aimless,
can't see the places you belong. But you will

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:33.000
find that, there is a purpose, it's been there
within you all along. And when you're near

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:46.090
it, you can almost hear it. It's like a symphony,
just keep listening. And pretty soon you'll

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:59.400
start, to figure out your part. Everyone plays
a piece, in their own melody - each one of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:18.900
us, oh oh oh, it's glorious. And you will
know how to let it ring out as you discover

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:34.869
who you are. Others around will start to wake
up, to the sounds that are in their hearts.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:46.099
It's so amazing, what we're all creating.
It's like a symphony, just keep listening.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:57.600
And pretty soon you'll start, to figure out
your part. Everyone plays a piece, in their

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:17.500
own melodies - and each one of us, ooooh, it's
glorious. Oh Oh Oh And as you feel the notes

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:40.590
build, ah ah, you will see. It's like a symphony,
just keep listening. And pretty soon you'll

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:52.820
start, to figure out your part. Everyone plays
a piece, in their own melodies - each one of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:03.000
us, oh oh oh, it's glorious.
