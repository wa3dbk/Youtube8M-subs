00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
I have to turn it down for copyright reasons. Good morning John!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.060
I have to make a makeup tutorial today and I realized that I have no makeup, Katherine has no makeup,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.240
and no one we know has makeup because we are in the social group of people

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.320
who do not highly prize the evenness of one's skin.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.660
So we're going to Target!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.320
I'm very comfortable here. It's my Target.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.880
Spent a lot of time here. Though I admit I haven't spent a lot of time in the makeup aisle

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.600
So Katherine and I were walking up and down the makeup aisle, and I was seeing all these beautiful, fancy people

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.340
on the walls, and in the aisles, and I was trying to think to myself, who do I really admire who wears makeup

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.100
first thing that came to my mind was Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of the Hunger Games

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.480
in the opening ceremonies of the Hunger Games, they talk a lot about her fashion, and she's totally into it

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.100
so I was thinking about that, and I came over to the book section to check this out,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880
and actually read about what Katniss is wearing at the opening ceremonies of the first Hunger Games

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.640
and here is what is says: "my face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there"

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.360
and that's all it says about Katniss's makeup. The outfit, of course, is much more sensational than that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.980
but I think that's the look that I am going to go for: not a lot of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.920
I'm a little bit worried about getting the one that features Ellen's face, because it makes me feel old.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.960
That is a lot of ingredients.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.820
I don't know if you know this, but shaving hurts sometimes.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.160
It stings, that's why I don't like to do it.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.040
So I'm going to start with my foundation, of course, and I'm going to be doing most of this video with my glasses off

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.540
and you will say "oh my god Hank, you look so weird with your glasses off"

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.140
And I have no idea how to get this open. It's like they've stuck it inside of a single block of hard plastic

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.560
I have no idea how to open this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.460
God, what kind of woman is strong enough to do -- oh, there we go

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.960
I did it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.680
And this, I think, is how makeup works.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680
And I just shoved it in my eye.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.560
That doesn't feel good.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.560
Blend it into the neck there

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.380
Okay, that's looking good.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.720
So what I'm going for here is like, you know, District 12,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.300
kind of smokey, but subtle look.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.740
I'm gonna attempt that with this silver shimmer eye shadow

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.320
which I'm going to put around the edges to give kind of a sparkle

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.500
then I have this, which is dark, with a nice white highlight,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.360
that I think will give us a really good dramatic, smokey look.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
In fact, it says on the back of this, "dramatic, smokey look."

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.720
How do you put makeup on your eyes...if you have to see...how...your eyes are closed but they have to be open?

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.220
How do you do this?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.220
I look like I've been beaten. With a hose.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.880
Now I'm gonna go with white across the brow bone here.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.640
It's just so counter-intuitive. Why the hell would anyone do this?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.500
Why would you put a stick in your eye?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.220
I don't know if you people thought I was going to take this quite so seriously.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.500
Ohh, that's bad.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.580
Ohhh, mother of poo! I am the worst at putting on - oh, that's not coming off

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.660
Since I did a little bit of extra fun with my eyes,  I'm gonna be very simple with my lips

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.720
You know, this is the third time I've put on makeup for a Vlogbrothers video.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.200
This stuff smells good!

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
So I wanted a cool look -- nice, dark, smokey, District 12 look

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
and this is what I'm going for

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.640
And if I had ever put on makeup before in my life I think that it would have been really awesome.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.080
This is my Katniss Everdeen look, everybody, I hope that you enjoyed it

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360
and tomorrow you can go buy Mockingjay, the next book in the Hunger Games series

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.020
Which I am extremely excited about

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.080
and of course tomorrow is also John's birthday. But I'm not gonna talk about that right now.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.500
I will say that while I was waiting for Mockingjay to come out I read The Shipbreaker, by Paulo Bacigalupi

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.920
Two Nerdfighter symbols up for Paulo Bacigalupi's The&nbsp;Shipbreaker, you should check it out.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.120
Thank you ladies for putting on makeup for special occasions,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.420
but I think it's important to note that we guys, we think you're pretty all the time.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.280
Because you're beautiful.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.100
John, you will see me, and a lot of Nerdfighters, tomorrow.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.300
It occurs to me that I have no idea how to get this off of my face now that I have it on.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.600
So I think I'm just gonna eat a granola bar, and edit my video like this.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.560
No one's watching.
