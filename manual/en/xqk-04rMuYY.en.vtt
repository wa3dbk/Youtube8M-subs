What’s Up Guys,
So I don't know about you, but I like seeing

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.870
my phone above 50% charge, but I don’t like
plugging my phone in and out all the time,

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.999
nor do i like spending money on things that
I can inexpensively build. So I decided to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.410
build myself a wireless charging dock. Although
it doesn’t look as nice as the ones that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.970
cost 50 dollars, it works just as well and
costs a fraction of the price. For only $7

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170
dollars, you can build yourself this wireless
dock in under 7 minutes. Now this video is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.070
not a step by step tutorial, rather it gives
you a brief overview of how to build it and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.460
a review of the device. It is fairly easy
to build and requires little to no experience.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.660
All you need is a few pieces of scrap wood,
a hot glue gun, and the wireless charger PCBA

00:00:42.660 --> 00:01:11.420
which is linked down below the like button.
Specs wise, the PCBA takes in 5 volts at 2

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.000
amps and spits out 5 volts at 1A. So you need
to plug this into a 2 amp wall adapter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.729
with this one, it’ll charge faster, but
this one slower. It’ll still work though.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.270
The construction of the dock is very simple.
Just take two pieces of scrap wood and hot

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.100
glue them together at an angle that’ll create
a slight tilt for your phone to rest on. I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.150
would suggest being generous on the hot glue.
I added a little wooden barrier so my phone

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.299
would never slip off from its optimum position
After building the main frame, simply hot

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:47.140
glue the coils from the PCBA to the front
of the dock and glue the main circuit board

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.500
to the back. Make sure to leave ample room
so you can connect your micro usb to it.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.740
The dock charges my galaxy S4 from 0-50 in
about 30 minutes and 50-100% in another hour.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.490
Just know, that this will make the receiver
in your phone a tad bit warm. However, it's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.970
not your actual phone that gets warm, its
the receiver.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.910
You are now finished. In my opinion, it is
a very easy and fast build. If you have any

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.530
questions, just leave it in the comment section
and if you somehow liked the video, you can

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.980
click the like button...if you want. That’s
all I got for you guys today. Hope you enjoyed

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.310
the video and I’ll see you in the next one.
