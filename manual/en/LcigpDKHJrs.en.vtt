00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.649
Good day, and here we are taking a look at
the first expansion pack for Battlefield 1942.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:31.359
This is Road to Rome, and it features maps
set during the Allied invasion of Italy.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.870
Really, this is a pretty basic expansion pack;
you get a couple of new maps, and you get

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.420
to play as two new armies.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.531
Although they're not really new armies because
they only use a few different vehicles, and

00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.370
they only use a few different weapons.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.379
This is actually the most basic expansion
pack of the lot.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.840
Now, the new vehicles and weapons are somewhat
historically accurate, a bit more so than

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.939
seen in the very first Battlefield game.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.850
No longer are the allies armed with exclusively
German tanks, especially when... they shouldn't

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.850
be.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.260
Now you can play as the Italian army and you
can play as the French army in some levels,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.450
although if I'm not mistaken it was just the
one.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.729
Now this level we're looking at here was actually
one of my favorites from the expansion pack;

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.600
you have to fight up this mountain, and it
is very difficult to do so.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.830
Now if you're the Defender, it's pretty easy
because you can just jump on an artillery

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.370
platform and just bomb everybody to hell.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.330
Really, that's one thing I did not mention
in the first review; the AI for this game

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.000
is actually pretty good, and you can't take
that many hits.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.590
In fact, you can get shot about three or four
times, then you're dead.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.150
So whenever the enemy sends two or three enemy
soldiers after you, it's a pretty harrowing

00:01:41.150 --> 00:02:15.810
experience.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.579
And really, that's about it.

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.030
Road to Rome was a very, very basic expansion
pack, as said earlier.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.040
You get maybe one or two new weapons that
work exactly like the weapons did in the first

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040
game.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.611
You get a few new tanks which work exactly
like they did in the first game.

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.610
You get a few new maps, but they're not that
amazing.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.610
Really, the next expansion pack that we're
going to be taking a look at in the next video

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.310
actually did add a great deal more content.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.590
But really, for what this is, it was of decent
quality I suppose.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.980
And seeing as how you can't really get Battlefield
1942 without it, it's not really a matter

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.480
of recommending it, it's just saying that
it was kind of lackluster when it was released.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.700
And so, this is Jon, signing off.
