00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.940
Welcome to the NDSU Virtual Cell.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.820
It's time to climb into one of our cell submarines and take a virtual tour of our cellular landscape.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.560
Looking straight ahead, you should see a large blue object studded with small yellow openings.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.960
That is the nucleus of the cell.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.980
It will be our first stop today.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.760
The nucleus is uniquely recognizable by the system of pores embedded within its outer membrane.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.380
Biological materials move in and out through the pores.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.500
They are the communication channel between the internal world of the nucleus

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.320
and the cellular cytoplasm.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.500
The nucleus contains the vast majority of the DNA in the cell.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.100
The DNA contains all of the genetic information necessary

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.560
to carry out all of the functions of the cell,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.160
as well as the tissues and organs in which the cell can be found.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.340
That information is mobilized first by the process of transcription.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.380
Let's pause and take a short look at the process.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520
During this process,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.840
the DNA is used as a template to make RNA.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.960
Here, you can see that process in action.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.440
 The final product of transcription

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440
is then spliced and modified

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.360
into one of three RNA molecules:

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.540
messenger RNA (or mRNA),

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.240
transfer (or tRNA),

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600
and ribosomal (or rRNA).

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.700
These are all important components of the process call translation that is used to make proteins.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.560
If we follow the final mRNA products out of the nucleus

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.900
we can see them in action during the process of translation.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.080
Here you can see a particulate organelle called the ribosome.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.960
It is partially composed of the rRNA we just spoke of.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.940
Attached to it is the mRNA.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.040
As translation starts,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.180
a tRNA molecule binds to it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.480
and delivers the correct amino acid.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480
As the protein grows,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.320
additional amino acids are brought into place by the correct tRNA molecules.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.480
The correct tRNA

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.700
is determined by triplet codes found in the mRNA.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.980
Proteins are the product of translation

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.760
Although some of these proteins stay within the cytoplasm,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.640
others are trafficked to different locations within the cell

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.100
and some are exported from the cell.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.260
Most of this trafficking

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.560
involves the endoplasmic reticulum (or ER)

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.560
and the golgi apparatus.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.700
We are now looking at the ER, or endoplasmic reticulum.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.140
Some of the cell's ribosomes are attached to the ER

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.980
and the proteins they manufacture

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.520
are inserted directly into the space inside the ER.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.900
Those proteins can be packaged into vesicles

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.560
which depart the ER and migrate to the golgi apparatus.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.080
Here, the vesicles merge to form a golgi cisterna

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.680
with the proteins located inside the cisterna's membrane.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.000
As the cisterna matures,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.060
enzymes inside can modify the protein.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.900
This modification creates a molecular tag

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.580
that is used to target the protein

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.900
to a specific cellular location.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.660
Eventually, the cisterna will mature into the trans golgi network.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.880
From here vesicles can deliver proteins to cellular locations

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.680
such as endsome or the cell membrane

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.120
where the proteins can be embedded or exported from the cell. \

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.780
Once proteins have been translated,

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.820
they can also be delivered to other organelles in the cell,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.740
such as the mitochondria and the chloroplast.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.640
Delivery here is by a different process.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.180
Some proteins are produced with transit peptides.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.540
These are specialized sequences on the end of the protein

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.020
recognized by pores

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.840
in the mitochondrial membrane.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.780
With the help of additional specialized proteins,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.340
the protein is delivered into the organelle.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.620
Transport to the chloroplast involves a similar process.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.140
Mitochondrias and chloroplasts are the sites for unique cellular processes.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.880
We'll first look at the mitochondria.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.580
 This organelle produces ATP,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.780
an energy molecule that is used by many other cellular processes.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.940
ATP is produced by a complex in the mitochondrial membrane

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.940
called ATP synthase.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.500
The energy to produce ATP

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.960
is provided by a gradient of protons

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.380
 (or hydrogen ions)

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.980
found on the two sides of the membrane.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.160
Protons flow from the area of high concentration

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.160
through the ATP synthase,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.600
to the area of low concentration.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.620
As they flow through ATP synthase,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620
 ATP is produced.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.040
This gradient is produced by the action of the electron transport system.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.080
As electrons are passed from one carrier

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.700
 to another in the system,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.400
protons are pumped across the membrane.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.620
This creates the gradient required for ATP production.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.120
Here we see can see the electrons

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.120
moving between the carriers.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.020
Finally, we see an organelle only found within plant cells.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.400
This is the chloroplast.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.880
Here light energy from the sun

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.620
is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.560
As with the electron transport system,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.400
electrons are passed from one carrier to another

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.180
and protons are passed across the membrane.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.680
The gradient this creates

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.680
produces ATP by a similar ATP synthase complex.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.720
It begins with a photon of light

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.540
that produces the energy necessary

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.560
to release an electron down the carrier chain.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.200
Here you can see the electron moving between the carriers

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.440
along with ATP being produced by ATP synthase.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.120
And that brings us to the end of our fly through.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.280
There are many processes going on within our virtual cell,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.880
and this trip featured only a few of the major functions.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.800
We are always working to expand our collection,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.400
and we hope you will return to explore our newest additions.
