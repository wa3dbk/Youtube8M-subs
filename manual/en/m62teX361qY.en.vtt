00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:08.688
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.060
- So you've made it to Clemson.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.411
Welcome.

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.172
Most of us are here to get
our first four-year degree.

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:26.921
As a sophomore, I'm here to tell you

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.539
about the degree you need to get today.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.478
There's a lot to see and do on campus,

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:34.043
and while Clemson has put
into effect safety rules,

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:36.934
it is your job to apply
them to your daily routines.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.261
Be aware of your surroundings.

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.694
Clemson students are among
the happiest in the nation,

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:43.243
and one of the reasons we are so happy

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.607
is because we look out for each other.

00:00:45.607 --> 00:00:47.975
It's easy to get caught up in
the music playing in your ear

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.862
or the cell phone
conversation you're having

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:52.362
while making your way to and from classes.

00:00:52.362 --> 00:00:53.837
The last thing you want is to fail to see

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:55.543
the car you're about to walk into.

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:57.629
(car horn honks)

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.073
So pay attention to traffic.

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:02.952
And if you're the driver,
watch for pedestrians.

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:05.337
Remember, this is the
next stage of independence

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:07.466
in your life as a young adult.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.460
Your principals from high school

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.824
will not be in the hallway
telling you to get to class.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.590
You're on a public college campus.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.757
Keep an eye out for suspicious people.

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:25.295
And note if someone is following you.

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:35.999
If you feel threatened,
draw attention to yourself.

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.532
- Somebody help! Call the police!

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:40.509
- [Erika] Get to a place
where there are other people.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.427
- Help!

00:01:41.427 --> 00:01:43.043
- Call 911 from your cell phone,

00:01:43.043 --> 00:01:45.383
or get to an emergency phone on campus.

00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:48.724
Know the locations of blue
light emergency phones.

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:51.114
If you're out at night,
travel in crowded areas,

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:55.487
walk with a group, and
stay in well lighted areas.

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:56.612
- I'm so tired.

00:01:56.612 --> 00:01:58.986
- Exercise caution in
your dorm or apartment.

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.055
Make sure you lock your doors

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.638
before you go out and
before you go to bed.

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:09.106
(suspenseful organ music)

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:42.672
(thunder)

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.479
Severe weather is out of our control,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.151
but knowing what to do in that case isn't.

00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.346
The last thing you'll want
to do is show up for class

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:55.160
when all classes are canceled, right?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.867
When dangerous weather approaches,
find shelter right away.

00:02:57.867 --> 00:02:59.842
Also, sign up today for CU Safe alerts,

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:01.438
and tell others to do the same.

00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:02.900
Here's the web address.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.412
The university created a system

00:03:04.412 --> 00:03:05.978
for getting emergency information to you

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:09.402
via your cell phone, email,
and the CU Safe website.

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:11.993
Here you'll find breaking
news, follow-up messages,

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:14.715
weather warnings, and
tips for staying safe.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:16.089
One more thing.

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:17.432
If you see a security problem,

00:03:17.432 --> 00:03:18.906
such as a burned out light bulb,

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:20.681
don't assume somebody's taking care of it.

00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.014
Call the police at 656-2222.

00:03:24.847 --> 00:03:27.452
Bottom line, safety is
the most important degree

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.856
you will receive while at Clemson.

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:34.856
And it is the only degree
you can give yourself.

00:03:36.578 --> 00:03:40.745
