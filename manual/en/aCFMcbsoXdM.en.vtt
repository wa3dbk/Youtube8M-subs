An Introduction to VoiceOver on the iPhone,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.033

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:31.933
Many people ask, “How does someone who 
cannot see the touch screen of an iPhone use

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:39.166
 one?”  It may seem impossible, at first, since 
the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad all use a flat, 

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:45.999
touch-operated surface that is inherently visual.  
But the folks at Apple have devised an 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.333
ingenious way for people to operate these 
mobile devices using the screen reading

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:57.266
technology and custom gestures built into 
VoiceOver, the free screen reader that comes 
built 

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:06.532
into the operating system of the device.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:14.999
So, how does VoiceOver work?
Setting up VoiceOver is easy, but since it is a 
one-time

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.300
process, we won’t cover setup in this video. 
When VoiceOver is set up, most people who 
use 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.800
and rely on VoiceOver will use a feature called 
Triple-Click Home to toggle VoiceOver on and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.266
off.  To do this, locate the home button just 
below the bottom edge of the iPhone screen.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:45.966
Now, press it three times in quick succession to 
activate or deactivate VoiceOver.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:53.566
Each object on the screen of the device is called 
an element.  To hear a description of an 
element, simply tap it.

00:01:53.566 --> 00:02:04.266
You can move your finger around the screen to 
hear descriptions of additional screen elements.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:14.399
To activate an element, tap the screen twice in 
quick succession.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.066
In addition to tapping individual elements to hear 
their description,

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:24.232
you can move from element to element using 
single finger swipes, sometimes called flicks.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:36.933
To move to the next element, use one finger to 
swipe or flick from left to right, anywhere on the 
screen.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:47.066
To move to the previous element, use one finger 
to swipe or flick from right to left, anywhere on 
the screen.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:53.799
It is also possible to read large blocks of text 
using a two finger swipe or flick.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.133
To read from the current element or cursor 
location to the last screen element, use two 
fingers to swipe or flick from the top 

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:11.266
of the screen in a downward motion.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:17.466
To read from the first element on the screen to 
the last element, use two fingers to swipe or 

00:03:17.466 --> 00:03:29.099
flick from the bottom of the screen in an upward 
motion.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.833
You can change VoiceOver settings using the 
Rotor.  The Rotor is a virtual knob or dial 

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:45.899
that can be turned to change a setting.  Using 
two fingers, hold them as if you were going 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.933
to use them to turn a dial such as one you 
might use to adjust the volume of a radio or TV. 

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:57.699
Next press them against the screen.  While 
holding the fingers in the dialing position

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.466
on the screen, turn or rotate them as if you are 
adjusting a physical, on-screen dial.

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:09.266
It doesn’t matter where on the screen you do 
this, the device knows you are making a Rotor

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:16.866
adjustment by the placement of your fingers.
VoiceOver voice settings like language and

00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:22.766
speech rate may be changed by choosing either 
in the Rotor, then using a single finger to

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:35.999
flick up or down to change the setting you just 
selected using the Rotor.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.066
You can also change navigation element 
settings with the Rotor. 

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:49.499
Two such settings are Headings and Words, to 
move by either when using the single finger flick 
up or down. 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:58.233
For example, if you choose Words in the Rotor, 
then use a single finger to flick down, you will 
move to the next word on the page, 

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:03.033
if one is found. If you next use the Rotor to 
choose Headings, a single finger flick

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:25.199
will now move by headings instead of words.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.466
We hope you have enjoyed learning some of the 
basic iPhone VoiceOver terms and commands.
