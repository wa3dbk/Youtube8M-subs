00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.610
The second video game crash isn't inevitable.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.200
Because, in my estimation, the video game
crash has already begun.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.340
I'm neither doomsaying or sensationalizing.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.680
It brings me no modicum of pleasure to divulge
this fact.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.270
But it is irrefutable fact.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.360
Don't write me off as one of the many fearmongers
of the fourth estate just yet, though.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.529
At least not until you've heard my reasons
why.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.669
We've seen it time and again in the industry.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.540
For every boom, arises an inevitable glut
of product... at which point the market goes

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.660
slack, demand is incapable of compensating
for a surplus of cookie-cutter product...

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.060
and the entire house of cards heads floorward.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.469
It's been acted out in microcosmic scale with
mini-trends in gaming such as the late '90s

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:52.610
RTS boom, the mid-'90s JRPG boom, the late
2000s music gaming boom, and at least a dozen

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.399
more mini-bubbles that have swollen only to
explode, leaving only studio closures, unemployed

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.510
programmers and consolidations in their wake,
as a result.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.960
The difference at those times... was that
most of the industry wasn't trying to emulate

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.390
RTS games back when that bull market took
a matador's saber to the ass.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.740
Right now... if you aren't targeting the popped-collared,
heineken-swilling, Dubstep-blaring Call of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.130
Duty cuntbag conglomerate... you are not making
money.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.119
Because Call of Duty and Halo... are essentially
the only massive successes during this industrywide

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.229
economic downturn.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.490
Which means when the multiplayer FPS bubble
bursts... it takes the entire industry along

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.490
with it.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.780
That... is BAD.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.780
Yes!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.060
There's the odd Minecraft... or Portal.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.460
But for every rule, there's an exception that
proves it!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.719
The first video game crash had its exceptions!

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.439
In Europe, the 1983 video game crash led to
a boom period for home computers like the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710
Commodore 64 and the BBC Micro.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.540
In short... the presence of a crash... does
not guarantee an absence of product... or

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.510
even an absence of profitable product.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.270
So consider that a pre-emptive 'shut the fuck
up'.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.830
Independent and middle-market studios - see:
BioWare, Naughty Dog or Insomniac - facing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.820
the realities of diminishing returns - have
found themselves either consolidated into

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.910
one of the big 5 publishers or... they've
just flat-out failed to pay the light bill,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.220
and found themselves walking the fiduciary
plank.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.490
See also: Pandemic, Looking Glass Studios,
Black Isle, Troika... and at least several

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.460
dozen others presently occupying corporate
landfills across America.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.840
The problem?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.560
Pliability equals maneuverability.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.131
And bulbous, man-tittied fatass corporations
like Electronic Arts and Square Enix... are

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.070
- by their very nature - impliable.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.490
They can't afford to be.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.110
They have shareholders to satisfy.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.920
Not that EA has to worry about that anymore!

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.920
But bringing shareholders along for the ride
means justifying every move - and every permutation

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.960
of that move - on the corporate chessboard
before allowing yourself to proceed.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.960
The R.M.S.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.260
Titanic isn't a gigantic metalliferous coral
reef at the bottom of the Atlantic right now

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.080
simply because it slammed into an iceberg.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080
The R.M.S.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.900
Titanic sank because it was too large... and
traveling at too great a speed... to adequately

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.920
course-correct when the lookouts first spotted
a jagged mountain of razor-sharp fucking ice.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.850
And that, to me, is the tragedy of the modern
video game industry.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.530
These massive publishing conglomerates have
spent the better part of two full decades

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.370
gorging themselves on the libidinous excess
of the second boom period of gaming... that

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.420
now they're obese... they have the maneuverability
of a cast-iron bath tub... and with the advent

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.540
of the next gen... they've illustrated quite
clearly that they're thundering full speed

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.540
ahead!

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.810
But where the industry is divergent from the
Titanic analogy... is that the iceberg isn't

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.590
looming ahead in icy waters... they've already
slammed into it.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.410
They slammed into the fucking thing back in
2008 and they've been taking on water ever

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.410
since.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.540
But, instead of boarding lifeboats and shouting
'women and children first', they're doggedly

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.060
plowing forward, convinced they're impervious
to the laws of economic causality.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.640
To name-check yet another insufferably shitty
nautical disaster flick... it's The Perfect

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640
Storm!

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.980
The signs are every fucking where!

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.631
And if you sincerely believe there's anyone
occupying a corner office in one of these

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:03.740
corporate megaplexes with the discernment
to read these tea leaves... might I direct

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.870
you to the fact that these were the same industry
insiders who boldly proclaimed in 2007, that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.990
the video game industry is 'Recession Proof'?!

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.620
It's not coming.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.710
It's here.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.130
It's the adipose elephant in the room that
no one wants to talk about, and yet they expect

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.959
us all to shovel it's fucking shit.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.210
I'm RazÃ¶rFist.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.320
God - fucking - SPEED!
