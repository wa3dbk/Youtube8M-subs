00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.434
Hi everyone, this is rprentki

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:04.434
with another tutorial video for EyeWire

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:06.529
This is going to be one for a

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.127
starburst amacrine cell

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:09.626
They are a little bit more difficult

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.624
They are characterized by

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.122
long thin branches

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.120
that will usually go across the cube

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.117
and the occasional blob

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.115
they are difficult because the branches

00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:21.113
are so thin, that sometimes it is very

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:23.111
difficult to see in the 2D

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.609
Let's get started

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.105
and again they almost always go across the cube

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:30.103
You'll notice that our starter piece ends midway through

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:33.599
and that it has a flat edge right here

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.097
so if it's got a flat or jagged edge

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.695
that usually means that there is something missing

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:41.091
if it had a rounded edge, that could mean that it's finished

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:43.089
alright, let's get started

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.086
and a quick thing to note, you'll see right here

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.084
that there's a little bit of

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:49.082
blue outside the line

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:51.080
if I hit shift, you can see that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.077
so this is just a mistake that the AI,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:55.075
the artificial intelligence, made

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.073
and this happens once in a while

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:59.071
It's good, but it's not perfect

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.069
the important thing to do is you want to make sure

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:03.066
that you don't continue the computer's mistake

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.064
and what I mean by that is

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:07.062
that this one right here, this big one

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:09.060
is what's actually correct

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.057
this little bit is incorrect

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.055
so i don't want to add anything else to the

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:15.053
incorrect part, so I'm just going to ignore

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:17.053
it and pretend it's not there

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.046
Okay, so it's disappeared now

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:23.046
so we can just move on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.034
alright, so this is what I mean when I said that

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:34.032
it can be extremely hard to see.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.030
sometimes the outline is even

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.027
really fuzzy, or almost gone

00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:40.025
and so what you have to do is try to

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:42.023
figure out what the shape was

00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:44.021
So I can see right here that the

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.017
shape curved slightly, up here

00:01:47.017 --> 00:01:50.014
So we're going to try following that

00:01:50.014 --> 00:01:52.511
and when you pick up something that's this large

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.009
and you can see that in the 3D that this is a very large piece

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.006
you always want to make sure that it looks right

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.003
in the 3D, so I'm going to zoom in a little bit

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.001
and then take a look, alright

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.999
So, it looks to me

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.596
like it flows very well

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:09.992
so it's a smooth continuation

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:11.990
and this is the blob that I was

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.987
talking about earlier, so a there's a

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:15.486
long branch, then a blob

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:17.983
Sometimes these will have several little nubs

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:20.980
coming out of them, almost always there will be one

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.477
long branch continuing out of it as well

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.475
and that will hit the other side of the cube

00:02:25.475 --> 00:02:26.975
so let's continue on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.969
Alright, so I'm focusing on the blob here

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.966
right now, because I can see in the

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:34.964
3D that there's some jagged

00:02:34.964 --> 00:02:36.962
little bits, and you can see

00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:38.960
the little missing pieces

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.960
so I want to get those before I continue all the way across

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:54.942
Alright, looks like that disappears

00:02:54.942 --> 00:02:56.940
Now let's go back and follow the one

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.937
long branch all the way across

00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:01.937
alright, so it looks like it goes here

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.917
alright and it looks like that hit the edge and disappeared

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:18.917
so now we're done
