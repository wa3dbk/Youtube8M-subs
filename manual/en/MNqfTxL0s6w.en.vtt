Utah offers a close up look at stunning vistas

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.420
and landscapes, while affording you and your

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.699
in a glorious, unspoiled environment.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.640
No matter what time of year you choose to
travel, Utah has plenty of fun and adventure

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.269
waiting for you.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.800
From points both east and west, head out on
I-70 to Moab, with your first stop at Arches

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.970
National Park.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.910
Arches preserves more than 2,000 natural sandstone
arches, like the world-famous Delicate Arch.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.510
Plan on spending at least a few hours in the
park, exploring the scenic drive and several

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.740
of the viewpoints and short trails.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.420
The extraordinary features of Arches National
Park create a landscape of contrasting colors,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.800
landforms and textures.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.050
And if you hit Moab during early September
you can check out the Moab Music Festival

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.160
where world-class jazz musicians meet stunning
red-rock venues for an outdoor experience

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
like no other.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.620
Head South-Southwest out of Arches and you’re
on your way to Canyonlands National Park.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.229
Canyonlands is a unique park that’s been
described as “the most weird, wonderful,

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.420
magical place on earth” Visit Canyonlands’
Mesa Arch to reconnect, recharge and refocus.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.560
Within a half-hour of both Arches and Canyonlands
National Parks, you’ll find plenty of campgrounds

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.359
to serve as your base camp for a good night’s
rest or an extended stay.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.119
If hitting the water is your thing, be sure
to take a trip down the Green River while

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.380
in the Canyonlands area.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.369
Next up on your itinerary is Capitol Reef
National Park, located in south-central Utah.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.409
You’ll know you’re in the heart of red-rock
country as you explore the cliffs, canyons,

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.880
domes, and bridges in the Waterpocket Fold,
a geologic monocline extending almost 100

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.950
miles.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.920
The drive from Capitol Reef to Bryce Canyon,
your next stop, takes you through Dixie National

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.499
Forest – a nearly 200 million acre forest
filled with a wide variety of scenery from

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.789
desert vistas to thick pockets of green pine,
fir and spruce trees!

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.250
Just outside of Dixie National Forest sites

of extreme action!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.900
Keep your eyes peeled for Bryce Canyon’s
hoodoos.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.129
These unique all-natural rock structures can
be up to 10-stories high.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.450
The hoodoos are just one more reason Bryce
Canyon is a haven for all types of travelers,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.500

first national park – Zion, where you’ll

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.189
find massive canyon walls that ascend toward
a brilliant blue sky.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.640
To experience Zion, you need to walk among
the towering cliffs, or challenge your courage

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.629
in a small narrow canyon.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.150
