00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.830
The Monday morning “pulse report” for
seafood purchasers.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.039
Some Fast Facts to start this week’s insight:
Watch Pollock Fillet pricing. Raw material

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:18.510
prices have not been set yet and from a market
standpoint I see nothing but downward pressure.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.590
In news this week
The Pacific Cod market is tight.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.780
Despite the fact that the Pacific Cod quota
is up 23 percent this year prices are holding

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.950
steady and Halibut is the reason why.
Skyrocketing Halibut prices are creating turmoil

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.570
in the global Whitefish market.
The Pacific Halibut quota is down 19 percent

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.329
this year and many buyers are switching to
less expensive products such as Pacific Cod.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.510
Another factor keeping the Pacific Cod market
tight is supply and demand of its counterpart

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.200
Atlantic Cod.
Europeans historically consume large amounts

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.170
of Cod.
In recent years Europe has imported increased

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.010
quantities of Pacific Cod to replace a shrinking
Atlantic Cod supply.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.009
Atlantic Cod supply in Europe will continue
to be low until the season opens this spring

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.109
at that time prices may drop a bit.
Atlantic Cod quotas are up 16 percent over

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:16.380
last year and an increase in supply may reduce
demand for Pacific species.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.600
In addition a weaker Euro will make Pacific
Cod more expensive to EU buyers.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.520
In the meantime expect prices to hold steady.
The effect of the big quota drop for Pacific

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.950
Halibut doesn’t end there.
Just as Halibut buyers are switching to Pacific

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.319
Cod Pacific Cod buyers are switching to Alaskan
Pollock.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:43.749
And so despite a 54 perecent quota increase
for Alaskan Pollock prices are holding firm.

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.719
Elsewhere Russian companies are selling more
whitefish to their domestic market.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:53.630
Consequently more Pollock is remaining in
the Far East driving up prices for raw materials.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.989
As many of you know at Tradex we take great
pride in our stringent quality standards.

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.329
We employ our OWN quality supervisors around
the globe.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.630
In British Columbia Alaska China AND Vietnam.
On a recent visit to an Alaskan processing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.310
plant Michael Warren who oversees Quality
Control at Tradex Foods filmed a production

00:02:11.310 --> 00:05:35.680
run with Mel Morris our Alaskan Quality Supervisor.
This video truly takes you to the source…

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.770
We hope you enjoyed some insight into our
Alaskan Processing Operations.
