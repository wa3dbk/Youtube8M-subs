00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.600
Ew.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.540
Cards.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.480
Hearts.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.420
Chocolate.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.350
Love.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.290
Love.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.110
Flowers and chocolate.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.360
Roses and commercialism.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.359
Bearcat is pretty sexy.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.369
I think Baxter.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.939
Gotta give it to Harvey.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:32.939
Baxter.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:33.939
Baxter.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:34.939
Probably go with Stenger.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:35.939
He has the PhD.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.480
It's the president, you could call me any
time.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.359
You know where I am.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.510
There's not many romantic things to do in
Binghamton.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.510
In Binghamton?

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.870
Oh my God
Is that a trick question?

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.350
I've actually gone to the conservatory a few
times and you get to watch the stars.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.999
I think the Rat is pretty romantic.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.299
You've never even been there!

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.959
I'm a lover.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:06.549
I try every year to hate Valentine's Day when
I'm all alone, but I really can't.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.549
Neutral.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.210
I'd like to say I'm right down the middle.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:22.890
There are things I love about it, things I
hate about it.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.890
Hater.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.890
Hater, definitely.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.890
I'm a lover.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.890
I love Valentine's Day.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.890
I love Valentine's Day.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.890
All of Dickinson.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.890
That would have to be Bartle.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.890
Library.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.890
The library.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.890
Dining halls.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.890
Dining hall?

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.719
That's gotta be a gross bathroom somewhere
in here.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.820
Perfect day would be to go to dinner and just
have a good discussion.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.820
Talk and maybe watch a movie after.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.900
Not go to the movies, watch a movie back in
your place.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.900
Kissing on the mouth?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.249
Take him out to dinner, maybe a movie.

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:47.380
Probably dinner and a movie.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.840
Well, something I like to do is a little bit
more exciting.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.569
Not just, like, a dinner and a movie.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.850
Dinner and a movie.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.030
Yeah, similar like that.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.030
I'll make dinner though.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:08.009
Probably a movie first and then dinner so
that we can talk about it during the dinner.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.039
I don't know, that would be tricky.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.039
Love.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.039
Flowers.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.039
Roses.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.039
Chocolate.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.039
Flowers.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.039
Chocolate.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.039
Roses, bears, candy, all that.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.390
I go all out.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.450
What if all of them were?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.750
I was dumped on Valentine's Day once.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.209
I'm pretty fortunate.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.819
My boyfriend asked me out the day before Valentine's
Day and then didn't show up for school or

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.910
to hang out because he was "sick."

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.220
Threw up in my shower one time.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.120
I went to go visit my ex-boyfriend on Valentine's
Day and he wished another girl happy Valentine's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Day before me.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.640
Sat in Taco Bell to eat by myself.
