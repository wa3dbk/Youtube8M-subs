00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.800
Baby, I'm a broken man

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.740
I'm just a shattering storm

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.020
Baby, try to find my way

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.640
As the lonely shadows swarm

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.180
Whoa whoa whoa, I'm just a man

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.880
Missing you, please understand

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.660
Without you~, I'm dying

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.620
No, no one will know

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.940
How I bear my pain alone

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.220
In the end

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.200
I choose my solitude

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.200
No, I can't go back

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.740
To my days of innocence

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.460
Can't go back

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.960
There is no return

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.480
Another cycle of seasons has passed us by and I can't help

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.240
I wonder I wonder I wonder just where you are now

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.160
I hear from everyone that you are different

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.760
And that you are yet more beautiful than before

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.520
Whoa whoa

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.180
If you say that you are happier now

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.920
And that's just the way you feel about everything now

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.800
Well then I guess it's just the way

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.020
That it is
