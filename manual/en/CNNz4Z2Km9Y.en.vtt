What's up guys? Kevin here from SnowboardProCamp.com. In this beginner snowboard video

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.130
 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm going to teach you how to toe turn. When you first start snowboarding

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.600
turning onto your toes can be difficult,
but I've got three tips to help you out.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.880
 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.000
First let's break down the toe turn. Get ready for
the turn by controlling your speed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.100
on your heel edge.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.249
Look and point downhill to get your
snowboard going straight and flat.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.210
Start to turn your body to the top for
the slope and pressure your toe edge

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.179
to complete the turn.

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.109
Control your speed on your toe edge and 
get ready for the next turn.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.359
To get your snowboard going straight and
flat

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.900
reach your front hand towards the snow.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.769
This will get more weight over your
front foot, helping to get your snowboard

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.300
to go straight.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.309
 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.300
Continue to reach towards the snow

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.320
and get more weight over your front foot
throughout the turn. To get onto your toe

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.410
edge pull your back hand backwards. Your
snowboard will follow

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.460
whatever your upper body does. By pulling
your back hand backwards

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.270
your upper body will turn to face the
top of the slope and your snowboard will

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.840
follow.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.470
When you pull your hand back, make sure you're
pressuring you toe edge

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.900
and your head is looking up the slope. To
complete the turn

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.350
and control your speed practice sliding
on your toes.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.890
Solid toe sliding will give you the
confidence to commit to the turn

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.700
and control your speed once the turn is
completed. Sliding on your toes

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.090
is the most important skill for toe turns, so practice until you super

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.700
comfortable.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.180
Let me know

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.300
how your toe turns go. Leave me any
questions in the comment box

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.200
