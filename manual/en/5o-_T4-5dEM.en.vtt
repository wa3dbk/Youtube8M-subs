00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.689
The truss rod adjustment is a delicate operation.
It's very easy to break them if you go too

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:14.210
far. We've already removed the truss rod cover.
And, ideally, it would nice if we can release

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.060
some of the middle strings so that we have
some room to move. So, I'm going to loosen

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.530
these two center strings so that I can pull
them out of the way. But I don't want to completely

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.110
remove all the strings because once we do,
we release the tension on the neck and then

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.520
all of the adjustments inside change. Remove
those two, the thing that I want to make sure

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.880
that I do is find the right size Allen wrench
to make the adjustment. This particular one

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:53.320
has this, this will do and what we'll do is
we want to test it. If we see a warp, then

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:02.190
we want to, if it's warping up, then typically
we're going to go, in a, I guess that would

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.360
be a clockwise motion in order to increase
the tension and as the increased tension goes

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.750
that warp should go down. We only want to
go one quarter turn at a time in order to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.740
make an adjustment. Then let it sit for a
moment, actually probably five minutes be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:32.140
wise. Test for straightness again and if it's
straight then you can stop the adjustment.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.799
That's the process. If it's warping the other
way, which is more rare, then you make the

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:48.460
adjustment going this direction. If you're
finding that it doesn't want to move, then

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.110
there's a possibility that your truss rod
has rusted. Whatever you do, the important

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.390
thing is not to force it. You're likely to
cause the nut that creates the possibility

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.450
of making the adjustment to break and then
you've got a much more expensive problem to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.960
deal with.
