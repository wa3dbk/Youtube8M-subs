00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.690
Hello everyone and welcome to this week game
development log video diary! And this week

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.800
I have a huge amount to show you such as the
improved animation system,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.969
new features in the world editor and loads
of new models.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.270
So we'll start off with the animation system
which I've been redoing this week in preparation

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.510
for the big upcoming combat system update.
Unfortunately I haven't

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.890
changed any of the actual animations, so they're
still as bad as ever, but I do now have a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.070
few more features to the animation system.
Firstly, in the old system the player could

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.280
only do one animation at once, so it could
do a running animation, or it could do an

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.320
attack animation, but it
couldn't do both at once. So this week I changed

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.190
the system so that there are now 2 different
types of animations, movement animations like

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.760
running, walking,
jumping, turning, etc. and action animations

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.130
which are basically everything else. At any
time the player can now carry out one movement

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.969
animation and also one action
animation. You can still do movement animations

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.290
on their own, and you can still do action
animations on their own, but you can also

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.470
now do them at the same
time, meaning that the player can move and

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.580
attack all at once.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.470
As well as that I also wanted to add a feature
that would allow any bone in the model to

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.540
have an extra rotation added to it, so that
I could program any bone

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.710
to face in any direction if necessary. And
that's what I've done here, allowing me to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.939
control the top half of the player's body
with the mouse, no

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.490
matter what animation it is doing.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.390
Finally, I also realized that my current movement
system wouldn't work very well in combat,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.900
because rotating the player with the A and
D key's made it very hard

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.939
to aim accurately at anything. So I programmed
a new movement system which now uses the mouse

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.910
to control the player's rotation , giving
you much more control over

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.259
your aim. You still move the player forwards
and backwards with the W and S keys, but you

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.729
can also now strafe using the A and D keys.
And this is where that feature

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.259
that I was just talking about comes into use,
because it allowed me to rotate the player's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.550
upper body to always face forward, despite
the lower body facing in a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.640
different direction.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.720
Away from the animation system I also added
some new features to the world editor. Firstly,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.060
you'll see that I've implemented different
categories in the entity's

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.680
tab, making it much easier to find the entity
that you want to place. Secondly, I also made

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.360
it possible to now place mobs in the world,
just like you would place any

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.290
normal entities. This generates a text file
with information about the mobs which I can

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.110
then give to the server to read, and therefore
it allows the server to spawn

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.370
mobs in the chosen locations.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.209
As well as that entities now have a y position
slider allowing you to change their height

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.510
in the world, there's also a plane placement
option which allows you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.310
to choose a height for all entities to be
placed on, instead of them being automatically

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.810
being placed on the terrain, and finally there's
a randomize rotation option

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.790
which is good for when you're placing plants
and trees and you don't want to have to manually

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.520
rotate each one.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.540
Back in the game, there are a huge number
of new models that you guys have been making

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.030
over the holidays, and I've been putting as
many of them as possible into

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.110
the world. So I'm just going to take you on
a quick tour around the world to show off

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.710
some of these new amazing models. Also, while
my player makes his way over to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.480
the town, I've started up a new album on my
Facebook page which is eventually going to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.030
contain pictures of all the models that you
guys have been making once

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.020
they're added to them game. So if you want
to have a look at what everyone has been creating

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.490
then do follow the link in the description,
and if you want to get

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.040
involved yourself then send me an email and
I'll give you links to the dev kit and any

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.220
other resources that you'll need.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.650
So here we are arriving at the town, we just
went through the new entrance and you'll have

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.280
also seen that there are now some stone walls
going all the way

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.480
around the town, and they've all been added
in since last time. In the town itself we've

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.620
got some very nice looking house models, I
think there are 3 new ones

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.900
in total and I'm slowly replacing all the
old houses with these much better looking

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.540
ones. Here on the right you can see a new
market stall that looks like it's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.269
selling some pots and stuff. If we go past
these old house models on the right you'll

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.349
be able to see the watchtower that was added
this week, and coming up on the left there

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:26.159
are also a couple of new models, like that
new lamp model there and that darker market

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.449
stall. I updated the texture for the leaves
on these trees on the right here, so that

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.770
they look slightly more realistic than they
did. A couple of new ferns on the left which

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.439
you'll recognize from the tutorial series.
That's a new lamp that we just went past,

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:47.949
the one with the fire. We're just going to
take a left here past the church, past that

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.210
new bench, down there, which was also added
in this week, and I think if we follow this

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.580
pathway up to the top it should lead us straight
back to the town center, just in time for

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.889
the sunset!

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.969
But that is it for this week, next week I'll
be finishing my work on the animation system

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.800
and I'll also be releasing the updated dev
kit with animation support, so do let me know

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.550
if you're interested in making some animations
for the game. After that I'll be starting

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.580
work on an improved weapons and armor system
before moving on to the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.050
combat system itself, but yeah thank you guys
very much for watching this video, thanks

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.479

the game, names are in the description below,

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.979
do subscribe if you haven't already, have
a fantastic week, and I will see you all,

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:34.559
