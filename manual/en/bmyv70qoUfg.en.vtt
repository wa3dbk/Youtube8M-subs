00:00:01.236 --> 00:00:02.829
- (clears throat)

00:00:02.829 --> 00:00:04.237
- I'm mean, what are we, what are we

00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:06.612
doing here Liz, this is insane.

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:09.972
- Cake. Pie. Equally delicious, right?

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:11.337
But are they?

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:13.869
Because people have a lot of
strong opinions about them.

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.146
So today, we're inviting people

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:17.375
from both camps to state their cases.

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:19.697
And maybe we'll finally
settle the age old debate.

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:22.878
Which is better? Pie, or cake?

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:26.562
(dramatic music)

00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:30.095
- I was born a man of pie.

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:32.347
- I far prefer cakes to pies.

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:35.342
- I'm a pie advocate
because I'm a grown ass man.

00:00:35.342 --> 00:00:37.080
- I am a cake enthusiast.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.059
- Team Pie!

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:38.823
- Team cake!

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:40.053
- I just hate cake.

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:42.027
- I'm ready to fuckin fight
about some cake and pie.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:45.069
(dramatic music)

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.251
- People eat pies every day, because a pie

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.968
is acceptable, a cake is
not acceptable every day.

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:51.252
- You pie every day?

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:53.830
- You can have any pie for
breakfast, you start having

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.337
cake for breakfast, you
look like a goddamn fool.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:59.077
- A pie, it's a step above
a PopTart. It really is.

00:00:59.077 --> 00:01:01.399
I'll fuck with a PopTart
fresh outta the toaster,

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.117
than I'll ever touch some pie.

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:05.439
- You go to Starbucks,
you'd see a cake represented

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.343
as breakfast food more
than you'd see a pie.

00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:09.201
- There's not like a bunch
of cakes at Starbucks,

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.338
there's cake pops,
which are not breakfast,

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:13.403
they're fucking snacks for crazy people.

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:15.982
- That is not the color of food.

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:18.326
- I'm sorry, but this
pecan pie looks like shit.

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:20.183
- You think this looks like shit?

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:21.298
- It does look like shit.

00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:22.389
- He thinks this looks like shit.

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:25.850
- Oh I'm sorry, compared
to the beauty of this?

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.940
- You have that artificial frosting,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.679
which is bad for everything and everybody.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.908
- I guarantee that's yellow five.

00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:34.742
I promise that shrinks penises.

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:36.832
- You also get chicken pot pie.

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:38.712
There's like 30 textures in that shit.

00:01:38.712 --> 00:01:41.059
- If anyone ever tries
to serve me a meat cake,

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.776
I'm gonna fuckin throw it in their face.

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:44.611
- Once you can have chicken in a pie,

00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:47.118
you've won the game,
there's no chicken cake.

00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:50.159
- Listen, that's true. There
are savory pies out there.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.762
And I don't know what
we're gonna do about that.

00:01:51.762 --> 00:01:52.648
- Crust.

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:56.558
- Look, we all love crust,
there's no getting around that.

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.240
- It can be savory or sweet
and it's not one dimensional.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.961
Like a cake--

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.088
- A cake isn't one dimensional,
it's literally layered.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:05.084
- Pie is versatile, yay! You
know what else is versatile?

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:07.522
Minivans, you know, Honda Odyssey are--

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.541
- I drive a minivan and I love it.

00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.003
- Pie is the Model T of desserts.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:13.397
It's like, it was cool in the 30s,

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:14.674
like you put it on the windowsill.

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:15.680
That was awesome.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.270
- What do you drive?

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.234
What's the cake equivalent of automobiles?

00:02:19.234 --> 00:02:20.324
- A Hyundai Sonata.

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.182
- Oh yeah, that's a real cake car.

00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:25.314
- Why would you have a Toyota
when you could have a Ferrari?

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:26.602
Ok? That's it.

00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:29.551
- Oh, I'm sorry, a pie is a Ferrari?

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:32.012
A pie? A pie is a Pony Express.

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:32.825
- It's got pizzazz!

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.403
- This, right here, this
little yellow number?

00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:36.400
This is a Lambo.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.674
- Pie can be made with nuts,
with fruits, with meats.

00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:41.927
Pie is everything we've wanted.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:46.062
It's even a gross term for a sexual part.

00:02:46.062 --> 00:02:46.784
- It is?

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:48.103
- Yeah, a vagina.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.589
(dramatic music)

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:52.775
- Cake is more of an event, you know,

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:54.771
we're having a piece of cake,
we're really celebrating.

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:56.722
Pie is like, oh cool, your grandma's over,

00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:58.416
let's have some, you know, pie.

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:00.716
- You don't celebrate
special occasions with pie.

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.014
- Hah! When it was my birthday,

00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:06.753
in the office, they bought me a pie.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:09.353
And it was pretty fuckin good. Yeah.

00:03:09.353 --> 00:03:10.978
- What do you do at your wedding day?

00:03:10.978 --> 00:03:11.995
Are you married Colin?

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:12.678
- No.

00:03:12.678 --> 00:03:13.575
- That's a shame.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:15.781
- Just put that in your head for a second.

00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:19.658
Birthday pie. No. Wedding pie. Ugh.

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:23.188
Like, this is just crap.
Crap crap crap crap crap.

00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:25.510
- The only reason that
cakes are done that way,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.388
that they're the popular item,
is because they're cheaper.

00:03:28.388 --> 00:03:31.639
The most popular flavor
of cake is vanilla.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.146
Vanilla is a word for boring.

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.423
- Look how simple your food looks.

00:03:36.423 --> 00:03:37.886
- Man, you're such an American.

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.718
Does everything have to look
like a goddamn roller coaster?

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:41.415
- Yes.

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:42.599
- Who likes sweet bread?

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.409
Like you're eating bread that's sweet.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.916
- Who likes sweet bread?
Her words, not mine.

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:51.376
I love sweet bread, you love
sweet bread, we love cake.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.977
- But if you were to go
to a fancy cake maker

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:55.439
oh my god, I wouldn't even want to

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.949
eat it because it's so beautiful.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.669
That, actually, is an
argument for pie. But...

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.548
(both laughing)

00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:04.828
(dramatic music)

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.624
- Let me cut you a good
slice of cake, alright.

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:10.084
- All of these revolt me,
there's so much frosting on it.

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:12.569
- Do I have to it it? Honestly,
I know what it tastes like.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.424
Guess what, it's fucking
vanilla, what a surprise.

00:04:15.424 --> 00:04:18.118
- This isn't even good cake.

00:04:18.118 --> 00:04:21.396
Ugh, it's so sugary.

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.626
- I wouldn't want a piece of hard fruit

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:26.037
in my thing that I really
gotta bite through.

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:28.650
- Sugar bread and sugar, what variety

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.647
I've been blessed to enjoy.

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.527
- It's like eatin candy, you know what?

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:34.895
You can go home and eat your runts

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:36.568
and sleep in your race car bed

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.262
and be the child that you want to be.

00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:42.768
That's fine, but I'm just sayin,
like, real adults eat pie.

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:44.849
- Let's agree on something though,

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.512
how do you feel about a strudel?

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:48.537
That shit makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:49.462
- I like strudel.

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:50.456
- Pffft.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.353
- Nothing Patrick said
has changed my mind,

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:54.350
I'm still a firm believer in pie.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.599
- Pie is, sure, it's good, I'll eat it.

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.875
- Great, it's settled, we done here?

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.121
I got work to do, I'm an adult.

00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:08.555
(dramatic music)

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.949
- What do you think red velvet is Patrick?

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.106
- It's not chocolate. It
sure as hell ain't chocolate.

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:16.896
- It's vanilla!

00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:17.639
- No, it's....

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.845
You wear hats on your feet and you put

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:22.572
shoes on your head, that's your pie logic.
