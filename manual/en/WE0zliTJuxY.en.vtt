build up while finishing

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.010
resilient, beautiful finish with fewer

in just a few simple steps you can give your pens
and projects a high-gloss finish that's

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.480
stunning and durable

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.680
let's get started

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.460
when woodturning follow all
manufacturer's safety guidelines

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.540
wear a face shield, and use proper dust protection

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.360
first have your blank turned and sanded to 400 grit

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.920
set your lathe speed to approximately 500 rpm

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.360
apply a small amount of thin CA glue onto a paper
towel and quickly apply a thin coat on the blank

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.000
then spray with aerosol
activator to harden and seal the blank

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.800
next cover your finger with a plastic bag and
apply a thin coat of Insta-bond CA Pen Finish

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.860
using a consistent side-to-side motion
to spread the glue evenly

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.680
then spray with aerosol spray activator to harden

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020
repeat this process for three to five coats

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.980
next sand the blank using Abranet sanding screens through 600 grit

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.820
complete the process by wet sanding with
micro mash abrasives and then polish

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.300
with plastic polish
it's as simple as that

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.400
now you can enjoy a durable, high gloss
finish on your pen blanks and other small projects
