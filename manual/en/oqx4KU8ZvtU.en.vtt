00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.710
Hello, Jillian Batchelor, with the Batchelor
Group.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.590
And many of my clients are asking me: Why
I should buy a home before the end of 2013?

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.880
Well there are many reasons and if you've
been waiting for the best time to buy your

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.980
home well your wait might be over.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.710
In fact, if you take into a factor that there
are many considerations on why you should

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.699
buy your home before 2014 you can save a lot
of money.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.640
The reasons will include everything from rising
mortgage interest rates and home prices to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.140
the falling affordability indexes and the
fear of inflation other sources will say.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.590
Reason number one: interest rates will rise.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.340
One problem with historically low mortgage
interest rates is that they have no where

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.730
else to go but up.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.160
And a few months ago that's exactly what happened.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.111
Started in the beginning of June announced
by Ben Bernacke.

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:58.180
Bernacke said that he may begin to slow wind
down of quantum easing phase three.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.740
This is the Federal Reserve's program of buying
back mortgage backed securities and treasuries

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.579
from the banks in order to encourage the banks
to lower interest rates.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.630
And as a result, stimulate the economy.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.549
Immediately after Bernacke's announcement
there was a sharp rise in mortgage interest

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.749
rates and anywhere from a half to a full percentage.

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:24.659
Bernacke has since backed off that statement
a little since he first made it and interest

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.009
rates have settled a bit but quantum easing
three program must end and 2014 is a likely

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.569
time frame for that.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.740
There is absolutely no doubt that the rates
will rise once Bernacke does that.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.139
Rates only have one way to go when the Fed
stops buying all together and that's up.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:47.590
Wonder what rates will look like once the
quantum easing does end?

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.479
Well, we're all thinking somewhere between
five and a half percent to probably six percent

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.069
range.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.979
Reason number two: home prices are on the
rise.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.859
Interest rates aren't the only thing rising,
home prices are rising too.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.999
For instance, according to the July SMP Case
Shiller twenty city composite home price index

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:16.060
in May 2013 home values across the U.S. were
up approximately 12.1 percent from May 2012.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.280
So with home prices rising along with interest
rates rising indications action is needed

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.120
by home buyers.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.209
So every uptick of one percent interest rate
means ten percent less buying power.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.459
So if prices rise by ten percent and rates
go up by one percent, that means your buying

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.709
power decreases by twenty percent.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.549
That's the argument for buying in 2013 and
not waiting till 2014.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.640
Reason number three: homes are still affordable.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.660
Ever heard of the housing affordability index
is put out by the National Association of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.660
Realtors.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
And according to the Association it's based
on three things: relationship between median

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.030
home price, median family income, and average
mortgage interest rate.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.270
In 2013, January, the index hit a high with
a composite number of two hundred ten point

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.270
seven.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.470
An explanation of that number is somewhat
lengthy but essentially a value of one hundred

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.280
means a family earning the median national
income makes enough to qualify for a loan

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.440
on a home whose value is the national median
as well.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.500
So a value of two ten means that a family
earning the median national income has two

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.370
hundred percent or makes more than twice of
the income necessary to qualify for the same

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.500
home assuming a twenty percent down payment.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.730
That means that homes are very affordable
right now.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.850
However you should know that the affordability
index is sliding.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.310
In fact, in May, the last figures posted were
one seventy two point seven.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.810
In short, houses may get less affordable the
longer that you wait.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.969
Reason number four: to protect yourself from
inflation.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.299
Let's say you could strike a deal to pay today's
prices for milk, eggs, gasoline for the next

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.299
thirty years.

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.360
You'd probably take that deal, right?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.829
It would hedge you against inflation, which
is the price of goods and services increasing

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.900
as a result, leaving you with less buying
power.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.810
It's much the same way with a thirty year
mortgage fixed rate guards you against mortgage

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.000
against inflation.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.020
Especially when you get today's low interest
rates.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.360
