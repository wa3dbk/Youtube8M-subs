Hi, I'm Donna Karlsons with
the USDA's

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.934
Food Safety &amp;
Inspection Service.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:07.333
Spring celebrations can
often feature foods we

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.867
don't prepare as often
during the year, so here

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.600
are some food safety tips
to help you keep foodborne

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.200
illness from
ruining your party.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.300
As with any food
preparation, always begin

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.000
with the basics: clean,
separate, cook, and chill.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.367
Clean your hands often
with soap and warm water

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.300
and clean all surfaces and
utensils with soap and hot

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.400
water.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.200
Keep raw foods separate
from uncooked meats by

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.367
using separate cutting
boards and servers.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.100
And cook foods to a
safe minimum internal

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.867
temperatures and chill
leftovers promptly.

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:46.266
If eggs are part of your
celebration, store them in

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.967
the carton in your
refrigerator at 40 °F or

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.200
below.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.367
Eggs will keep good
quality for 3-5 weeks from

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.467
the date you
purchase them.

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:58.767
Many springtime
celebrations call for hard

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.734
cooking eggs.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.233
Cook the eggs until the
yolks are firm, cool them

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.867
in cold running water, and
refrigerate them within 2

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:07.600
hours.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.100
At this point you can make
deviled eggs or dye them.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.266
If you're going to dye
the eggs and hide them,

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.400
they'll still be safe to
eat - IF you hide them in

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.033
clean places, and retrieve
them within 2 hours.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.834
Shorten that to one
hour in hot weather.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.633
You may also want to
consider using plastic

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.400
eggs for the hunt.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.333
If you know the eggs have
been at room temperature

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.200
for longer than two hours,
or if there is any doubt,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.100
throw them out.

00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.667
Some typical meats for
spring celebrations

00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:38.100
include ham, pork
tenderloin, turkey breast

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.166
and corned beef.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.967
Pork, Ham, and beef should
reach a safe minimum

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.400
internal temperature of
145 degrees F as measured

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.934
with a food thermometer
before removing the meat

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.967
from the heat source.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.467
For safety and quality
allow meat to rest for at

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.467
least 3 minutes before
carving or consuming.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.967
Turkey breast should reach
a safe minimum internal

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:03.066
temperature of
165 degrees F.

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.266
After the meal, slice the
leftovers and store in

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.967
shallow containers in the
refrigerator promptly.

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:10.567
Don't let the meat or
eggs sit out at room

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.233
temperature for
more than 2 hours.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.667
The leftovers will be safe
in the refrigerator for 3

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.033
to 4 days.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.100
If you don't serve the
meats within the 3 to 4

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.867
days, you should
freeze them.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:25.400
Make sure your
freezer is at 0 °F.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.467
Apply the same guidelines
for ham, turkey breast or

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.700
other spring
seasoned meats.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.533
