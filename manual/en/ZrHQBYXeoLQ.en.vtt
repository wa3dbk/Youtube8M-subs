00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.920
This video explains how to set up your printer to use ePrint services on your printer or

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.259
the HP ePrintCenter. ePrint is a free service that allows you to print documents and photos

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.180
from any mobile or network connected device to your HP ePrint-enabled printer.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.500
In this step, we will show you how to enable web services. Web services must be enabled

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.640
on your HP printer in order to use ePrint services.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.400
Before you can enable web services, you must have your printer connected to the Internet

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.690
through a wired or wireless network connection.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.880
Because connecting your printer to a network is unique for your system configuration, we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.980
will not provide those instructions here.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.739
On the printer's control panel, touch the Web Services icon.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.950
Touch Settings.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.390
Touch Enable Web Services.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.239
Touch Accept to accept the terms of use and enable web services.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.530
At this point the printer will check for available updates for your printer.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.350
If a product update is pending, you must first perform that update to ensure that your printer

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.930
has the most up-to-date functionality.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.930
Touch Yes to apply the update if one is available.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.400
After your printer has applied all product updates, an information page will print out.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.790
The information page contains the printer code you will use to register your printer

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420
at the HP ePrintCenter.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.540
The next step is to register at the HP ePrintCenter. When you register at the HP ePrintCenter,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.470
you can customize your ePrint settings, view and manage your ePrint print jobs, and add

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.299
new print apps to your printer.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.200
From your computer open the web browser of your choice. For this video, we are using

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.060
Internet Explorer.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.340
Go to www.hpeprintcenter.com

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200
In the upper right corner of the web page, click the Sign In button.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.979
A ‘Sign In to ePrintCenter' page opens.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.090
Click Create an account from the right side of the page.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.810
The Create an HP Web Services account page opens.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.560
Enter your information in the text fields provided.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.560
In the Screen Name field, use a name of your choice. This name is a unique identifier for

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.310
you on the HP ePrintCenter web page. If a name is already registered by another user,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.310
you will be asked to choose a different screen name.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.680
Make sure that you use a password that you can easily remember.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.319
After entering all information and you have agreed with the terms of the site, click Create

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.200
Account.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.340
The Add a Printer to your Account page opens.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.560
Using the Web Services information page you previously printed out, type your printer

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.290
code in the ‘Enter Printer Code' text box, and click OK.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.319
A screen confirming that your printer has been added to HP's ePrintCenter will appear.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.129
Click the Next button.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.209
At this point you can enter a custom email address for your printer. You will first need

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.720
to clear the text box before entering your custom email address.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.290
You will use this email address when you send print jobs to your printer using ePrint.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.069
Once you have entered a custom email address, click the Check button to see if the email

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.870
address you entered is available for you to use.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.629
If the email address is currently in use by another ePrint user, you will be asked to

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.709
enter a different email address.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.230
Once you have checked an email address that is available, click Save to add this email

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.160
address to your account.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.660
The HP ePrint Settings page opens.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.920
Using the menu on the HP ePrint Settings page, you can customize your ePrint options, including

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.190
printer options and adjusting who can send print jobs

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.300
to your printer. Once you have adjusted your desired settings, click Save.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.050
After clicking Save, you will return to the HP ePrint Center where you can now manage

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.700
your ePrint settings, print jobs, and print apps.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.080
Your printer is now set up to use ePrint services.
