00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.790
Now we're going to talk about a walking bass
line.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.880
We're going to add some extra notes to make
it sound interesting, kind of more of a jazz

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.040
approach, jazz walking bass line.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.150
So, let's change the key back to the key G.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.779
We're going to add some chromatic notes.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.410
And so what I'm going to do, start off with
our G. I'm going to move up to A, play a B

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.070
flat or A sharp, if you prefer.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.670
Go up to B here.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.620
I've got to play four notes, because I'm playing
four beats to a measure.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.140
So I've got to play one, two, three, four
and then as soon as I land on the C, I'm now

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.640
in the C chord.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.160
So, as you can tell, that's a little bit more
interesting than going [playing notes] because

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:06.030
we're walking up [playing notes].

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.111
Now, let me explain what I'm doing there.

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.830
I'm kind of just improvising, so it's going
to be hard for me to explain.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.410
I didn't pre-plan this to know exactly what
I'm playing.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.410
That's the beauty of this.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.100
Once you get this kind of technique down,
you can improvise your bass line.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.590
One way to get used to improvising is to practice
how to get from chord to chord.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.090
So, [playing notes] as we did that one to
get to C, maybe practice how to get back to

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.280
the G chord [playing notes].

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.800
So, I'm climbing my way up to C [playing notes],
maybe I'll do that to get to a G chord [playing

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.930
notes] and I'm playing a G9.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.170
So, I'll do that again [playing notes].

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.210
C9 [playing notes], climbing up [playing notes],
now I'm climbing back down.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.120
I just felt, "Oh, I'm going to go back down
now," so [playing notes].

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:28.409
Back to the C [playing notes], back to G [playing
notes], there's my A minor chord [playing

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.749
notes].

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.521
Same approach that I did from G, but now I'm
doing it from A [playing notes].

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:39.180
I'm going up a tone [playing notes], a semi-tone
[playing notes], another semi-tone, these

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:52.500
are chromatic notes to climb up to the D [playing
notes].

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.120
Now, that's a really neat, easy way to create
a bass line, a walking bass line, by approaching

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:15.459
your chord tone, your root note, from either
a fret below or a fret above [playing notes].

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.029
Hopefully that will get you started on learning
how to do walking bass lines in a finger-style

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:21.379
approach.
