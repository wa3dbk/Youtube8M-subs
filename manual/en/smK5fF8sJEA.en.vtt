00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.330
[intro music]

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.819
&gt;&gt; Court: I’m at the Electric Bike Shop
in Sacramento, California.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.819
I’m with Mike.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.819
He’s the owner.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:08.819
Hey, Mike.

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:09.819
&gt;&gt; Mike: How you doing?

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:10.819
&gt;&gt; Court: I’m good.

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:11.819
You know, this is such a great bike.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:12.819
I’ve seen this around before.

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.290
It’s actually one of the more iconic bikes,
the A2B Metro.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.520
It’s got the front and rear suspension.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.850
These big tires kind of oversize.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.330
A big, you know, what is this, a gearless…?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.992
&gt;&gt; Mike: It’s a direct drive [hub] motor.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:24.992
&gt;&gt; Court: Direct drive hub motor.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:25.992
Yeah.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:26.992
I mean, so it’s kind of like a scooter.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:29.029
Even the seat, it reminds me of a Vespa.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.250
But I guess they’ve got a similar model
but now they kind of renamed it, the Octave,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.250
is that right?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.250
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.860
&gt;&gt; Court: So tell me, you know, take me a
walk through this, what features does it have

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860
in?

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.260
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, the battery is contained in
the down tube here.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.260
&gt;&gt; Court: Okay.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.510
&gt;&gt; Mike: And as an accessory, we can get a
secondary battery in the back to double the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.510
range.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.510
&gt;&gt; Court: Oh, I see.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.930
&gt;&gt; Mike: It has lights integrated into the
front rear, into the battery, you know, the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.690
main or the accessory battery.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.590
[It’s kind of cool], it’s got the neat
LED display that shows you your trip distance,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.329
speed and as well as your…

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.159
&gt;&gt; Court: There we go.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.360
&gt;&gt; Mike: You have [inaudible] level as well.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.720
It was formally Ultra Motor, now Hero Eco.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.810
This one is now going to be called the Octave
from what I’ve been told.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.810
&gt;&gt; Court: Okay.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.500
&gt;&gt; Mike: The velocity is changed to the [Alpha]
and then Alpha Plus which will offer pedal

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.220
assist as well as a throttle.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.220
&gt;&gt; Court: Okay.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.880
&gt;&gt; Mike: A fine bike to ride, great hill climber
with a smaller diameter wheels.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.310
I sold quite a few of these this last year.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.310
Great bike to have.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
&gt;&gt; Court: Awesome.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.620
Well, what’s the price range on this?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.620
This looks like 3500 bucks here.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.600
&gt;&gt; Mike: The newer ones are retailing at 3500.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.770
They were usually 3100 but with the new, they’ve
changed the key from the…

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.580
&gt;&gt; Court: That’s right.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.840
The key used to be down here.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.050
&gt;&gt; Mike: The frame up top here because people
will be kicking it and bending it all the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.050
time.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.050
&gt;&gt; Court: Yeah.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.329
&gt;&gt; Mike: One of the more comfortable electric
bikes to ride.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.611
&gt;&gt; Court: I think I’d agree with you.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:52.760
You know, yeah, sitting on this bike and cruising
around with all that suspension.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.350
Now, it’s not the lightest bike.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.460
And one of the challenges that I’ve had
is, you know, you go to a bike rack and then

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.159
try to get your cable through this thing or
if you have a car rack, there’s really no

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.270
straight top tube.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.270
&gt;&gt; Mike: Correct.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.930
&gt;&gt; Court: So it’s kind of like, you know,
park it in your garage and scoot to work,

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.930
something like that.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.510
&gt;&gt; Mike: I’ve actually sold quite a few
of the Hollywood racks, makes an electric

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.510
bike rack.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.800
It holds two 84-pound bikes.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.100
It’s perfect for this bike in Holly.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.840
Just [slides a receiver] on the back of a
truck and we’ll also fold it as well.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840
&gt;&gt; Court: Okay.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Well, thank you.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Again, this is really cool bike.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
I appreciate it.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840
&gt;&gt; Mike: You’re welcome.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.842
Thank you.
