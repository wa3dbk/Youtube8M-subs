00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.867
Welcome to the West Wing Week!

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:05.266
Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week!

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.567
Your guide to everything
that's happening at

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.667
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.000
This week, the President
announced a major new initiative

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.967
on food security; hosted
the G-8 and NATO Summits;

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:17.600
gave the commencement address
at Joplin High School and at

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.433
the U.S. Air Force Academy
in Colorado Springs;

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:23.033
and traveled to Iowa to
urge Congress to act on

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.133
the "to-do list."

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.734
It's May 18th to May 24th
or "We are not Meant to Walk

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.200
this Road Alone!"

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.567
On Friday, in anticipation of
the start of the G-8 Summit,

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.533
the President announced a major
initiative to address hunger in

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.567
Africa at the Symposium
on Global Agriculture and

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:39.600
Food Security.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.266
The President:
When tens of thousands
of children die from

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.467
the agony of starvation,
as in Somalia,

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:47.834
that sends us a message we've
still got a lot of work to do.

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:48.867
It's unacceptable.

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:49.767
It's an outrage.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:51.834
It's an affront to who we are.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:54.200
Narrator:
Then on only his
third day in office,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.900
newly-elected French President
Francois Hollande arrived at the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.066
White House before the start of
the G-8 and NATO Summits where

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.967
he sat down for discussions
with the President in the

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.100
Oval Office.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.700
Then it was on to the official
welcome at Camp David for each

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.233
of the leaders of the world's
eight largest economies.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.967
The 38th G-8 Summit at Camp
David represents the largest

00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:17.734
single gathering of world
leaders ever received at the

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.000
bucolic Presidential retreat
which was originally called

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.266
Shangri la and was
built by the WPA.

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.867
The world leaders expanded to
one of their working sessions to

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:29.533
address their newly-announced
Food Security Initiative.

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.834
And at the end of the Summit,
the President spoke on the

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:32.800
progress they made.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
The President:
As all of the leaders
here today agreed,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.400
growth in jobs must
be our top priority.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.600
Narrator:
That evening, it was on
to Chicago for the second

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.633
two-day summit of the week and
the first NATO summit hosted by

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:47.700
the United States outside
of Washington, D.C.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.266
Then the summit officially
kicked off with a greeting

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.433
ceremony and a working session
that began with a moving tribute

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.667
to honoring the dedication
and sacrifice of NATO forces

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:56.867
deployed around the world.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.967
(drums playing marching cadence)

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.133
On Monday, the President
participated in the

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.400
International Security
Assistance Force meeting

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.667
on Afghanistan with the
leaders of 60 nations.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.767
The President:
This will not mark the end
of Afghanistan challenges,

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.500
obviously, or our partnership
with that important country,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.900
but we are making substantial
progress against our core

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.600
objective of defeating al
Qaeda and denying it safehaven

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.800
while helping the Afghans
to stand on their own.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.900
I will leave Chicago
with a clear roadmap.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.000
Narrator:
That evening, the President
headed south and west to Joplin,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.934
Missouri, where he
delivered the commencement

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:33.934
address at Joplin High School's
graduation after devastating

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:36.066
tornadoes ravaged the
Joplin area nearly a

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:37.934
year ago to the day.

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:40.667
The Joplin community's
resilience and selflessness

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:44.100
in the face of tragedy has
continued to inspire our nation.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.567
The President:
So my deepest hope for
all of you is that as

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.834
you begin this new chapter
in your life you'll bring

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:54.433
that spirit of Joplin to
every place you travel,

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.300
to everything you do.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.133
You can serve as a reminder
that we're not meant to walk

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.433
this road alone.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.433
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
traveled to Colorado Springs --

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:06.967
(cheers and applause)

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.433
-- to give the commencement
address at Falcon Stadium where

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.433
he saluted and shook the
hand of every one of the 1,074

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:16.367
graduating Air Force cadets.

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:18.800
The President:
We know that the sovereignty
of nations cannot strangle the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.166
liberty of individuals and so
we stand with the student in

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.367
the street who demands a life
of dignity and opportunity.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.233
We stand with women
everywhere who deserve

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.300
the same rights as men.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.467
We stand with the activists
unbowed in their prison cells

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:36.533
and the leaders in
parliaments who's moving

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:40.467
her country towards democracy.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.800
We stand with the dissident
who seeks the freedom to say

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.834
what he pleases.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.700
The entrepreneur who wants
to start a business without

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.166
paying a bribe.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:51.600
And all those who strive
for justice and dignity.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.500
For they know, as we do,
that history is on the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.934
side of freedom.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.400
Overhead voice:
-- will you support and
defend the Constitution

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
of the United States --

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.633
(cheers and applause)

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:07.233
Narrator:
On Thursday, the President
traveled to TPI Composites,

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:10.200
a wind energy manufacturer
in Newton, Iowa, to highlight

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.700
the need to invest
in clean energy.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.734
His to-do list for Congress
includes extending the

00:04:14.734 --> 00:04:18.200
production tax credit and an
advanced energy manufacturing

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.600
tax credit, both of which would
support American-made clean

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.400
energy manufacturing
outfits like TPI.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.767
The President:
I'm calling on Congress
to extend tax credits that

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:32.834
are set to expire at the end
of the year for clean energy

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:34.867
companies like TPI.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:38.967

Before heading home, the
President conducted a Twitter

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:44.400
question and answer session
right there at TPI making him

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.033
the first President to actually
work within the confines of 140

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:50.233
characters or less.

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:52.233

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.700
I'm the master, I'm
the master twitterer.

The President:
That's the perfect tweet.

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:07.000
What's it called?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.600
Female TPI Employee:
A twoosh.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.166

A twoosh.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.800
