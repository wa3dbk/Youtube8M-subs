00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:06.058
- [Narrator] It began with a vision,

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:08.641
and a willingness to think big.

00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:11.761
- When Clemson University
set a goal of becoming

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.619
one of the nation's top
public universities,

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.570
some people asked why?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.816
Why push ourselves so hard?

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:21.378
Why set extremely high
standards and demand

00:00:21.378 --> 00:00:23.595
excellence in every endeavor?

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:26.224
Why drive our faculty and
staff to be more productive

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:30.358
and more creative than
they had already been?

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:31.358
This is why.

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:39.652
- [Narrator] It was
nurtured by determination,

00:00:39.652 --> 00:00:42.205
academic strength, and
the goal of building

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.235
the premier automotive and motorsports

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:47.031
educational facility in the world.

00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.082
But without the right catalyst,
a major private partner

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.274
with forward thinking leaders,
and creative state incentive

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:57.100
packages aimed at building an
economy based on innovation,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.683
it would still be just a dream.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.662
- It gives me great
pleasure to announce today

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:08.190
that the academic anchor of this campus

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.209
from this day on, will be known as the

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.097
Carroll A. Campbell Jr.
Graduate Engineering Center.

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:17.097
(audience applause)

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:27.183
- [Narrator] Soon, more lead
partners joined the team

00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:30.324
adding greater depth
and speeding momentum.

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:33.338
Along with world class
faculty drawn by the chance

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:36.784
to do something no
university had done before.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:40.603
And the vision became reality
as faculty industry leaders

00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:43.019
and graduate students work side by side

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.992
educating tomorrows engineers today.

00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:49.924
CU-ICAR, and the Campbell
Graduate Engineering Center,

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:54.091
a perfect alignment of vision,
partnership, and timing.
