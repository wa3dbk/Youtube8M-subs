00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.960
Hi, I'm Steve Jones and I'm going to show
you how to solve linear inequalities. Now

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.629
there are one or two tricks about this that
you don't get when you're solving linear equations.

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.780
So let's just look at this carefully. Here,
we've got four X minus two and it is less

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:35.950
than eight. Just a warning, is that if we
multiply or divide by a negative number we

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:44.600
must change that for that or vice versa. Just
a little one to remember because this is something

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.940
that people do and they suddenly find they
got the wrong answer and don't know why. Here

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.879
we know we can actually deal with it as though
it is an equation. But it isn't, it's an inequality.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.100
So four X minus two is eight, so what we can
do is add the same to both sides. Because

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.060
after all, if that is less than eight and
I add two to there, and add two to there,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.289
it is this side is still going to be bigger
than that. So if I add two here and I add

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.060
two here, they're still going to be equal.
This is the idea here we have six and here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.189
we have eight. Eight is bigger than six, but
if I add to the eight I get ten, add two to

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.859
the six I get eight, ten is still bigger than
eight. It hasn't changed things. So what I'm

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:48.149
now going to do is evaluate this. Four X minus
two plus two will leave me with just four

00:01:48.149 --> 00:02:00.499
X here. I'll still have my less than and I've
got eight plus two, that's ten. Well, that

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:08.500
seems fairly straightforward. So what I must
do now is divide by two, both sides, sorry

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.260
not by two, by four don't I, divide by four.
Because I've got four X. Okay. And I divide

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.200
this side by four as well. Okay. So four X
divided by four will just give me a plain

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.510
X, I've still got less than and I've got ten
divided by four, or two fours are eight, so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.200
that's two point five or two and a half, okay,
so X is two and a half or two point five depending

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.170
on how you're asked to express the result.
So essentially what we're saying here, we've

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.200
solved the equality, we know that the value
of X is less than two and a half or two point

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.430
five so it could be one, it could be zero,
it cannot be two point five, X is not equal

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.720
to two point five, it's less than. So it can't
be equal to two point five and it can't be

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:23.480
three or four or whatever after that. So here
is X and there is two point five, so in fact,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.900
our number is everything - X is everything
less than two point five. But not equal to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.490
two point five, so that is how we solve a
linear inequality, and remember if I did come,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.790
if this was minus four X, then I'd have to
be very careful because when I multiplied

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.100
by a minus here, I have to change this around.
Okay, good luck.
