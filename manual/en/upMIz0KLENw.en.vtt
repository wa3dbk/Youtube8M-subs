Hey Sweet Willy. Hey! Are they building your
kitchen? They're building my kitchen. They're

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:14.139
taking my old kitchen, and they're -- Ey yei
yei. Gracie has a concern. What is Gracie's

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.779
concern? I dunno, I just heard her voice.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.160
Grace, what is your concern?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.880
Oh, that nasty ceiling fan.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:35.580
Are you keeping this thing? No no no, it can
go. It can go. That ceiling fan has - all

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.930
the ceiling fans can fan. This is staying
here for -- Oh for a while? We get to keep

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.820
the refrigerator where it is for a while?
Well because eventually it's gonna have to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.520
move, but for right now - doesn't the old
one end up there anyway? The new one's gonna

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.380
-- I mean the new one, yeah. The same circuit's
gonna - okay cool, that's handy, we don't

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:04.390
have to put it in the living room. Or my office.
Which is really nice. Did you go out in the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.439
new living room? It's rather large.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.560
You want to see something amazing? Hello MTV,
welcome to my crib!

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.740
So they opened up the addition part, and attached
it to the rest of the house. So this was the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.579
dining room - here's the living room. Also
guys, I just need to show you something - anything

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.729
with the orange floor, that was our kitchen.
That was how tiny our kitchen was. The kitchen

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.060
was very teeny tiny, and there was our dining
room. This is so cool! And this was our living

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.899
room. This is where we filmed our videos.
This is where we used to film our videos,

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.090
and now this is - so all of this where Gracie
is, and where this refrigerator is, is gonna

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.240
be kitchen. So the kitchen's gonna be twice
as big, and then where Daddy is - over here

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.389
where this amazing window is - I'm so excited
about this window, be careful, don't trip

00:01:52.389 --> 00:02:02.460
on the electrical wires - is the living room!
It's like a living room. We could have people

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.880
over! We could have people over and they don't
have to sit on folding chairs. We could have

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:18.410
a couch and chairs! Oh my goodness, this is
amazing. Where are we gonna put the TV? The

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.270
TV's gonna go on that wall, yeah, cause we've
got this picture window. I wanted this giant

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.650
window. Guys do you like my fabulous Crocs?
Look at her fabulous Crocs. Yeah so the TV

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.640
will go on that wall, behind Daddy. And then
this over here, this is gonna be a countertop

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.930
and there's gonna be like bar stools so we
can eat breakfast. We're gonna have a breakfast

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.680
bar. We're gonna have two places to eat. You
could eat at the breakfast bar, or you could

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.510
eat at the other side where the old living
room is which is gonna be the dining room.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:01.060
Right, which is where we'll mostly eat dinner.
This is so insane! I am like so - so right

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.410
now. So so so. So. Sweet Willy's kitchen!

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:19.570
Future home of Sweet Willy's kitchen. Coming
soon. Oh my gosh. This is like, this is like

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:29.380
so dream come true right now. After 12 years,
we're finally doin' it! No, no spray paintin'

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.490
Daddy! No spray paintin'. He's whippin' out
the spray paint. What are you gonna tag? You

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:54.810
goin' back to your roots? Oh my gosh. Y? Y.
Sweet Willy's. Kitchen baby, c'mon. If you're

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.980
gonna do it, you do it.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.790
You're so good with spray paint. It's scary
how good Daddy is with that spray paint, it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.700
worries me a little bit. Ta-da!

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.910
This is called parenting bad example. He just
taught her how to play with spray paint on

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.900
the walls. This is how to do it. This is great.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.900
Beautiful! I'm a good artist. You're a great
artist. Mommy's not gonna play with the spray

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.240
paint, cause I always get it all over my finger.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.780
Mine's dripping. It always drips, that's the
spray paint look. Look, it looks like it's

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.689
bleeding. Alright, so Daddy, you're gonna
go get us some baby gates? And some dinner?

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:48.370
Yeah, what do we want for dinner? I dunno,
what do we want for dinner Gracie? Get Chili's

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.930
to go. Chili's to go. That works. What do
you want? Um, yeah I have to think about that,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.159
cause I can't eat much. Oh you know what - okay
you guys don't wanna hear what I want for

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:05.379
dinner, so say bye Sweet Willy's kitchen!
