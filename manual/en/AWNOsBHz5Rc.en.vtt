00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.530
 according to me it looks like

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.910
Iphone

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.250
similar

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.970
premium

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.790
look on this side

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.710
we have a ringer over here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.659
but you know

and the New Model of this phone samsung Galaxy Mini 2

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.010
had also a NFC Option

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.900

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.770
speaker ring that but

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.740
The New Galaxy 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469
The Samsung Galaxy Music

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.090

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.880
If you measure this on any phone
