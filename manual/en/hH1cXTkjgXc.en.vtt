00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.660
Pork thigh in casserole

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.200
hello my friends!

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.340
many times if we have a celebration or we have invited some friends home

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.800
we need more portions than usual

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.320
so we have to use big pieces of meat

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.700
although this is a very good solution , without much difficulty we have enough portions

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.200
and a spectacular plate

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.060
we will prepare some of these kind of recipes

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.060
one of these recipes is the pork thigh cooked in casserole with vegetables

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.080
let's see up close the meat

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.240
as you can see here we have a piece of pork thigh

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.300
is a single piece

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.820
which is lean meat except a small amount of fat on the outside

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.020
the fat is usefull here , cause we don't want our meat to dry off completeley when cooked

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.680
if there are nerves on the meat remove them

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.180
we will add salt &amp; pepper on the meat

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.760
add some garlic sticks , by piercing the meat in various points

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.140
this will give a unique flavor

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.840
now we will give the meat some color in the pan

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.480
when the oil start to burn , add the meat in the pan

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.860
to give it color and armor it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.600
take an onion and cut it in four pieces

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.840
also some carrot pieces

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.740
these vegetables will be also usefull in our sauce

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.480
the amount of liquids that will be left off in the casserole, will be used to make a sauce

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.800
little leaf of leek

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.880
some sprigs from dill

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.780
sorry i meant parsley

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.480
also little celery

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.200
bay leaves

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
a piece of cinnamon wood

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.280
pepper grain

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860
and one garlic clove

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.940
with caution flip the meat

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.920
we can see the nice color on top

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.740
you can also see the veggies in the casserole

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560
we will add the meat on top of the veggies

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.140
3 to 4 minutes in every side it's enough

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.520
you can see what a nice color it has

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.940
now add the meat in the casserole on top of veggies

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.080
with caution add some white wine to the pan

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.360
and then add it in the casserole

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.060
if we have many fats inside the casserole , remove some of them and let a tiny amount of fat

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.560
enough so that our veggies will boil inside

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880
doen't need so much fluids

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.140
add little fresh green pepper

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020
and little more white wine

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.360
it's ready for the oven

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.680
close the lid

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.720
after about 2 hours the pork thigh is ready!

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.340
let's see it inside the casserole with the veggies and fluids

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.480
you can see how the thigh looks in the casserole

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.000
we still have some fluids

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.300
we want these fluids inside , because next we will prepare the sauce

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.800
now we will remove from the casserole and serve it in a platter

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.620
we have served the pork thigh in a nice platter and decorate it

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.120
then put in the middle of the table and cut slices

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.660
and accompany it with his sauce

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.320
i will tell you later on for the sauce

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.760
now i will show you how we can see if the thigh is properly baked

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.800
it's better to see in close

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.420
beside the amount of time i tell you to put it in the oven

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.600
we can have a meat thermometer like this one , so we can see the temperature in the center of the meat

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.560
which must be above 80-85 degrees Celsius

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.240
another way is

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120
pierce with a skewer

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.880
and see what fluids come out

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.800
if the fluids that coming out are clear

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000
mean it's ready

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.660
if the fluids are rosÃ© or red

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.940
mean it needs a bit more

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.100
the fluids must be clear

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.180
the sauce that accompany the thigh

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.060
is the fluids with the veggies from the casserole

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.840
we will strain the fluids with a strainer

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.600
with a ladle ,we will press the melted vegetables to take their flavor

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.500
then we will put all of these fluids in a pot to boil and will tie them with corn flour

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.420
in little cold water we will dissolve little corn flour and add it inside

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
and the sauce is ready , bon appetit!!!
