00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.940
It’s not every day that a video game gets
recognition as being anything other than a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.430
toy meant to amuse children. In fact, 
video games are far more likely to be the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.980
target of widespread moral panic when given
their time in the mainstream limelight, whether

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.520
it be about excessive ultraviolence, or the
realization that children may be witness to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.150
the horror that is video game sex scenes.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.370
Sometimes, however, a game will get recognized
as something more--as something culturally significant--something

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.570
like The Witcher.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
Maybe it doesn’t seem that important in
the United States. But in Poland? In Poland,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
the Witcher is so popular that it’s become
something more than a pop culture phenomenon--it’s

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.329
touted as a modern embodiment of Slavic and
Polish historical pride. So don your Sukmana,

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.249
dust off your Crakows, and warm up some Kiełbasa
we’re exploring the Hidden History of The

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.021
Witcher.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.160
The Witcher is a game series based on books
written by the Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.580
In the series, a witcher
is a mutated superhuman created to fight monsters

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.069
with a combination of swords, traps, and magic.
The word Sapowski created to describe this

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.149
superhuman was "Wiedzmin"  which
is remarkably similar to Wiedźmiak,

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.690
a polish word that describes a male witch
in Slavic Mythology, also called a Vedmak.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.940
A Vedmak healed humans and animals, fought
witches, and protected humanity from the forces

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.959
of evil. But it carried some negative connotations
as well. Vedmak were believed to be connected

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.200
to the Devil, and were capable of spreading
plagues, killing livestock, and destroying

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.720
harvests. They were considered possibly benevolent,
but were widely feared and treated with great

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.390
suspicion. Sound familiar?

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.429
Sapowski and the development team at CDProjekt
Red dug deep into European, Slavic, and Polish

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.720
folklore to breathe live into the plethora
of creatures that fill the Beastiary of The

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.640
Witcher's world. Beasts like the Kayran, which
resembles old depictions of the Kracken, a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.709
giant tentacled sea creature that's reputed
to target ships in the deep sea. But maybe

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.229
that one's a bit too obvious.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.270
Well, what about the Noonwraith from The Witcher
and The Witcher 3? Most monsters from games

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.670
and legends wait until nightfall to prey on
defenseless mortals, but not so with the Noonwraith--attacking

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.060
in the middle of the day, Noonwraiths appear
as sun-scorched women and attack farmers and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.510
other folk when they least expect it. This
almost certainly is a reference to the tales

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.710
of Pscipolnitsa.... Just put it...I'm just going to put it on the screen there.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.980
She is also know as Lady Midday, a noon demon
from slavic folklore that appears in the middle

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.629
of the longest, hottest days of summer, brandishing
a scythe or shears.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.930
Then there's the Striga from the first game.
Created when a woman is cursed into the form

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.340
of a wild beast, it may seem somewhat similar
to werewolves, but there's quite a bit more

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.579
to it than that. In the Polish version of
the game, the word used is not "Striga," but

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.319
"Strzyga," which is also a demon from old
slavic tales. Often female, people born with

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.329
two hearts, two sets of teeth were believed
to be potential Strzygas. It was believed

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.450
that, when a Strzyga died, only the human
soul passed on to the after life, while leaving

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.239
a fully-fledged Strzyga behind in our world.
These demons would fly around the air at night

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.480
and attack travellers, sucking out their blood
and eating their internal organs. In order

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.719
to keep a suspected Strzyga from rising from
the grave and attacking passersby, they were

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.219
to be decapitated, with the head buried separately
from the body. Bleh.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.360
If you're not sitting down, now's the time,
for I'm going to tell you a little story:

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.579
deep in the woods, far away from civilization,
paved roads, taxes, rules and those that enforce

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.849
them lives an old woman--maybe the oldest
woman in the world. She's a bit hard to find,

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.159
because she lives in a hut which walks all
by itself on a pair of chicken legs--not

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.680
that you'd want to find her. She's just as
likely to eat you alive as she is to help

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.730
you. Often seen with a mortar and pestle,
and rumored to own a flying broom, there's

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.599
only one name for this ancient creature: Baba
Yaga. Baba Yaga is a recurring character in

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.810
Slavic folklore, often as a villain, but just
as often as a benefactor. She's inspired characters

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.329
in stories for generations, from Spirited
Away, to The Witcher, where she is the inspiration

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.959
for the terrifying Devourer, monsters that
resemble old women that enjoy nothing more

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.419
than to eat the flesh of the living.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.140
But enough about monsters. Let's talk about
something big. Let's talk about the Wild Hunt.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.520
Aside from the Niflgaardian Empire, The Wild
Hunt is one of the most important recurring

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.419
elements of The Witcher. In the series, The
Wild Hunt is a group of spectoral riders who

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.500
appear in the sky, bearing bad omens. Often,
they ride through the sky before a war, or

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.970
to signal some other major catastrophe. This
group of malevolent specters is hugely influenced

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.669
by a European Myth called, well, The Wild
Hunt. Sometimes portrayed as the ghosts of

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.919
the dead, and sometimes as fairies, the host
of men on horses, with rabid hounds in tow,

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.330
almost perfectly match the description of
those in Sapowski's novels and the Witcher

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.539
Games. Like the games, the "real" Wild Hunt
is said to ride before war or plague, and

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.870
those who are said to have seen the wild hunt
are doomed to an ill fate--death if they're

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:23.280
lucky, but possibly being kidnapped and adopted
into the fold of these ominous hunters.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.330
The Witcher isn’t a perfect portrait of
Polish history or Slavic folklore--like all

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.110
things great, it’s derivative: that means
it takes something that came before it, it’s

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.330
derived from predecessors. What makes it so
significant is that it dusts off the old fairy

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.069
tales and myths and breathes new life into
them, using them to tell new stories for all

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.330
of us to enjoy. And it gives people who are
otherwise unexposed to Slavic history and

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.720
culture an opportunity to walk a bit in those
worlds.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.639
And hey, it’s not every day a video game
is give to the President of the United States

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.750
as a diplomatic gift. Even if he doesn’t
like it.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.099
You thought you knew The Witcher, but hopefully
you’ve learned just a thing or two more.
