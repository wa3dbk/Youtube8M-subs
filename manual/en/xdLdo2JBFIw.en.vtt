00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:09.786
Let's go! Tamagotchi!

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.116
Yah-tchi!

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.886
Ok, let's go over our game plan one more time!

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.386
We need to find the perfect birthday gift for 
Ms. Perfect in this department store!

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:23.516
Let's find the perfect gift!

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.046
Yeah!

00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:27.616
You gonna be helping us search too, Chamametchi?

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:30.486
I told her it'd be better if she stayed home
but she wouldnâ€™t listen to me.

00:00:30.586 --> 00:00:32.316
Yeah, I didn't listen to Mametchi!

00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:37.386
Let's check of this store for the perfect gift
and we'll meet back here again in 30 min, okay?

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:38.816
OK!

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:42.316
Welcome, children.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:51.886
Ah! I bet flowers would make the perfect gift
for Ms. Perfect!

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.546
I think sporting goods would make a great gift!

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:58.686
I agree.

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:03.686
I think maybe I'll just take a little nap.

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:07.446
Lookin' for a gift, oh yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:14.046
Oh, look! Yah-tchi! 

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:18.116
I think some delicious desserts would make
a wonderful gift-tchi.

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.946
I bet she would love to get a vacuum cleaner!

00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:23.186
I'll take one of those, please!

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:24.346
And one of these!

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:26.086
And one those too, I think!

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:27.846
Oh, and that, too!

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:30.886
Why do I get the feelling 
Makiko's just shopping for herself?

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:33.986
Okay, everyone, how'd we do? Any good ideas?

00:01:34.016 --> 00:01:36.946
I think she'd totally dig getting 
a brand new electric guitar!

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:38.486
Or perhaps some flowers?

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.816
Can't go wrong if we get her 
a great collection of sporting goods!

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:42.486
Agreed.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:44.786
She can mayby always use more cleaning supplies!

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:47.986
Any pastries make the perfect gift-tchi!

00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:51.186
Designer goods would suit Ms. Perfect the best!

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.416
Oh, that's a good point! Oh, yeah. 
I like that, I dunno.. etc.. 

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:57.986
Could everyone please quiet down for a minute!?

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.786
I think we've all managed to forget 
a very important issue at hand..

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.416
An important issue?

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.846
Yes!! Remember our budget?!

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:10.746
We really don't have that much money
to spend on her gift.

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:12.816
So we can't buy anything here..

00:02:12.886 --> 00:02:15.146
Now we'll never find her a present-tchi.

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:20.586
I've got an idea for a gift
and it won't cost us anything!

00:02:20.646 --> 00:02:23.186
Huh???

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.246
Happy Birthday, Ms. Perfect!

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.386
You're all so kind..

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.946
Thank you so much for this!

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.086
That worked out well!

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:38.016
Yep!

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:44.246
This is so perfect! The most perfect gift
I've ever been given!
