00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.069
oftentimes are very very critical of
religion and the role it plays in some

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.820
of our legislation but they united
methodist church in north carolina

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.440
actually wants to use religion to

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.860
do good things

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.970
knew what they want to do is out push

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.359
uh... that

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.429
realization of same sex marriage which
i'm not

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.289
uh... and that's not something that you
hear about allot when it comes to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.269
churches and what they're basically
doing is they are stopping all wedding

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.300
ceremonies

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.499
until gay people can get married in
their state

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.340
okay ann and i love that i think that
that's a great idea and it also

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130
it's a little

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.939
it's a good p_r_ move

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:44.029
uh... when it comes to their church and
when it comes to religion in some ways

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:46.869
because i think that you know uh...
we're talk about this on to my

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.600
two-year-old but uh... about

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.899
twenty percent of people in the united
states have no religious affiliation

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.620
yeah rights of people are starting to
increasingly read jacked uh... religion

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290
and i think that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.330
part of the reason why is because people
are using religion to dictate our lives

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.800
and now we have

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
some charges that are speaking out
against that i think it's a good thing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.180
yeah

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.770
that i i love the the insurer that
they're trying to use a church to do

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.139
good thing

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.509
of course there i mean in in the the
people try to stop you there if they

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.169
think that they're doing a good thing a
bit of those funny yeah uh... the i

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:23.419
don't know i i don't discount the the
work that they're doing in in the went

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:27.720
on this article that non evangelicals in
general are much more in favor

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
of uh... of gay marriage and look
there's been left-wing christianity for

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.830
a decade two decades now they've been
trying to get things i'd or discount

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.020
that to the extent that that they're
trying to meld uh... support for gay

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.990
marriage with christianity that's
perfectly fine

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.240
when they're doing something like this i
can't help but think

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.590
if not for the churches we wouldn't be
having this conversation to begin with

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.140
like they're doing what they can

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.200
but they're still because of the problem

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.420
that these guys individually but the the
dat that they purport of represent i get

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.540
an idea that the reason why i think this
story is important is because their

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.250
hearts

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.640
on religious people out there aren't
that hard fundamentalist iran good

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.799
you know hardworking members of society
that want equality they want to push for

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.349
things that would actually benefit
society and they never get any coverage

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.819
you know already every time we talk
about religion on the show it's always

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.930
midnight needed aspects of religion and
as you guys now

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.060
uh... i'm not religious out all the hot
so i have you know no

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.570
bias here when it comes to like
supporting a specific religion or

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.719
specific charge

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.589
but i like hearing about what they're

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.589
beliefs are because day it was really
one use their religion for good and it's

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.599
not just about supporting gay marriage

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.489
it's about loving one another it's about
equality it's all the things that i

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.039
learned when i went to church

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.879
and what i enjoyed about my religion
right now i don't believe in religious

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.989
doctrine which is why rejected it later
but all that

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.659
positive morals that i got out of
religion i like and i and i like to see

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.200
other churches push for that so that's
that's the reason why brought this up

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.630
and i want to read you guys on their
statement because i thought that it was

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.159
a

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.399
they set up agri street church we claim
the committed same-sex relationships as

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.939
no less secret in their ministry to us
and the community

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.540
uh... and then they say are
denominations troubles overcome the sand

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.150
of are reserving

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.110
these sacramental privileges for stress
free people only we believe is a green

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.870
street church see people in same-sex
relationships is completely worthy

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.710
of the sacrament of marriage we reject
any notion that there are specific

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.400
processes in the kingdom of god and
telling him the phrase kingdom of god

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.600
yeah i don't love at first i i i i am
since they're cool

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.740
it doesn't have a different enough drugs
to be honest with the atlanta exit more

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.180
awesome based out of bed so anyway but
not any you mentioned i had not

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.000
evangelical white protestants and uh...
you know their support for same sex

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.130
marriage and about seventy percent of
them actually support same-sex marriage

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.380
uh... self-described evangelicals about
thirty one percent of them support

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.570
same-sex marriages and with catholics
it's fifty nine percent up nineteen

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.150
points yet so and by the way for you to
break down those evangelicals by age

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.440
group the younger evangelicals would be
more in favor of it of course and and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.199
also by the way it's of long-term it's a
good long-term business of

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.599
because we've read that like you prefer
not marriage later and later in the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.609
decided not to get married at higher
rates of the past so if they want to

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.910
find people to

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.879
later on married

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.619
better start looking for people outside
of st distributing or you may remember
