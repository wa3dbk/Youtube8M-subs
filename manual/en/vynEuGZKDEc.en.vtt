00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.330
Hi.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.719
My name is Eric Sampson, and I'd like to spend
a few minutes talking about how to properly

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:09.900
train your VMO.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.570
The VMO is short for your vastus medialis
oblique.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.930
It's the inner portion of your quadriceps
muscle, which is basically the front of your

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.930
thigh.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.599
The VMO is very important to train and train
properly in the presence of any degeneration

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.599
in your knee.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.470
Classically, the knee will degenerate on the
medial side of your knee due to some skeletal

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880
alignment issues or just the normal wear and
tear process.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.489
So working on your VMO a little extra, rather
than just doing the quadriceps alone, is going

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.940
to be important to try to prevent the knee
injuries as well as recovering from the injuries.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.719
So two exercises that are wonderful for the
VMO, they're real simple to do at home as

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.410
well as in a gym setting, is going to be a
straight leg raise where you're concentrating

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.390
a little bit more on your VMO.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.730
So the best thing to do is to first straighten
out your leg, and the trick is to try to turn

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.960
your foot out laterally.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.280
I often tell my patients to point their toes
at about 11 o'clock or 10 o'clock if you pretending

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.130
there's a clock in front of you.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.310
From there, you're trying to tighten up your
thigh and then basically lift up your leg.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.740
But by having that hip angled, you're going
to be working your inner quad portion of your

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.740
VMO a little bit more.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.070
So you can lower that back down.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:30.119
So you tighten up and then you lift, and then
you would lower back down.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.729
The other exercise that's real simple to do
is call the bridge, something that we do a

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:34.729
lot.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.700
But if you take a medicine ball or really
anything with a little bit of weight and you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.530
put it between the knees and you squeeze while
you're doing the bridge lift, you're actually

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
going to contract your inner thigh and your
VMO muscles a little more than you ordinarily

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.920
would do on a regular bridge.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.120
So bridges and your straight leg raises, if
you're doing this on a regular basis, I recommend

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.780
maybe two sets of ten on alternating days,
three sets of ten as you get a little stronger,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.049
and then you can kind of progress with the
leg raises to a weight, or you can continue

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.070
doing this and holding your bridge up a little
bit longer as a progression.
