00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.096 position:98%
There are many types of vehicles in use today, and they all have to share the same roads.

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:18.042 position:97%
A major problem with sharing the road is seeing the situation in purely human terms.

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:25.408 position:97%
A driver gets in his car and the car and driver become a single in personal machine.

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:32.469 position:97%
A rider puts on a helmet and protective equipment, and like the car driver, some of his human characteristics,

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.376 position:94%
like his hairstyle or a great smile begin to fade from view.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:43.755 position:98%
So it's quite possible that the driver will treat the rider on his motorcycle a way that he'd never treat him face to face,

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:51.286 position:97%
and the way the car driver treats the motorcycle rider is important because in a collision a rider is more vulnerable than a driver.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:56.042 position:98%
Car drivers have a steel cage all around them, by contrast the motorcycle

00:00:56.043 --> 00:01:01.483 position:97%
rider has only his riding skill and basic protective equipment to rely on,

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:05.366 position:84%
but these very different vehicles share the same road.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.248 position:98%
The most common accident between drivers and motorcyclists involves a

00:01:09.248 --> 00:01:14.005 position:73%
car turning in front of an oncoming motorcycle.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:19.189 position:98%
Even good drivers sometimes don't notice motorcycles or misjudge the riders intentions.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.266 position:98%
Motorcycles are much shorter and narrower than a car, so they present a narrower profile.

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.811 position:98%
If a driver is subconsciously expecting a motorcycle to be as long and wide as a car,

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.758 position:98%
He may think its farther away or going more slowly than it really is.

00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:39.306 position:98%
The solution to this is to take the time and effort to look not just once, but twice,

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:46.816 position:97%
and yes, three times to make sure just how far away the rider is and just how fast he's approaching.

00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:55.093 position:97%
Intersections are the most likely places for a collision for two reasons: First, the driver might not detect the motorcyclist,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.587 position:97%
and second, if he does see the motorcyclist, the car driver may make a wrong interpretation of what the motorcyclist is doing.

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:10.880 position:98%
It's important to for both riders and drivers to communicate their intentions, use your turn signals,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.717 position:56%
and cancel them after a lane change.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.386 position:83%
Why do car drivers sometimes tailgate a motorcyclist?

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:21.504 position:97%
Because a driver can see past a motorcyclist easily, he may not consider the

00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:25.792 position:98%
bike much of a threat, or realise how close he actually is to it.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:30.592 position:98%
The car driver might even be concentrating on a vehicle in front of the motorcycle.

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:35.605 position:97%
When following a motorcycle, allow at least a two second following distance.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:40.256 position:98%
You work it out like this, choose a marker that the motorcycle your following is passing.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:45.056 position:97%
For example, as the motorcycle hits the shadow of this bridge, count one thousand one,

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:50.389 position:97%
one thousand two, before you pass the shadow. That's your two seconds.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.954 position:97%
Always look before pulling out, it's especially important to check the rear view and

00:02:54.955 --> 00:03:00.331 position:98%
side view mirrors when backing up and to look over your shoulder too.

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.779 position:84%
Now that you understand motorcyclists a little better,

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:16.822 position:94%
share the road with them, treat them like the guy next door.

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:24.971
