00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.020
Have you ever wanted to have a profession
that really helps people out and something

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.180
you can really be proud of? Well look no more.
Today we are going to learn how to be a dietitian.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.869
I'm Isabelle Simon your wellness consultant.
The very first thing that you need to have

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.720
in order to become a dietitian and actually
anything for that matter is passion. When

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.200
you are going to be helping your clients when
you are a dietitian if you don't have truly

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.030
that passion to help them become proactors
of their good vibrant health utilizing the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.300
foods that are available to us. Then the certification
that you get will be of very little impact

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.210
without that passion. So number two would
be obviously that certain certification. And

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.470
there's actually four steps for you to get
certified. Number one step would be for you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.950
to get a bachelors degree in either dietetic,
nutrition, or wellness consulting. And that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.810
bachelor's degree will need to be from an
accredited institution from the ADA which

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:30.380
is the American Dietetic Association. Number
two, you are going to need to get an internship,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:40.229
practical experience, an internship that is
again certified and recommended by the ADA.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.639
Number three, and that is very important,
you are going to need to pass the national

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:53.780
certification that will be able to give you
the stamp of approval if you will to become

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.799
a dietitian and put registered dietitian behind
your name. And number four every five years

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.680
you are going to be required to take continuing
education in some credit hours to be able

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.569
to keep up to speed on the new studies in
your research that gives us more information

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.500
every year. So every five years you are going
to need to renew your certification if you

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.540
will. And that's it, once you've done that
keep working with your clients, keep that

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.230
passion alive about helping them and you'll
be good to go. And remember good health begins

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.360
with good nutrition. I'm Isabelle Simon. See
you there.
