Welcome to Ball State University.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.820
We're glad you are planning to live in the
Residence Halls this coming school year.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.700
As much as we wish we could show you the exact
room and hall you'll be staying in

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
- it's just not possible, as our staff is making
updates and repairs to all the buildings.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
And we have conference guests who stay with
us during the summer months too.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.020
So, we've created this short video to give
you an idea of how

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.900
a double room in each complex or hall is designed.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.400
Enjoy!

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.840
Thanks for taking the time to watch.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560
We hope this will help you know more
about the Residence Hall room

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.360
you will occupy when you move into the halls.
