00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello, I'm Jim Tapley, the brother of
William Tapley.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.780
A week ago, we did a YouTube

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.910
on a painting I did called "Apocalypse
Today".

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.080
Since I did that painting, I've been
doing a number of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.990
religious paintings and if you've ever

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.920
read the book "Revelation's Unraveled"
you will know that

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.070
numerology is a very important part

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.890
of the Christian Church and specifically
the Catholic Church.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.470
You have the 3 marking the Trinity.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.570
You have the 4 Gospels: Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.579
You have the 7

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.400
Deadly Sins.  You have the Ten
Commandments.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.650
Numbers are all involved

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.020
in the Church.  I think there is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.170
one set of seven that no artist has
ever done

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.329
and it occurred to me that I should try
it.  You have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.189
seen or will see the seven words

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.030
that Christ said on the cross and I've
done them in sculptures

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.350
with just the torso and the head and
I've tried to show

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.880
the different expressions for the
different words

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.389
that he did say on the cross.  You will
notice that the first one,

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.789
he's actually more awake it seems and
more

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.249
active, but of course, as the hours went on when he was on the cross,

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:37.450
he became less and less verbal

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.029
and of course he ends with "It is finished."

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:46.039
I hope you enjoy these.  I enjoyed doing
them although, I have to tell you,

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.240
when I did them, it was very soul
searching

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.229
and I felt very close to Christ on the
cross

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.529
when I had finished them.  Thank you.

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:01.759
"And when they were come to the place

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.009
which is called Calvary, they crucified
him there

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.509
and the robbers, one on the right hand

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.340
and the other on the left, and Jesus said,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.420
'Father, forgive them

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.420
for they know not what they do.'  And one
of those robbers

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.120
who were hanged blasphemed him saying,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.329
'If thou be Christ, save thyself

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.140
and us.'  But the other answering rebuked
him saying,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.390
'Neither dust thou fear God seeing thou art
under the same condemnation

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.540
and we indeed justly for we receive

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.590
the due reward for our deeds but this
man

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.579
hath done no evil.'  And he said to Jesus,

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.780
'Lord, remember me when thou shalt come
into thy Kingdom.'

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.400
And Jesus said to him, 'Amen, I say to thee,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.750
this day thou shalt be with me in
paradise.'

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.010
his mother and his mother's sister, Mary

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.370
of Cleophas and Mary Magdalene.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.750
When Jesus therefore had seen his mother

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.879
and the disciple standing whom he loved

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.469
he saith to his mother, 'Woman, behold thy
son.'

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.780
After that, he saith to the disciple,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.730
'Behold thy mother,' and from that hour,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.930
the disciple took her to his own.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.749
And when the sixth hour was come,

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.480
there was darkness over the whole earth
until the ninth hour

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.430
and at the ninth hour Jesus cried out
with a loud voice saying,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.049
'Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?'"

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.249
Which is being interpreted, "My God,

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.889
my God, why has thou forsaken me?"

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.069
"Jesus,

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.249
knowing that all things were now
accomplished

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.130
that the Scripture might be fulfilled

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.470
said, 'I thirst.'

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.970
Jesus, therefore, when he had taken the
vinegar said,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.790
'It is consummated.'  And bowing his head,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.290
he gave up the ghost.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.660
And the sun was darkened and the veil of
the temple was rent

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.010
in the midst and Jesus crying with a
loud voice said,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.050
'Father, into thy hands I commend my
spirit.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.750
It is finished.'"
