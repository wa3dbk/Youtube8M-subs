RUSTY: Hey! Welcome to Pickleball 411. 
I'm Rusty and this show

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.030
from Pickleball Channel is all 
about providing helpful information about

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.080
the sport of pickleball. This week 
we focus on line calls. Specifically,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.110
how to determine 
when the ball is in or out. 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.140
So, let's learn and play.

» RUSTY: This time on Pickleball 411

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.250
we're going to clarify line calls. 
Specifically what determines whether

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.290
a ball is in or out. We're not going 
to get into the details of refereeing,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
but focus on the rule itself. 
There's been some discussion about this,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.340
especially since Pickleball and 
tennis are not exactly the same.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.380
So, let's break it down one step at a time. 
Court lines are good.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.390
Okay, this one is pretty straight 
forward and most people

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.430
already know it. Not counting 
the non-volley line on the serve,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.450
balls in play that land on 
any court line are called "in".

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.490
In short, if a ball hits a line, it's good. 
Compression of the ball.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.520
Another critical thing to 
understand is that a tennis ball

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.540
and a pickleball compress differently. 
A tennis ball compresses when it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.570
hits, making the surface area of 
the ball that contacts the court larger.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.600
A pickleball is harder and does 
not compress like a tennis ball.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.620
Basically, there's no give because 
of the hardness of the ball.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.650
This means the surface area of a 
pickleball which contacts the court,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.670
or the "point of contact", is much 
smaller. Only about the size of a dime.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.680
Point of contact is the rule. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
The point where the ball meets the court 
is what determines if the ball is in or out.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
In pickleball, all line calls 
are only determined by this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.740
point of contact. What that means is 
that sometimes a ball may look like

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.760
it's in because the curved part 
of the ball is overlapping the line,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.780
but it's actually out because the 
point of contact is made out of bounds.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.810
Let's take a look at this from several angles.

Courtesy on the court.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.930
We've covered the specifics of the rule but, 
as you can see, sometimes it can be really hard

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.950
to tell if the ball is in or out. 
So let's try to remember to be courteous

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.960
and have good sportsmanship. 
For more information, there's actually a section

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.990
on code of ethics for line calling 
which you can find in the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.030
official rule book at the USAPA website.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.040
So that's your Pickleball 411 for today. 
Thank you so much to the many players

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.060
and to the USAPA for helping us to 
clarify this rule about when the ball is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.080
in or out. We hope that this has been helpful. 
And now there's only one thing left to do

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.100
and that's go play!
