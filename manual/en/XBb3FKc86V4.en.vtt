This one secret will make you look younger
and leave you feeling full of life and energy?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.080
All you need is an ice cube and a few moments
of your time!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.410
There is a point at the base of the neck known
as the Feng Fu, the Feng Fu pressure point

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.940
is found at the base of the skull just below
the bottom ridge of the skull cap at the top

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.820
of the neck.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.510
If you regularly put ice on it, the body begins
to rejuvenate and you will find yourself healthy,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.900
cheerful, and full of energy.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:03.300
First you lie on your stomach, and place an
ice cube at the point of Feng Fu and hold

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.490
it for 20 minutes.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.530
You can either lie there or fix it there with
a bandage, scarf or plastic wrap.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.780
Do this regularly with breaks of 2-3 days
and do it in the morning on an empty stomach

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.270
and at night before going to bed.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:37.159
After 30-40 seconds, you will feel slight
heat come onto the point.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:51.020
In the first days, you will have a feeling
of euphoria due to the release of endorphins.
