00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.630
Hey everyone! Welcome to our video tutorial. 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.360
In this tutorial we'll be talking about
online slots jackpots. It's pretty much

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.950
every single casino player's dream to win
a very large slot jackpot. However you

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.520
have to be extremely lucky to achieve
this. To show you how slots jackpots work,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.380
we chose to play on the very popular
Gladiator progressive slot machine. 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.759
If you look at the top of the screen,
you'll see that the Gladiator Jackpot is

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.720
offering at this moment the prize
of $1.5 million.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.740
which is continually increasing.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.240
In order to find out what the conditions
to hit the Gladiators Jackpot are,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.720
we'll have to access the info page.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.180
On the info page, we'll also be able to
see all other specs related to the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.450
Gladiator slot game such as the bonus
features and special symbols. Going

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.310
further we'll find out that in order to
win the Gladiator Jackpot we'll have to

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.150
trigger the jackpot bonus game first. the
jackpot bonus game is triggered when

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.970
3 gladiator helmet symbols appear
on reels 2, 3 and 4.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.880
In the jackpot bonus round, the game will
randomly select 9 helmets being made

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.450
of either gold, silver or bronze. If all 9
helmets are of gold, the player will win

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.690
the jackpot. But let's play a little.
The Gladiator slot game allows us to play

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.030
with as much as 25 pay-lines, but
let's play with 10 for now.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.020
And let's launch a new game.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.020
And unfortunately we didn't win anything.
But let's play again.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.200
And we won $2.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.890
And we didn't hit the jackpot. During
gameplay you might have noticed that

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.730
the jackpot counter was continually
increasing on the top right corner.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.820
And now you might be wondering what
determined this increase. The jackpot

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.300
counter increases each time someone loses
a bet on a spin. So during gameplay when

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.410
we lost, a certain percentage of the bet
we lost was added to the jackpot prize

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.300
pool. The jackpot counter increases
continually because many players are

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.190
playing on the Gladiator slot machine at
the same time. And this is how online

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.520
slots jackpots work. Checkout our
