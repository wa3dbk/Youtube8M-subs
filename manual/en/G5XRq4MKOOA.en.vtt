Hi and welcome back to Hair with Hollie.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.880
So today I'm going to show you how to do two
gorgeous looks for shoulder length hair.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.650
We have one really sleek updo and then a sexy
tousled half updo too.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:22.560
[music]
To prep the hair I just pop in a bit of mousse.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.070
I'm using a spray mousse here.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.920
It's handy to get all the sections of the
hair.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.190
So just get to kind of rub it through all
the layers underneath the hair as well, and

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.390
this is just giving it a bit of grip and will
help the curls stay a bit longer.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.560
And brush it all through to make sure you've
covered all the hair.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.000
So just section off the hair, kind of working
from ear to ear and pin the top half up out

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.510
of the way so you can get to curling the bottom
section.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.739
I'm just going to curl random sections here
just to give it a bit of movement.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.780
So kind of every second or third section just
pop a curl in it.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.530
And you can go, you can curl in either direction
or both directions.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.050
It doesn't have to be too uniform.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.310
[music]
Once you've finished with the bottom sections,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.490
let the top section down and curl 2 or 3 inch
sections in alternate directions.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.450
Once you've curled the whole head, or sections
of it, run your fingers through breaking up

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.280
the curls, and it kind of gives it just a
soft, get a bit of movement in there.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.509
And for this look I'm going to pop a little
bit of texturizing dust just along the crown.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.119
This kind of just helps to mess up the look
a bit and give it a bit of texture and a bit

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.119
of lift.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.810
So already you can see we're getting bigger,
more volume there around the sides, which

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.700
is great if you have thinner hair as well,
it kind of stops the need for back combing.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.160
Just to make this look a little bit special
I'm going to pin up some sections towards

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.780
the back of the head, just kind of giving
a bit of volume, bit of a lift.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.040
It just updates the style, kind of a great
day to night look.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.880
So just working towards a bit of volume at
the back of the head, using curler clips the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.340
same color as your hair.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.340
There.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.591
Got a nice bit of volume there at the crown.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.860
Popping a few clips in really helps hold the
style in place and will keep your hair from

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.090
going flat and just gives it a kind of nice
messy updo look, it doesn't have to be too

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.090
polished.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.090
Lovely.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.730
Finish off with a bit of hairspray and you're
good to go.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.630
Now I'm going to show you how you can transform
this look into a really sleek updo.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.180
[music]
So to transform this look we're going to take

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.099
out the clips.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.180
It's great because we have the curls, we have
the volume which makes the hair so much easier

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.980
to work with.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.880
So to section off we're just going to keep
the bangs or any longer layers that you have

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.230
at the front.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:04.150
So put them to one side and then take another
section about two inches or so wide kind of

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.470
coming from the top of your ear across and
pin that in place.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.680
And then this here at the top of the head,
the kind of crown is going to make up the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.879
volume of our style.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.190
So it's quite textured already, we have a
bit of texture just in it and it has a curl

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.200
so it will be so much easier to work with.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.849
I'm just going to back comb through the lengths
just like so, working all the way up to the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.849
tip.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.610
So you're kind of looking at little troll
dolls as your hair inspiration.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.970
So you want the hair to be able to stand up
on it's own, hey ta da, just like that and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.530
then just keep doing that along the sides
and down a bit towards the back of the head

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.860
as well, and that will make up the volume
for our style.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.220
Once you're happy with amount of volume that
you have just roll it back.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.260
So you want to create kind of like a cushion
of hair that will build up the volume.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.980
So I think that's good for us but if you want
it bigger pop it up higher on the crown, if

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.610
you want it lower pull it down lower, whatever
you feel like.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.000
So roll it into, you kind of want kind of
a croissant shape, so kind of big enough at

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.650
the middle tapering down to the smaller sides.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.690
Once you anchor the bump in place it's a lot
easier to work with.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.660
You can choose you know if you want it higher
or lower, bigger, so just turn it around like

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.840
a fan and then pin the bits in place.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.440
Once you're happy with your shape, so you
want like kind of like a fan, just like that,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.650
that's like a template of what your style
is going to look like.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.463
We're going to cover this with a little bit
of hairspray and then get cracking.

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:48.570
Then take the fresh hair, give it a bit of
a brush and I'm just going to back comb it

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.300
ever so slightly at the root just so it's
able to stand up and get up and over the style

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.000
and just brush it back so you get a really
sleek finish, and we're just going to pin

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.270
all that in place with some curler clips.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.009
With your remaining hair we're just going
to bring it up to the anchor point working

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.020
with the natural texture and the natural curl
that we have so you have kind of like a messy

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.030
updo at the back.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:24.190
Take a piece of hair, just going to roll it
up just like so and then pin them in place,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.400
aiming towards the anchor point as a guide.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.390
You can pin any way you want, like if you
want something a bit sleeker then go for a

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.650
kind of side bun or you could even leave it
down, whatever you feel like.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.350
So just keep taking same size sections and
roll them up towards the tips until you have

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.490
used up all the hair.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.380
Once you're happy with the back you're going
to swing around to the front, and with the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.250
sections we put away at the start, take them
down.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.600
So you can see they still have a bit of the
natural curl to them from our earlier style,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
which is brilliant.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.460
We're just going to work with the curl pushing
the hair kind of back towards the back of

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.460
the style.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.660
There we go.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.850
We got kind of soft nice tendrils and that
kind of frame the face.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.919
And then just do the exact same thing on the
other side.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.389
Once you're happy finish the whole lot off
with a good lot of hairspray.

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.889
So there you have it guys, two super easy
looks to do on shoulder length hair.

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.330
