00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.939
Butch: Fifteen years ago, my whole world ended.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.740
The zombies took
everything from me.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.570
Everybody I knew, everybody I loved was killed.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.340
My
father, my brothers, my uncles and I, we tried

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.680
to fight them, but it was no
use.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.450
I've dedicated my life to hunting zombies
down.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.900
As long as a
zombie walks this earth, I will not sleep.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
I will not stop until
they are gone.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.840
My name is Butch Sanderson, and I'm the last
living human on this earth.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.710
Man 1: Howdy, stranger.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
Tax: Hey, partner.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.920
Butch: You stop right there, or I swear I
will put a bullet between

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920
your eyes.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
I swear.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920
Man 1: Come on, put that piece away, son.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.920
We ain't here to hurt you.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920
Tax: Come on, man.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
Butch: I swear on the blood of George Patton,
you will die tonight!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.490
Man 1: Tax, here, he is a sure-fire expert
at getting fires started in

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.600
weather like this, where there's snow and
rain and everything.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.280
There was one time when there was a monsoon,
I believe a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280
tsunami.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
Tax: I remember that.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.440
Man 1: This man can get a fire started in
the middle of a tsunami.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440
Go
light the fire, man

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.440
Tax: I got it right here.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
Man 1: Help this gentleman get a fire.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.240
Tax: My grand-daddy gave me this lighter.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.340
Butch: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.440
Tax: Come on, man.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.500
Hey, man.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.170
Man 1: Hey, son, look right here.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.311
Where are you going?

00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.311
Just lower that
thing down, go on.

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.510
There you go.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.000
All right?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490
All right.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.490
See?

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.490
See.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.490
We're nice fellows.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.010
Nice little campsite you've got going on
here.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.030
Where's your tent?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.860
You got a tent in a bag?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.960
You just sleep
out here in the snow at night?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.060
Tax: Not very smart.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.979
Butch: Where did you all come from?

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.881
Man 1: Well, you know, a couple of . . . if
you've been down this

00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.350
trail here, ten, twelve miles or two down
there, there's a fork

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.350
in the trail.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990
One leads down to the valley; one leads up
to the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.990
mountain.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.360
Well, we're down there in that valley, and
our family

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.640
has been there for the last--what would you
say, Tax--ten or

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.629
eleven, twelve years or so.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.609
Butch: So you ain't zombies?

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.200
Man 1: You're [inaudible 2:19]], man.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.439
When was the last time you ever
heard a zombie talk as intellectually as we're

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.439
conversing right
here?

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.439
Huh?

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.439
When was the last time?

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.629
Butch: Well, where did you last see some zombies?

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.629
Man 1: Couple of miles or two down the road,
couple, or three, or

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.099
four, or five miles or two, down here.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.139
They're in a little pack,
three or four of them, and them critters are

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.139
slow.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.860
They take a
real long time to get anywhere.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.069
I'd say you've got a good six or
seven hours.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.739
You could probably . . . you know, let's just
relax, you know.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.639
Just relax here, have a nice fire.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.419
We could
roast some marshmallows.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.549
Actually, I've got them right here.

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.379
Brought some marshmallow with me.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.609
Have to get my pack off.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.650
Here
they are, right here.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.669
See.

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.669
From Kroger, even.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.669
You know, the
Kroger's, they're not around any more.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.129
Them zombies, when they
came around, the Kroger's all got shut down.

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.199
Butch: OK.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.870
Well, let me tell you.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.579
I've dedicated my life to killing
zombie scum.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.900
As long as it walks the earth, I will not
rest!

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.319
Where did you last see them zombies?

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.019
Man 1: Told you already!

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.839
I plumb told you three or four times, they're
not close by.

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.681
We've out here camping, we're going to have
some

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.689
marshmallows, we're going to have us some
graham crackers, we're

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.359
going to have us some . . . you've got the
graham crackers with

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.359
you?

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.359
Let's get this thing going.

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.359
Tax: You were supposed to bring graham crackers.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.589
Man 1: I don't ever bring graham crackers,
Tax, that's your job.

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.589
Tax: You got the marshmallows.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.489
Man 1: I got the marshmallows!

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.400
I got the marshmallows!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.639
You get the
graham crackers, and you get the chocolate.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.870
Tax: The graham crackers are sitting right
next to the marshmallows.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.870
Man 1: Damn it!

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.870
What is wrong with you?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.989
You know what?

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.040
You just relax,
Butch, you just relax right here, OK.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.599
We're going to be back.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:02.599
No?

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.620
Yeah, you're coming with me, OK.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.900
I've got some words for you.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.319
You sort of relax right here.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.629
We're going to be back with some graham
crackers and some chocolate.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.629
You'd better know where that stuff is at.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.629
We'll be back.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:12.629
The zombies are far away.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.629
Don't worry about it.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.629
Come on, Tax.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.629
Let's get out of here.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.130
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.440
Tax: If you ever hit me again, I swear that
I will kill you.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.680
I will rip
your skull right out of your head.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.420
Man 1: I'm telling [inaudible 4:25].

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.920
Tax: You go ahead.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.420
I'm taking [inaudible 4:30].

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.030
Man 2: Now let's have you stand up and step
out.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:55.930
Let's do it one more
time.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.140
I just need you kind of stepping up out from
where you

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.140
were.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.580
Butch: Pull out the marshmallows.
