00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.640
Now to put it together, take one of your units,
and take this other unit. This triangle will

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.390
go underneath the rabbit ear, and then this
triangle will get tucked into the pocket of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:26.540
the rabbit ear, like this. Tuck it in, and
it's in place. Now, it helps if you collapse

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:36.399
the units as you put it together. Okay, take
the other one, slide it in under the rabbit

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:51.070
ear. Tuck this triangle into the pocket of
the rabbit ear, like that. Collapse it, and

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:02.510
do another. Slide it in, tuck the triangle
into that pocket, collapse. And here's the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:12.330
final unit, and the final unit is always the
trickiest. So we slid the triangle in; tucked

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:22.780
the triangle into the rabbit ear, collapse
it. Now, we have to tuck this right into this

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:35.250
original one. And we have to do it without
without the unit falling apart. So, tuck that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:45.600
triangle in, and then lift up that pocket,
and tuck that triangle right into that pocket.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:59.860
And there your unit is put together. Shape
it,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.950
and you have your five-pointed star.
