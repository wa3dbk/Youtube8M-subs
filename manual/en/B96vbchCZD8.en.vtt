Hello. This is J.B. I'm with Austin Homebrew
Supply in Austin Texas. We're talking a little

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.700
bit today about equipment and ingredients
and process regarding making your own beer

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.970
and wine at home. OK. So, right now I'm going
to discuss a little bit about sanitizing bottles.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.099
OK. So, at the end of the brewing process
or the end of the wine making process you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.460
need to make sure that your bottles are very
clean and sanitized before you put your finished

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.000
product into it. It's imperative. If you want
it to be shelf stable and not spoil. OK. So,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.480
how do we do this? Well, the main thing you
need to do is make sure that your bottles

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.980
are clean. Say for instance this is a wine
bottle. You need to make sure that it's very

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.610
clean, rinsed off, completely free of any
kind of particulate matter. OK. Once that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.460
is done and you are ready to sanitize then
there's a couple of ways you can do this.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.780
You can immerse this bottle into a bucket
full of sanitizer and wait for it to completely

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.409
fill then once it's completely full then you
take it out and drain it out. Now, that takes

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.570
a certain amount of effort. That's why this
particular device here came out a number of

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.590
years ago. It's called the Ventnor or soul
fighter. What this guy does, really all this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.110
thing is is a pump with a reservoir. OK. So,
you take your sanitizing solution, you fill

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.789
it up about half way into this apparatus and
then once you're ready to sanitize a bottle

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.810
instead of having to immerse it into a full
bucket you simply invert it put it on this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.530
thing and when it's full you squeeze it down
in there and it will, it will shoot sanitizing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
solution up inside of the bottle sanitizing
the inside of the bottle. So, it's very effective,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.249
very fast way of sanitizing bottles without
having to immerse each bottle. You simply

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:05.400
pump this thing into it and then once it's
done if you have a bottle drainer tree just

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.549
put it on your drainer tree and let it drain
off.
