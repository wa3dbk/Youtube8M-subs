00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.440
I’m Lee; I have a degree in architecture,
about ten years experience in the construction

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.990
field, and today we’re doing a designer
countertop. We’re using almost the same

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.059
colors as we did in the back counter, but
not quite the same. These will carry out into

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.640
the dining room. We have our lines drawn as
reference marks, right along the edge right

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.650
here. So what we want to do- just take up
your spacers, just move the tile out like

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:39.190
this, out of the way. You can move it straight
out if you want- however you want to move

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:59.589
it. Pile your spacers to the side. And then
I’m going to pick this up. &lt;P&gt; And just,

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.900
with your trowel, notched trowel, go right
up to your reference lines, but don’t cover

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.340
them completely up. And when you first start
out, it’s going to take awhile because it’s

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:29.250
slow going to get this first
area all set up. See, there was a lump in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:45.920
it right there, so you want to crush the lump
and mix it up a little bit just in case. Just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.990
remember to go to your reference lines, but
don’t cover them up so you can’t see them.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.370
And you usually- say on the floor you have
one long reference line that will go through

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:11.380
the entire house, or maybe it will go through
the entire room. Scrape the excess back into

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.590
your pan or bucket. And if you have a few
little spots here, that’s fine. And you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.819
want to start off with this one right here
in the center, really. And you’re not going

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.290
to press it down, you’ll lay this one in,
too, and you’re going to lay this one in.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.480
lay everything in that touches a reference
line. And you just line it up by sight or

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:48.209
use one of the other pieces of tile. You just
want to make sure you get this part correct

00:02:48.209 --> 00:03:00.260
because it will determine everything else.
You can see how it’s off a little bit here,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:13.770
so just scoot the whole thing this way until
you can see the reference line along this

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:26.180
line. And just keep putting your spacers in.
and when you get two sides done, that’s

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.400
when you would put in your center tile. &lt;P&gt;
And then, once you have all of your pieces

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.880
in, we’re just going to press it together.
And you will take these spacers out once it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:49.110
dries. And just let that sit up overnight,
and that’s the way you would design the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.989
starting point of your countertop.
