&gt;&gt; 
UYGUR: Ana.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.840
&gt;&gt; KASPARIAN: Yes?
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: What's the latest on Leno versus

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.820
Conan?
&gt;&gt; ANA: Okay. First of all both of them are

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.060
going on their own television shows and they're
both taking little stabs at one another, right?

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.930
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yes.
&gt;&gt; KASPARIAN: Leno's stabs are weak sauce,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.200
lame and unfunny, right? But Conan's stabs
are a little funny.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: I want to do both. I want to let
the audience decide.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.619
&gt;&gt; KASPARIAN: Okay.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Okay. So first, he is gay.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.519
&gt;&gt; KASPARIAN: Ha, ha, ha.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: He's terrible. Everybody does a

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.870
gay accent. Everybody can do one, apparently
except me. All right, so here's Leno going

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.770
after another guy a little bit. Let's watch.
&gt;&gt; LENO: Critics of the war have stopped referring

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.820
to it as another Vietnam, they're not calling
it anymore. The bad news, they're now calling

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.950
it another NBC, that's recorded. Welcome across
NBC, America's most dysfunctional TV family,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.420
huh? Thank you very much. Well, nobody knows
what's going on. If Conan O'Brien understands,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.030
he'll be very upset. He had a statement on
paper yesterday and Conan said, "NBC had only

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.619
given him seven months to make his show work."
When I heard that, seven months, how did he

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.250
get that deal? We only got four. Dave, who's
his agent? Get me that guy. I'll take seven.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.360
Well, all the late night hosts are having
a great fun with this debacle. Last night

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.680
Jimmy Kimmel did a show, dressed up as me.
Show that clip, here he is dress up like me.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
&gt;&gt; KIMMEL: My name is Jay Leno and, let it
hereby be known that I'm taking over all the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.570
shows in late night.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.909
&gt;&gt; LENO: Let's see what's coming up on our
late local news. Rick, Tonya.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.040
&gt;&gt; TONYA: Thanks a lot Jay. Coming up after
the Jay Leno show. An NFL player suffers his

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.970
17th concussion and is forced to become an
NBC executive. We have all the details.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.750
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah. I mean that, I got to be honest
upon a second watching that I swear I want

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.659
[INDISTINCT].
&gt;&gt; It did, right from the start. Everything

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.730
in there, you know, their calling it another
Vietnam they're call it another NBC. This

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.090
didn't make any sense. It's like...
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah, and you saw that joke coming

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.900
from a mile away and he almost wanted to stop
it like no, no, no, no don't, don't say NBC,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.670
ah, you said it.
&gt;&gt; Its funny, you know, the headline here

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.729
is about they're taking shots at each other
and the one joke they use in that is the reference

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.281
that, you know, that they--how did he got
that deal with seven months, I only got four.

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:11.569
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; That's not really a shot at Conan.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.120
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: I agree. I agree.
&gt;&gt; Actually, that's not a shot at all and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.150
actually that's the line I kind of like. I
thought that's, that's at least a joke.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.790
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah. It's a little unfair to say
that Leno's going after Conan. But Conan was

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.310
just waiting for any little thing to go after
Leno because what Leno's lying about--he's

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.780
making jokes about NBC and I don't mind Leno,
right? It's just--he's getting a great deal

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.090
here. Okay, he's, instead of getting cancelled
and gettin' walked out the door, he's getting

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.850
the Tonight show back--he always wanted the
Tonight show back. So he's pretending that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.310
he's aggrieved when he's not at all aggrieved.
&gt;&gt; No, he's not aggrieved at all. And what

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.410
is incredibly false about Jay Leno, what was
false when he got the--look, we're not--this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.410
aren't--we're not--these aren't six year olds
and everybody gets the equal amount of ice

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.120
cream and the person who doesn't get the equal
amount gets to cry about it.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.640
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Right.
&gt;&gt; I mean this is, these are big boys and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.200
no one as Conan said in his brilliant statement,
you know, don't shed a tear for me, for crying

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.299
out loud.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Right, right.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.860
&gt;&gt; But I have been put in this awkward public
situation. So I have to respond.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.310
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Right.
&gt;&gt; So no one needs to hold anyone's hand.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.010
But what Leno cannot do, what is disingenuous
and which I think strikes me is disingenuous

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.989
and unauthentic and I think its striking,
pretty much universally everyone who pays

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.561
attention to this as, is when he goes out
there after this all happens and says, you

00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:36.300
know, I mean I--you know, they're screwing
me, they're screwing Conan, I mean poor Conan--like

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.239
Jay didn't sit there and this didn't happened
to Jay. He made this happened.

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.800
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; He took Conan's job. Conan got the job,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.470
was promised it, did it for seven months the
ratings went down in part because of Jay's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.110
show.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.549
&gt;&gt; And then, now, Jay is not obligated to
let Conan keep that job, in no way.

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.550
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Right
&gt;&gt; What he needs to say is, yeah, look this

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.140
didn't work out for me and these guys I'd
like that job back, it's not doing that well,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.550
I hate to push out a guy like Conan. He doesn't
even need to say that much. He just needs

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.450
to say hey, we're all big boys, it's really
competitive, my ratings were better and I

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.230
want this job back and I can't wait to start
broadcasting at 11:30 to America and guess

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.709
what? Conan will be fine. But acting like
you care about Conan, acting like he cared

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.069
about Dave in 1993 that was what the--you
know, when you read the late shift, Jay is

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:27.370
a schever, he's a schemer and then, he's like
"oh, no, I'm every man, I'm George Bush, everybody

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.600
loves me, have an Odules; I'm great!"
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yeah, and that's what gets on everybody's

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
nerves.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.360
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: So now let's go to Conan, going
after Jay Leno a little bit and he did go

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.370
after him a little bit here. So let's watch.
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: You know, I'm trying very hard

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.610
to stay positive here. And I want to tell
you something. This is honest. Hosting a Tonight

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.791
show has been a fulfillment of a life long
dream for me. And I just want to say to the

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:54.660
kids out there watching, you can do anything
you want in life--yeah, unless Jay Leno wants

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.660
to do it too. You still using that? Because
I could now look at [INDISTINCT].

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.550
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: You're having a good time sticking
it to NBC aren't you?

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.360
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Oh, no, no; I'm just staying here
having a good time. That's all I...

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.360
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: They did--they did. They deserve
it. But I will say this.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.690
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Yes.
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: I think I should plug all my stuff

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:17.340
now in case they just take you off the air
like Mike Davis.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.650
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Done.
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: What you're going to do?

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.800
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: I'll find something to do. I'm
sure.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: Oh, really?
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: Okay.
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.970
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: You know I'm really worried about
it, because I saw that the effort was great.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.970
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Yes.
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: I feel for you. And I just think...

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.620
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Yes.
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: ...you know, you've been treated

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.880
badly, but what I don't--you got no discernable,
I'm not being funny this is--this is...

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.210
&gt;&gt; O'BRIEN: Sure, of course, yes, yes.
&gt;&gt; GERVAIS: You got no discernable skill.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.490
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Ricky Gervais is funny too.
&gt;&gt; On Letterman Tonight, Ricky Gervais said

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.479
that--he said our good friend Ricky Gervais
will be hosting the Golden Globe's if Jay

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.190
lets him.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: That's what Letterman said.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.250
&gt;&gt; That's Letterman Tonight.
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Okay, that's awesome. Now, by the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.261
way, why Conan's numbers went down because
of Leno which is what Ben said, is because

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:05.100
Leno's number were so bad that the news programs
that followed him were also had bad ratings

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.940
which led to bad ratings for Conan because
it all trickles down in television that way.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.780
So Conan...
&gt;&gt; Now, that said, I mean I suspected an equal

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.500
some game. At this point, Leno would do better
than Conan. I mean that's simple.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.030
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: Yes, because he's going to get us
all the audience back, people are used to

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.030
him et cetera.
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.479
&gt;&gt; UYGUR: So I get the NBCs decision on that--in
that term.
