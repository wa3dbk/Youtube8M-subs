00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.290
A hundred years ago we started putting
batteries on cars

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.530
but the basic structure of the battery
hasn't really changed much in 30 years.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.679
We're trying to add some intelligence
through control of how you use that battery

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.790
you try and come up with physics-based
model also understanding the material

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.850
properties

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.620
where the heat being generated and then
how that he is being taken out of

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.370
battery.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.680
We have the ability to connect these
batteries to an electric load or

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.130
a power supply which can simulate
vehicle drive cycles so we can actually

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.059
hook up single cells and and small

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.530
three or five cell modules to our
electric cycler next door

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.620
and we can say okay we want to simulate
this vehicle going through a new york

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.670
city drive cycle. This gives us a way to
actually both

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.190
calibrate the models are developing and
validate them

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.339
in fairly real-world conditions.So these

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.339
cells here are power cells out of a
hybrid electric vehicle.

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.829
Part of the project we're working on in
collaboration with Ford and

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.190
General Electric is to develop some
advance sensors to put in these battery

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.710
packs.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.850
So this is a three-year project to
develop very

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.130
thin film temperature and strain sensors
that can actually be put into a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.409
battery pack at different locations
to monitor

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.520
at what rate all the cells are degrading
and understand

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.000
actions we can take to prolong life of the
pack. So we've got a couple of these

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.909
temperature sensors here they're
actually measuring the battery

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:25.560
temperature

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.579
so when the when the battery here is
actually placed

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.780
in this bus bar you can see here
the battery temperature is actually

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.700
measured just great here on the top.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.490
This is the temperature sensor and its
just in contact

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.109
with one point on the top of the battery. So
this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.070
single measurement location can only
give you so much information about the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.210
battery and in fact

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.109
we're not even measuring every battery
temperature because these sensors cost a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.960
dollar apiece to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.630
put inside the battery that directly
correlates to the cost of the final vehicle.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.670
Manufactures come back to us and say,
you know, we only when he is 5 sensors.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.090
Do we have an argument for why they
should add that six sensor based on

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.300
what the temperature distribution looks
like over you know

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.950
the use a battery. Our project and goal
for this is to actually

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.810
take this battery pack re-instrument
some other cells in the battery pack put

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.920
it back together and actually put in a
vehicle

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.069
try out some the algorithms the we're developing. We can come up with some models

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.400
that really tell us these are the key
parameters in the system that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.409
we really need to be able to monitor and
control in order to increase reliability

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.519
and that's something that can enhance

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.519
I think the life of this battery in a
vehicle application.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.739
Related Video: So what we have achieved here is colored

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.129
solar cells you know the red stripes the
blue background they are actually

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.480
working solar cells.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.050
You want this material semiconductor
material to absorb

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.680
of the light...
