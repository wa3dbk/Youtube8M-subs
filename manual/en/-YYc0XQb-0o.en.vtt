00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.430
Robbie speaking for expert village. We talk
a little bit about the maintenance on your

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.480
electric motor. Brush motors considerably
more maintenance there that's required with

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.610
them after each run. If you have been running
in a dusty environment you need to stop by

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.809
your local hobby store and get something like
this electric motor cleaner has a little straw

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.550
in it like a WD-40 can. You spray it inside
the motor; flush it out real good, all the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:32.369
dust and everything will come out of it. Most
of the time you can get away with doing that.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.899
Brushes on these motors do wear so from time
to time the brushes will get worn down. You

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.710
have to actually physically pull them out
of there, put new brushes in solder them in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.269
place, replace the springs to get the motor
to come back to life. Also, if you want the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.250
motor to last you'll have to pull the engine
apart. You can take it to a hobby store or

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.230
someone at a race track and actually have
a put it on a lath and have a calm turn with

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.250
the lath on it, then you install your new
brushes, your new springs. For the most part

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.520
you've got you a brand new electric engine.
You can turn the engines quite a few times.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.190
It's not expensive to do its just kind of
a pain in the neck to have to pull them apart.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.740
Brush motors. On the case, in the case of
a brush less motor, like this one we've been

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.760
looking at, there is zero maintenance. Brush-less
motors are stay together you run them, run

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.580
them, run them, and run them till they don't
work anymore. That's one of the beauties of

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.240
the brush-less motor, so very little maintenance.
One of the other things that you got to be

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.480
real careful of also to get the proper life
out of them is making sure that you don't

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.280
generate too much heat, in other wards you
got to gear them properly. There's numerous

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:57.120
different sizes of pinions that you can buy
for these. All of these pinions are going

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:07.520
to change the speed that the car runs at so
if you're driving around real slow you want

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.689
to gear the car with a pinion, ok, or a lower
speed pinion. If you're going to be doing

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:22.980
a lot of high speed runs, you put a higher
speed pinion on there. The goal for that is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.250
keeping the motor running in its design operating
rpm's and you'll just adjust that with running

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.940
the appropriate pinion and of course tire
size on it as well.
