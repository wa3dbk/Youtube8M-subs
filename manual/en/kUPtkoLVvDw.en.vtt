In a word, it's...

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:32.164 align:start position:0%
It's a team of up to 10
kids Grade 7 through 12.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.734 size:88% position:44%
kids of all kinds of talents
and all kinds of backgrounds

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
working as a team, with a
volunteer coaches. 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.277 align:start position:0%
Every season we get a new challo
design, build and program a
robot

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
to play a field game against
other teams' robots.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.384 size:88% position:44%
We're not given much time or
resource. We have to keep a
real engineering notebook.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:56.389 align:start position:0%
It takes a lot of team work and
a lot of hard work, but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.191 align:start position:0%
it's the hardest fun you'll
ever have.

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:04.530 align:start position:0%
First Tech Challenge is one in
a progression of four robotics
programs that make up FIRST

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.865 align:start position:0%
What's FIRST? 

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
FIRST is designed to introduce
kids of all ages to the fun

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.676 align:start position:0%
and excitement of science,
technology, engineering and math

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start position:0%
and motivate them to pursue
education, career opportunities
and become leaders

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.715 size:81% position:41% line:92%
in these important fields.

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:28.220 align:start position:0% line:88%
Founded in 1989 by inventor 
Dean Kamen, FIRST has grown 
steadily to become an

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.858 size:84% position:42%
international phenomenon.
I think every single person
that is in high school

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:36.862 align:start position:0%
middle school, they should do
this. They should do FIRST
because this is amazing.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.867 align:start position:0%
FIRST Tech Challenge helps
build self-confidence, and
opens doors

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.904 align:start position:0%
to learning new skills, like
problem solving and overcoming
challenges

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:48.908 align:start position:0%
and leadership. 
In the process we discover a
lot about ourselves

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:52.946
and make so many new friends.
We call it sport for the mind

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.949 align:start position:0%
Best part is, anybody can play.
Each team gets sent

00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:00.986 align:start position:0% line:0%
Each team gets sent the 
same robot kit and they're
given a manual about how the
robot must play

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:04.990
The game changes every year and
can be pretty complicated, but

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.995 align:start position:0%
it's not just about the robot.
It's about building
self-confidence and building
respect.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:13.065 align:start position:0%
It's not so much about
winning or losing. It's really
about

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:17.069 align:start position:0%
the experience, learning and
building your mind to compete
tomorrow

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.107 align:start position:0%
FIRST Tech Challenge isn't just
about mechanics and
engineering. Every

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:25.144 align:start position:0%
FTC Team needs lots of help
from kids with every kind of
talent

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:29.181 align:start position:0%
What can you do that can help u?
Like to work with your hands?
Can you draw?

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:33.219
paint or sew? Shoot video? Give?
Do you know about electronics?

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.257 size:88% position:44%
There's a job for everybody.
It's about working as a team

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:41.293 align:start position:0%
Respecting everyone and their
ideas.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:44.197 align:start position:0% line:91%
We learn from you and you learn
from us!

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:49.368 align:start position:0%
Basically this is a sport where 
if you show up you can play 
and every student has
the opportunity

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.704 align:start position:0% line:91%
to go pro at the end of their
schooling

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:57.409 align:start position:0%
FIRST Tech Challenge games are 
built on a sports model
designed to be played with two
teams on a side

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.413 align:start position:0%
called an alliance, so each
team has to build relationships
with other

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:05.451 align:start position:0%
teams who might be their
partners in one game and their
opponents in the

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.488 align:start position:0%
next. Everybody helps everybody
else and treats all players
with respect

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:13.525 align:start position:0%
What FIRST refers to as
Gracious ProfessionalismÂ®

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:17.596 align:start position:0%
The season's most successful
team earn a spot at the FIRST
Tech Challenge world
championship

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0%
in St. Louis. Students are
eligible to apply for millions
of dollars

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:26.672 align:start position:0%
in scholarships, along with
recognition for achievements
far beyond building a
great robot.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.709
So that's FIRST Tech Challenge.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.779 align:start position:0%

volunteer or sponsor a team in
your neighborhood
