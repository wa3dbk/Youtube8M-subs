00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.183
"The simple prayer of the Rosary marks the rhythm of human life" of John Paul II

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.966
Tell us the Second Vatican Council:

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:23.288
"" In reality, the mystery of man only in the mystery of the Incarnate Word (in Jesus)

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.210
truly becomes clear ".

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.417
The Rosary helps to open up in this light.

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:38.704
[...] (The man) contemplating the birth of Jesus learns the sacredness of life,

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:48.394
looking at the house of Nazareth learn the original truth of the family according to God's plan,

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:57.328
listening to the Master in the mysteries of public life receives light to enter the kingdom of God,

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:04.307
and following him on the way to Calvary learns the salvific meaning of suffering.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.900
Looking at last to Christ and his Mother in glory,

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:21.467
sees the goal to which each of us is called, if left to heal and transform the Holy Spirit.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:32.147
One can therefore say that each mystery of the Rosary and meditated, illuminates the mystery of man.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:42.557
At the same time, it becomes natural to bring to this encounter with the holy humanity of the Redeemer

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:51.558
numerous problems, hardships, toils and projects that define our lives.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:02:03.274
"Cast upon the Lord thy care, and he will sustain you" (Ps 55, 23).

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:16.264
Meditating with the Rosary means to deliver care to our merciful hearts of Christ and His Mother "

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:23.815
(The Apostolic Letter: Rosarium Virginis Mariae paragraph 25)
