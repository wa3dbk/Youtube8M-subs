The edging that you’ll see on this blanket
is different from a lot of edgings that you’ll

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.270
see on other things, in that there was a look
that I was going for, and the technique that

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.310
I ended up using is almost a crochet technique.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.609
Kind of is a crochet technique with knitting
needles.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.680
I’ll quit talking about it and actually
let you take a look at the edging.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.230
It’s little loops that match up with the
diagonal stripes in the blanket.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.230
And these loops are done with yarn over bind
offs.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.300
Which is pretty much crochet chain with your
knitting needles.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.160
So there’s your look at how it ends up when
you’re finished with it.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.670
And now let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.220
Here’s my work, I have a teeny tiny little
blanket here. We’re going to pretend I’m

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.350
actually finished with it.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:11.510
And I’m going to start looking at my pattern
here, I’ll knit two, bind off one, and then

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.659
yarn over bind off times five.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.289
And a yarn over bind off is just what it sounds
like.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.130
Yarn over, whoops I lost it.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.909
Yarn over, one, yarn over, bind off two, yarn
over, bind off three, yarn over, bind off

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.409
four, yarn over, bind off five.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.969
That is a crochet chain, my friends.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.850
I’m going to now knit two together, bind
off one, and then do the yarn over bind offs

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
again.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:52.700
Yarn over, bind off one, yarn over, bind off
two, three, four, five.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:01.069
Again, I’ll knit two together. This connects
it back down to the blanket.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:11.290
Bind off, yarn over, one, two, three, four,
five.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.069
That’s the idea and here you can see the
little loops all the way around the blanket.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.531
Well, we’ve finished two, all the way around.

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.810
I’ve finished two. [laughs] There’s your
example.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.570
It’s two little loops around the blanket.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.030
And once you finish that, you will want to,
of course, weave in your ends, and you’ll

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.240
want to block this.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.290
Things will be a little bit eschew, and your
edging will not lay down flatly until you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.820
either steam block this or completely wash
this and lay it out flat to dry.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.530
I, in fact, to get things looking really smooth,
um, before shooting this video, and probably

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.850
before, you’d want to do this before you
presented this as a gift to someone, I actually

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.570
ironed it out a little bit.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.350
And with this yarn that I’m using here in
the pattern, it’s not going to do any harm.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.730
If this was knit with wool, I’d be worried
about flattening out the stitches or something,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.280
but in cotton it’s not a big deal.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.990
Once I ironed it out everything looked beautiful,
and the edges laid really flat and it was

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.990
really nice.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.480
So that’s the yet-unnamed lacy blanket.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.150
I hope to have a name for it before I actually
release the pattern.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.150
Good luck.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.440
[fly buzzing]

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.840
Ugh! Flies!

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.640
