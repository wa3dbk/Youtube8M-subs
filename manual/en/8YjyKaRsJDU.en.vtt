♫ Lollipop, lollipop ♫

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.187
(suspenseful music)

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:12.223
(Lollipop screaming)
(cracking)

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:13.202
♫ Ba, dum, dum, dum ♫

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:15.092
- Not cool, dude.

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:17.977
- (scoffs) Whatever. Cupcake.

00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:19.766
- Don't call me Cupcake.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.351
- Fine. Muffin.

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.956
- Don't call me Muffin.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.435
- Fine, oversized candle.

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.388
- Wait, what?

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:29.476
♫ Ba dum, dum, dum ♫

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:30.796
(laughing)

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.564
- Yo, Orange, wanna play some Minecraft--

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.250
- Not now, Little Apple.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.937
Looks like it's going
to be a really busy day.

00:00:35.937 --> 00:00:38.273
I don't even have time to make
a short joke at your expense.

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:40.284
- Whoa, you really are slammed.

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:42.580
- Yeah, probably gonna have
to skip the title card too.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.819
(thrilling music)

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.623
Hey, what did I just say
about the title card? (growls)

00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:48.269
- [Voiceover] Ow, my leg!
- That's better.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.017
Now where was I?

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:52.114
- [Voiceover] You have
an 11 AM meeting with--

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:53.374
- Apple.

00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:55.182
- [Voiceover] Haha, very funny.

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:57.173
What do you mean? I'm
talking about Apple here.

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:58.311
- Hello, Orange.

00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.871
- Hello, Stick in the Mud. (laughs)

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.801
- No!

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.889
- I guess I was wrong
about the mud. (laughs)

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:10.237
- (laughs) It's not
looking good for me, is it?

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.065
(suspenseful music)
- But don't worry, Caramel,

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:13.223
I'll never forget you.

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:16.779
- Actually, it's a Caramel!

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:17.856
- Meh, whatever.

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.765
- Hey, hey Chubby Hot Dog, hey!

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.000
- You must be talking to me.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.890
For I am Bockwurst!

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.836
- And I am his brother Knackwurst.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.075
- And we are here to

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:29.127
- [Both] plump you up.

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:30.914
- Yeesh, I didn't know
we were having a sausage

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:33.170
party today. (laughs)

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.486
- But why is he laughing at us?

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:37.517
- Probably 'cause you're
talking just like me.

00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:39.488
(speaking gibberish)

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.511
- No, you talk like me.
You even growl like me.

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:48.511
(speaking gibberish)

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.403
- Sorry, I was just clearing my throat.

00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:03.475
What I meant to say is grill!

00:02:03.475 --> 00:02:08.475
(speaking gibberish)

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:13.930
- I hate it when wurst
comes to wurst. (laughs)

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.393
Hey, hey, Pudding Pop, what's going

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:16.490
down town, James Brown?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.400
- Oh, not much, Orange.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.696
(suspenseful music)
What have you been up to?

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:21.549
- Grill!

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.551
- Why would you put a delicious
pudding pop on a grill?

00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.949
Why?!

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.070
- Yeah, I gotta say I'm
struggling with that one too.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.137
- So, it is wisdom you seek.

00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:36.657
Perhaps you should look inward.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.688
- Yeah, and perhaps you
should look out for mallets.

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:39.995
- Huh?

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:43.747
- Oh, how thoughtful. Cookie
wrote me a little note.

00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.820
Very soon, you will run out of jokes.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.669
I wonder what that means.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.371
- Hello, friend, can you tell me where

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:53.865
to find the refrigerator? (laughs)

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.400
- Beats me, last I heard,
it was running. (laughs)

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.838
- Very good, thank you.

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:04.172
- No problem, you, you can of...

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:05.832
you know, stuff.

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:07.498
- Foaming, non-dairy dessert topping,

00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:10.281
but all of my friends
call me whipped cream.

00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:11.947
- Yeah, I bet they do.

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:13.613
- And how.

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:15.909
(laughing)

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.860
- Dude, what's going on?

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.030
- It's just been a long day.
I'm not out of jokes, okay?

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.056
- OMG. The fortune cookie was right.

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:26.474
- No, I've got something
for this, just wait.

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:30.056
Um, um, um...

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.041
(dramatic music)

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.073
Forget this. (spits)

00:03:40.073 --> 00:03:43.304
- Whoa!

00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:48.267
(upbeat music)
