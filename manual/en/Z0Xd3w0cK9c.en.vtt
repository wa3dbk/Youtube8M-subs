00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:07.839
HP 88 and 940 printheads can fail for a variety
of reasons. However, in most cases, instead

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.120
of buying a $60 or $70 printhead from HP,
it's actually possible to repair your own

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.940
for a fraction of that price using an InkOwl
HP 88 and 940 printhead repair tool!

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.080
Before showing you how to use the tool to
fix your printhead, we'll review the main

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.570
reasons printheads fail and whether or not
this tool is appropriate for your situation.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
This tool will not repair electronic failure
or a burnt printhead. If your printer is actually

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.050
alerting you that the printhead is not usable,
then you most likely have an electrical problem.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.610
The tool is primarily intended to repair air
infiltration into the printhead. If your printhead

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
is severely clogged but doesn't have any air
infiltration, then you should unclog it with some

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
InkOwl printhead cleaning solution instead.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.210
Here is how to find out whether or not your
printhead has air infiltration: Simply weigh

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.020
the printhead on a precise scale. A functioning
printhead weighs 60g or 2.1oz. If

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.810
your weight is any less, your printhead has
air infiltration. If the weight is between

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.780
between 57g and 60g, so above 2oz,
then your printhead is probably fine, but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.400
anything below 57g, and you should definitely
use this tool.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.640
Here is how to use InkOwl's HP 88 and 940
printhead repair tool to remove all the air

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.900
from your printhead:

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.530
Step 1. Plug the syringe adapter into the
printhead.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.860
Step 2. Plug the double funnel into the ink
entry ports on the printhead.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.200
Step 3. Pour some of the appropriate color
inks into the double funnel.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.850
Step 4. Attach the syringe to the adapter
and apply negative pressure to force the ink

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.000
through the printhead. This action will force
out all the air bubbles trapped inside.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.020
Step 5. When you notice that the ink coming
out of the printhead is clean and free of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.439
air bubbles, you can stop pulling and remove
the tool, rinsing it with water for future

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.479
use.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.090
Wipe the printhead off with a slightly damp
paper towel. Then, press it against a clean

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.309
and dry paper towel. A solid pattern like
this one should appear. At this point, the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.709
weight of the printhead should be
60g, but anything above 57g should be

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.249
fine.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.989
Now, if your printhead is not producing a
clean pattern, you should let it rest for

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.290
several minutes in some printhead cleaning
solution and then try again. Another trick

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.090
you can try using our tool is to fill the
syringe with a bit of the solution and then

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.370
gently force some of it in and out of the
printhead. You'll notice the solution mixing

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.219
with ink as the clogged ink particles are
broken up and dissolved. Finally, you can

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.239
cycle some fresh ink back into the printhead
to flush out any solution that will have entered.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.340
By using InkOwl's HP 88 and 940 printhead
repair tool, you can greatly prolong the life

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.249
of your printhead units, which will save you
