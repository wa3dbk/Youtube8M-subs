00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.880
Nice four boys.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.980
There's a misconception in the states that
cricket is a foreign game and that baseball

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.750
is the American game,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.300
but in fact cricket is the original American
game.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.540
George Washington played it and over time
baseball kind of took over, but cricket is

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.870
coming up again in the US

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.440
and it's really exciting

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.190
and it's great to have all these teams come
out and make sure that cricket emerges in

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.210
the United States.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510
I personally don't believe cricket is confusing.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.960
There are some small rules in cricket which
can be confusing for a first timer,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.760
but if you just concentrate and know that
the two ways you're going to get out is bowled

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.890
which is the ball hitting the stumps like
a strikeout in baseball

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.030
and caught out which is a caught out in baseball.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.309
So if you concentrate on that, you're right
there.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.010
We actually have a lot of beginners.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.250
People who were born here, people who are
from China and Japan where there is no cricket

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.720
at all,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.370
but they were interested in knowing the game

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.970
so we just invited them to our practices and
then they know everything now.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.650
It's not complicated to them.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.350
So I guess you can compare it pretty much
to baseball.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.290
Instead of a diamond where you have foul balls
and stuff in baseball,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.510
there are no fouls balls in cricket.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.630
It's a 360 degree field, so you're always
in action.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.020
On a superficial level, they do have a lot
of similarities.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.770
You have people run around, something similar
to bases.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.290
You have to score runs.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.549
People catch the ball, you have a catcher
who's collecting the ball thrown by the pitcher.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.540
But I guess there's also a lot more stuff
that's different.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.080
The pitcher doesn't just directly throw the
ball.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.560
The pitcher actually has to run the steps
and then actually bowl after the run-up.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.840
There are a lot of different things like you
know, every time you hit,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.990
you don't have to run, whereas in baseball,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.290
every time you hit, you have to go for that
first base.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.990
The most amazing thing about cricket which
I feel like separates it from baseball

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.540
and makes it really great is that you have
to catch this ball barehanded.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.799
There is no glove.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.890
There's like techniques to catch it and stuff,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.290
but overall, once that ball goes up,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.540
you wanna catch it but you know it's going
to hurt.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.230
It usually lasts three hours, just like baseball,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.060
but rather than having baseball scores which
are 5-2, 6-1, stuff like that,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.310
we have runs that go up to 180, 190, sometimes
even 200.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.040
So you're always on your feet, there's pretty
much a run every ball

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.370
and you're trying to get as much runs as possible

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.790
and try and make sure the other team gets
less than you.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.870
I play cricket because I grew up playing cricket.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.200
Just for me growing up, my whole family watched
cricket.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.760
We would just kind of gather around the TV
and just have a good time.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.980
It's also a very social thing.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.099
The great thing about our sport is that the
alums don't leave the club.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.340
The alums constantly come back and help us
out with our games.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.280
They're there for support, even coaching purposes
and those alums usually

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.500
I've seen in the past that students who are
playing end up getting jobs

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.840
because those alums guide them and sometimes
bring them into their companies and stuff,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.090
so it's just more than a game.
