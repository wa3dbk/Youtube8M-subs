00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.420
Hi guys, so you're never going to believe what just happened.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.580
We are gonna be fashion designers.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.476
We're influencing a new clothing line for Kohl's.

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.955
Which is awesome because neither of us have done anything like this.

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.615
We're really excited, a little nervous, but excited.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.133
And there's so much to do.

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:18.275
We have a list.

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:22.288
We have to do a style board, mock ups, pick styles of clothing we like

00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:24.473
colors, fabrics, it's crazy.

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:28.975
But seriously, Amanda, our clothes are going to be in all of the Kohl's all over the U.S.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:29.894
Can you imagine?

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:31.274
It's a dream come true.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.980
Hi can you approve these before they go to production?

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.480
These are perfect.

00:00:40.053 --> 00:00:41.413
That one needs help.

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:42.894
Take a look at the original sketches.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:47.114
This is the new line. Kylie Jenner just called and she wants some samples.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.600
Send her this.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.200
This is so exciting. I can't wait to get started.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.114
Well, first we need to put together a style board.

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:04.294
It's a way to show the designers what influences our style.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:05.734
Which will help shape the line.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.740
And you know how we're gonna do that?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.620
Room Tour!

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.320
Hi everyone! I'm Lia! And this is my room tour.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.340
And I'm eating Cheese-Its. They're in my teeth.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.220
I got this little lady at the flea market for only four dollars.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.620
And I thought it was so cool when I saw it.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.295
And I had to buy it instantly.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.100
I love going to the flea market, you find such cool things there.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.993
My dad travels a lot.

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.373
I have this snow globe that my dad got me from Rome.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.800
He got this for me in Japan.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.447
And it's made out of gold.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.660
I have this mask. I made it in my art class.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.500
And basically you had two choices. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.820
you could either just make a fake face

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.440
And like plaster it. Or you could use your actual face

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.060
And I was like the only person in class that was brave enough

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.340
to get my face plastered.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.840
But that's how it came out.

00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:06.694
My style is very boho, artsy, and colorful.

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:09.055
Floral prints should definitely be apart of the clothing line.

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:15.834
Over here I just have some lipsticks and lip glosses.

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.534
That I use more often.

00:02:17.534 --> 00:02:21.614
They're definitely like neutral, but kind of darker colors like this.

00:02:21.614 --> 00:02:24.738
This is what probably most of the colors look like.

00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:29.159
And It’s very 90’s. I like that look it’s like darker but still natural.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.520
In here I just have some jewelry. 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.540
I don’t wear these ones as much but I still like to have them.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.740
I wear a lot of gold and there’s also some bohemian looking necklaces like this one.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.660
 I definitely have retro looking sunglasses.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.080
90’s grunge, I guess that’s how I would describe my style. I think these sunglasses really capture that too. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.980
And then I have a candle and a tower of palettes.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.920
So I have a ton of makeup palettes and I just kind of set them up

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.400
like this so it looks like a tower or like a decoration but it’s still make up palettes. 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.580
I love retro and darker palettes and definitely want that reflected.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.980
This is me and my little sister when we were babies.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.620
That's me and that's her 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.560
and when I saw this I was like dang we are so coachella.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.300
Before we even knew that coachella was coachella. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.100
and this is my old guitar her name is Emmy and it’s a mixture of my little sister’s name Emma and Sammy. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000
Music definitely influences my style a lot.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.840
Whatever I'm listening to if I'm feeling more indie. I'll wear maybe a more Indie outfit.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.200
If I'm listening to rap, like I usually do it's definitely an outfit that's more confident.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.020
Music is a big part of our lives. We should make sure the clothes are coachella ready.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.180
This poster so cool. Definitely need like glamour, beauty, so me.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.114
And I really like how these kind of like pulls it together and like balances it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.880
because it's like edgy with the skulls and the black and grey. 'Cos that's definitely how my style's like.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.725
But it's still feminine in a way.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.785
And pink is actually one of my favorite colors which people wouldn't really expect.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.280
And these are my stars. 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.940
I like to sleep under them because it feels like I'm either in space or on a camping trip.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.915
Because we both like glam and girly with an edge, that's what the pieces in the line should look like.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.780
Right here is what I call my swag rack.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.240
Skirts, I love skirts, definitely high waisted skirts.

00:04:21.134 --> 00:04:25.054
Kimonos I love. I love them just like slouchy and bohemian.

00:04:25.054 --> 00:04:30.514
I like how this one is black because I wear a lot of dark colors and its bohemian but it's also edgy. 

00:04:30.514 --> 00:04:32.967
So I think that's really awesome and I love that style.

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:39.454
And then I have some flannels I'm always wearing flannels whether it's tie around my waist or just on normally.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.980
So this one I think is cute it has like this maroon color in it. I love the maroon color.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.660
And the plaid is awesome.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.720
So these are some of my clothes, not all of them. This dress is my friend's. 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.920
And my friend has the best sense of style. Ever.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.580
And I want everything that she owns.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.320
I think it's so cool. It's very dark and mysterious.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.834
Boyfriend jeans. Boyfriend sweater.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.140
The good thing about boyfriend jeans and boyfriend clothes 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.694
is that you don't really need a boyfriend to wear it. You can just go out and buy it.

00:05:11.694 --> 00:05:15.399
And this is one of my favorite things in the whole wide world.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.554
It's just an overly size sweater.

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:20.234
It has like holes in it so you can throw it over any outfit.

00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:26.714
Flannels. I love flannels. This one is really cool because it has gold thingys on it.

00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:29.015
Baseball tee and the boy shirt.

00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:31.260
This little romper, I love rompers.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.640
I got this at the fairfax flea market.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.440
It's like really cool. You just like throw it on with some overalls or something. 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.900
wear it on your back. Feel like a little turtle.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.414
Since we both like flannels, the clothes should definitely have a 90's grunge look.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.900
Inspiration is everywhere. Show us where you get yours with the hashtag SoRad. On Insta and Twitter.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.573
So those were our room tours.

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:56.393
And these are our style boards.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.660
Next week we're going shopping for styles and shapes and cuts that we like.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.834
This is so rad.

00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:08.520
Lia, you're a genius. We should totally call the line So Rad!

00:06:13.614 --> 00:06:19.854
If you want to wear these clothes too. Go to Kohl's or Kohls.com and shop the So Rad collection.
