00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.810
We are so excited to tell you about a brand
new dress line called Divina brought to you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.440
by Something New Boutique.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.380
When Mindy and I started Something New Boutique
back in 2008, a lot of that was birthed out

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.590
of her experience as a bride.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.430
We both felt that every bride deserves the
absolute best experience when looking for

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.010
her gown.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.850
Really there is a personal passion behind
the Something New Boutique story.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.620
That’s why I’m really excited about the
Divina line that she’s releasing because

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.080
it’s a culmination of her gifting of the
Something New Boutique philosophy that the

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.330
girl comes really does before the dress.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.329
With the Divina line that we’re releasing
in January, we couldn’t be more excited.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.190
I’m so proud of her and the team.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.100
We can’t wait for our brides and the whole
country to see these dresses.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.339
We had the idea about a year ago to design
and bring in an exclusive line of dresses

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.910
that would be unique to Colorado brides.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
So we named the dress line “Divina” because
we want every bride that wears one of our

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.730
gowns to feel divine on her wedding day.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.140
In conjunction with that, we wanted to do
something bigger.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.410
We wanted every bride that wore one of our
dresses to give back to someone else.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.150
We decided to partner with an organization
called SakSAUM and a portion of all of our

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.229
dress sales will go to them.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.500
SakSAUM is a program in Cambodia where we
work with rescue, rehabilitation, restoration,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.410
and reintegration of trafficked women that
includes exploited, vulnerable, and sexually

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.410
abused.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.180
First year, we have a program for holistic
healing, mind, body, soul, spirit, social,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.180
vocational, and financial.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.399
We end up helping the girl to be empowered
that she can succeed in her emotions, her

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.610
mind, and in the person that she is, and also
in a skill.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.780
They’re completely trained to be able to
sew complete a product from start to finish.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.780
Be empowered at the end with a sewing machine
and then they can graduate and go back to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.030
community and be successful.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.009
A beautiful thing about this is the story
of redemption of the bride, of the wedding,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.080
and we really believe in what SakSAUM does
with helping rehabilitate people’s lives,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.130
with giving them opportunity, with training
them with income generating opportunities

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.400
for their own life to start over again.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.220
So many things with a wedding combined with
that.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.270
For brides to know that their purchase of
a quality, hand-crafted designed gown personally

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.850
by Mindy is outstanding.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.330
We couldn’t be happier to help support SakSAUM.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.670
I connected with Mindy because if anyone does
brides, it’s Mindy.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.520
She’s the first person that they go and
see once they decide to get married, “Let’s

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.580
go get the dress!”

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.270
When Mindy approached me about becoming a
part of this she flew into Chicago and we

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.660
sat down and she pulled out some sketches
and started sharing the vision of what she

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.080
wanted to do.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.440
She had said she had been watching and seeing
what I’ve been doing and I feel like this

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.640
is the perfect opportunity for us to come
together and collaborate on something awesome.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.940
I’m doing this line, it’s been in my heart
for a long time and I’m going to go for

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.940
it.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.810
And she said will you design all of the accessories
to go with my line.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.320
I said absolutely and so then we got to work.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.830
She was sketching and coming up with these
awesome ideas for the designs and I did the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.830
same.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.790
When Mindy and I got together this week on
Monday, it was perfect.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.980
Everything that I designed just went perfectly
with her line.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.090
It was just miraculous to be honest.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.600
I am beyond excited and honored to be a part
of this project.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.470
When Mindy and I got together to talk about
the vision of this shoot, we decided that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.320
we didn’t want to use professional models,
mainly because we didn’t want the photography

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.010
and the look of the line to come off as cookie-cutter.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.840
We decided to use the Broadmoor as the location
for our shoot, so the thought popped into

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.180
my mind to immediately contact Lindsey, not
only because she is such a joy to work with,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.700
but it’s the Broadmoor.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.400
It’s one of the top 100 hotels in the world.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.710
It’s elegant, while still having that old,
rustic charm.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.350
It was the perfect place.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.480
I was most excited when Mindy called me about
shooting the dresses here at the Broadmoor.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.190
Her personality is just the best.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.470
You just want to be with Mindy and anything
that she does.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.909
And working with Audrey, you just know that
this is going to be a high end project.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.460
I’m so excited for Mindy and the gowns she’s
designed.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.439
They’re stunning and beautiful and I knew
it was going to be a perfect fit here at the

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.090
Broadmoor.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.150
Something New Boutique is where the girl comes
before the dress so we really want to welcome

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.030
you to come in and experience that for yourself
and to see these Divina dresses in person.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.430
We have some that we made from scratch, those
are our designs.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.860
We also have some that we were able to bring
in exclusively and put our personal touches

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.860
on.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.750
And remember, there’s only a limited quantity.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.669
We have about 100 dresses from this collection.

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.050
Once they’re gone, they’re gone.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.960
We want you to be one of our brides and come
see us soon.
