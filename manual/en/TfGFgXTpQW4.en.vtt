00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:18.440
How to Be a Hypermiler.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.360
A hypermiler does whatever they can to maximize
gas mileage.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.100
There are safe ways to do this, and then there
are extreme measures that are not worth the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.100
danger.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.650
We’re going to tell you the difference.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.140
You will need Driving skills Patience The
ability to withstand other drivers’ rage

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.930
and a hybrid car.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.541
Don’t even think about tailgating big rigs
to catch their drafts or cutting the engine

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.541
and coasting in neutral.

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:44.541
Getting brag-worthy mileage isn’t worth
risking your life.

00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:45.541
Step 1.

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:46.541
Stay within the speed limit.

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:49.320
For every 5 miles per hour you drive above
55, your fuel efficiency is reduced by up

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.320
to 10 percent.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.070
Step 2.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.070
Coast when you can.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.719
It uses no fuel.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.100
Try to park on hills, where you can get a
rolling start.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.330
Step 3.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.850
Keep your tires inflated at the maximum.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.750
The flatter the tire, the more it drags on
the road.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.270
Don’t do what some hypermilers do and over-inflate
your tires; it could cause a blowout.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.420
Step 4.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.110
Use the thinnest oil recommended for your
car, get regular oil changes, and have the

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.580
air filter changed when it gets dirty.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.580
Step 5.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.009
Avoid fuel-wasting stop-and-go driving by
taking the road less traveled.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.090
Step 6.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.720
Install hood insulation to keep the engine
warm, when it operates most efficiently.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.720
Step 7.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.659
Keep the AC off and the windows up when possible.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.439
