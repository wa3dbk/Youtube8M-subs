00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:26.092
Daniel Mercier, due to my accent you will understand that I'm Quebecois

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:31.698
I was athletic trainer in Canada

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.734
I had to wonder about several things

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.203
because athletic is different than ski mountaineering

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.239
Even if the training principles are similar

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:41.708
even if the first questions are identical

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.611
the answer could be really different

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:52.118
First we had to evaluate the ski mountaineering activity in a simple value expressed in W/Kg

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:56.489
So I developed a method to know her power

00:00:56.523 --> 00:01:06.266
by considering the gradient of the uphill, her speed, the load and the weight on her foots

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.869
Qualities of Laetitia ? 
She has got a lot !

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:17.210
The first one is her willpower and motivation when it's useful

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:24.651
Physicaly, from her heredity and the training

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:30.123
she has fantastic energetic quality and stamina

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.393
As she is lightweight is perfect during the uphill

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.563
and to ski down she was alpine-skier

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:49.309
I start my specific training for my 2013 ski season by the middle of October

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:56.749
On the Stelvio glacier
So I went to Italy to ski

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:04.090
Before the first races it's difficult to really know our grade

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.830
The first test to evaluate my fitness was the French Championships

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:17.403
I had good feelings and to my mind it's the most important

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:21.841
Compared to the other my times was pretty good

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:26.045
so it corroborates my feelings

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:32.252
My first international race was the 12th January

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:42.529
Good feelings was still there and good results also, I win the the two races

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.470
Today we are on the individual of the World Cup, at Marecottes, Swiss

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:57.277
Nice course, I won this stage ahead Mireia Miro, Spain

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.550
Gloriana started quickly so I followed her

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:12.292
 Then I hadn't waited to lead the race and distance my pursuers

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:28.508
It was a nice race, really pleasant with an interesting route

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:54.067
During the competition it's really hard, this sport is really difficult

00:03:54.067 --> 00:04:00.073
So everyone will doing its best and will run to win, definitely !

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.177
But once the finish line passed we are all friend

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:13.486
we share really pleasant and convivial times together

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:17.957
I really appreciate this sharing spirit between athletes

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:29.569
it's nice to exchange with new athletes, sometimes younger and still learning

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.709
So I like help them and share our experience too

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:55.855
Thanks to the staff, it's not so easy to manage a race like this

00:05:55.822 --> 00:06:00.493
So if tonight we welcome nearly 200 racers it's thanks to all of you

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:07.667
I hope you appreciate, you will be back next year and we will live the same good party

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:13.272
Thanks to all of you, have a safe trip and enjoy this new season !
