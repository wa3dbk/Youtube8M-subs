00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.969
I am Patrick Olsen the suburban dad for cars.com

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.050
well the most interesting things to come
out the auto show season this year

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.119
boxy cars like the Nissan Cube or the
Kia Soul

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.740
they're gonna compare that peculiar and
the soul and some key features to see

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.900
which one is right for you

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.840
birth here

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.070
in the solver for leap left the field
for the inside left out there or need

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.390
water for this class

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.510
it's got really messing design isolated
thunder that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.930
in the glove box there's a ton of space
down the center

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.390
there are class for two different
couplers and more storage space but when

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.610
I don't like is that they're not support
my elbows

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.550
in the queue with my cum

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.540
combination the traditional me and
neutral for sure to pass a girl suffered

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.180
matter to the touch and that's all

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.810
rate is kinda on the same if I never
wear but we have this I started

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.670
primadonna

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.860
you and the seller the glove box equally
as large

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.729
we find that we have couple hours before
I'm but they also have this couplers up

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.200
here

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.619
these were me a little because if you
have the wrong size container lineup

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:10.979
with your drink in your lap

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.799
that being said I think the interior
quality feel that in the queue

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.789
is a much better than us all so this one
as the one for her we talk about the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.340
second round the soul she comes on nice
n Easy

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.509
in your flat load floor and my knees
barely brushing up the front seat

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:33.030
but this seems don't recline and they're
all back and forth Mesa cube differences

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.340
that got the strings

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.229
the poll villager Highness Sheikh
backward report that's very nice

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.579
in addition they've got the ability to
move the whole row forward

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.889
or bad as you need Tom important
overseas don't lie flat and not make for

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:46.850
a flat load floor

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.179
in this case I think at the time the
cute come to the swing it would you not

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.209
wild about

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.670
the second row seats though but I'm
pretty easily but they don't give you up

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.310
a clean flat load floor now there's tons
of cargo space in their

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.310
you up the side need something flat or
use a lot of space

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.850
in the sole you find that you can get a
flat floor my long the Seas ending in

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.610
this mess toward underneath that
platform but what makes

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.310
the sole the winner in this category is
lifted the kids up and I love your way

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.980
not the whole opened not to worry about
traffic taking a nap

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.470
gonna give us perhaps most distinctive
all the bakkie type

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.210
car seat covers recall ripple effect in
the ceiling in the car on the speaker

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.270
Steven at the bottom

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.810
up the cup holder now that being said
this car lou to uni

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.010
for me when it comes to the soul

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.660
I like the styling of Morris lot more
aggressive plumber contemporary looking

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.320
a lot less

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.130
Japanese what well so for starting point
I give it to the fall

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.880
so let's recap the q1 furniture

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.640
quality they tied on the second row in
that space and usability

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.280
for the soul for me was much better
terms of the styling and the cargo

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.730
access the backs of me

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.080
ITU's the sole tough real if you liked
it there were climbing move back and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.120
forth in the second row you may choose
to kill

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.459
the current a very similarly priced at
about 600 bucks between them

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.390
now look for incentives to see if you
can he make a better deal for additional

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.780
