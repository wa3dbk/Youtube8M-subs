00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.399
Hey what's up?

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.620
This is Andy with MyTechMethods.com back with
another video for you today.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.650
This video is going to be a short tutorial
on how to put movies on an iPad.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.659
So today I'll show you how to load that bad
boy up with a bunch of movies so you can watch

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.830
them on your iPad wherever you are.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.510
So basically there are two main ways to put
movies on an iPad.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.960
The first way is obviously through iTunes
itself by buying and purchasing them on the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.960
iTunes Store.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.560
And the second way which I'll be showing you
today is copying movies from DVDs and putting

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.579
them into iTunes then syncing them onto your
iPad.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.029
So I'll go ahead and show you how to do that
right now.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.840
To do this you'll be using DVD ripping software
from a company called Digiarty.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.910
They have some of the best DVD Rippers for
Mac and Windows so whatever operating system

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.260
you're on go ahead and click that link.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.250
You'll see links on the video right now and
in the description below.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.980
If you're a Windows user click the Windows
download link.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.050
If you're a Mac user click the Mac download
link, and download and install that program.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.000
You'll be able to try it out for free and
when you see that it works for you and you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.820
like it, you can register the full copy at
a special discounted price right from the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.260
program itself.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.150
For Mac users it's going to be Mac X DVD Ripper
Pro.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.280
For Windows it's going to be Win X DVD Ripper
Platinum, but they both work exactly the same

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.190
so you can follow along no matter what operating
system you're on.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.110
So after you've downloaded the application
from the links below and you've installed

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.990
it on your computer, open it up and you'll
see the application's home screen right here.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.190
Next thing you want to do is insert the DVD
movie into your DVD drive on your computer

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.690
then click this DVD button in the top left
of the program.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.990
And it should display the name of the DVD
movie in your drive right now then click OK.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.630
Now when the output profile window pops up
you're going to go down to Apple device and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
choose iPad video and then choose whatever
iPad model that you own that you're going

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.400
to put this movie on.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
And always choose the recommended option for
your device so say if I have an iPad Mini,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.920
which I do, I'll choose this iPad Mini Recommended.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.440
Recommended just means the application has
automatically selected the best quality options

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.190
for your specific device.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.960
So I have my device and the recommended quality
selected then I'll click Done.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.940
And here the main movie is already detected
and selected for me so the only thing I have

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.130
to do is click Run, and the movie will end
up in my Desktop folder.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.470
Now here's a cool little tip, if you want
the movie file to automatically be added to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.281
iTunes when it's copied onto your computer
click this Browse button here and you can

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:22.110
go into your music folder, into iTunes folder,
iTunes media, and then Automatically Add to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.510
iTunes then click Open.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
And that way the movie file will be copied
to that folder and it will automatically add

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.049
it to iTunes.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.209
If you can't find the Automatically Add to
iTunes folder don't worry I'll show you how

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.080
to add the video into iTunes from the Desktop
when we're done.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.159
So now we're ready for the movie to be copied
onto your computer in the iPad format so we'll

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.909
just click Run.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.370
Okay and when the copy is complete you'll
see the folder pop up.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.799
If you chose to put it in the Automatically
Add to iTunes folder you'll see that this

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.109
folder's empty because it automatically added
it to iTunes so just open up iTunes, go to

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.200
the Movies section, and you'll see it in there
automatically.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.680
If you didn't choose to put it in the Automatically
Add to iTunes folder just go to the folder

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.849
where you copied it to, probably your Desktop
or wherever you chose to, then drag and drop

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.519
that file into iTunes.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.769
Make sure you have iTunes open then drop it
in there, and it will automatically go into

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.219
the Movies section.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:15.040
Now to actually put the movie on your iPad
you'll need to sync your iPad to your computer

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.629
via the USB cable.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.349
Now once your device shows up in iTunes you'll
click on it then click the Movies section

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.779
and then select Sync Movies.

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:27.290
If you want to add all the movies that are
in your movie section you can check this "Automatically

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.739
include all movies" and it will sync all the
movies to your device.

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.790
If you just want to select the one, you'll
select it and click Apply.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.510
And your movies will sync onto your iPad,
and that's it.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.969
That's how to put movies on your iPad, by
far the easiest and fastest way in my opinion

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.090
to do that.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.139
And this application can copy any DVD movie
no matter what it is, and it can copy unlimited

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.980
DVD movies so it's definitely a must-have.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.900

As always thank you so much for watching.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.099
Keep having fun out there.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.469

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:12.169
Bye.
