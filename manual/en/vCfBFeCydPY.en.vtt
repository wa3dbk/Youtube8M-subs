00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.560
Coach Rudy, Big Ten Alumni. Let's talk about
the position of safety. One of the most important

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.300
positions on the defense. So, which safety
are you? Are you strong safety? Do you like

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.920
collisions? Do you like hitting people? Can
you catch a football? Those are two things

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.890
that are very important to that position.
Do you understand run support? Do you know

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.330
how to tackle? Are you in shape? That's what
a strong safety is. There's a strong safety,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.999
and a free safety. Which one are you? Strong
safety--let's go through the characteristics.

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.230
You have to be able to really, really have
collisions. You have to love collisions. You

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.049
have to love hitting people. Football is a
game of controlled rage. You have to really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.909
be aggressive as a strong safety. You're going
to make a lot of tackles with guys running

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.219
the ball. You have to play pass defense. Occasionally
you'll have the chance to intercept the ball.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:07.130
Can you catch the ball? Is that what you can
do? Free safety. Free safety's the coach on

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.520
the field. Let's talk about free safety. Free
safety is called the coach on the field. Free

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.900
safety's a guy that understands personnel,
what the other team is doing, the down, the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.990
distance, has a feel for the flow of the game,
is in touch with the tendencies of the other

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.740
team, and understands the position that they
must be in, in the coverage and in the defensive

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.320
scheme. You have to be able to tackle people.
You're the last line of defense between the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.009
ball carrier, whether it's a running back,
the quarterback, or a receiver, and the goal

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.390
line. You have to be able to tackle people.
As far as pass defense goes, you're the deepest

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.700
guy, nobody gets behind you. You've got to
make a play on the ball, you make people pay

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.050
for coming over the middle. Which one are
you? Are you the coach? Are you capable of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.329
understanding schemes and mechanisms? Do you
understand personnel? Downs, distance, situations,

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.420
tendencies, or are you just an animal? Somebody
that wants to tear somebody's head off. Are

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.680
you a strong safety, or are you a free safety?
Which one are you?
