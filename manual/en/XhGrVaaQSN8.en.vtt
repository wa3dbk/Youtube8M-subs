00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.490
Hi, I am Ritik and I am going to talk about 3dprinting and digital creation.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.519
The presentation is about us, you and me.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.669
First I will introduce myself.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.819
Then I will tell you something about me and 3dprinting

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.710
Then I will talk

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.089
about 3dprinting and digital creation

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.480
and finally I will tell you what you can do with digital creation

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.480
Before we start: anyone know what 3dprinting is?

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.400
So you make something on the computer

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.920
and the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.390
printer prints it layer by layer

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.429
then you get

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.130
the model you have created on the computer

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.990
Who am I?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.410
I was born in 2000 and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.890
computers and digital things existed from before I was born, so I'm

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.480
a digital native: someone who is naturally familiar with digital stuff.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.480
at TEDxKids@Brussels I joined ....

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.690
I participated at the first TEDxKids@Brussels and the theme was there

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.790
Makers

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490
and that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.810
Joris Peels came to do a workshop on 3d printers:

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.100
very interesting machines that materialise something on your computer is a real thing

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.799
the most important thing I learned was that you should not be afraid to fail

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.900
and that you had to learn from your mistakes and move on.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.380
After TEDxKids@Brussels I actively started helping with

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.430
TEDxYouth@Flanders

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.460
not just me but also my sister and my father

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.620
now I will tell you about me and 3dprinting

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.450
at TEDxKids@Brussels

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.719
Joris Peels gave a workshop on 3dprinting.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.239
As homework, we had to make something in 3dtin: a very simple website

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.519
to build something block by block.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.189
I had the idea: there is nothing to do with my name on it so why not make

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.089
Glasses with my name

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:30.409
The glasses became so famous that they were exhibited at the local Modern Art Museum in Antwerp.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.230
After I had designed the glasses,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.729
it was pretty simple to make other things

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:39.049
And over time there were also better apps and websites that allowed you

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.579
to design stuff like the old guys did: in CAD.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.749
bitten by the virus, my father quickly bought me a 3dprinter.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.639
it made a lot of noise and printed only ten centimeters by ten centimeters

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.419
by ten centimeters

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.889
but 10 by 10 by 10 was enough space to go lots of fun stuff.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.489
Once 10 by 10 by 10 was no longer enough,

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.579
We bought a larger printer: 25 by 25 by 30 would be big enough

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.329
and two printheads to do more complex things

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.999
3dprinting and digital creation

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:13.860
Before 3dprinting existed,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.150
the world was very different. If you designed something on the computer,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.379
Then it stayed on the computer. If you wanted to bring to the real world

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.069
the machines were very costly.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.339
a 3dprinter was only for a small group of people.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.809
with 3dprinting, you can design something on the computer and print it in any size

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.059
3dprinting compared with music

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.440
There are 3 kinds of people in this world

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.230
ninety percent of the people are consumers who want to only listen

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.489
to a song on iTunes.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.559
Then there are mash-ups

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.509
people who will take two existing songs and mix them

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:02.879
into a new song.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.429
then there are creators:

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:10.749
Who do the effort to make their own music.

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.609
3dprinting compared to erm ...

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.370
digital creation compared with 3dprinting:

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.608
there are people who will go and print something from thingiverse

00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:23.499
when they need it.

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.090
then there are mash-ups

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.470
You take existing models from thingiverse and stick them together.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.509
A good example is myrobotnation

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.550
by 3dsystems that allows you to create your own robot.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.789
Then there are creators who make their own stuff.

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:50.789
but if you look closely

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.180
if you look at the size of these boxes, the creators

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.610
and mash-ups much larger. Why?

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.550
because 3Dprinting is very cheap and easy

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.550
you can make something.

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.999
Take the example of the man on the last slide: he was playing music

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.949
in San Fransisco on his iPad

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.759
no guitar, no drums, no musiclessons

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.360
Just an app of 15 euros and creativity

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.150
digital creation and you:

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.639
3Dprinting is easy and cheap. There are a lot of

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.620
3d models online

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.009
you can share your work with others

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.009
and they can put their ideas on your model

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.610
There are very easy mash-up tools

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.689
and also very easy

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.490
creator tools.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.490
and you don't need a printer. the only thing you need is an idea

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.169
So my conclusion is

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.080
beginning with 3d printing now. Now that your teacher does not tell you how to.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.990
Now that there are no rules.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.349
Break with conventions, there are no impossible ideas.

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.580
You can share your work with others and they can put their ideas on it.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.400
They can make your work even better.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.830
use mash-up not only for 3dprinting but for everything

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.469
for photos, music

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:45.589
Special thanks to Joris Peels and TED for opening doors to a new

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:46.539
world.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:52.479
To iMaterialise for bringing my glasses from digital to reality.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.259
Jason Lopes to show me that 3Dprinting and digital creation is used in the

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.919
movies a lot already.

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.779
Scott Summit to show that 3dprinting can even give people

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:10.580
a better life and that 3Ddesign is going to be very important.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.610
Autodesk Gallery for a very broad view on 3dprinting, which can be used

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.399
from

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:20.889
luxury watches to electric race cars.

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:24.769
And Assa ashuach to show me that you should keep your creations digital

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.770
as long as possible.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.770
Because that's where the cool things happen.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.050
Thank you for your attention and start creating digitally now.
