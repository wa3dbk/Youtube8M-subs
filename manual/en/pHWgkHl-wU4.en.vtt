00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:04.076
- I'm Trevor James and I travel to eat.

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:07.499
For me, any excuse to travel will do.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.190
But food, well, that's
a whole 'nother level.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.947
You can follow me, The Food
Ranger, as I make my way

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:15.754
around the world.

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:16.671
I'm hungry.

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:26.107
So I'm in downtown Kuala
Lumpur, I'm really hungry

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:29.583
and actually tonight we're
gonna make our way a little

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.638
bit outside of Kuala
Lumpur, actually only about

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:34.353
20 minutes by car or taxi,
and we're gonna go to an

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:37.518
area called Setapak for
some hawker stalls with some

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:39.918

variety and we're gonna

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:41.501
make our way there.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.187
Okay, tonight I'm in the
outskirts of Kuala Lumpur

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:46.910
at a local hawker center.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.427

and I am just pumped for
this epic, epic food.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.761
Tonight I'm gonna be
trying some nasi lemak.

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:00.464
Tonight I'm trying this
because it's authentic and a

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:03.440
local specialty, the nasi lemak fish.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.107
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:16.147
Peanuts.

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.916
Oh, and some awesome sauce.

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.317
Maybe one of these chickens too.

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:29.984
Gotta try it, right?

00:01:31.272 --> 00:01:32.772
Oh, that's a meal!

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:35.970
Some sauce, beautiful!

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:39.521
Okay, thank you very much.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.236
Oh, look at that!

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.553
Okay, check it out.

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:49.052
I'm outside Kuala Lumpur
Malaysia, I'm hungry,

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:52.079
I got a beautiful,
beautiful meal on my plate.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.533
Nasi lemak, a ton of variety
here, just look where I am.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.593
And the smells coming from
this plate, I'm excited.

00:01:58.593 --> 00:02:01.629
I've got curry chicken,
deep fried chicken, I've got

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.011
curry sauce on top of rice
with a nice fried egg on top.

00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:10.742
Sambal, I've got satay,
and cucumbers, anchovies,

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.481
it's just beautiful.

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.148
Look at that beauty!

00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:21.125
Mmm!

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:25.122
That's beautiful.

00:02:26.373 --> 00:02:28.456
I have to try this satay.

00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.487
All around the world, every
country has their own variety

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:34.449
of meat on a stick.

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.638
And Malaysia is no doubt one
of my top favorite places

00:02:37.638 --> 00:02:41.011
I've been looking forward to
trying meat on a stick, so

00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.844
let's go.

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.316
That is prime.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:59.726
Best flavors in the world
here, I've gotta say.

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:00.809
Unbelievable.

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:12.570
This is the best here.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.560
That meal was unbelievable.

00:03:18.648 --> 00:03:20.391
I'm a defeated man now.

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:22.315
I've gotta say I'm really full.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:24.391
The spiciness of the
curry was very, very bold.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.057
Just unbelievable.

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:29.211
And the actually, you know
what was really nice, the

00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:32.575
anchovies on top of the rice
with the curry and the egg

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:36.325
all in one bite,
surprisingly very delicious.

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:40.332
I could come here every
night, eat a different thing

00:03:40.332 --> 00:03:43.486
every night, the variety
here is just, there's so much

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:47.219
food to try, I'm blown away really.

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.640
Thank you for watching and
I'm just looking forward

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.277
to tomorrow morning because
I'm back here eating more.

00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:55.435
More for lunch, more
for dinner, every day.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.352
This is food heaven, I've found it.
