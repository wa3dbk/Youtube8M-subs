Hi everyone! Today I will show you how to make a nail art within everyone's reach.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.630
It is very easy to do and is made with glitter flakes and nail polish.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.630
For a great effect!

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.230
Here are the glitter mix that I have chosen. By NFU OH.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.130
Its a mix various flake sizes.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
That’s what make it look great!

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.950
I take the top coat.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.940
I make a strip with the top coat

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.700
in a curve shape that goes narrow at the end, as you can see here

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.130
Before the top coat gets dry, take your fanbrush

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.860
Dip it in the flakes and then sprinkle the two colors randomly.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.030
Once you have added enough of it, remove the extra.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.570
With a stick, I fill the holes

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.720
So that I don't have it all over the top coat surface.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.380
And if it doesn’t stick, add some top coat to add the glitter flakes.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.240
Try to make straight lines to define a shape.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.810
Then with my finger I press on it to flatten the flakes.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810
Or else it will peel off.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.050
Then with my brush, I sweep. And I do the same again in the corner of my nail.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.790
I add some flakes with a toothpick and finally I press on it.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.020
Once the extra glitter is swept off, we can see that the lines are well defined.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.020
Then I apply some top coat.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.650
You should choose a thick top coat for this one.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.580
Have a look at my videos concerning base and top coats

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.890
