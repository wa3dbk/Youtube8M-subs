00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100
i've sprayed the ring mold

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
try go twice around to have a thick border

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.440
press gently with your fingers to seal the crust

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.520
grate the vanilla pod

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.159
mix with brown sugar
