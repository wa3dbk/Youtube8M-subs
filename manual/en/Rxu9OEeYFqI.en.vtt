00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.660
Matthias Sandten - Modern Pentathlon Champion

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.660
It's not so difficult to do a car that
is extreme in a particular direction

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.620
but it's the balance of the whole thing

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.000
as all the bits and pieces come together.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.980
In pentathlon, the skills that are required

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.270
for each sport are completely different.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.100
It's just about diversity of requirements. 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.650
Their cars in this class,
the C-class category,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.670
that might be better in particular attributes. 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.570
Not much, but maybe just subtly.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.780
But the whole is more than the sum of the pieces.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.420
Putting all those things together

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.320
leaves the impression with the driver
that he has really a capable vehicle.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.610
For me it's a sports car,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.250
but its a car for daily usage.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.160
It's a car for everybody.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.900
Given that the Ford Focus is the
best-selling nameplate globally,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.740
you can imagine it was quite
a bit of a challenging task

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.840
to make a new one even better.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.950
When you drive the car you will feel,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.180
that we are no only promising it,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.080
we really have delivered.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.420
Its quite easy to tune a car for
optimal handling performance 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.640
but in this case the vehicle also
needs to be a very comfortable.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.050
I think that we found the right balance
between a sporty car, but also a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.780
a very comfortable family car.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.770
When a driver has a smile on
his face while enjoying this ride

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.730
we know we did a good job.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.190
If someone comes to me and asks
me why I'm not as fast as Usain Bolt

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550
I say yes you're right, but ...

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.510
can he swim, can ride a horse, can he shoot a gun,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.450
can he win in fencing against me?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.160
Then the answer is no.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420
I'm the better one.
