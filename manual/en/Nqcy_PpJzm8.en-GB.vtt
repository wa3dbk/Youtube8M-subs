00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.130
I'd like a sports coupe that has a really
cool exhaust sound, looks good, does 0-60

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.179
in 6 seconds and only costs Â£140 a year to
tax please! Not possible? Think again, this

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:22.279
is the RCZ R and is the fastest car Peugeot
has ever built -- capable of 155mph thanks

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.519
to its 270bhp 1.6-litre turbocharged engine.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.100
and if those figures weren't enough to impress
check out this figure, these beautiful curves

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.460
are available in black, red, grey or white.
The styling contours, black roof pillars,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.280
19 inch alloys and lowered ride height all
scream out that this just might be a little

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.730
bit sporty.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.850
yes that's right, it's not in the negative
section - this boot is huge, look quick, [shove

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:03.069
loads of suitcases in] practical box ticked,
let's see inside!

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:08.340
these sports seats, leather steering wheel
and door trim, red stitching on the dash and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.140
metal gear knob replace the standard features
of the normal RCZ. You also get xenon headlights

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:24.990
plus a multimedia and sat-nav system. But
that's enough of that, now let's drive!

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.469
You can feel that Peugeot is really making
a sporty come back when it comes to performance

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.770
cars, the 205 GTI is one of the best hot hatches
ever made and the iconic group B rally car

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:56.920
had a road going version called the T16. But
that was a very long time ago - way back in

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.500
the 1980s in fact...

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.909
The engine fitted to this car is the most
powerful 1.6 litre in any road car. It feels

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.160
like it too, the acceleration is manic and
is more than powerful enough to rustle the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.800
feathers of the German coupes like the Audi
TT and VW Scirocco.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.670
It's also better on fuel, this R version can
return over 40 miles to the gallon and with

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.290
CO2 emissions of 145 g/km - it's cheaper to
tax as well. What's more, with the sports

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.710
exhaust it sounds just as good too.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:44.280
But are the suspension, steering feel and
chassis up to the job? Well as you would expect

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.460
ride comfort is compromised for handling,
but we can accept that, until you come to

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.440
a really bumpy road and it moves about quite
a lot. On any road surface although the steering

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.820
turns in well it's not as sharp as a Nissan
370Z Nismo plus you don't get the lovely push

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.470
through the bends that the rear wheel drive
Nissan offers. For front wheel drive though

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.610
it is very impressive.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.090
Not only is this the R but it has also undergone
a facelift with a redesigned grille [cut to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.730
grille in driving mode] but there's been no
change to these obtrusive A pillars, and the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.680
ideal body dimensions as Mat quite rightly
pointed out in his review of the pre face

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:42.310
lift non R are Orangutan long arms short legs
so you can reach the radio. I mean I sit close

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:51.510
to the steering wheel and even I'm struggling.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:00.860
my final complaint is the space in the back,
it's very definitely small. Even a squish

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:09.130
for me, probably children would complain here.
A BMW 4 Series is better in this department.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.190
These are minor moans, all in all this offering
from Peugeot has really opened some eyes in

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.449
the sports coupe market. Not only is it the
most powerful 1.6 litre road engine in the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.300
world, but also incredibly good looking, fun
to drive and relatively cheap to run. Before

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.160
you sign on the dotted line, take a look at
one of our favourite front wheel drive sports
