00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.440
The presentation will begin.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.500
The commencement of the beginning is about to start.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.600
Andries!

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.900
That streak across the grass,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.500
that's where dead bodies are found.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.020
Once somebody tripped over one.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.200
Thought it was a log.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.300
Three days and three nights and he was
in his wooden coffin.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Shhh.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.400
Honey, is that you?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.700
Food is ready.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.940
I can't stay.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.300
Have to go to the captain.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.300
What is the matter with you, Harry?

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.000
Maria, there was something out there again.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Isn't it written: "and behold, the smoke of the land

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.600
rose to the heavens like the smoke of a furnace"?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.100
Harry.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
It followed me 'til I reached town!

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800
What's going to happen?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.300
Harry?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.000
I've got to go.
