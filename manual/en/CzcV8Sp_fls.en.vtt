00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:20.520
What the hell is a Rygar?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.320
I’ve read up on the subject, and I’m still
kinda confused.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.119
There’s an Arcade version of Rygar, which
plays like a standard run-to-the-right platformer.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.439
There’s the NES version, which adds some
overhead running-about and takes a significantly

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.429
more nonlinear approach to the gameplay, a
la Metroid or later Castles-vania.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:43.440
So despite this being in an arcade cabinet,
it’s the NES version, full of... lots and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
lots of creepy guys sitting on platforms behind
doors in mountainsides or trees or whatnot.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.449
None of these men are Rygar.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.410
You, the yo-yo with the yo-yo down there,
are not Rygar.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.460
Heck, Rygar isn’t Rygar, depending on which
parts of the documentation you’re reading.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.809
And by documentation, I mean “stuff on the
internet, because the game itself doesn’t

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.109
bother to explain a damned thing.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.450
Not a damned thing.”

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.400
As games of this era were wont to do.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.630
This interpretation of Rygar has you, the
Hero, traipsing all over hell and creation

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.500
to... um, fix things.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.649
You can pretty much assume that there’s
going to be a big climactic fight after all

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.790
this is over, so let’s go with that.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.609
You can jump, and throw your shield thingie,
and crouch.

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.820
And for the first chunk of the game, that’s
it.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.469
You’re opposed by endless swarms of evil
things that set upon you from every angle,

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.469
and who can be either bludgeoned with your
disky-yo-yo-thing or stunned briefly by bouncing

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:45.469
on it.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.859
Slay enough beasts and you’ll be rewarded
with an expanded health gauge, as well as

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.119
improved toughness as evidenced by more powerful
attacks.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.920
Wait, so this is an RPG?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.280
With, like, experience points?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
HOLY HELL THERE’S A STATUS SCREEN.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
I thought I was going to have to fight to
get Final Fantasy hacked onto this thing,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.530
but if there’s already an RPG, then... oh,
who am I fooling.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.200
This is a dicey platformer masquerading as
something bigger than itself.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.790
And doing so on a PlayChoice timer.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.350
But in its defense, the music’s memorable,
and some of the mechanics are pretty cool.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.140
Unfortunately, in order to obtain the cool
mechanics like the grappling hook and whatnot,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.870
you’re going to be hunting and searching
and blindly wandering through continue after

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.900
continue.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.430
That said, this being a PlayChoice version,
you’re not actually paying for continues,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.799
you’re paying for time.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.620
And if you keep getting cheese-killed by flying
fish beast monster things in that one particular

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.549
chunk of the woods, you might actually run
on the profitable side of the quarter curve,

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.549
all told.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.900
But keep in mind that this thing’s a marathon,
not a sprint... and that the only thing worse

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.191
than RPG-style level grinding is paying a
machine three bucks an hour (or more!) for

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.530
the opportunity to do so.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.800
Rest assured, this one’s getting swapped
out for Yo!

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.710
Noid as soon as... well, as soon as I can
actually track down a PC10 copy of Yo!

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.209
Noid.
