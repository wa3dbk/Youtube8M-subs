Hi! I'm Anne Mooney. I'm a personal chef and
the food columnist for Simply the Best magazine

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.690
in Delray Beach, Florida. Today I am here
on behalf of Expert Village to talk more about

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.150
eggs. This time we are going to talk about
the Spanish tortilla. Now this is neither

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:27.369
a Spanish omelet nor is it a tortilla as we
are familiar with a little flour cake. This

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:35.780
is a dish that is very common in Spain and
usually people eat it for lunch or for a light

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:44.260
supper. It is a thick omelet that is stuffed
with potatoes and onions and it is absolutely

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.829
delicious and very satisfying. It is just
the essence of comfort food. Unlike the other

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:03.329
omelets, this omelet or tortilla is typically
cooked in olive oil so we have our individual

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:12.610
sized skillet here with olive oil heating
up and we have two eggs, the individual portion

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:22.170
to which I will add some cream. The Spaniards
probably would add goats milk or water to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.240
these eggs but any kind of liquid would probably
do. You can use skim milk if you like to,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.730
you can use club soda if you want to or plain
water or you can go whole hog and use cream

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:47.479
like I am. So there are eggs and here is one
Yukon Gold potato that has been cut up into

00:01:47.479 --> 00:02:00.229
about one inch thick slices so we are going
to put this potato into the oil first and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.560
you can hear it sizzle so there might be a
little crust develop on that potato and then

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.430
we are going to add some onions. I've used
green onions, you can use white onions, any

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:25.560
kind of onions you have on hand. Once this
is brought up to temperature, we will pour

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:42.451
the eggs and just pour them over the potatoes
like so and kind of move them around so that

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:50.440
the eggs are distributed evenly over the potatoes
and let it cook. Sometimes it is a good idea

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.370
to put a lid on it. A lid will make it cook
a little bit faster. There is a lid right

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:08.640
here that doesn't fit particularly well but
that is okay. At the end of this process,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.321
we are going to have a nutritious lunch. Now
if you wanted to guild the lilly, you can

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:21.840
put some cheese on top of it, you can add
some green peppers or maybe a little ham if

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.090
you have it around. The classic tortilla is
simply eggs and potatoes and onions but there

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.970
is nothing that says you can't add stuff to
it.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:48.769
At the end of two or three minutes, there
you have a very satisfying or tasty lunch

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.129
or supper. If you like these tips, check out
