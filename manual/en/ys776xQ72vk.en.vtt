Hi, I'm Richard Goms. We're here in Murray,
Utah, talking about basic car care. Today,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.540
we're going to talk about how to interpret
instrument lights. You're driving down the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.519
road, and all of a sudden, one of your instrument
lights come on,and what you need to know,

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:27.150
is that, that means that there is a problem,
with something in your car, that needs attention,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.930
immediate attention, and some of these lights
mean more than one thing, so I'm going to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.480
show you basically, what they mean. There's
a low fuel light, and that light comes on,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.600
when you're really low on fuel. Now, if you
look at the fuel gauge, and it's on E for

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.210
empty, and the fuel light comes on, that means
you really need to pull over, and get some

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.430
gas somewhere. The next light that you really
need to be concerned about, is the check engine

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.720
light. Now, when that comes on, it could be
something very simple, or it could be something

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.870
very complicated. It could be as simple as
a gas cap not being on tight, or it could

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.400
be something major with the engine or transmission,
the drive train in some way. You need to go

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.370
to a mechanic. Even some of the auto parts
stores, have equipment to check that check

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.880
engine light, or to the dealer, and have them
check the computer codes. These cars are equipped

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.740
with computers, as most new cars are, and
it will tell the mechanic or yourself, what

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.580
the problem is. The temperature gauge is one
that you really need to be concerned about.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.810
If it comes on,and it looks like a thermometer,
with lines on it, as a thermometer would have

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:11.519
lines on it. It will show that your engine
is overheating, and you're either low on antifreeze,

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:25.120
or there is, maybe the fan has quit working,
or something inside the engine is blocked.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
It could be something fairly simple, like
you just need to add more antifreeze to the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:41.549
car, but in any event, you need to pull over,
let the car cool down possibly, and check

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:50.159
to see if you need to add some water, or some
antifreeze to it, and don't drive it very

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:57.920
far, with that temperature light on. The next
light would be that you really need to be

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.580
concerned about, is the oil light, and it
looks sort of like an oil lamp, an old oil

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:15.279
lamp, and if you ignore this light, you could
really damage the engine. The car engines

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:22.629
of today are not intended to run with any
less than three quarts, and when you fill

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.860
them, they usually contain about five quarts
of oil.
