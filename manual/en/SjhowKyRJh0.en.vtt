00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:11.466
First of all, I think getting the
diagnosis of a tumor is

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.666
you know, it's earth-shattering.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.666
It turns your world upside down
and then you hear the word

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:18.496
"brain tumor". But what I think
patients need to understand is

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:21.066
that there's really a wide variety of tumors

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.706
and today with all the tools we have,

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:26.716
advances in surgical resection and

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:28.646
advances in non-invasive ways
of treating these tumors

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:32.216
like the CyberKnife, it doesn't always
mean a dismal outcome.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:35.496
In fact, for the vast majority of these tumors,

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:37.756
we actually have a very high
degree of success.

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:43.376
The broad category

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.326
of the treatment is called
stereotactic radiosurgery

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.516
and what that really means is

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:50.926
that we are pinpointing radiation in the body

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:53.236
with submillimeter accuracy at a target

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:54.986
and the target is usually a tumor.

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:56.776
It could be a malignant tumor,
a benign tumor.

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:58.556
Actually sometimes it's not even
a tumor at all.

00:00:58.556 --> 00:01:01.306
We treat things that are
non-malignant altogether,

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:04.236
but the key thing here is that we need

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:06.916
to get the radiation only to our target tissue

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:08.426
and avoid all the normal tissue,

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:10.336
so that's what stereotactic radiosurgery is.

00:01:10.686 --> 00:01:11.846
It has been around for a long time.

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:13.906
It was actually invented in the 60's

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:17.216
on a machine called the Gamma Knife
by a Swedish neurosurgeon

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:18.766
and that machine is still around

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.816
but advances have occurred
obviously since the 60's

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:25.196
and we now have robots that
deliver this therapy

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:27.036
in a completely non-invasive way

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:30.056
and that machine is what
we have here at El Camino.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.426
It's called the CyberKnife.

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:38.076
You know, the CyberKnife,
it's really a miraculous advance.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.946
Patients can walk in, in their street clothes.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.346
It doesn't require any anesthesia.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.356
It's completely non-invasive.

00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:47.076
They are literally laying on a table

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:48.286
and they don't feel a thing.

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:51.886
The radiation is delivered via this robot

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.606
that has a linear accelerator mounted to it

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:57.246
and there are a lot of other pieces
within the room

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.966
that actually monitor the patient
and monitor

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.856
where the tumor is at all times.

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:05.016
So this robot is continuously
watching the tumor

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:07.676
and treating the tumor from
hundreds of different angles.

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:10.616
So as a patient, you walk in.
You lay down.

00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:13.546
You won't feel a thing and
you can literally walk out of here.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:19.706
There are some brain tumors
that are still quite malignant,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.616
but again, we've made advances on those

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.446
and outcomes are getting better and better.

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.976
However many brain tumors
have a very, very high degree

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.566
of success with the CyberKnife

00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:32.206
where we have control rates
better than 90 percent,

00:02:32.206 --> 00:02:35.416
in some instances 95 percent or better,
controlling these tumors

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:36.136
for good.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.056
Once you hear the word "brain tumor",
the first thing

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:46.046
thing to do is not to panic
and the next thing to do is to get

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:47.866
to a center like El Camino Hospital

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:50.096
where we really have all the tools available

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:51.216
and the physician expertise.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:52.846
You really need to couple those together.

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:57.916
Here at El Camino, we meet in a
multi-disciplinary approach.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:01.756
That means neurosurgeons,
ENT surgeons, radiation oncologists,

00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:04.576
radiologists and medical oncologists
all get together

00:03:04.576 --> 00:03:07.426
and review the case and
we put our heads together

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:09.136
and decide what is the best way.

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:10.446
Is it going to be surgery?

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:11.566
Is it going to be the CyberKnife?

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.756
Is it going to be a combination?

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.976
And that's really how you optimize
outcomes for patients.
