00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.730
So this is our most basic singing exercise.
I am going to do it with a guitar although

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.710
I think a guitar or piano will suffice. The
reason for doing your vocal exercises with

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.000
another instrument is just to kind of give
yourself a reference and stay in tune and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.289
practice singing in tune. Another reason you
practice singing is not necessarily for being

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.660
in tune, but to have a good tone. So you are
thinking about pitch and you are thinking

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.319
about tone when you are doing these vocal
exercises. We are going to start out using

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.749
the vowel sound "oo", and we are going to
start at the G and basically the idea is we

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.370
are going to try and take it as high as we
can get it. When you get to the top of your

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.379
range that is when you really start exercising
your voice and if you can increase your range

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.920
that is when you are actually increasing the
strength of your voice. And ultimately it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.309
makes you into a better singer. So I am going
to cruise up the scale now playing Do Mi So

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:21.680
Mi Do three times and then moving up a half
step. Do Mi So Mi So, Okay? "Ooooo...." And

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.869
you want to be sure that your voice is or
your breathe rather is coming from your diaphragm

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.350
so when you breath in your belly is moving
out and power is coming from here out. "Oooo..."

00:01:33.350 --> 00:02:50.960
Okay, now I am kind of at the top of my range
so I am going to be slowing the exercise down

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.510
now. My voice is warmed up and now I am trying
to strengthen.
