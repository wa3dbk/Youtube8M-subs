My name is Mike Jones, and I'm a barista at
Third Rail Coffee right by Washington Square

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.750
Park in New York City.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.750
I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making
skills.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm going to show you how to make a Cafe Latte.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.960
Now at its most basic interpretation, a latte
is just espresso with milk.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.610
Traditionally it will be 8 ounces to 12 ounces,
some shops will go bigger than that, usually

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.829
not too much smaller than 8 ounces though.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.719
You started off with around 2 ounces of espresso
and the rest is milk that is steamed with

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.270
just a tiny bit of air put into it.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.379
You don't want it to be too foamy and also
not too thin.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:01:12.780
So I'm going to go ahead, pull the shot, steam
the milk and then pour.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:02:03.180
Alright, so we have our shot and the milk.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.149
You can see on the milk it, it has that nice
sheen, good micro foam, and then when you

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.140
swirl it you can see it sticks to the side
a little bit, but not too much.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:24.909
A cappuccino would be frothier.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:39.620
Alright, and 
that is a Cafe Latte.
