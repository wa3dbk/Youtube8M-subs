00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.569
What if you could shoot smooth video with no effort?

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.830
What would you shoot?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.040
How would you shoot it?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.869
Is such a thing even possible?

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.599
Hello. I'm Michael

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.289
And I'm Christine. We made STABiLGO .

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.590
We both have 15 years of experience in the world in cinematography and

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.099
professional photography

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.539
over that time we've worked with some
pretty amazing people on great projects

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.269
like music videos,  feature films, and stop-motion
animation

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.509
The STABiLGO merges our love of cinematography with our passion for

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.730
action sports like snowboarding and skateboarding.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.089
As cinematographers when we built
the STABiLGO

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.579
we set out to build something that would
be rock-solid that we would be proud of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.940
and hopefully you would enjoy too.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.100
9 months ago, we started developing the Stabilgo and doing

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.560
research and development

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.620
at this point our goal is to introduce
it to the community and see how far we

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.010
can take it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.180
whether beta testers get to enjoy it or it goes to full production for a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820
broader audience is completely up to you

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.910
we hope our video demos speak for
themselves, and make you excited to support it.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.070
The STABiLGO gives you a great starting
point for capturing smooth video with

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.110
less effort

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.720
At a total weight of one and a half pounds
with a GoPRO3 attached the STABiLGO

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.890
design minimizes weight

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.920
Let's face it holding a heavy rig in
your hands is tiresome even if you're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.300
standing still.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.650
You'll be able to independently capture
movement without a crew or

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.650
cumbersome equipment

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.260
It allows you to go more places and have
more usable footage.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.750
Lightning fast response time is achieved
with a high-speed processor and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.620
state of the art gyroscopic sensors,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.990
working in tandem to keep the camera
perfectly horizontal and vertical.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.030
The unit utilizes 2 brushless motors
controlled by a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.510
32-bit flash microcontroller.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.479
The gyro unit feeds the data to the mini CPU to keep it level.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.960
The gimbal is cut from carbon fiber
plates

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.950
and the handle is ABS plastic.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.869
High flex silicon wires allow for free
movement.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.690
Like any gimbal

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.470
you attach your camera and set the center
of gravity.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.880
The STABiLGO allows for 180 degrees of pitch movement (forward/back tilt) and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.010
270 degrees of roll movement (side tilt).

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.260
Put the STABiLGO on a monopod or a tripod
for an instant auto leveling

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.330
portable crane.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.710
The STABiLGO works seamlessly with your existing gear and comes complete.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.879
Every unit comes with a battery and
charger.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.439
Our goal is to take this to production
so we can further developing the unit

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.540
and have a more easy to change battery.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.779
All the mounts utilize standard 1/4-20 thread.

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.930
Check us out on Kickstarter and join the action.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.450
Whether you want to be a beta tester, get one of the first production models

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.490
or just give us a small donation, Kickstarter is the place to make it happen. 
Thank You!
