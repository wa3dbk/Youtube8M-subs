Hydro Fuel Bloom A&amp;B is used in conjunction
for the bloom stage of the plants life.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:43.559
It is important to add 
the two formulas 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:56.820
separately and mix the first before adding
the second.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.750
In week one put in 12ml of Hydro Fuel Bloom
A per gallon of water.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.289
Mix well then add 12ml of Hydro Fuel Bloom
B per gallon of water.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:18.201
In week two and three increase to 14ml and
week four any ongoing weeks increase again

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:24.319
to 16ml per gallon of water always mixing
separately.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.690
It's important in the last week of flower
to flush with only water.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.289
At Green Planet all our nutrients are pure
therefore we do not require manufacture or

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.729
recommend a flushing agent.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:02:13.569
Why spend your money on a product that dechlorinated
water 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:24.280
is the best at.
