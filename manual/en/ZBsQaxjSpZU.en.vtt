00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:21.000
If you've tried many types of Hemorrhoid  
solutions then you probably understand the 
differences of how each is used.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.033
In this article, I'll go over what each of them do 
for the body, how they intend to treat 
Hemorrhoids or piles, and the controversial, raw 

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:31.000
truth on most of them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.033
The first popular type is creams and ointments 
where a topical treatment is rubbed on your 
outer rectal area and aims to soothe blood 

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.000
vessels. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This creates a relaxation of the tissue so that it 
does not bulge out so much. Once the tissue 
does not bulge, the hem roid will be less likely 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.033
to flare  up.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:58.066
This is great for some relief in the temporal 
matter but unfortunately you are practically 
guaranteed to flare  up again.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.066
The 2nd type that is very popular as well in the 
form of suppositories which is inserted inside 
the rectum for the purposes of delivering 

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:07.000
moisture to the hem roid and creating a 
lubricating effect once the next rectal pressure 
comes. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.066
The aim is to ensure the Hemorrhoid heals 
without ruptturing again. For sum it works well, 
for others not so but it's worth seeing.

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.033
The 3rd type is pills one can consume that 
regulate some blood pressure in the system. 
This can have its side effects but overall it's 

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.066
used to tighten vein tissue so that the 
Hemorrhoid is less susceptible to problems.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.033
 It's a very top down approach that has its 
benefits but can also induce real side effects 
and big pharmacies like to push this.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:52.000
These three types are the most common and 
once these ar exhausted, you still have options 
such as cryo,therapy or surgery. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.066
It all depends on the individual case and what 
you can tolerate. In my personal experience, it's 
best to first try the safer options before going to 

00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:00.033
the extreme measures.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:09.066
Even if the pain is unbearable, you can still get 
relief from these methods. It’s just not pleasant 
long-term. 

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:15.066
Now, not all hope is lost. I do have one solution 
that has surprised even me. I’d like you to review 
a totally safe, natural remedy, that works within 

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.000
a few days. It’s called the H Miracle system.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.066
It’s already been proven by hundreds, if not 
thousands of success stories in the 
underground realm of alternative medicin. 

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.000
The system includes ingredient resources, 
charts, audio lessons and basically everything 
you need to cure your Hemorrhoids once and for 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.066
all.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:52.066
I really recommend it and just see the 
testamonials from users who have triumpphed 
even over severe Hemorrhoids for good
