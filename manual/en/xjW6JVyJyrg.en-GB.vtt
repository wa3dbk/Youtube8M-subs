00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.759
In this video, I am going to show you how
to fit a Deco frame.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.259
Having assembled the frame in video 1, insert
the frame screws into the holes so you can

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.340
mark where to drill.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.370
Lift the shutter onto the window sill and
centralise it.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:31.450
Support the shutter to ensure it doesn't fall
forward and check the frame overlaps the wall

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.230
equally all round. On larger windows you can
mark the position of the frame to make it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.370
easier to line up.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.460
Check the shutters are level at the bottom
and each side, your then ready to mark the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.850
position of the holes.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.329
Make sure you support the shutter frame at
all times so it doesn't fall forward, centralise

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.800
the screw in the hole and give it a tap to
mark the wall.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.659
Do this all the way around then carefully
remove the frame.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.610
This is a new build house so I am not using
the hammer action on my drill, just a sharp

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.470
multipurpose masonry bit, depending on what
your fixing into you do need to take care

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.570
when drilling close to the edge of the recess.
As a tip you can also drill at a slight angle

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.890
away from the recess.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.800
Insert your raw plugs and lift the frame back
onto the window sill, locate the screws and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.040
make sure they line up with the plugs.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.160
Screw the screws in a little way each side
and the check the frame is aligned, the shutters

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.980
should be level at the top and bottom and
the panel feet should just rub on the bottom

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.060
frame. Make any adjustments sideways or adjust
the hinges up and down, drilling larger 6mm

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.550
holes when assembling the frame makes moving
the frame easier.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.000
When your happy, finish fixing the screws
around the frame, be careful not to over tighten

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.520
the screws as some walls can be slightly angled
and can result in pulling the mitres apart

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.170
or stopping the shutters closing properly.
Loosening the screws slightly or using small

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.660
packers can help with this.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.500
With these shutters I want to close up the
gap a bit at the bottom so I am going to fit

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.590
a single hinge packer behind each of the bottom
hinges on the shutter panels.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.560
Remove the panel and loosen the 3 hinge screws,
take care to use the correct PH2 bit and slowly

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.590
loosen the screws so you don't slip and chip
the paint.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.890
Slide the clear hinge packer between the shutter
and hinge and make sure it fits up against

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.700
the screws so it's not showing.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.740
Re-fit the shutter and do the same for the
right hand one, now I've got a nice parallel

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.220
gap between both panels.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.069
Screw the final locking hinge screws into
place.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.150
As this Deco frame has sill plate that sits
down flat onto the window sill I need to fix

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.349
in place, I am drilling 4mm hole, finishing
it with a counter sink so my screw sits flush

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.040
and covering the hole with a white cap.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.910
The final job is re-fit the insert strips,
remove the double sided tape and push the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:04:00.810
inserts into the frame taking care to line
up the mitres in 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.810
the corner.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.920
And here's the finished result.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:16.850
