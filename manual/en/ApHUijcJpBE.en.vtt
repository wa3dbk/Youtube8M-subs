Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.370
Today we are going to show you how to change
the door light switch on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.110
It’s a pretty easy job, all we are going
to need is either a putty knife or a small

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.850
flat blade screw driver and a pair of needle
nose pliers.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.669
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.800
Now the first step in this repair, since we
will be working around some live electrical

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.310
circuits, will be to disconnect the power.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.660
So simply pull the plug from the receptacle,
now there are two switches for this refrigerator,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.790
one for the freezer side and one for the refrigerator
side.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.400
And they are both identical.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.879
It’s just a rocker type switch and on the
side closest to the rocker there will be a

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.510
locking tab that has a little bit of spring
to it.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.710
On the other side there is just ribbed portion
there that will catch on the cabinet.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.999
So we are going to loosen them from the flexible
tab side.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.949
Now using either a putty knife or a small
blade, we are pulling from the side it’s

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.190
closest to the rocker.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.909
Just pop that out a little bit, when we go
to the opposite side just pry it out to clear

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:05.909
those ribs.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.250
Then we will be pressing that flexible side,
we will rotate the switch to the left and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.470
you can rotate the switch right out of the
opening and there will be two wire terminals

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.880
that will attach to that switch.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.360
You may need a pair of needle nose pliers
just to remove those.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:38.340
We will take our new switch, reconnect the
wire harnesses, and we will rotate it back

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.399
into the opening, ensure sure that we have
the rocker in the proper position with the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.020
flexible tab towards the right.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:58.240
We will check the operation of the switch;
we will reconnect the power to the refrigerator.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.799
And we see that the light switch now works.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.310
And our repair is complete.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.119
We told you it was an easy job.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.229
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
