00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:34.293
The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:42.965
The world and all it’s capers and how it all will end

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:51.614
Nothing seems to be lasting, but that isn’t our affair

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:54.956
We’ve got something permanent,

00:00:54.956 --> 00:01:13.383
I mean in the way we care

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:23.082
It’s very clear our love is here to stay

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:32.537
Not for a year, but ever and a day

00:01:32.537 --> 00:01:36.275
The radio and the telephone

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:40.930
And the movies that we know

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:49.610
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

00:01:49.611 --> 00:02:00.400
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:10.420
Together we‘re going a long, long way

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.000
In time the rockies may crumble,
Gibraltar may tumble,

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.750
they’re only made of clay

00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:35.720
But our love is here to stay

00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:53.990
Our love is here to stay

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:29.740
Our love is here to stay
