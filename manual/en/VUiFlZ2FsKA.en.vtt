What's going on Nation? Today

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
I'm gonna Demonstrate for you guys how to do a sissy squat what I like to call

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.269
The Matrix squat because I know all of you have tried to do this move after watching the movie

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.120
Now it might not look like much of an exercise,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.049
but if you practice it regularly and include it in your bodybuilding workouts

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.590
You're going to see some serious growth and separation in your quads

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.089
if this is your first time trying this

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.549
Exercise you might want to do it standing next to a rail or a post that you can hold onto for balance

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.780
Begin the exercise standing with your feet about shoulder width apart

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.119
and with the heels of your feet on the edge of the blocks

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.260
The block you're standing on should be about two to four inches high

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.459
and sturdy enough to support your weight and not slip out from

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460
under you while doing a rep

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.339
lean back until your body forms a straight line from your neck to your knees your knees will be bent slightly in the starting position

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.919
You should feel a deep burning in your quads after a few reps

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.610
But no pain in your knees do as many reps as you can with good form

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.820
It's okay, if you can't break 90 degrees initially because you will gain balance

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.399
ability and strength the more you practice the exercise

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.990
