00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.529
Kansas has the best roads in the country according
to the latest issue of Reader’s Digest.

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.360
The magazine ranks all 50 states based congestion,
road and bridge condition, safety and spending---

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.199
with Kansas taking home the top spot.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.619
Governor Mark Parkinson was joined by former
governors Bill Graves and Mike Hayden to celebrate

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.419
this accomplishment today at the Topeka KDOT
office.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:29.720
Today, we’ve been recognized in a national
survey put out by Reader’s Digest as having

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.910
the very best road system in the country

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.431
The investment that Kansans have made, in
their infrastructure, over many, many, many

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:46.010
years. My thanks to KDOT to the literally
thousands of employees of KDOT over all those

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.039
years to deliver for Kansans on that investment.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.890
Thank goodness there were people with the
vision, the courage to increase taxes, because

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.989
that’s what it took. These roads aren’t
free and they aren’t cheap. But if you’re

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.940
gonna invest in the future of your country
and your state, you have to make that kind

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.480
of commitment.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.680
Kansans can see the investment and accomplishments
made in their county by visiting www.kansastlink.com

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.200
Readers Digest cited the drive along I-70
through Kansas as one of the nation’s best

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.440
drive. Truckers love this route because it’s
smooth, flat and has few curves the magazine

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.170
said. It also offers drivers views of the
flint hills and a chance to catch one of Kansas’

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.360
famous sunsets. However, a good transportation
system can do more than just provide an easy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
drive.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.000
A terrific economic development. Anywhere
you look that interchanges have been built

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.570
as a result of these programs, you will see
vital businesses that have developed around

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.360
them. Our manufacturing sector in the central
part of the state has flourished because of

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.530
the highway system we’ve created and we
simply cannot stop.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.770
While it’s nice to be number 1, officials
warn that this success might be short-lived.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.429
Today’s announcement is bittersweet for
me. While I’m enormously proud of our transportation

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.989
system today, I have serious concerns about
the future. KDOT has lost $257 million in

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.850
the last year due to budget cuts and we are
currently spending less on construction than

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.760
we did in 1970s. If this trend continues,
we can expect our roads to decline substantially.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.629
We need a revenue increase to continue to
have a transportation system that generates

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.299
economic growth, provides mobility and keeps
Kansans safe.

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:43.069
For that reason, I proposed in the State of
the State speech a two tenth’s sales tax

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.749
to formulate the basic structure of a new
highway plan, of a new comprehensive transportation

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.379
plan. And it’s critically important that
we do that. Ten years from now I would love

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.800
to be in the position that Governor Graves
is in of being able to come and have a press

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.220
conference like this and look at the great
things we’ve accomplished. Twenty years

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.780
from now it would be wonderful to be in the
position of Governor Hayden is. I don’t

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.269
want to be in the position where, because
we failed to act in 2010 we let all this great

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.890
work begin to deteriorate.
