Hi, I’m Jacob Garcia with JGG Fitness Denver.
On behalf of ExpertVillage.com, I want to

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.640
show you how to do a proper exercise ball
crunch. For this exercise all you need is

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.820
an exercise ball. What you’re going to do
is you’re going to sit on the ball like

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.140
so, with your feet flat against the ground
like I’m sitting. Now to get into proper

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.510
position you’re going to walk your legs
out as you bend your body back just until

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
your fanny is just hanging off the ball and
keep your feet flat on the floor and your

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.760
knees should be bent at a 90 degree angle.
You’re going to get your hands, and don’t

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.120
clasp them behind your head, but bring them
just behind the ears and press lightly against

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.320
your head with your fingertips. Now you’re
going to tilt your pelvis up to get your back

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.799
in proper position, go ahead and drop your
shoulders and your head back. You should almost

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.500
feel a stretch in your stomach, but not quite,
and then you’re going to go ahead and contract

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.020
and go up to this position. Think of your
belly button driving right towards your spine

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.420
in a curling motion as if you’re rolling
a carpet or a rug, like if your head is going

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:35.500
to just dig right into your stomach and just
roll up. Back down. It’s very important

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.000
when you’re going in a reverse position,
from this position to back down, that you

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.201
go really slow. Once you’ve completed about
fifteen of these, go ahead and take your hands

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:55.880
off your head and place them on the ball and
slowly walk your legs up until you’re back

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.460
in a seated position and you’re finished.
