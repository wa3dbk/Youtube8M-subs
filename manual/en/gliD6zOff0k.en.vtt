Hey guys, what's up, Tyler here and today
I'm bringing you guys my review of the Artist

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.519
Paintbrush Tip for the TruGlide Pro stylus
by Lynktec.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.159
And this is an extra stylus tip that you can
swap out on the Truglide pro to give you more

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.580
of a natural brush feeling whenever you use
your favorite art or design apps.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.420
I have already reviewed the TruGlide Pro Stylus
in general, and you can check out that video

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.480
here on the channel.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.640
I will put a link in the description below.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.910
Recently Lynktec just announced the new Artist
Paintbrush Tip and it can replace the normal

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.980
tip on the TruGlide Pro simply by unscrewing
the regular stylus tip, and screwing in the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.980
paintbrush tip.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.380
Each of the bristles on the brush are a single
microfiber piece and they all work together

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.920
seamlessly to give you a true "painting with
a brush" feeling on your tablet.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.470
I used the app Paper by 53 to try out this
stylus, and you can see the results here.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.740
I preferred using the water painting settings
on this app, as I feel it just felt natural

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.950
with the brush tip.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.370
The stylus flowed very well on the screen
and it felt just like painting on a normal

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.370
canvas.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.970
Now I'm not supreme artist or anything, but
from what I can tell, it was comfortable and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.060
felt just like using a normal paintbrush.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.200
I think it works very well and I had no issues
using it and I feel like if someone was pretty

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.540
serious about their digital art, this stylus
tip would work very well for them.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.790
By itself, the stylus tip costs $15 and comes
with a case.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.340
I think this might be a bit too much for just
the tip, but the included case helps.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.020
If you buy the combo deal on Lynktecs site
you can get the regular TruGlide, The brush

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.860
tip, and the case all for $40 which brings
the cost of the brush tip down to $10.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.700
So you are getting a little bit better of
a deal if you buy the combo package.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.340
So if you like designing on a tablet or just
want a stylus that gives you a paintbrush

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.030
feel, I would definitely recommend this stylus
and tip combination.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.729
It is a bit more expensive than other stylus'
but they are definitely more sturdy than other

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.229
stylus that I have used in the past and I
have been very happy with it's performance

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.340
thus far.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.831
