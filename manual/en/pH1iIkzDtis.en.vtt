What's up Minecraftinites!
This week I talk with Carl, and 
 have brilliant news about the MOD API

00:00:05.506 --> 00:00:08.916
Also somebody's getting married!
And great giveaways as always!

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.144
Welcome to your post Christmas Minecraft Monday Show!

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.149
**Epic intro music of jam jam**

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.156
How do you guys like it! The new gaming set we're working on.
This is 
 just one section of it I swear. It's a labyrinth of stuff

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.857
With your Mojang news this week I talk with Carl

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.865
Now despite  all the Cobalt death matches that have been going on 
 in the office. Carl has been doing a TON of interviews. 

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:37.304
And they're even still looking for for developers. 
But... They 
 have a new Web &amp;amp; Operations developer. 

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:39.940
I'm not even going to try to pronounce his 
 name in Swedish. 
But here you go

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.944
Markus &amp;amp; Actually use to work with this guy over at Jalbum.net 
  
So let's just take their word for it. 

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.614
And apparently he's pretty awesome. 

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.683
He's going to start up after the holidays

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:55.923
I'm also being told that there is 1 more developer we can expect.
And 
 he is brilliant, but his position has not been finalized. 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:04.097
Also, the powerhouse that is Jens, has another clone, his name is Jon. 
 and they will be working throughout the holidays on new code.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:10.270
Also next week Lydia is going to be at the Mojang office. 
So 
 you can expect tons of chaos that will arise from that. 

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:17.911
And, Notch has been voted IGN's #1 person of the year. They 
 had a voting this week. Congrats buddy! You deserved it. 

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:21.481
And Wednesday they had a great Christmas party over at Oxeye Game Studio. 

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:27.621
And, they also hired a new CFO I've been talking about for 
 a few weeks. She's going to be handling everything economy. 

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:33.226
And a big shutout to Daniel Kaplan, he purposed to 
 his girlfriend, and she said "Of course".  

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:39.566
Another victory for the nerds! Yesssss!
Go tell him on Twitter congrats and everything. 

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:44.570
He is a great guy, I've met him on several occasions. 
And 
 I wish all the nerdy best for you guys, congratulations! 

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:50.580
Alright guys, finally your biggest news here, the MOD API.
We've 
 been waiting to hear news on this. 

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:56.020
And the last time we heard, Jens is making this is primary 
 focus.
Well here's a quote from Carl when I talked with him

00:01:56.483 --> 00:02:09.460
**Quote on screen**

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:16.200
Now we do not have an exact date on when the MOD API 
 will be available. But, we do know that Jens is talking with...

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:21.440
All the major frameworks of the Minecraft community. Including 
 Buckkit who went to Mojang last week. 

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:27.580
But, we can expect something at the beginning of Jan. 
On where 
 we can see things going, and more of a timeline. 

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:34.460
So as the Minecraft Monday Show enters 2012
You can expect 
 the Mods segment to be a larger part. 

00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:38.690
And main focus, because that is going to be a big 
 part of the community. More than anything else. 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.090
So in that case, let's get right into it with your mods this week.

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:45.360
Your very first mod, if you're an RTS lover
You're going to enjoy this. 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.400
Because it's releasing very soon.  
This is a Minecraft RTS game. 

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:55.980
Where you drop items to give NPC task you want them to 
 complete. And are completed in the order you give them. 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.580
This is everything from actually building structures
to simply gathering 
 material you can take from them. 

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:07.320
When it comes to actually making a building.
They clear out all 
 the land. Make the foundation, and then the building

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:12.590
And this will be released very soon just so you know.
And 
 your second mod here is for realistic sounds to Minecraft.

00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:17.660
Where it just adds to your current game, now keep an eye 
 out cause they're always making nice improvements to it. 

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:24.800
But it adds a lot of nice ambient sounds to the 
 game. 
Including mob sounds, and general all around coverage. 

00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:29.940
The sounds are in no way overbearing or to much. 
They're 
 just a nice subtle addition to the game. 

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:33.150
You Minecraft videos this week. 
We have creeper revenge again. 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.150
He's coming out with them on a pretty regular basis. 
And I love 
 these, I'm just going to show it off one more time. 

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:44.360
I know I talked about it a few weeks ago.
But creeper revenge episode 2...

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:49.460
Is all about how to flank, and attack Steve with style.
This is 
 a genius series Idea and I absolutely love it. 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.400
And it just seems like he love blowing up Segways in the end. 
Your 
 second video is all about why you don't dig straight down. 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.470
pretty known - Well he has fun with it in this animation. 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.980
Your 3rd video here *sign* talk about the end of the year...
Cause 
 this brings back the 1st Ep of Minecraft Mondays. 

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:10.280
There's nothing better than shooting a sheeps bootyhole though it's face! 

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:12.120
~~~ BOOM!!!!!! ~~~ (Bootyhole through face has occurred)

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:13.950
WHA WHA WHA WHAAAaaaat?

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:19.060
The pig cannon... and they never get old. 
*noises* BLaaaaaawawawawa 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.290
Who doesn't love pig cannons! 

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:26.700
Also this week you can expect a video i helped produce. 
 
you guys are going to love this song! (I hope)

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:28.970
I've listened to it like 100 times already. 

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:35.510
But also, I hung out with ChimneySwift11, Wolv21, minecraftwb, 
 Clash. All of them on Livestream (Twitch)

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.610
And, none of them knew how to make their Minecraft GO FAST!

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:45.450
So I helped them do that, and I made a tutorial. 
Now this 
 is only for windows users and works for 32bit &amp;amp; 64bit. 

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.620
Very simply how to make your Minecraft GO FAST!

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:52.660
Also I was interviewed by a few people in the last couple 
 of weeks.
So those links are below if you're interested. 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.630
Alright now your texture pack is called "FeatherLight"
It is a 64x64 Texture-pack. 

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:04.970
This is a very nice appealing texturepack, that is bright with detailed 
 colors. Wood textures seems to stand out the most. 

00:05:05.338 --> 00:05:10.680
But also the nice thing is, every piece of 
 art and every texture is completely original. 

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:15.980
Nothing is stolen or reused, and actual images or photographs that 
 are used, are copy write and royalty free. 

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:22.460
So it's just nice to see more texture packs that are 
 original.
And not complete rips or stolen textures from others. 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.030
Now one of my favorite segments 
Holy $#!7 
 Did You See That in Minecraft! 

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.160
One of yours this week, FyreUK, I showed them off 
 last week too with one of their builds. 

00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:38.010
They're doing amazing time-laps as always. But, check this 
 out. They have one that's actually downloadable now!

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:42.840
This is the very first time they've ever done 
 this. 
So go ahead and download it. 

00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:45.380
They've also had it downloaded so many time already 
They had 
 to find a new host to do it. 

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:50.080
There is just so much detail in all their 
 builds.
and so many people are involved. 

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:55.240
Cause I've always been a fan of the massive train station they 
 built
Man how I've always wanted to get one of their maps!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.960
It's great to actually see that the community can 
 get their hands involved with one. 

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:02.830
Now your seed of the week this week.
There's five for you...

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:07.330
Because somebody did a wonderful video covering some very great good looking seeds. 

00:06:07.834 --> 00:06:13.670
And they have all the locations of some big structures 
 on them.
I've linked that for you below. 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.420
This new seed generation system that they've been doing,
is just absolutely brilliant. 

00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:20.050
Because it is just so much better than what it use to be. 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.420
And real quick your skins for this week...Hmmmm....  Enjoy!
? Claw machine 
 Angry Birds
? Tropic Island
? Snow man with Scarf and hat

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.650
But now we've come to, the creeper bar question of the week!

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:34.720
What was your most favorite feature of beta. 
Mine was 
 always punching sheep just to get their wool. 

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.130
That was so much nicer, and easier.
And pretty comical too. 

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:43.900
So be sure to comment, and subscribe, if you'd like 
 to win.
one of these! A Minecraft Mondays T-Shirt. 

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:47.910
or... an "I break for porkshops!!!"
Love these things they're great.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.710
Nobody will ever get it if they don't play Minecraft.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:58.720
Also a big thank you to our new server host legendary 
 craft. 
They commonly host 200+ people on their servers.

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:02.160
And we were more than happy to join them. 
So 
 I will see you on the server. 

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:06.460
And since we joined them last week. 
it has been nothing 
 but good stuff. From help with plugins, to --

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:14.030
To cleaning up any possible lag what so ever.
We even 
 spawned about 300 Enderdragons,
 nothing, Ran like a champ!

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:21.880
But, that is everything for this weeks show of Minecraft Mondays. 
I trimmed this down 
 a bit cause of the Holidays, and I'm actually filming this on Christmas. 

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:27.610
So, I hope everybody has a great Holiday and a safe New 
 Year. 
And I will see you guys next Monday. 

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:31.720
And in 2012. 
As always thank you for 
 watching, thank you for the support. 

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.690
With the Minecraft Monday Show. 
And sharing it with your fellow Minecraft addicts. 

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:37.420
And I will see you next week.
Happy Minecrafting!

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:38.390
And Diamonds To You!
