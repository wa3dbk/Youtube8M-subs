00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.720
Economic research makes it hard to deny that
investment in early childhood development

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
is the smartest strategy that we can make.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
There's really no more fertile period of time
for investing in human capacity.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.980
We're having a national debate right now about
effective teaching.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.120
We're focusing in ways that we never have
before on the importance of the teacher that

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.200
is in the classroom with the children.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.930
What we're learning is that there are elements
of what teachers know that are important,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.350
but it's far more important what teachers
do with children in those classrooms.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.190
"That is delicious!

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.389
OK, I want that.

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:41.600
Alright, get that now.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.710
Don't forget!"

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.579
Dozens of studies now from all across the
country converge really on the finding that

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.769
it is the qualities and nature of interactions
between the adults and children that are responsible

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.679
for the learning and development of those
kids.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:08.150
There are a lot of ways to define quality.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.830
Our way of measuring quality involves observing
the interactions that occur between teachers

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.830
and student in those settings.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.900
We use the Classroom Assessment Scoring System
to do that.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.190
We've been able to show in almost thousands
of classrooms across the country that indeed

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.480
when one uses a standardized reliable way
of looking at interactions, that what we're

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.390
looking at is predicting children's learning
and development.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.090
When we look at the interactions that adults
have with kids, we generally think of them

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.270
in terms of how emotionally supportive is
the adult toward the children, how much does

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.930
the adult organize the child's activity and
attention and time in the classroom, and what

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.650
is the adult doing to foster cognitive development
that stimulate language and conversation with

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.450
the children.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.350
On the emotional side of things, we're looking
for how warm those interactions are, does

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.810
the teacher genuinely enjoy the child, and
is there some reciprocity in that enjoyment?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.170
"Oh, Fideles says we have cheer for him.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.240
So we've got to say 'Go Fideles!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240
Go Fideles!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
Go Fideles!

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240
You can do it!

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Go Fideles!

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240
Go Fideles!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240
Oh you did it!".

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.180
A child should feel that they are supported
in their growth of self esteem, in their use

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.090
of curiosity, and persistence and resilience.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.110
All the types of life-long management skills
that we want every individual to have find

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.819
their seeds in these very young years.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.209
"Can you help me make it like this monster?"

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.189
"OK, first draw a line here, and then point
here, then make the ears, eyes, nose..."

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.200
"Help me.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.230
I can't" "Here, that's how you do it!"

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.230
"Aha!

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.749
That's too funny" "Sorry!"

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:57.970
We also pay a lot of attention to how teachers
manage time and manage behavior and activities.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.239
So, we like to see teachers structure learning
environments in ways, or learning activities

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.219
in ways, that allows kids to move and allows
kids to make noise and allows them to really

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.139
kid of express themselves individually.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:17.430
[singing]
But I think one of the more important elements

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.319
that we see of interaction are the ways in
which adults provide ways that stretch the

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.450
children's thinking.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.079
"Number 10" "Is 10 on the top or should 10
be on the bottom?"

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.480
"Bottom" "OK.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.129
And then what comes before 10?"

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.389
"7" "What's this one?"

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.090
"9" "so, 10..."

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.920
A child might be fiddling with a puzzle or
trying to learn a new word and the teacher

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.340
wouldn't give them the answer but would just
come in and try to offer some hints that would

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.689
help the child perform the task a little bit
higher level, hopefully have an experience

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.629
of success, and then celebrate that success
together.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.890
"Would you be able to show 0?"

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.810
"No zero" "You don't have to show zero, why?

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.810
Zero is how many?"

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.900
"Nothing" "How many is zero?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.900
Nothing!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900
Excellent!

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.989
Good job, Jack!

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.319
You know your numbers really really well."

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:15.090
The ability to actually measure, assess, and
then support effective interactions in a classroom

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.620
has given us a great opportunity.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.620
We're opening up a field of understanding,
measuring, and improving the quality and effectiveness

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.350
of teachers' interactions with kids that I
think has enormous promise.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:49.850
I think it actually has the potential to move
education forward.
