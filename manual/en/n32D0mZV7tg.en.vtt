Hi, this is john; I'm with Archery Tag. We're
going to do a fun demonstration for you

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.090
today.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.509
We're going to demonstrate how safe these Archery Tag arrows really are

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.449
by shooting an egg.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.999
Uh... we have this egg

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.269
suspended from the tree with the uh...
string there. We glued it on there; it should stay

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.519
secure.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.320
We're going to shoot it and we're going to

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.740
demonstrate our Highland Bow here. This is a
new offering that we have.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.230
So we're doing a couple of things: showing you
the Highland Bow

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.730
and shooting an egg.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.400
Just show you that were that doing any
kind of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.110
trick shots here with the camera...

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.230
uh... some people might think we're
shooting a hard-boiled egg. But we wanna show you

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.000
this is actually an egg that we'll splatter.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.300
We're going to write a smiley face
on here...

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.220
There we go! Now I'm going to get back about 10, 12

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.510
feet.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.510
And see what we can do!

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.860
Are you ready?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.220
Just nicked it. Got another arrow here...

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.530
Hold up, hold up.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.080
Let's see the smiley face.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.180
Alright.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.040
Well, looks like he's still smiling.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.740
As you can see it's the same egg. Hasn't
gone anywhere.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.740
Take it down!

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.049
Still got the same smiley face!

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:17.040
And we're going to let 'im go!

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.829
There's the smiley face.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:21.409
There ya go!
