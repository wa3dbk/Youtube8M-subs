Hi, I'm Constable Rob Brunt of the Vancouver Police Department Bike Unit

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.800
As part of our LOG IT OR LOSE IT campaign

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.560
I'd like to take a few seconds of your
time to give you some pointers

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.100
on how to reduce the chance of you
becoming a victim

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.540
of a theft of bicycle.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.760
The 3 "L"s - Location, Lock it, Log it.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
Step 1 is Location.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.880
pick a location that is highly visible,
has lots of pedestrian traffic, 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.160
somewhere a thief is going to be easily seen. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.900
Out front of a grocery store, community centre, busy coffee shop.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.950
step 2 - Lock it. invest and a good luck

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130
Invest in a good lock.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.800
Take your lock, and lock your rear wheel through the rear triangle, and through your back tire. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.040
Make sure what you're locking to, is an immovable object.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.880
A bike rack, a pole, 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.220
something a thief can't dig up, or lift your bike out of. 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.120
Now, if you have the space, take off your front tire and lock it here as well.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.330
The ideal system, however, is to have two locks.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.250
a U lock and a cable lock.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.010
Now, take your cable lock, feed it through from the front tire, 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.620
Lock your bike everywhere you go.  That
includes your home, backyard, your garage

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.260
Log It.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.370
find your serial number on your bike.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.340
On most bicycles, you flip over your bike

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.760
Look on the bottom of your crank, your serial number should be there.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.960
Write it down, and put it in a safe place.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.650
VPD recovers thousands of bicycles a year.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.670
We can't return it if we can't identify the owner

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.200
