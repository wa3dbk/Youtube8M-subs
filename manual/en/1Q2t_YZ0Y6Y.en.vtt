We are going to talk about divorce and remarriage
in the church. Now divorce is a sad thing

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:17.099
it's a devastating thing, it cripples, it
cuts out, it's like putting two people together

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.470
and they've been together for so long that
they become one and then you slit them right

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.810
down the middle. And they go their separate
ways. You know what they are taking a little

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.050
bit of the other one with them where they
go. And so they are never really whole again.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.050
Well that's really the picture of divorce.
This is why God says that I hate divorce,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
I hate divorce. It's not of me, it's not something
that I want. Now however we know that God

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.579
feels that way but there is still divorce
in the church. So when people get divorced

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.530
and they get remarried is that of God. Are
they in sin? Are they wrong? How does God

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.850
view those things? Well that could be different
you know, a view point for different people

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.220
based upon how you interpret scripture. But
as I read my bible I believe it's very clear

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.430
that God simply says, when a woman divorces
her husband and she remarries again, and therefore

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.820
her husband is yet still alive then that woman
commits adultery. Wow those are some sobering

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.350
words there. You know but the bible says what
it says. And I don't think it needs an extra

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.060
interpretation there. Now then when someone
says, well I'm an adulteress and God is going

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.909
to look frown upon me you know, I'm going
to, I'm in trouble now, and I'm in sin whatever.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.210
You know, listen we serve an awesome God,
we serve a God that is so merciful, so loving

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.920
and so long suffering with us you know. I
wouldn't want to be standing here and tell

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.430
you you know God is mad at you and God hates
you, you know. We know God is a God of love.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.049
So I think I would just simply encourage someone
that's in that situation to simply just see

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.900
God. You know our hearts will let us know
whether or not we are in error or not and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.739
if you feel that you are in error then make
the necessary adjustments. And do what you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.290
need to do so that you can have the peace
that God desires for you. But remember the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.159
bible is clear, the bible instructs us and
that is our guiding light you know the bible

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:30.540
is what you should live by. So in this particular
issue of marriage and divorce and the remarriage

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.130
simply go with what the bible says, and you
can never go wrong.
