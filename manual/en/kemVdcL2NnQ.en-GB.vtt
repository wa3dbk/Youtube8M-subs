00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.300
I feel happy.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.520
I just feel happy

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.580
and very excited.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.120
Check the traffic

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.060
I wasn't merging

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.720
into any, Dad.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.060
Now I can go.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.960
Okay.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.620
When a child is born,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.460
you've got all

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.780
these dreams

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.380
of what your child

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.280
would be.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.060
And then the doctor

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.140
comes in and says

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.400
your son has Down Syndrome

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.660
and all those dreams just

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.600
suddenly collapse almost immediately.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.320
And you go into

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.280
the mode,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.900
how do I maximise what

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.300
my son can do.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.545
(Chris' Mum) Christopher was learning,

00:00:59.545 --> 00:01:01.705
he needed help,

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:02.805
from the beginning,

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:04.205
he needed more than

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.605
- than others.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.340
My parents is the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.460
biggest one because without them,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.940
I wouldn't progress.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.820
(Chris) I've got two roles

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.340
with Special Olympics

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.660
Morning

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:20.431

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.640
One as an athlete,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.040
one as an office worker.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.180
Thank you for calling

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.900
Special Olympics Australia,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Chris speaking.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:32.457
Welcome to Sydney University.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.280
This is my University.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.460
My Dad was a Sydney

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.220
University student himself.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.840
Whenever everyone asks

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.680
me which Uni I'm going

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.300

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.480
Hey Chris, how are you going?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.780
I'm good Mandy, how are you?

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.469
I'm good.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.449
If I'm happy with the

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:53.069
skill and I can do it,

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.549
I am - what's it called?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.540
I'm excited.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.320
But I also like challenges.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.720
Because challenges and skills

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.700
that I learned on the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.220
high bar are the complex

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.100
skills that I can

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.820
grasp, but now it is simple.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.112
Cha

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.820
Touch your toes

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820
I applied for a job

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.040
at my local gymnast club.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.180
Then they asked me,

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:21.887
would you like to work.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.140
I became an accredited gymnast coach.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.480
Thats it, that's a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.820
good one there!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.660
Are you proud of me?

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:30.001
Oh very proud of you.

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.736
Yes we are very proud.

00:02:31.736 --> 00:02:33.056
(Chris' Dad) The surprising thing

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.860
about you, Chris is you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.800
don't have a limit.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.760
You keep on learning.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.360
(Chris' Mum) You always want

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.720
something else to do,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.140
you find interests,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.760
you never stop.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760
(Chris' Dad) And you're up

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.740
for trying everything.
