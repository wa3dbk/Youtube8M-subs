00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:18.890
DMD or Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the
most common muscle disease affecting young

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.370
boys; it affects about 1 in 3,600.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.210
It's an incurable condition, and it results
in really muscle weakness that worsens over

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.960
a boy's lifetime.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.570
Typically, boys lose their ability to walk
around age 12.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.530
As boys go through adolescence, they have
usually additional complications related to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.510
their lung or pulmonary health, as well as
more often than not will develop cardiac disease,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.170
heart disease, and fortunately most boys will
pass away in their 20s from complications

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.969
such as pneumonia, or heart failure.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.160
In order to combat diseases like this we have
to study the structure of proteins that are

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.880
associated with that particular disease.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.540
In order to do that, we first must crystallize
the protein, and that crystal is basically

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.440
millions of copies of that same protein aligned
like a row of bricks on a wall, but in three

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.800
dimensions.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.650
But here's the problem, when we try to grow
a crystal on earth gravity can affect the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.920
way the molecules become aligned on the crystal's
surface and that affects the overall quality

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.780
of the crystal.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.040
The ideal environment to grow a more perfect
crystal would be a lab that we could have

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.890
up in space orbiting the globe so that we
are free of earth's gravity.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.470
Luckily we have one of those with the International
Space Station.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.880
Since 2003, the Japan Aerospace Exploration
Agency has conducted more than 16 sessions

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.560
of the protein crystal growth experiments
onboard the International Space Station.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.830
In microgravity the crystals grow much more
slowly, but the molecules have more time to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.710
get perfectly arranged on the surface of the
crystal, and that gives us much better data.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.459
One of the most promising results has been
gained by studying a protein associated with

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.010
Duchenne muscular disorder.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.600
Studying this protein that [inaudible] discovery
like a key fitting into a key hole we are

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.910
able to design the graph that perfectly binds
to this protein.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.590
By knowing the shape of that key hole we can
tailor make a drug to fit into a specific

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.959
location of the protein.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:48.640
What this means is we may be able to slow
the disease by half instead of being in a

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.400
wheelchair at 12 we might be able to push
that age to 25.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:05.579
Instead of being dependent upon this vision
at 20 years old you live to be 40.

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:16.090
What are we talking about is potentially doubling
the life span of many of the DMD patients.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.240
And it's all because of such a [inaudible]
afforded to us by the International Space

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.340
Station.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.980
This research is really just in its infancy;
there are literally thousands of other proteins

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.239
who's structures we need to determine, and
the International Space Station is going to

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.260
provide a platform where we can hopefully
grow much better crystals that will allow

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.469
us to get structures and to learn more about
how these molecules function in our body,

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.160
in bacteria, or in viruses.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.920
We're doing this research not just for ourselves
or our children, but for generations to come.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.730
Many of the protein structures that will be
determined wouldn't be possible without the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.849
International Space Station.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.029
[ Music ]

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:12.110
I'm hoping that those trials will be successful,
that they will tell us yes there is a way

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.019
that we can keep these boys stronger for a
longer period of time.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.410
That we can help their heart and pulmonary
function and that they can live longer; that

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.360
they can grow up and go to school and do the
things that we all want our children to do.
