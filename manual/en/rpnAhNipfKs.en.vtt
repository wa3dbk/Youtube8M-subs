00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There is a secret game that is played for control of the world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 A true test of your fabled skills and intellect.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And I am here to lead you to it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I do not know what temptations you offer, stranger, 
 and perhaps that is best. Go in peace.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A king has no time for games.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So be it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But should you change your mind, look for 
 me at midnight in the gamblers quarter.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
A week passed, and the encounter with Jata haunted 
 Yudish through endless days of tedious work.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
My King, the science is there to expand 
 your subjects lifespans by another thousand years.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The kingdom canâ€™t afford it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Seven thousand years per person is more than enough!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's inhumane to prevent it. What do you command great King?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The Vimanas crowd the skies.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We must tear down Old Indraprasth and build a new flyway.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This man is a fool if he thinks vimanas are the future.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Look at these diagrams, I can develop a better transportation tech.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What do you command great King?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's clear even to his foolish brothers that something was wrong.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What do you know about the gambling quarter?
