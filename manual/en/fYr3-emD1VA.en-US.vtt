00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.839
Good afternoon, I'm Still reporting on the
economy.

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.600
The war drums of economic doom continue to
bang in the United States.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.030
This morning, the Wall Street Journal reported
that top bankers are warning Republicans to

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.870
-- now catch this -- bankers warned Republicans
NOT to pay interest on the debt ahead of social

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.649
programs.
In other words, accept Obama's budget proposals,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.120
or we will support a default on U.S. Government
debt. What a turn of events!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.140
As I've said before, a default will NEVER
happen, but it shows what side the big bankers

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.260
are on at this point. More debt to cure America's
debt problem is like more whiskey to cure

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.350
a drinking problem. We have to stop this -- why
not now?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:10.970
I say, "No More National Debt". A sovereign
nation does not need to borrow. Congress has

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.830
full authority -- under Article 1, section
8 of the Constitution -- to "pay the Debts....",

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.430
and "coin Money [and] regulate the Value thereof...."
No new laws are needed -- no Constitutional

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.700
Amendment. Just these two simple steps.
Step 1: Let's pay these debts with coins.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.310
They are the only money created without debt.
The Supreme Court has determined that the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.770
term "coin" money can refer to paper money
as well as metallic coins -- but to be sure

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.630
there is no confusion here, let's just pay
our debts in actual coins this time -- just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.170
to make a point.
In our last report, we saw that the Treasurer

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.770
of the United States said that we would need
$417 billion by Nov. 7 to prevent a default

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.509
on the interest payments on U.S. Treasury
Bonds. No problem.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.530
We don't have to go begging to bankers for
loans to make these payments. We can simply

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:26.150
pay them off in lawful U.S. coins -- so how
about quarters?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.049
The Treasurer has complete authority to do
this without even asking Congress for legislation.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:39.450
A U.S. quarter weighs exactly 1/5th of an
ounce. Five of them to an ounce. 80 of them

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:50.170
to a pound. 160,000 to a ton -- that's $40,000
worth. That's 10.4 million tons of quarters,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.769
or about 347,000 tractor trailer loads.
Think of the jobs this would create -- not

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.669
only in the production of the quarters, but
their transportation.

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:09.909
Once we learn that we no longer have to borrow
money from bankers ever again, we can move

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:16.690
to Step 2 as proposed this morning by Karl
Denninger on "The Market Ticker".

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.279
Since all spending bills must originate in
the U.S. House of Representatives, the Speaker

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.049
of the House could pass a year's worth of
government funding at the existing levels

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:33.370
of tax revenues and no more -- in other words
a balanced budget. Then the Speaker could

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.609
adjourn the House sine die -- in other words,
until the next Congress is elected about 13

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.209
months from now. Sine Die is irrevocable.
"There would be no need for a debt ceiling

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.019
increase because there would be no deficit
allowed," said Denninger.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.180
The Democrat-controlled Senate would than
have to pass this bill and have the President

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.591
sign it, or the Democrats would be totally
responsible for the resulting chaos. They

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:07.379
could actually spin themselves as the big
heroes. Brilliant!

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.140
I'm Still reporting on the economy. Good day.
