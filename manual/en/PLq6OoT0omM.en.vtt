HI I'm Blue I like to do whatever my parents
ask me to. I'm green super-duper sweet. I

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.620
like to put everyone else before me. I'm pink.
I like to think. Reading is fun and so is

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.239
learning. I'm yellow the brand new fellow.
I have authority problems and I live in the

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:03.489
Ghetto.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.919
We are the fun friends. My parents and my
sister they keep me on track. We are the fun

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:11.919
friends. All my sister's pants say juicy on
the back. We are the fun friends. If you're

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.200
really sad try on a funky sweater. We are
the fun friends. If really really sad violence

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.450
always makes it better.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.639
Wow, there's so much to do and think about.
Really like what? Like what makes us who we

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.009
are. Oh, you mean like the things we love.
Or places we like. Or why our parents are

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.049
divorced and punching things feel soo good?

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.289
Not exactly Yellow, for example, I have really
fun hobbies. Like Shopping, or lifting, or

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.555
or stabbing somebody?
I don't know!

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:18.539
I have really great role models! Like Beethoven,
or OJ Simpson! Is she throwing a football

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:18.539
or stabbing somebody?
I don't know!

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:18.539
What about our favorite weapons? Like uh,
uh... Like kindness, or Brass knuckles...

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:18.539
I don;t know!

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.279
What about our favorite dances? Like the Grapevine,
or the disco, or the twerk.. NOOOO!!!

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000
What are you doing!? this is a kids show.
Yeah you really gotta to tone it done buddy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.130
What? Everything you say is horrible for kids
to say and do! I just thought you guys wanted

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.890
me to be honest and real. This isn't a documentary
about inner-city gang life. Get it together.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm sorry I'll do what I was supposed to,
you can trust me.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.330
We are the fun friends! You can do a lot when
it's imaginary! We are the fun friends. You

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.680
can also do a lot with a fake ID. We are the
fun friends. Ever stuck your finger in a working

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
wall socket. We are the fun friends. Its fun
taking money out of stranger's pockets.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.400
That does it. I'm going to finish her off
myself.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.400
AHHHH!!! Let me at him! I just need some time
to take my earrings off!
