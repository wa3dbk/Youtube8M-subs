00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:02.088
Announcer: Today...

00:00:02.448 --> 00:00:04.557
Dr. Youn: A couple quick injections.
Boom. Boom.

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:06.534
Rachael Ray: Oh gosh, I seriously can't look.

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:09.390
Announcer: What if you could do this
without the pain?

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:10.501
Audience: [applause]

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.103
Rachael: Okay. Next patient.
What are we moving onto next?

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:16.102
Dr. Anthony Youn: Okay I'm gonna have you
come over on this side.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.132
Rachael: I'll come over here.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:22.312
Dr. Youn: And what we're going to talk about next
is fat removal. So, the old-fashioned way to

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:26.350
remove fat is with diet and exercise.
Old-fashioned diet and exercises or liposuction.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.986
And we know liposuction is painful, and we know
diet and exercise can be painful too.

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:32.278
Rachael: [laughs]

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:34.670
Dr. Youn: So, now on your show we've actually
shown a couple of different devices over the last

00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:40.313
couple years that will reduce fat without surgery,
and these devices would either freeze the fat away

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:45.883
or they would use ultrasound to kind of blast
the fat. But the issue with these devices is that

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.593
they do cause pain too. So now plastic surgeons,
we've taken it one step further and now we're

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:56.162
doing the Venus Freeze. And this is a way
to remove fat with absolutely no pain at all.

00:00:56.508 --> 00:00:58.957
Rachael: When you have a procedure like this
done, does it take multiple times?

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.204
Dr. Youn: It does take multiple times.

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.795
Rachael: And how long does it take to achieve,
say an inch difference?

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:08.751
Dr. Youn: Typically the studies have come out.
There was one out of Toronto that showed

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.605
an inch and a half difference around the
waistline after about six treatments.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.480
And each treatment takes about a half hour.
It costs about $200-300. So it's not cheap.

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:20.204
To remove fat without pain it costs
a little bit more money.

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:21.951
Rachael: And how long do the results last?

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:26.882
Dr. Youn: It's a very new device, so we're seeing
results initially at a year, and there are some

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:30.846
doctors from overseas, where it's been around
there longer, they're saying that

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:32.500
they're seeing results 4-5 years later.

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:37.161
Rachael: Wow. I mean given reason that you're
not sitting around eating Ben and Jerry's all night.

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.847
Dr. Youn: Exactly. You can't have this done
and then decide you're going to go binge.

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:43.386
Rachael: And then just eat whatever you want.
Exactly.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.684
Dr. Youn: Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

00:01:44.977 --> 00:01:48.846
Rachael: So, have you ever considered having
a tummy laser treatment,

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.034
or even more severe, a tummy tuck?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.976
Alicia: The recovery time is just entirely too
long, and I was always afraid of the pain.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.154
Rachael: Yeah, I mean you hear horror stories
about even liposuction. Not only being painful,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.617
but in some cases being deadly. Like things
going wrong. I mean surgery is still surgery.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.612
Dr. Youn: Yeah, so it's important to do your
homework. Now today we're covering all these

00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:12.750
devices and these treatments that have no pain
at all. And there are some ways to get

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:17.615
good results that way, but the one surgery
that there's never going to be a substitute for,

00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:20.549
and you've got to suffer through the pain,
is the tummy tuck.

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:21.640
Rachael: It really is.

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:24.932
Dr. Youn: Exactly. So, women come in, they've had
children, they have extra skin on their tummy.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.148
Tummy tucks are very painful operations.
I tell you, 1 out of every 3 or 4 of my patients,

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:31.921
2-3 days after surgery
have a little buyer's remorse.

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.549
Rachael: Because it's so painful.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.625
Dr. Youn: Because it is, yeah.

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:38.271
Rachael: But that's about excess skin,
not about necessarily just losing an inch.

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:41.189
Dr. Youn: Exactly. But there are surveys that
show-there's one on www.realself.com

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.727
showed 95% satisfaction rate with tummy tucks,
even though they go through this pain.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:46.996
So sometimes you have to go through the pain
to get the results.

00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:49.492
Rachael: That really is a
"no pain, no gain" situation.

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:50.292
Dr. Youn: It really is.

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:53.472
Rachael: But this is very successful for
just getting rid of some of the fat.

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:55.422
And we have the befores and afters, right?

00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:58.636
Dr. Youn: Exactly. So we take a peek at that. I'm
going to have you lie down here. We can kind of...

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:04.454
Rachael: Yeah, you could do Alicia's right now
while we're looking at the befores and afters.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:07.177
Dr. Youn: Sounds good to me. Alright, so I'm
going to pull up a little bit, okay.

00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:12.676
Rachael: Wow! That is huge!
What a difference that is.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.374
Dr. Youn: And I think we have some arms
to show as well.

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.451
Rachael: Oh my goodness!

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:19.884
Audience: [sighs]

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:22.974
Rachael: That's unbelievable. You nervous?

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:23.914
Alicia: No, not really.

00:03:24.317 --> 00:03:25.738
Rachael: It's going to be fun.
It looks like a fun little gadget.

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:28.590
Dr Youn: I'm going to have you help me, if you
don't mind. Have you ever used one of these?

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.161
Rachael: Oh yeah, I got these all the time.
[laughs] Oh no, actually I do know what this is.

00:03:32.398 --> 00:03:36.517
Is this a thermometer? My husband has one
of these. I think Mario Batali gave it to him

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.432
and he uses it in the pizza oven. It makes him
extremely happy to know what it reads. [laughs]

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:42.864
Dr. Youn: So what we're going to do is...

00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:46.336
Rachael: Holy macaroni, it's 17 degrees Celsius
in here. No wonder we're chilly. [laughs]

00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:47.596
Audience: [laughs]

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:51.602
Dr. Youn: So the idea behind the Venus Freeze,
it's a revolutionary new treatment to reduce fat.

00:03:51.884 --> 00:03:56.393
And it does that by combining radio frequency
with magnet waves. And the idea behind it

00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.324
is by combining that radio frequency with
magnet waves, if we get her skin temperature

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:05.505
to at least 41 to 42 degrees, we can
actually cause the fat...

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:08.096
Rachael: This is on Celsius. Is it supposed to be?

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.587
Dr. Youn: Yes. So let's have you hit her here.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.804
Rachael: 31, 30.

00:04:12.213 --> 00:04:19.948
Dr. Youn: 31. Okay. So I'm going to start the
treatment right now. So the idea is that this

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:24.319
product, it causes the fat cells to literally
open up and release their contents.

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:25.784
Rachael: Wow!

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:27.879
Dr. Youn: So let's take a peek.
Can you go ahead and check her again?

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:29.608
Rachael: 38.

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:31.555
Dr. Youn: 36?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.279
Rachael: 38 is what we're at when I first hit her.

00:04:33.646 --> 00:04:35.409
Dr. Youn: So we're going to get her up to 42.

00:04:35.736 --> 00:04:38.546
Now once we hit 42 degrees,
that's when the fat starts to melt away.

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:39.966
Rachael: No kidding?

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:42.183
Dr. Youn: Yeah. And so we're going to get
up to 42 degrees.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.319
Rachael: When we go to commercial, you're going
to do the other side for her too, right?

00:04:44.524 --> 00:04:46.502
So she doesn't have a weird like... [laughs]

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:47.593
Audience: [laughs]

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.872
Dr. Youn: We'll see if we have time. [laughs]
Alright, let's check her and see where's she's at.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.462
Rachael: 41, 41.2.

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:56.439
Dr. Youn: So we've got to get it just up
to the 42 and we'll be good.

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:58.893
And then we'll go to the next part of the segment.

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.887
Rachael: Awesome.

00:05:00.438 --> 00:05:03.055
Dr. Youn: Alright.

00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:03.995
Rachael: 41.8.

00:05:04.548 --> 00:05:05.593
Rachael: 42.4!

00:05:05.952 --> 00:05:06.675
Audience: [applause]

00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:11.684
Rachael: We have fat melt! Good job baby.
You just hang out. Does it hurt?

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:13.960
Alicia: No, not at all.

00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:14.508
Rachael: Nothing, right?

00:05:15.053 --> 00:05:15.925
Alicia: It was just very warm.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.740
Rachael: Now we promise we're going to do the
other half, but over the break. We have one

00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:22.775
more demo over here. [laughs] You just chill out,
no pun intended. And he'll be right back.

00:05:23.103 --> 00:05:24.417
Audience: [applause]
