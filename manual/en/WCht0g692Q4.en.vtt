00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey guys.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.150
This is Game On, I'm Grace and I've got the
best gaming news for you today so first up

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.370
a new map, game mode and abilities are coming
to Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare, they're

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.779
coming for free and they look like a lot of
fun.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.210
Sure you might be lost in the world that is
Titanfall right now but tear yourself away

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.850
because PVZ is bringing in some treats with
the Garden Variety Pack DLC.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.260
The new 8v8 Gnome Bomb game mode allows zombies
to defend rather than just attacking like

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290
in the current Gardens vs Graveyards.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.390
And all the games characters get three new
abilities so you can change your loadout.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.090
There's also a new map called Chomp Town which
sounds a little scary if you're a zombie.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690
Anyone who's spoken to me in the last few
weeks will know I've become absolutely addicted

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.450
to this game so you must come and play it
with me.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.430
Up next if the US Amazon site listing is anything
to go by, apparently DriveClub will be coming

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.920
out on Tuesday September 30th.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
It's also been reported that Sony has started
sending out e-mails to those customers who

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.920
have pre-ordered a copy that they will be
getting it on a new release date of between

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.921
Friday October 3rd and Tuesday October 7th.

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.680
The game was originally meant to launch alongside
the PS4.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.960
We'll keep an ear to the ground on the one.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.830
And finally it seems Canada has decided to
charge you more for a PlayStation 4, I'm going

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.830
to tell you why.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.000
And the reason is basically anyone who got
their cheeky mitts on a PS4 previously was

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.040
actually getting it cheaper than America.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.320
Sony has stated that the price increase is
due to changes in the market environment,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.290
so the Ps4 has gone up by 50 dollars.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.870
Same goes for the DualShock conotroller, PS
Camera and some games.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.870
Sorry Canada.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.570
