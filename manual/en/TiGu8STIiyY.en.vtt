00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.100
Hah!

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400
- Ouch!
- Jenny!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.466
- That hurt!
- I’m sorry.

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.766
- Got ya!
- Hey! No fair!

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.400
Never let your guard down.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.566
Boys are weird.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:42.700
Oh great...
I forgot my umbrella.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.333
Don't worry, Jenny...
I’ll share mine with ya!

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.300
Oh no.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.433
Nice try.  And even though
I don’t really want to,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.833
I guess I can share my
umbrella with a classmate.

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.133
- Jenny!
- Hi Mom!

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.166
Thanks guys.
See you tomorrow!

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.766
See you, Jenny!

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.200
I hate it when I
act polite for no reason.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.166
But now you can give
your umbrella to me!

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.033
- What...why should I?
- Well you broke mine!

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.300
- Did not!
- Did too!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
- You OK, Posty?
- Sure.  Thanks, Poli.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.600
- Hey Poli... Roy.
- Hello, Spooky.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
Posty, you all right? Heard your
day’s not going too well.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.200
Yeah... I ... had a slip.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.766
Roads can get slippery,

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.233
especially on rainy days
like this one.

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.233
- So drive carefully.
- Don't worry.

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:47.266
I’ll take good care of
our friend, Posty.

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:51.000
- Thanks. Bye guys.
- Be safe Spooky!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.733
Well Roy… I’m heading
over to the school.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.166
Yeah, I guess classes are
over by now.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.800
Right… and I want to
make sure

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.800
the students all
get home safely.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.933
- You be careful too, Poli!
- Will do!

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.533
Quit hogging it!
I’m getting all wet!

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.466
I’m getting wetter
than you, Kevin!

00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:09.766
Wrong!

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.966
Kevin, what do now?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.433
I don’t ...know!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.233
This rain just
won’t go away.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.333
- I’m soaked!
- So am I!

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:35.000
- Let’s cross.
- OK.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:43.766
Gotta hurry.
Oh no..I can’t see!

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:46.666
Hey, look out!

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.533
I’m rolling too fast!

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:53.200
This won’t be pretty!

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.000
I’m sorry Poli.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500
I warned you about
driving on wet roads.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.266
It’s dangerous.

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:25.866
You were right.
I’ll keep that in mind!

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.633
Kevin and Doug, you should’ve
been more careful too,

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:30.600
especially since
it was raining.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.300
Us too?!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.600
When it rains, it takes
more time and distance

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.433
for a car to stop,
because the roads are

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.900
more slippery than usual.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.866
Don’t walk too
close to the curb...

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.133
it’s safer to keep your
distance from cars

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.900
when it rains.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.033
It’s also a good idea
to stay back

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.933
a few steps
from crosswalks.

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:52.466
If you get too close,
a car could hit your umbrella.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Always hold an umbrella
higher than your eye level

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.966
so you don’t
block your view.

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.966
An umbrella you can
see through is even better.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:05.933
Use a shoulder bag when it’s
raining to carry papers,

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.700
books and other things,
so they don’t get wet.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.833
When it’s dark and rainy,

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.133
it’s safer to wear
brightly colored-clothes

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.600
and use
a bright umbrella.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.700
Dark clothes and
dark umbrellas make you

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.566
hard to see and make
accidents easy to happen.

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.133
It’s the same on
snowy days.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.800
But don’t wear white clothes
when it snows.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.833
They make you
blend in too much.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:35.300
Wow. We blocked our view
with the umbrella…

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.333
and walked right into the
crosswalk without looking.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.733
We even had
a dark umbrella!

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.766
- We got it all wrong!
- That’s true...

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:47.266
But now you know how to
get things right as rain.

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:49.600
Yeah!

00:04:53.366 --> 00:04:57.300
Jenny, you’ve got nothing
to worry about today!

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.400
You can’t share that
tiny umbrella with him?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400
Here. I’ll share mine.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.500
Thanks guys,
but, I’m covered.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.600
- OK.
- Well, see ya tomorrow!

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.700
- Jenny, wait for me!
- Try to keep up.
