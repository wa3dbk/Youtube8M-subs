Hi! This Julie with Beadaholique.com and I want to show you how use these great new

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.949
screw and nut sets by Nunn Design

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.479
and I'll show you how to use them in a form of making an earring. I find it a

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:22.710
little easier to learn when you're making a project, so this is going to be a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
earring that we made. You can see I've used a screw here

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.439
and on the back side

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.780
and the tools you need is some
way if you're items don't already have

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.250
a whole hole punch in them you need
someway of punching a hole

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.570
I have this two hole punch here

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.239
it's got to sizes. It has a 2.3 millimeter hole that it punch on

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.200
one side and has a 1.6 millimeter hole on the other

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.070
I'm going to use the smaller hole, the 1.6mm

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.530
you need some kind of cutter to cut the
backside of the screw. I have

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.780
a nice pair of flush cutters right here

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.330
and then for me I need to know where to punch that hole, I have a pen

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.580
if you're doing a traditional rivet you would need a bench block and a hammer and

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.160
that's what's so great about these
screws and nuts is you don't need some

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.790
of those more metal smithing type tools

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.610
to begin to make this particular project I
wanna layer

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.180
my pretty little flower stamping on top
of

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.290
my pendant blank here

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.750
and to do so

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.670
you can see I've got it right where I want it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.130
and I'm in now punch a hole in the flower
to begin with

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.270
this happens to be really easy thing to
punch a hole in because it's got a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
little divot right there, place

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.520
my

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.910
little flower into

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.790
the area where I can screw

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.150
the punch down, because I've got that little divot

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.210
I can kinda make sure that that's in there and
centered before I actually punch and to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.300
punch

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.780
just

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.230
twist the handle clockwise

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.830
and it does not take a lot of strength at all

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.620
and to unscrewed, to release it, go counter-clockwise

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.939
so now I've got a hole in my flower

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:15.359
I'm going to line it up with my other earring that I've already created

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.529
I want them to be even

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.859
and that looks about even to me, take my pen

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.889
hold it in place

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.650
now to make sure I can see my mark I'm going to swirl it just a little bit

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.909
that's gonna be covered

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.199
it can be really hard to see

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.259
you see it's right there

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.309
if you want to use a sharpie marker or something
like that, you could use a sharpie might be a little

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.309
easier to see

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:42.759
that's going to be perfect

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.159
take this piece

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.319
and really you have to just

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.349
be careful and look at this. It can be a little bit easier to screw down the tip

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.799
so it's almost ready to touch the blank

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.789
scoot it on in

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:00.369
and

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:06.529
probably hard to see on-camera

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.119
I'm going to grip it

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.680
I'm not going to punch it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.769
grip it enough so you can move it around

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.769
you can see I'm right on the dot

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.809
looks good to me

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.359
and I'm going to punch through

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.569
just like that, it's very easy to do

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.079
to connect the two pieces together

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.049
I'm going to take a screw

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.239
put it through the flower

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.709
and also

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.929
through my blank

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:53.929
now screw the nut onto the back

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.669
screw it down. I'm actually pressing the two pieces together and the

00:03:58.669 --> 00:03:59.559
screw

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.079
so I'm trying to hold the actual screw
steady

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.569
as I wind this down

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.949
make it as tight as possible

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:20.639
if you have a pair of pliers you can also grip it with chain nose pliers

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.979
I'm able to do it pretty tightly with just my fingers

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.210
you can see that's on there, that's not
rotating

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.870
all you need to do is take your flush
cutters

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.070
lined it up so you're right on top of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.860
the nut

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.300
and just

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.560
you can hear that went flying across my room, so just make sure that you're

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.009
pointing away from your eyes or that you're wearing my protection

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.449
and make sure it's not gonna go in a direction that can hurt anyone or anything

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.300
and make sure you pick it up after you finish this project. To attach the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.760
earring hook, I've got a cute kidney wire here

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.610
slide it through

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.099
and let it rest down at the bottom in that little

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.279
well

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.150
I have finished

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.350
my pair of earrings and it's great because they look riveted together

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.169
They're not glued into place, it's very secure and
I haven't have to use a hammer or metal

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.000
smithing tools or even glue

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.960
one glue is if you are making a piece of jewelry, you get a lot of wear

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.679
like a bracelet or a ring

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:27.409
I suggest dabbing the nut part with a little bit of glue, you can use

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.090
a GS Hypo cement, E6000

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.919
just some glue that will help to really secure
that nut in place if you do you feel

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.759
like it's going to get a lot of wear. I these earrings here we'll be

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.110
totally fine without the glue

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.110
but if you are doing a piece like a bracelet or a ring

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.920
go ahead and take that extra precaution by just adding a dab of glue. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
