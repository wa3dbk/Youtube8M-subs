How to play Classic KLOO. KLOO is the fun
card game that teaches you French

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.800
as you play. The game is very easy to play
and ideal for adults and children. To start

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.430
a game of Classic KLOO, start by dealing seven
cards to each player. The aim is to score

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.199
points by creating sentences and translating
French words. Making a sentence and learning a new

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.449
language in KLOO is really easy. Here's how.
Always start your sentence by playing a red

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.390
card first. If you weren't dealt a red card
and don't have one to start, you can play

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.629
one card, just one, of any color.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.659
Once you've played the first red card, all
you need to do is look at the colored arrow

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.540
and play a card of the same color next. Now
you can play a yellow or green card, we've

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.830
chosen yellow. Now a green card. Now a blue.
Don't forget, you cannot finish on a double

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.670
arrow card, so make sure you can play the
next one.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:33.299
You score points in Kloo as you play your
cards. You score one point for every card

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.119
you play. And you also get points for every
word you can translate. If you don't know

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.929
a word, remember to look at the bottom of
the other cards for clues. If you still can't

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.820
translate a French word, keep it in a separate pile
for everyone to see, and the next person to

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.630
translate it on their turn gets an extra three
points. All of the other cards go into a word

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.350
bank. This way, all the French words will be translated
by the end of KLOO.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.760
When you've finished your turn, pick up cards
from the pile to take your hand back to seven.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.230
And it's on to the next player. That's it.
You can score with a pen and paper, or use

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.980
the Kloo board to spice things up.
