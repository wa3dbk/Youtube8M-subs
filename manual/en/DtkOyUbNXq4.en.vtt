Vest With Single Breasted Suits - 3 Piece

00:00:01.539 --> 00:00:02.539
Suits

Today, I'm going to be answering a reader's
question, "When should I wear a three-piece

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.420
suit?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.420
When is it appropriate?"

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
That's right.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.680
I spent many nights just crafting that up
for you.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.650
Okay, guys, this is the question that came
in.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.640
"Antonio, I like your fashion and style tips.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.220
As a freshman student, I've felt I've had
a lot of growing up to do, so now I'm just

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.760
starting to dress more mature.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.760
Thank you."

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.170
Well, you're welcome.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.190
"Just one question today, what situation would
call for a three-piece suit instead of just

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.720
trousers and a suit jacket?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.930
Cheers in advance.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.930
Mark."

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.620
All right, Mark, that's a good question and
it's one that we have to look a little bit

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.960
back on history.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.310
The quick answer is that there are very few
occasions nowadays in which you need to wear

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.310
a three-piece suit.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.090
In fact, I can't think of one except black
tie, in which technically it is a three-piece

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.110
because you should have a waist covering,
but besides that, black tie, white tie, but

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.909
with regular business attire, 99.9% of men
in the Western world use -- your two-piece

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.040
is going to be fine, but let me go ahead and
break this out for you.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.470
At the top of the formality echelon, we have
white tie, then we have black tie, then we

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.740
have business attire, then we have business
casual.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.390
Business casual, by the way guys, is a sports
jacket.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.810
I mean, this is business casual.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.810
I don't have a tie on.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.170
I've got a sports jacket on.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.540
I've actually got raw denim, a pocket square.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.010
This is true business casual, but there are
levels within that because there is business

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.259
casual for casual Fridays and I realized that
what I'm wearing here, a lot of guys would

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.329
actually consider more business wear, but
a suit I'm going to define as business wear.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.669
Let's go ahead and break that out.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.459
I've talked about four categories.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.499
We're going to focus on business wear because
this is where the double-breasted suit lies,

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.040
although you do see the double-breasted in
black tie as well, but we're not going to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.540
go that path.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.590
So within business wear, we've got double-breasted
as the most formal.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.230
We've got single-breasted.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.059
And then over on the other end are the more
casual business wear suits and these are going

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.769
to be in colors that are less than traditional.

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.720
Also, they've got maybe a few style features
that make them a less traditional suit.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.599
It would still be business wear because you're
wearing a suit, but because of that, it's

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.859
going to be more casual.

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.560
The single-breasted is what we see most men
are wearing nowadays.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.219
The double-breasted kind of lost its place
in World War II.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.620
It was just something that a lot of men stopped
wearing when they came back from the war.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.889
In addition, it used more fabric, so a lot
of factories stopped using it because of rationing.

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:19.329
But before World War II, there was a time
that the double breasted was purchased and

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.510
worn as much as the single-breasted, but the
double-breasted was considered more formal.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.659
So how could you take a single-breasted suit,
which like this that has the deep V, and a

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.260
double-breasted usually that buttons up like
this -- that small distinction actually made

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.139
the double breasted appear to be more formal,
more buttoned up.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.799
So how you could you take a single-breasted
suit and get more miles out of it and make

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.809
it appear to be more buttoned up?

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.599
You put it on the same level as the double-breasted.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.870
Introduce the vest.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.449
Now, the vest or waistcoat, whatever you want
to call it, it was originally used by messengers

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.449
who rode horses.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.439
It was something that you're outside all day
riding on a horse in the wind, in the weather,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.900
and you need extra layers, so vests were developed.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.790
They initially started off as big pieces of
cloth.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.099
They eventually became their own type of garment,
but it was meant to be worn under a jacket

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.220
and to add warmth.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.080
It eventually made its way into formal wear
after enough use in multiple wars.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.310
Men began to like it.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.049
They find that they could contrast the colors.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.500
It added a bit of style to the wardrobe without
having them to go out and purchase an entire

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.220
new suit.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760
Jackets were really expensive; vests, less
expensive.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.540
You saw that by wearing a similar colored
vest, you could actually get the same buttoned

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.100
up look as the double breasted suit.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.290
Thatâ€™s where I would say that if you want
to wear something that is about as formal

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.830
as you can get in business wear, then that's
when you could look at wearing a three-piece.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.660
A lot of lawyers put this to good use because
they realize that they're not going to go

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.340
in dressed in black tie like "My Cousin, Vinny",
a great movie.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.020
When the judge tells him, "Go get a suit,"
yeah, he looked for a suit that he ends up

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.230
wearing.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.620
A lot of lawyers realize that that small visual
makes them just look more sophisticated, makes

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.440
them look smarter, and they use that to their
advantage.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.340
There's a lot of interesting case studies
out there in law schools and they talk about

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.190
how even when you're choosing jurors and the
way you present yourself -- just look at someone

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.830
that is up for murder or is up for assault.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.330
Look at the way they dress.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.430
They're wearing a suit in that court room
when they're defending themselves.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.180
They're not usually wearing a three-piece,
but it is one of those things that give a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.840
lot of attorneys the chance to separate themselves.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.690
Okay, so let me step back.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.190
What situation calls for a three-piece in
today's society?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.180
Very few situations, but if you want to dress
to the nines, if you want to look as formal

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.000
as you can look without going into black tie,
that's when you can wear a three-piece if

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.120
you don't own a double-breasted jacket.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.430
Hopefully that answers the question.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.640
I wish you the best on your style journey.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.310
If you've got a question, you know where to
go, mensstyleqa.com, my new website.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.770
I'm really excited about it.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.130
I'm getting a lot of people going over there
asking good questions, getting good answers.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.250
Let me know what you guys think in the comments.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.250

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.251
Bye-bye.
