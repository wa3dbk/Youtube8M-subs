00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.410
Hey, how's it going? I'm Andrew and today we're gonna be taking a look on how to setup your skateboard

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.609
Let's take a look at some of the parts you're gonna need to set up your skateboard

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.550
I will actually use the Alien Workshop's skate parts pack

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.270
Which features some bolts here

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.920
It comes with the riser pads and a pair of Reflex Abec Seven Rob Dyrdek bearings

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.200
You will even got a reflex tool which you're gonna need to set the board up

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.060
And of course a razor blade to cut the grip tape

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.060
There's two pairs of trucks back here

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.440
Some grip tape

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.300
And my favorite part----this Alien Workshop deck

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.460
Now it's time to grip this bad boy

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.580
First things first, you need to remove your grip tape and get ready to lay it down

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.220
Remember when you're laying it down

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.680
You wanna hold the grip tape at a slight angle when you're pressing it down

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860
And start from one end and go to the other

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.700
Make sure you get all the air bubbles out

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.460
And the hardest part for me is actually getting it laid out, sit straight

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.900
So even if you've been doing this for a while, laying it down straight is the hardest part for some.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.160
All right. Let's do this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.800
Removing the grip tape, step one

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.440
And I like to keep the skateboard about level at the edge of the table as a reference point

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.720
[Background Music]

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
So remember when you're laying it down, you start from one end to the next

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.280
And let's lay it down

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.680
Kinda guess it out right there

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.060
[Background Music]

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.800
And remember grip tape is very sticky

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.160
So once it's down, it's staying down. Whoo~

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.400
Here we go

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.080
Remember to keep it angled

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.580
When you're laying it down. So...remember to keep in that angle

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.520
Pressing it down a little bit at a time getting all of the air bubbles out cause nobody likes air bubbles

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.549
Those aren't fun

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.860
[Background Music]

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.480
Tug as you go too, giving it that little bit of resistance on the other end

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:48.640
[Background Music]

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.000
Just working all the way across the other side

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
Kinda like a zen-like method. I'm actually at peace right now

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.140
Working on this skateboard

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.500
[Background Music]

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Keep in mind

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.600
Different people set up their skateboards different way. This is just a way that I like to go

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.180
Laying the grip tape down like this

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.420
[Background Music]

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.620
Emm...This is peaceful...relaxing

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.040
[Background Music]

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.120
Almost done

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.500
[Background Music]

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.860
Finito

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.120
There's the grip tape done. That's step one

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.120
And for the second part now, you're gonna be using a razor blade

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.380
So if you are young, remember you're gonna need adult supervision

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.240
So today I'll be having Mr. Amanda step in to be my adult, cause, safety first

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.819
So here's a quick tip for when you're cutting the grip tape with the razor

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.619
Remember to hold the razor at a slight angle right against the board while you're cutting

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.960
And that's gonna help for a clean cut

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.690
Remember to keep it at that angle

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.070
[Background Music]

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.900
All right. Now it's time to do some cutting

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.650
Let's make sure the razor comes up. Be careful. It is sharp

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.720
Remember to keep it at angle and press right against the board

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.980
And it's gonna just glide right along

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.700
Doesn't matter if it's perfect because we will be following it down for a nice clean look

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700
It's gonna go all the way round

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.600
[Background Music]

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.000
And check this out.  You get a cool

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.100
Skateboard silhouette as well. That's pretty awesome

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.600
All right, the next step is filing down the edges for the nice clean look

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.800
I don't have a metal file

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.200
But I'm gonna be using the excess grip tape which works just as good

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.800
[Grating sound]

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.500
Filing the edges is actually gonna help keep the grip to stay on longer and more secure

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
[Grating sound]

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.100
There you go. And nice smooth edges

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.300
Next step, mounting hardware which comes in the great Alien Workshop skate bag

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.700
Now when you're putting your bolts in, you wanna start on the opposite side

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.900
And puncture a hole through the other way

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.900
[Punching]

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.840
So you know our reference point for the other side for when you're putting your bolts through

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.940
[Punching]

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.480
Now we're gonna set the bad boys in. Just jiggle them in

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.380
And right through the grip tape

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.639
They've even thrown in a nice shining metal piece to let you know

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.960
which one's your nose or tail. I'm gonna actually put this in my nose.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.420
Not my literally nose -- my literal nose but nose to the skateboard

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.860
Silly gooses

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.300
Now that you've got your bolts in, it's time to lay down your riser pads and of course your trucks

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.820
And riser pads are optional. I'm actually gonna just throw them on this board

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.240
Just cuz they come with the Alien Workshop skate pack

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.460
Now we will lay these riser pads down

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.889
[Background Music] Make sure the big hole stay at --

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.630
Facing the opposite in here, either your nose side or your tail side

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.480
Get your trucks here. You wanna have the baseplate facing out

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.920
So the bushings's gonna be facing in

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.740
Laying it down push the bolts through

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.360
[Background Music]

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.080
And you gonna put these nuts on these bad boys and tighten them up

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.900
When you have your nuts on your bolts here, you gonna actually be tightening up. I'm gonna be using this awesome reflex tool

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.790
And a cool thing to remember when you're tightening up your nuts, you wanna make sure you go at an angle. So once you tighten this bad boy up

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.530
[Background Music]

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.430
Go directly across in an "X" kinda fashion

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.890
And tighten that way and that way you don't get any crazy curves

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.680
You're not gonna be wobbling around all crazy and it's gonna be giving you a nice secure fit as well

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.320
Now it's time to put these bad boy bearings right here

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.400
into these fifty-one millimeter Stefen Janoski Habitat wheels

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.360
And these are Rob Dyrdek Reflex Abec Seven bearings

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.280
So I'm gonna show you how to set them up

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.040
Now you've got your Abec Seven bearings which come as cool like medicine like packaging

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.860
I've never seen that before. It's pretty awesome

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.920
And you've got some additional washers as well and spacers

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.980
So we're gonna set them up in the wheel now

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.900
Now you gonna remove this nut here

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.479
And there should be washes already located on the tracks you gonna take one off and make sure one's on

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.539
I'm going to actually set one bearing in

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.979
Make sure the shield is facing the trucks like that

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.010
Let's put a spacer in here as well

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.190
You're gonna lay it on top

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.090
And here comes the tough part

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.760
You just gotta press down with your body weight which is gonna get that bearing in there

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.360
It's gonna give you that nice rolling ability right there

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.719
Same way on the other side. You just kinda...whoa whoa whoa whoa...

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.559
You gotta lay it in there. Press down on it as well

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.399
[Pressing]

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.180
And tighten your bearings into the wheel

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.640
Some people like the painting facing out actually when I first set my board like my board facing in

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.760
So I'm going to lay that on top right there, get that excess washer laid on top

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.340
and your going to use your nut, tighten it up for a nice secure fit.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.700
Because you don't want your wheel falling off. That usually ends up in bad news

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.090
Your tool is here and fasten her down

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:13.200
You don't want it too tight, you want to make sure this is a little room, not too much

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.520
Just a little bit of give

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:18.039
Alright, about there.  Perfect.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.979
Now you are ready to roll.  Once you have all four of the wheels on and the bearings on, you're ready to roll

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.440
But you can also accessorize the board with a few stickers

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.130
Make sure your bushings are tightened down the trucks for that custom ride

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.210
no matter if yor riding loose or tight and the best part about having a skateboard set up

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.970
is you get to go to skate. So I'll see you guys later!
