00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.569
comedian ricky gervais i did an interview
to the daily telegraph and he recently lost

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.070
a lot of weight he lost about forty two pounds
threatens a vast and you know widened did

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.309
you lose this weight ad did you lose it for
hollywood

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.470
and he can do to really better answer but
i was surprised by the company said he said

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.369
was in america i don't give a fuck what they
think and i don't if i don't get a film role

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.830
because of my teeth or cricket that fuck them

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.390
i don't want it prices go it's ridiculous

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.919
i think that i hate

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.870
that people think that i would

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.450
it makes me angry i remember when i was and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.110
and then one in newspapers said he lost three
stone for hollywood i wait no i haven't lost

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.560
the stone at would never fucking jerk for
hollywood

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.140
i did it cuz i wanna work out that i want
to be fit and that was me

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.410
idol of thoughts on this first of all pretty
calm down

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.550
saleable bureaucratese forgetting which party
hollywood parties affects ok used as a matter

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.710
of normal you know

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.310
okay and then just appearances that right

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.670
uh... there were three

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.590
he went hollywood and that's why he's a little
insecure about

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.020
and doing the wrong isle of refrigerator these
whole larry straight and this is funny too

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.980
i mean when he first came out he saw the first
picture use adobe looking guy he was a regular

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.670
slow and that's why everybody like that when
he was our et cetera an index rose it is a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.230
brilliant job of

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.930
per train the hollywood people stuck up in
his love the regular guys is that our etcetera

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.750
uh... but now if you look at him i mean big
losses ass up

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.020
now it looks like a stop and it was a shot
and i modified protective but it's not the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.229
cricket c

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.640
well so he claims that i don't know why i
did but the people you know

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.730
it didn't but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.850
so i think he's a little less secure with
that but the flip side is

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.140
if your job is to be an actor

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780
or comedian

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.790
that you should lose some weight okay you
dislike all how long do you write for during

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.940
the day if this is a writer to write the rights
of material at that how often do that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.600
yet he doesn't have a for you know sixty minutes
a day loose away which he did and it looks

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.010
better however one of the winner maybe just
come down effort funny because if someone

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.460
came up to me is that while you really want
hollywood and do it while really think you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.170
without that i think i laughed my ass up like
i love that you know yeah you're right because

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.819
look i i don't want to have a right

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.989
i when all they want when i have a little
bit it it licensed and i mean

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.509
another kind of swarthy sharin but larry

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:38.549
headshot right that hate you know one day
he just sat there you decided you know what

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.409
i mean it's time to go hollywood

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.459
aidid's it feels like they're accusing him
or he's afraid that people are accusing him

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.760
of like selling out one day she decides that
he's gonna untill until you start your better

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.769
for no reason

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.199
there was a need to go out and get a big hollywood
contract

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.989
is that what you wanted yeah i don't want
to go hollywood failed to act

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.000
of the anti-government ultimate fate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.770
the ricky discontinuity surface move-up okay
