&gt;&gt; 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.400
Jacquie Vaughn: We are at GeoWoodstock here
in Carnation and I'm here with probably four

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.289
to five thousand of my new friends.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:28.980
&gt;&gt; Geocacher #1: Pretty crowded in there already.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.720
&gt;&gt; J.P.: I placed our pin up here in B.C..
A lot of people from all over the United States

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.380
everywhere and then a lot of people in Europe
also. Some from, oh wow way down there, Australia

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.380
and China. That's pretty good.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.970
&gt;&gt; Tina: We came in from Nashville Tennesee.
We did kind of a road trip and then got up

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:54.100
here. Today we dropped off some trackballs,
some geocoins and we're just here to have

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.100
fun.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.230
&gt;&gt; Jenn Seva: You got to do whatever the trackable's
goal is and '...to be pictured with cachers

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
across the land. I especially like pictures
with Groundspeak Lackeys.' (laughing) Where

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.890
does the tag go?

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.570
&gt;&gt; Justin Dover: I think you broke it.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.390
&gt;&gt; Geocacher #4: I'm going to do the hard
section of the rock climbing.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.200
&gt;&gt; Rock Wall Assistant: OK ready? There you
go.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.789
&gt;&gt; Robert: My name is Robert and our team
name is Team Dragon Hunter. Originally I started

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.090
geocaching in Iraq and I brought it home for
the kids. Even the youngest ones have fun

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.479
with it.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.899
&gt;&gt; Jacquie: It's taken us probably 18 months
to put this together. Many hours of fundraising

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.240
went into doing this. It's unbelievable to
me, just a sea of people. They're all here

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.929
enjoying the same activity, sport, hobby whatever
you call it, that I do and we're just celebrating

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.009
having fun together.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.460
[Geocoin Poker cheering]

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.369
&gt;&gt; Geocacher #5: Everybody that's playing
puts in three coins. It's geocoin poker. Basically,

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.700
I just held on and held on, and got lucky.
Well, you get the whole set of coins that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.319
we played the last round with, then we get
to split up all these.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.190
&gt;&gt; Jacquie: We actually have log book here.
It is in jumbo size, because this is a jumbo

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.090
sized event. We have a very large walk-through
ammo can.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.260
[tractor]

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:35.150
&gt;&gt; Tina: I'm seeing lots and lots of people
and they're from everywhere which is cool.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.960
&gt;&gt; Kandy McWilliams: It's just a way to meet
all the people that you see once a year, or

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.480
people who want to say 'Hi I know your caches'
and that's the best part. You know I'm going

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.470
to say I am, (laugh) I am a big deal. I've
placed over 1,400 good caches!

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.441
&gt;&gt; J.P.: My daughter would not believe there's
this many crazy people that do this for fun

00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:55.480
you know. This is going to be proof.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.700
&gt;&gt; Jacquie: How often are you going to go
to an event that draws thousands of people?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.040
You got to do one, just to see what it's like.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.300
&gt;&gt; Robert: Tell them bye. Bye!

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.920
&gt;&gt; Jenn: Are we done?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.880
&gt;&gt; Kandy: Peace Baby!
