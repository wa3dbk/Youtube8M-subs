00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.090
- So the mission
of Harvard Business School

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.840
is to educate leaders and make
a difference in the world.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.600
We're living in a time
in which the digital revolution

5
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.720
is creating completely
new possibilities,

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000
and HBX is an opportunity
for us to see how

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.810
these new digital possibilities
can allow us

8
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.480
to expand on our mission.

9
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.750
- What HBX CORe is designed
to do is to introduce you

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.180
to business and
to really connect the dots

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
between your education
and the world of business.

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.420
- The faculty who have been
involved in developing CORe

13
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.720
are some of the best
faculty members

14
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.600
at Harvard Business School,
and they have taught

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510
extraordinarily, imaginatively
of how can we leverage

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.180
this platform to allow people
to develop not just a mastery

17
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600
of these concepts,
but a mastery in a way

18
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.540
that is very sensitive
to how these problems

19
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.630
present themselves in business,

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420
a real understanding
of the context in which

21
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.720
these concepts
would be valuable.

22
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.480
- We have faculty who have
worked with CORe support teams

23
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.750
to create dynamic,
engaging content.

24
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.390
They've worked directly
with technology

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.120
and development teams to design
a one-of-a-kind platform.

26
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.780
We have videographers
and animators

27
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.570
creating state-of-the-art media.

28
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.180
- The whole platform
is designed to create

29
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.450
an immersive, engaging,
interactive experience,

30
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.180
where in the end you
don't just learn concepts,

31
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.630
you learn how to apply them,
you learn how to see them

32
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.390
in context, you know how they
actually work in business.

33
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.030
- We are trying to reimagine
online education,

34
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.840
to make it energizing, engaging.

35
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.360
I still remember when I walked
into the Harvard Business School

36
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.510
classroom for the first time,
students were engaged

37
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.660
in tackling real-world problems.

38
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.120
They were actively listening,
they were participating.

39
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.630
That's the experience we hope
every single student has

40
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.450
with this program.
