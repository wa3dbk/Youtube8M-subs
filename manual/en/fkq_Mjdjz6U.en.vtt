00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.659
It's important to clean between your
teeth everyday before using your toothbrush

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:18.690
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.609
this help reduce the risk of gum disease
and decay

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.949
you should do this before bed everyday

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.460
Imagine cleaning cars and motorbikes parked next to each other

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.450
They're parked close together. You won't reach between them with just a toothbrush.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.310
Interdental cleaning helps you reach the
gaps

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.160
Spaces between teeth aren't the same size in everyone's mouths

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.920
So ask your dental health professional if interdental brushes are right for you and - if so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.050
what size and design to use.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.259
Brushing your teeth is boring!

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.000
It's easy skip cleaning between them

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.059
It takes time to get the technique right, so use
interdental brushes in front of a mirror

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.729
so you can see where you are cleaning

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.939
Without any toothpaste on, insert the
interdental brush into hard to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.700
reach places first, like between your back teeth

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.970
Pre-curve the brush around your finger to help reach

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.250
Move on to clean between the rest of your teeth

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.500
remembering not to miss any gaps

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
Go in-and-out once or twice making sure the brush goes all the way through the gap

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.620
just below where the teeth meet

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.280
and out the other side

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.260
Try not to force the brush into gaps

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.590
it should be a snug fit

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.720
Don't be aggressive and don't go more than twice

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.000
 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.970
 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.190
Every two teeth you clean

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.490
wash the interdental brush with water to remove the stuff that builds up on it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.100
then continue cleaning

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.970
Dispose of an interdental brush when it gets
bent or worn

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.960
After you've cleaned between every tooth. Spit out, press play on the Brush DJ app, and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.130
