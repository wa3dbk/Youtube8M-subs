00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.830
This episode of Tekzilla is brought to you
by GoToAssist Express.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.820
We received this question from Fredrick who
writes, "Video camcorders used to have a view

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.310
finder that you put your eye to. Nowadays
they have ditched that for a flip out screen.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
When holding the camcorder against your face,
you have the weigh close to the center axis

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.919
of your body and this helps stabilize the
camcorder.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.470
When you are forced to hold the camcorder
out in front of you, the hand movements get

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.400
bigger, image gets unstable and your arms
get tired. Any tips from you or your viewers

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.740
on how to hold a new camcorder?" - Frederick.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.083
So Frederick after reading your question,
we figured it would be the perfect time to

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:46.990
haul out the old camera mule we use at CES.
So Roger tell us about your methodology for

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.010
holding camcorders for a long time.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.060
Yes, as a camera mule for CES.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.110
As a camera mule.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.080
Well, it's interesting that Frederick mentions
the lack of view finders. Now, believe it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.600
or not, this is actually one of the nice to
have features that they have cut out mainly

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.690
for cost but also because the touch screen
offers so many more options especially when

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.509
it comes to focusing and accessing various
functions on your camera.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.540
Now when you have a camcorder this small,
the viewfinder isn't as cool as you would

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.810
think. In fact, oftentimes, they are a lot
poorer quality in terms of image as well as

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.990
information captured clean. In fact, the only
way you really use it is outdoors in sunlight.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.400
So, back to his question, camcorder this small
when you use it, like this, traditionally,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.911
this is actually not the most stable way to
hold a camcorder.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:39.911
Yeah.

00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:43.440
Mainly because you have one arm holding it
and you're doing this, even if you have it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.060
against your face, you're still going to introduce
motion into the camera through your wrist.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.340
Now as you can see, maybe for a minute it's
solid but after after a couple of minutes

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.190
you're going to start doing this and you're
going to get a little jitter in your image.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.073
Now, traditionally what we have done in the
field with camcorders is sounds so professional

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:02.570
when you say it that way.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.570
Well, this is...

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.570
In the field...

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.830
In the field of EAG...

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.930
...where they're following around CES.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.099
People buy really expensive rigs in order
to kind of hold it out a little further spend

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.630
upwards of four to five hundred bucks. I prefer
doing it the human way by turning yourself

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.000
into a tripod.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.360
Now, basically what you do is you take your
elbows and you pull them into your body. And,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.220
you used two hands when you control the camcorder
in this case so you can actually hold the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.970
body, or the base of the camera as well as
being able to access the rocker and the record

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.500
controls. Now, the thing about this is, let
me rotate to my side, when you start moving

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.270
you don't do this or this, you actually rotate
your entire torso from your waist and if you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.880
want to pitch up, you pitch up with your entire
torso, you don't do this.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.660
Now, this will allow you to gain more stability
because you're essentially turning your entire

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.420
your upper torso, into kind of a human tripod.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.420
Got you.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.690
Now, for situations situations where you're
trying to shoot long distance, if your camera

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.470
has image stabilization, that's a great function
to have. In fact, I would recommend anyone

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.621
who has it to turn it on. But if you can't
afford to do that, or say you're shooting

00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:17.440
a parade - those things last for hours, literally
for hours - I would say you invest in a tri-pod.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.849
Now, this is our manfrotto. This is kind of
one of the middle to upper tier tri-pods that

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.290
you can get. Now, one of the important things
to notice about it is the head is a fully

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.100
floating head, so if I need to, I can decouple
it right here. It has kind of a bowl shape,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.620
and I will be able to kind of swing it around
depending on what I need to shoot.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.820
Now the other important thing about this is
that I have a relatively fluid motion when

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.470
it comes to swinging. It's not jerky.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.470
Yeah.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.000
Now if you get some of the cheaper tri-pods
that people use for still cameras, as you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.041
rotate it, as you bind the plastic, it starts
doing this. Not what you want. What you want

00:03:55.041 --> 00:04:00.960
is a tri-pod that's stable at the same time
you can still move, depending on your situation.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.659
Now, if you're in a situation where, say,
you're at a party or say you're trying to

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.470
get a bunch of people on the street and you
still want to be able to get a stable shot

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.180
but you're moving from place to place, you
want to get a mono pod.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.912
You know, I've actually seen those being used
frequently at conferences where people are...

00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:20.120
Yes. ...sitting and watching a presentation
of some kind. They just put it on a mono pod.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
Yes.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.340
Then they're holding it so there is not a
lot of range up and down because the person

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.620
is basically on the same plane the whole time.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.430
Yes. And essentially it's the same thing because
what I've done is I've basically taken the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.470
weight off my arm and I'm putting it on the
mono pod. And this allows me to to kind of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.889
tighten up on a shot. And so I'm going to
hold it from the top instead of holding it

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.400
down here. You want to hold it toward the
top where the camera is so you get the most

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.000
leverage as well as most stability.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.120
And when you're ready to move, you can keep
recording, just up and move it when you need

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.990
to. Now it's really important to understand
what you're shooting before you do any of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.180
this, because oftentimes you go into a situation
where it's like, "Oh, you know, I will whip

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.440
out my camera and start shooting." And in
my last a couple of jobs ago, this is something

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440
really annoying.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.070
They would just take out the camera and they
would do this. This is the worst thing you

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.561
can do with a camera is doing this. "Oh look,
look, I got your face." No, what you want

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:20.139
to do is plan and, if you need to, physically
move up to the person and, again, use technique

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.830
where your arms are pulled into your body
and you're rotating and shifting with your

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.889
entire torso.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.010
If you need to follow someone, say, like in
a race, what you want to do is anticipate

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.520
where they're going to end up, keep your body
pointed there, and then first lead and that

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.449
way your body kind of acts like a bungy cord
and it will kind of automatically pull you

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.350
through it.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.840
Gotcha. I also like the mono pods because
they are very compact.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.180
They are. In fact, I use it every time I go
to Comic-Con.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.280
Nice. Very cool. All right, well, thank you
so much, Roger.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280
Sure.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.240
These relatively expensive, these models,
but are there cheaper versions people can

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240
get?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.090
Yes. So, you can get a Vanguard mono pod,
and I put that up off Amazon for $33.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.090
Oh, that's not bad at all.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.900
And you can get a pretty good solid tri-pod.
Now this is pretty heavy duty for most people,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.210
but you can get a pretty solid tri-pod for
about sixty or seventy bucks.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.389
I'm sure you could probably whip up a pretty
good monopod with some stuff around the house

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:10.389
too, if you really need to.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.640
You can, but you know what, some...in those
situations where you really want something

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.600
light and as well as sturdy, you know, thirty
bucks isn't actually much to ask. Not so bad.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.139
Alright, there is more Tekzilla coming right
up but before we do that, it's time to thank

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.110
one of our sponsors.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.560
Are you working in IT? Well, you know what,
if you don't have the best tools, it's like

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.910
being a surgeon without access to the best
medical equipment. Rusty scalpels make for

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.490
bad surgery, bad IT tools make well everything
more difficult for everyone involved. Clients

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.850
get unhappy; your life gets miserable.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.949
