$60 EBay Video Monopod Review
Hey everyone today I’m gonna do a review

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:03.479
on this.

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:09.920
It’s a video monopod that I bought off Amazon
for about $60 as you can see it’s got retractable

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.350
feet right here and it is a bargain for the
price, so let’s take a look at it and see

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.420
how it goes.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.060
Okay let’s take a look at this video monopod,
now it extends all the way to 166 centimetres

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.650
which is really quite high for a portable
monopod like this.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.870
You also have to remember that the feet that
are used on this monopod will also give you

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.560
about 10 centimetres extra high which is quite
a lot.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.790
The monopod itself goes down to 60 centimetres
which is perfectly fine for if you want to

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.790
travel.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.500
It might be a little too big if you’re going
to carry thin in your carry on luggage on

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.100
a flight but I found that their size not be
an issue.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.710
I also use a Velbon monopod which is much
smaller and lighter but unfortunately it doesn’t

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.030
have the video monopod feet.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320
Now the monopod has a 15 kilogram maximum
load which is huge you know, you’re not

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.220
gonna have many problems loading up your camera
with your gear on it.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.490
It’s got a quarter inch and 3 inch thread
which is really good that they’ve put that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.220
on because you know everyone has different
kind of video head that they might want to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
put on, maybe you’ve got a lightweight head,
or you’ve got a solid head that might take

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.880
a lighter adapter.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.450
Another cool thing with this monopod is that
it comes with a bag, you know it’s just

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.020
the little things that kinda make a bit of
a difference, but it’s nice to have a bag

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.810
that you can carry this around with because
it not only makes it easier to travel with

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.060
but it also keeps the scratches and that off
your equipment and off this monopod.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.640
Now one of the pretty big things that I wanted
to know when I bought this monopod was whether

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.659
or not I could lock out this monopod so it
couldn’t really move and you could use this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.950
without your hands.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.050
Now it does have a locking knot as you can
see here but unfortunately it doesn’t really

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.240
lock that well.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.690
In theory you could actually use this to have
a hands free monopod but you wouldn’t really

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
want to be leaving it in the wind because
it would get knocked over easily.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.550
Now this monopod uses the twist lock system
which is really really nice because you can

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.600
get the monopod up and down super fast and
the locks actually seem pretty solid so I’m

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.920
happy with that.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.890
Okay this is the shot with the monopod on
and as you can tell it is pretty rock solid,

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.970
I’m just holding it by the handle and you
can tell there is not much movement, it’s

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.700
almost like it’s locked off on the tripod
which is really good.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.810
I’ll just try a quick pan here.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.540
It’s not as good as the tripod but it is
pretty good and the extra feet they make a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.540
big difference.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.660
Okay so this is a test without the monopod
as you can see, it’s a little bit shaky

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.239
and the earlier images were a bit better and
as you can see right here the monopod does

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.030
actually stand up on its own quite well but
once you put a camera on top it does get a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.890
bit weighted so it does tend to tip over so
you wouldn’t be leaving it on its own.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.430
Okay that was my review of this $60 monopod
that you can get off EBay.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.450
Like I said in the review I really do like
this monopod I think it’s got a lot of good

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.720
features and if you compare it to something
like the Manfrotto or Benro video monopods

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.739
you’re getting pretty much the exact same
features for about five times less.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.090
Maybe it’s not as solidly built as those
but I’ve used it pretty heavily for the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.319
last few months and I’ve got to say that
I’m very very happy with it and I highly

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.440
recommend it.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.270
Now if you liked this video I would love it
if you subscribe because I’m gonna be doing

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.950
a lot more reviews on these kinda things in
the upcoming weeks and if you did also like

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.890
it hit the like button because it makes a
big difference.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.010
Alright guys, see you in the next video, bye.
