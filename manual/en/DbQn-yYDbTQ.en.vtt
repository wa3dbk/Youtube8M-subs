00:00:16.694 --> 00:00:17.610
Hi, how are you doing?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.552
It's Russell.

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.010
In this video I'm
going to show you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.005
how to make an
Asian chopped salad.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.180
And we're going to have a
little bit of fun with it.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.870
And you should only
really watch this video

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.090
if you want to get a new
piece of kitchen equipment.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.430
And I'm kind of only
joking, but not really.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.400
It's one of these.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.400
You may have seen this before.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.399
You may have seen how
people use them, and maybe

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.125
just thought they
were used for herbs.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.520
But actually, we're going to
make an Asian chopped salad

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.020
with this.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.340
It's going to be really quick.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.865
It's going to give
a different cut

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.490
to what you're used
to with your knife.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.920
It's going to be a bit
more fun, and just going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.870
to be very quick.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.930
So it's the type of stuff we
do in our Weekday Raw course.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.390
So we've got a kind of spring
themed Asian chopped salad

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.890
here.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.098
You can see we've got these
amazing fresh ingredients

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:57.060
in front of us.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.190
And we're aiming really to have
this be for one to two people.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.962
So we've got some Chinese
Leaf, or Napa, cabbage.

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.420
And what we're going to do is
just start building this up--

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.360
laying this out on a nice sized
chopping board in front of us.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.310
With a view to to-- as I say--
feeding one to two people.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.240
So I'll probably just
do this for one person,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.220
just to demonstrate this.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.590
Maybe just take it down
to a couple of leaves.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.509
Two or three leaves.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.050
And then the rest
of the stuff, we're

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.430
going to do-- before we get it
on there, just a rough chop.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.370
So same with the carrot.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.540
We'll just do kind of quarter.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.910
And a rough chop.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.250
Sprinkle that in there.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.100
Then we've got this
beautiful organic cucumber.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.890
On top there.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.624
A few cashews.

00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:56.921
So we've a quarter of a
cup of cashews in there.

00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:58.170
And that's between two people.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.378
So you know, just a couple
of tablespoons of cashews.

00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:01.580
Not too much at all.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
Then we've got some
beautiful fresh mint.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.570
And we'll just take the
big stalks off of those.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.070
But the rest can
just go in as it is.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.416
And same with the
coriander, or cilantro.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.332
You can actually just
go in with all of those.

00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:18.970
Unless there's really
huge stalks on there,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.820
just pop it all in.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.840
It's already looking really
cool on the board as it is.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.520
Some mangetout, or snow
peas, you might know them as.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.377
Some red cabbage.

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:30.960
A few of these big
red cabbage leaves.

00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:34.850
And this builds
up really quickly.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.683
So I start off with the
intention of it just

00:02:36.683 --> 00:02:38.730
being for one
person, but it really

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.530
does-- it builds up quickly.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.676
And you can see these beautiful
colors coming together.

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:45.050
And then I'm just
literally going

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.090
to tear off some
broccoli florets.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.730
Maybe just cut that
bigger one in two.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.230
So really, really quick.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.370
Lots of fun.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.880
Let's put this
knife to the side.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.338
And then you're
going to come over,

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:02.670
and initially you're
just chopping down.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.862
Still going from left to
right, or right to left.

00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:06.320
Depending on what
you find easiest.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.235
And then gathering it
up again if you need to.

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:14.943
And when it gets down
to a certain point,

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:16.696
you'll be able to do
this kind of thing.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.720
And I got this idea
from a friend of mine

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.985
who mentioned-- you'll
loose a couple of bits

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.276
on the floor in the process,
but don't worry about it--

00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:27.710
a friend of mine who mentioned
there's a salad bar in the US.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.891
I think they've got a
branch in Washington DC.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:33.390
And one in Dallas,
I think, as well.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.704
It's called Chopped.

00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:36.620
And you go in there and
you choose your salad.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.040
And they just get
all your salad bowl,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.639
tip it out onto a
board like this,

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.055
and chop it right
in front of you.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.837
And you choose your dressing.

00:03:44.837 --> 00:03:47.170
I think they use really good
ingredients there, as well.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.786
So check them out if
you're ever in the area.

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:57.335
And you've just got this
amazing variety of cuts.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.430
And colors.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.530
And chunkiness.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.530
And lots of smaller bits.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.059
Not something to get the
kids involved in though.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.100
Normally when something's
fun like this I'll say,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.016
get the kids involved.

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:14.520
But these knives are
ridiculously sharp.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.340
So, I think we're
just about done.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.779
I mean, it just looks amazing
with all those colors.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.903
It makes me kind of just
want to take a photo of it

00:04:22.903 --> 00:04:25.290
right on the board now.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.564
But I'm going to
get it into a bowl,

00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:28.730
and get some dressing on it.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.810
Put that to one side.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.480
Just gather up your salad.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.560
The smell-- the smell from
the coriander, cilantro,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.070
and the mint-- we put quite
a bit of mint in there.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.140
It's just coming
through beautifully.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.454
OK, so then if you
look on your recipe--

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:56.370
either you'll see the
recipe below this video,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.745
or a link to the recipe--
take your dressing

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:10.920
which is essentially dates,
orange juice, garlic,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.320
ginger, olive oil, and put
some chili powder in there.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.634
If you've got some harissa--
I put some harissa powder

00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:19.050
in here, which is
a mix of spices.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.840
You can look that up online.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.310
Beautiful sweet, spicy dressing.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.660
You can add just a
touch of sesame oil

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.960
if you wanted to, as well.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.820
We've got salt in there as well.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.772
So this should be
seasoned up nicely.

00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:37.105
But of course we're going to
do that final-- as I always

00:05:37.105 --> 00:05:39.610
say-- that final
test for seasoning,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.140
once we've covered
everything in dressing.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.890
And how much dressing
you put on is really

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.730
going to be a personal
preference, you know.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.430
I actually like quite
a lot of dressing.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.564
So maybe just a little bit more.

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:53.500
I'm getting
everything messy now.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.041
I've got salad on my hands, I've
got salad on the Vitamix jug

00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:56.880
handle.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.580
It's OK.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.420
You can just put all
those words to one side.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.920
I like to work neat and tidy,
but when I'm making this salad

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.196
it just all goes out the window.

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:08.080
And here we can see we've got
just these amazing textures.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.510
We've got pieces of almost
whole cashew in there.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.170
It's going to be
an amazing crunch.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.402
We've got the sweetness.

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:19.200
And hopefully we've got the
saltiness seasoning just

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.240
right as well.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.815
So let's have a little taste
and see where we're at.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.040
It tastes really good.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.220
I'm going to put just a little
bit more seasoning on there.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.640
I'm going to re-put
my fork back in there

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.670
because this is only for me.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.310
So there's no double
dipping for anyone else.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.728
Mix that up and try it again.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.206
Mmm, yeah.

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:57.692
So good.

00:06:57.692 --> 00:07:00.190
Absolutely fantastic.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.938
Just the right mix of
salty, sweet, and spicy.

00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:06.396
A little bit of fat in there
as well, to carry the flavors.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.030
So that's a really quick, easy,
good looking, and definitely

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.770
tasty salad that
you can whip up.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.280
With your new kitchen tool,
should you decide to go for it.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.731
There you go.

00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:26.474
Enjoy.
