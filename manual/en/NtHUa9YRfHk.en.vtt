00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.389
It's important to understand that all surgical procedures come with some risk.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.289
Let's ask Dr. Drake to explain the
risk of a tummy tuck procedure, and discuss

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.559
the importance of choosing a properly
trained plastic surgeon

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.039
to help minimize those risks. The risks are actually low with a tummy tuck procedure.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.659
With all surgical, they do

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.859
carry a risk.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.469
The things that we are most concerned
about our clots in the veins and on a

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.490
rare occasion that can lead to some
problems requiring hospitalization.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.600
Bleeding, infection

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.570
are usually lower rates of risk in a tummy tuck procedure. The ASPS

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.860
surgeon I think is uniquely
qualified

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.360
to handle the tummy tuck procedure

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
in that we do a wide
range of all cosmetic and reconstructive

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.730
procedures.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.120
So that any complication that may arise for any apparency at the time of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.950
surgery can be easily handled.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.400
My

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.500
surgeon

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.280
was an artist.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.500
There were questions that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.820
I read online, there were questions in
the pamphlet that I was given

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.740
that asked

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.729
"Are you prepared to live with a scar

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.420
that you will have for the rest of your life?"

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.060
The scar that I have

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.460
is from one hip to the other hip.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.750
Considering how my body looked before

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.840
with the excess skin, the e

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.790
excess wrinkling of the skin

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.650
verses having a scare that only one person will ever see,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.200
that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.940
according to my doctor and according to
the pictures that I have seen online

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.000
could easily

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.310
be hidden with

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.720
a bikini

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.539
or

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.400
bikini underwear

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.110
or whatever

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.710
type of bottoms that I chose to wear, be it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.460
underwear or swimsuit

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.920
that completely would be camouflaged,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.619
was well worth it.
