00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.640
Mars: the fourth plant from the sun, is the
second smallest planet in the solar system,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.769
larger only than Mercury. Mars, as one of
the five planets visible to the unaided eye,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.989
has been known to astronomers since ancient
times: it was first recorded by ancient Egyptian

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.560
astronomers about 4,000 years ago.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.769
Mars is often called the Red Planet, because
of its reddish color. Modern astronomers know

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.160
that Mars is red because of large amounts
of iron oxide, or rust, in the rocks and dust

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.050
on the surface, but in ancient times people
associated its red color with warfare. That

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.150
is why Mars was named for the ancient Roman
god of War.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.040
Mars is a small, rocky planet, the last of
the planets of the inner solar system. It

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.900
is about 141 million miles, or more than 227
million kilometers from the sun, so it gets

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.610
less than half as much sunlight as the earth
does. Temperatures at the frozen poles may

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.450
dip as low as negative 225 degrees Fahrenheit
or negative 143 degrees celcius, but at the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.320
equator it may get as warm as 95 degrees fahrenheit
or 35 degrees celcius. One reason that Mars

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.740
has such different temperatures is that while
it has an atmosphere - made mostly of carbon

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.130
dioxide, with tiny amounts of oxygen - it
is very thin, preventing it from holding onto

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.290
much energy from the Sun.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.500
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Compare
to Mars, or even our own moon, they are very,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.670
very small: Phobos, the larger of the two,
is only 14 miles, or 22 kilometers, across

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.580
at its widest point, which means you could
set it down inside Rhode Island and still

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.740
have plenty of room to add Deimos. Because
they are so small, they don't have enough

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.830
gravity to pull themselves into spheres, and
so Phobos and Deimos are lumpy and irregular.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.250
Scientists believe that they may be stray
asteroids captured by Mars' larger gravity

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.290
at some point in the past.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.310
Something interesting about Mars is that it
is home to the highest known mountain in the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.580
Solar System - Olympus Mons! Olympus Mons
is more than three times higher than the tallest

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.720
mountain on Earth, Mount Everest. It's so
tall that it nearly reaches the top of Mars'

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.819
thin atmosphere.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.880
There is no liquid water on Mars, but there
are two polar ice caps made of large amounts

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.650
of frozen water, and sometimes there are even
clouds made of water vapor, much like on Earth.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.190
A day on Mars is very close to the same length
as a day on Earth, too. Mars rotates in 24

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.530
hours and 37 minutes, only about 2.7% longer
than an Earth day. Because Mars is farther

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.410
from the sun, however, Mars takes much longer
to travel once around the sun than Earth does,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.319
almost 687 days.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.430
Because Mars is so close to the Earth and
is so similar in some ways, people have wondered

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.890
for a very long time if life could survive
there - or if something lived on Mars already.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.459
Back in 1877, astonomers thought they saw
canals on the surface of Mars in long, straight

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.640
lines. If there were canals, they thought,
someone must have made them. People wrote

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.090
books and stories about aliens from Mars,
and they called them 'Martians.'

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.289
Modern astronomers have not found any signs
that anyone or anything has ever lived on

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:30.120
Mars. If there was ever life on Mars, it was
probably only small, simple kinds of life,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.449
like bacteria. Now people wonder if Mars could
be made into a good place for humans to live.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.809
More than 50 space missions have been sent
to or close to Mars to gather more information

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.069
about this fascinating red planet.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.669
There are currently five orbiters circling
Mars, and two rovers exploring its surface,

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:03.460
all sending data back to Earth. People want
to try to go to Mars someday, and it may happen

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.839
in the next few decades. Until then, there
is always more to learn about this exciting

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.330
planet.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.149
I hope you enjoyed learning more about Mars
today. Goodbye till next time!
