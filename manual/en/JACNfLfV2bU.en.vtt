00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.309
Alright, today we are going to review part
number AM3400 from Andersen Manufacturing.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.760
This is their rapid hitch.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.870
What we have here is an adjustable ball mount
that is constructed entirely out of aluminum

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.920
alloy.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.320
And the hitch ball assembly itself is actually
constructed of chrome plated steel.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.289
It does come with two locking pins, one for
the hitch ball assembly and also one for the

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.369
hitch itself.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.970
Alright, let us go ahead and take a closer
look at the rapid hitch.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.390
We have the rapid hitch installed in the hitch
. Let us go ahead and take it out.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.929
We have our locking pin here, it comes with
a barrel key.

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.159
And then with a 1/4 turn it comes apart.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.949
Go ahead and take it out.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.590
Alright, and you can see here the shank is
constructed of the aluminum alloy and also

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.590
has two hitch pin holes.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.309
It will give you room between different hitch
and bumper combinations.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.809
Okay, let us go ahead and reinstall it and
move on.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.420
0:58
As shown right now, the rapid hitch is in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.270
the rise position.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.900
We can easily take it out, flip it over and
use it in the position.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.490
Then reinstall our hitch pin.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.310
Alright, next we will move on to the hitch
ball assembly.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.050
Again, it uses a locking pin, same key as
before.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.660
Take out our hitch pin and we can move it
up and down.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.860
You can take it off either way.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.570
And then while we have it off, if we need
to, we can flip over the ball mount assembly

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:54.810
because right now we have our 2-5/16, we can
switch it over to the 2 inch ball.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.860
And then reinstall our pin and our lock.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.970
The rapid hitch has 7-1/2 inches of total
travel which will give you 3-3/4 inches of

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:57.560
or rise, depending on how you use it.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:49.769
