Hi I’m Peg from Sony and I’m here to show
you how to troubleshoot your Sony WALKMAN

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.429
that is not functioning properly appears to
be frozen or does not turn on or off

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.130
Each WALKMAN is slightly different so be sure
to check the owner’s manual or visit us

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.769
at esupport.sony.com for your specific features
and menu options

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.039
So let's get sarted

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.750
First turn on the WALKMAN by pressing the
play button

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.070
If the word HOLD flashes in yellow at the
top of the screen locate the HOLD button on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.200
the right edge of the device and slide it
to turn it off

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.930
If your Walkman is not on hold and it still
will not respond we recommend that you charge

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.430
it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.850
Plug your Walkman into a USB port on your
computer

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.129
Sometimes when the battery is completely discharged
it can take up to five minutes for it to respond

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.720
to the computer

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.880
Make sure your computer does not go into sleep
or into hibernate mode

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.190
Allow approximately five minutes for the Walkman
to receive a base charge

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.800
The battery icon should be active as the Walkman
charges

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.130
When it is fully charged the status will change
to FULL

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.520
If you Walkman has a charge and is still not
operating correctly or is not recognized by

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.750
the computer

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.740
You can try a few more tricks

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.360
Make sure you are not using a usb hub

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.030
Try a different USB port

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.450
Or you can also try a different USB cord

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.110
If none of these options corrects the situation
you can try a reset

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.720
A soft reset procedure will close all open
or running applications and services and then

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.369
restart the WALKMAN

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.330
No data is erased and no applications are
removed

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.680
Take a small paperclip and locate the reset
slot

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.000
Insert the paperclip and press gently

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.590
You will see the Walkman restart

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.360
Your Walkman should now be responsive
Once the reset is complete we recommend you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.690
fully charge the battery

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.350

after the reset you can visit our esupport.sony.com
