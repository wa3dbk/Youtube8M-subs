Hey everyone Aquaman here with Water Wisdom,
sponsored by WaterFilters.NET. Today’s product

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:15.990
is the Doulton W9331032, Countertop filter
system. Now, those of you that have been looking

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.760
for a countertop system, you may be discouraged
because there’s a lot of units out there

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.119
available for that application but many of
them are well, to be kind, less than wonderful

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.119
quality. That is not going to be a problem
with the Doulton product that I have in front

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.100
of me here today. Doulton’s a company that’s
been around over fifty years and they make

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.720
really high quality equipment. It’s made
from 100% BPA free, non leeching plastic.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.610
The entire system is NSF standard 42 certified,
that’s for materials, and also the more

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.540
stringent NSF standard 53, which, uh, relates
to health related claims because the system

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.410
claims to remove microorganisms, heavy metal,
VOC’s, pesticides, herbicides, and a very

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.549
long list of contaminants. For all the details
check out the product specific page at www.WaterFiliters.NET

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:22.579
for the W9331032. So, this unit attaches to
your faucet using this diverter valve, which

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.819
is then turned on and off to supply water
to the system and then the water obviously

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.779
comes out of this spigot to supply whatever
you are filling. Um, faucets vary, dramatically;

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:40.259
there was a day when all faucets had the same
type and size of threads, uh, that doesn’t

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.789
happen anymore. There are many different thread
types on faucets, so they send these adapters

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.849
with but it’s not a 100% mortal lock that
you are going to get the right adapter with

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.289
the system that fits. There’s a good chance
of it but there’s a slim chance you have

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.020
to purchase a separate adapter for your faucet
to attach to this diverter valve. So, be prepared

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.250
for that, just in case that happens. This
is the cartridge that goes inside of the system.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.590
This is an UltraCarb ceramic cartridge. It’s
a three stage filter. The outer layer is a

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:27.610
ceramic, a very tight porosity, .02 microns
ceramic. It’s also silver impregnated, silver

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.500
is antibacterial, and so bacteria and microorganisms
cannot live and grow on this media. The nice

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.440
thing about ceramic is that it’s washable.
Periodically you can remove the filter and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.960
take a green Scotchbrite and clean it off
and rinse it underwater, clean it off and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.380
put it back in and use it further.
The second stage of filtration inside the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.050
ceramic is a little layer of activated carbon,
now carbon removes a variety of contaminants

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.620
and also makes your water taste great. And
then in the center of all of that is a layer

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.370
of de-ionizing resin, and that’s going to
remove the heavy metals and some of the more

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.900
high level contaminants that are not captured
by the ceramic or the carbon. But what you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.750
are looking at here is an extremely high quality,
very, very good filter. I dare you to find

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.090
a countertop system that removes as many contaminants
without going to a reverse osmosis system,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.770
and the problem with RO systems for countertops
are many; they’re big, they’re bulky,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.390
and it’s a much more complicated form of
filtration. It’s necessary in some situations

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.781
but if you don’t have to go there, this
system is going to remove nearly as many contaminants.

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:49.212
It’s a very high end filter system.
So I want to install this filter for you and

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:54.050
show you just how easy this is, it’s really
nothing to it. Remove the sump, you can see

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.760
the o ring here and then the cartridge itself
has threads and an o ring that screw into

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.830
the base. Just very quickly attach the filter
and you don’t want to over tighten it. And

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:20.489
I can feel the O ring squeaking there and
then the sump and hand tight only and we’re

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.830
in business. Connect it to the faucet, turn
the diverter valve on or off and send water

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:36.699
through the system for extremely pure and
very good tasting water. The Doulton W9331032

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.449
is an excellent countertop system for the
money and I would highly recommend you check

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.610
it out and get one at WaterFilters.NET, if
you are looking for a countertop system. I’m

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.500
your host Aquaman and thanks for watching.
