00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.160
This ambitious action film directed by Justin
Lin poured gasoline on a fire, and brought

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.260
the "Fast" franchise back in a big way.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.880
Released on April 29, 2011 - this sequel deliberately
departed from the series' street racing theme

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.790
in favor of a wider focus on heists and action.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.259
The go-for-broke decision absolutely paid
off, to the tune of half a billion in profit

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.000
above the film's $125 million dollar budget.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.540
On the run from the law following their exploits
at the end of the last picture, Vin Diesel

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.750
and Paul Walker reunite their old crew for
one massive score to help buy their freedom,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.750
once and for all.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.609
This is Vin and Paul's first picture together
as allies from the beginning, and their loyalty

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.280
and love for one another is the real heart
of this picture; both men are at top form.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.199
Hot on their trail is newcomer Dwayne Johnson
as a hard-ass, beefed-up DSS agent: who provides

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.219
a fantastic and necessary threat sorely lacking
from previous entries.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.129
Injecting the series with a huge shot of gravitas,
he's like a less tactful version of Tommy

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.780
Lee Jones in "The Fugitive", but on steroids.Briefing
his team on their marching orders, "The Rock"

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.150
barks, "We find 'em we take 'em as a team
and we bring 'em back.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.530
And above all else we don't ever, ever let
them get into cars."

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.400
Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges,
Matt Schulze, Gal Gadot and Sung Kang all

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.270
return as well: and despite the size of this
talented ensemble, each player is given their

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.820
own individual moment and responsibility to
really make their own.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.490
Reintegrating the sidekick characters from
the lesser respected second and third films

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.289
really helps tie the franchise together, without
having to devote any of the already lengthy

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.539
130-minute runtime to their backstory.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.710
While these former street racers might not
be the most convincing gang to pull off such

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.729
an elaborate heist, it's damn fun to watch
their trial-and-error process as they put

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.109
their plan into motion.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.870
An excellent scene early has our foolishly
brave heroes hijacking exotic cars from a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.289
speeding locomotive in what is easily the
greatest train robbery since well, "The Great

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.289
Train Robbery".

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.950
The explosive stunt that caps off this opening
set-piece is a wonderful example of big-budget

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:07.159
action 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:31.190
done right.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.300
The film's transition away from focusing on
racing is perhaps most evident when an important

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.340
pink slip race is hyped-up before immediately
cutting to Diesel already returning in his

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.800
new car, omitting the duel entirely.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.760
The undisputed highlight of the picture, and
perhaps the entire "Fast" series itself, is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.629
the climatic heist of $100 million cash: which
sees Diesel and Walker dragging a massive

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.370
vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro
in their tricked-out Dodge Chargers.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.569
Besides being awesomely unique and furiously
fun, most of the driving and stuntwork here

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.890
was accomplished with practical effects and
actual drivers: making the crashes and explosions

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.090
way more convincing.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.879
The incredible chase is scored with intense
music from returning composer Brian Tyler,

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.019
which is mixed with plenty of loud tire screeches
and gun shots.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.690
As unbelievable as most of this mayhem is,
the characters themselves are, amusingly,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.810
just as incredulous.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.239
A tightly-crafted production that mixes in
just the right amount of wide shots during

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.260
the faster scenes, while letting steadier
shots dominate the dramatic portions.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.630
Almost half an hour longer than previous films,
the PG-13 rated adventure tends to drag in

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.970
the middle: but the endearing characters,
thrilling action, epic fist fights, and inventive

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.110
stunts more than make up for it.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.950
A hugely enjoyably, and endlessly watchable
experience, "Fast Five" is pure, unadulterated

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.449
entertainment, I thought it was AMAZING.
