Hi guys, welcome back. We posting videos again and

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:24.500
presenting our new sponsor, GearBest!!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Thank you GearBest for the present, this nice spotting scope.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.320
But this video is about this Multirotor!

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.960
Those who watch our videos note we use aerial footage some times.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.140
This one is a great option for those want to start playing with this flying toys.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.380
Obviously this is not a professional equipment.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.960
but allow you to know, spending few dollars if you want the next step.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.540
Syma X5C it is a complete kit to start flying a multirotor. You have all you need in one package.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.340
This model is very light, VERY VERY LIGHT!! Scared me a bit how light it is.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.500
When you look it, isn´t so small and you expect a corresponding weight. Surprise!

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.960
For this reason I was wondering how it will fly outdoor in wind conditions. Pff, flies perfectly.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.880
As I said before it is a complete set. Come with propellers protection , radio,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.440
You probably already saw it, come with HD camera (2 Gb mini-sd card included),

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.720
Full set of spare propellers, after all if you are a newbie fatally you will break some.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.680
Battery charger (Usb),

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.920
Mini Sd card reader,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
2.4 Ghz Radio

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.660
Ps. you take photos and switch recording on/off by the radio.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.260
The HD camera also take snapshots.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.980
The battery is placed in a internal slot just above the camera.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400
Let´s take a look in the instructions manual.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:43.040
Manual in English, simple but absolutly complete. All you need you will find in this manual. Very very nice manual.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:54.880
I´m showing just a few pages. You find assembly, maintenance, operational instructions, well.. everything.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.900
Let´s start some tests??

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.880
The default equimpment (protections, and landing gear) has 109 g or 1682 grains or 3.84 oz.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.480
Start hovering. Will keep 1 meter from the ground.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.800
From take off to landing we have 7 min and 17 sec with this setup.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.080
But.. after you got some experience and stop crashing all the time, you can remove the landing gear and the protections.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.880
Doing that you reduce 17 grams the total weight.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.720
and with 17 grams less the flying time is this:

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.680
1 min more flying.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:05.440
TIP: full battery charge spends more than 1 hour, so if you going to buy, add 1 or 2 extra batteries.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.660
Well, manual is good so I will not talk about how it works, let´s see how it flies.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.440
This model has a extreme smooth flying, it is easy to control, a fantastic choice for begginers.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.800
Is it able to loop or flip? Let´s check it out!!

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:24.520
If you keep pressed this right button here and move the right stick up, down, right or left .. he loops or flips.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:46.760
I could talk more 10 or 15 min about this guy but I don´t want a much longer video.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.080
I finish this video telling you this. Want a inexpensive and excelent flying toy. Buy it!!

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.280
