Who has been to a moonlight cinema before?
Watching a movie under the stars is Pretty

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.299
Romantic right. Well In this week's video,
I'll be showing you 2 ways of capturing

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.400
the cinemagic on your nails.
I alternated the design with an open curtain

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.119
and a closed curtain version. If you like
this Design please rate and favourite this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.990
video. As always, start with base coat and
base color and let it completely dry before

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.110
moving on.
This next step is completely optional but

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.500
if you want to achieve super straight lines,
you can give this method a try, instead of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.010
using the striper brush and adding them in
freehand. So we're going to use some striping

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.149
tape and cut them into smaller sections. Get
a few strips ready before applying them onto

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.629
the nail. Using a finger to help hold down
the tape, make any adjustments if needed and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.629
line them on the nail leaving even gaps in
between.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.449
Then apply a black nail polish all over the
nail and quickly peel the strips off to get

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.110
the super straight line effect. If the lines
didn't come out as clean, you can go over

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.920
with the base colour to cover any spots. Although
your still using the striping brush, its a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.920
lot easier to fix up certain areas than creating
super straight lines using only the striper.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.140
Next I'm just using the brush that came
with the black nail polish to section off

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.200
the tip of the nail with 3 curved bumps. So
Start small and build towards the shape that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200
you want. Then use a thin brush to line the
curved tips.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.340
Now for the Open Curtain design. I'm just
going to use the striper brush. Draw 2 curved

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.340
lines towards the top of the nail and color
in the tip. Add 3 lines on either side to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.290
represent the curtains, then line the tip
edge with a white striper brush. Now use a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.510
dotting tool to add polka dots to the Special
shaped French tip and do the same for the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.510
remaining nails

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.630
Using the Moon and Star shaped Nail Stickers
available at Meliney.com start placing them

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.580
onto the nail. If you put it in the center
of the nail, it will look like it's the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.580
star of the show. And if you don't want
to get the sticker's, you can totally draw

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.200
in the star and moon shapes instead with a
detail brush. Once your done, Add top coat

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.430
to secure the decals and presto. If you like
