00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.470
My philosophy has always been
that as a political scientist

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.210
and as a faculty member, my
two main responsibilities

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.430
are to educate our students,
but also to continue my research

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.540
agenda as a scholar.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.230
And the research that I
do informs my teaching,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.390
but sometimes my teaching
helps to inform my scholarship.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.434
Whether it's my presidency class
or my women in politics class,

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.850
there have been times when
I've been lecturing and hearing

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.660
students talk and
they'll ask me questions,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.535
and all of a sudden the
light bulb in my head

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:29.770
will go on and think
that's a question I

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.380
think I should really look
at in my own research.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.700
I have a brand new
presidency text coming out.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.020
It's called Presidents and
the American Presidency,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.200
based on some of the
research that I have done.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680
I've done extensive research
in presidential libraries

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.110
across the country.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.490
And so I rely on archival data
to show what really happens

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.350
in the presidency day to day.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.450
In the preface of the
book, I make a point

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.440
of thanking all of the
students who have ever

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.202
taken my presidency class.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.535
I've been teaching at the
university level for about 15,

00:00:58.535 --> 00:00:59.920
16 years.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.340
So much has changed
in medium politics.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700
I think scholars just
starting to contemplate

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.830
what all this new
technology means

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.650
for what we know
as voters and how

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.360
we participate in the process.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.220
It matters whether you're
just looking at one candidate

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.259
speaking, or you looking
at a split screen

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.800
when they're speaking,
because if you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.640
see the reactions
from the other person,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.970
is that changing what you're
hearing in the debate.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.560
If you're watching
it online and you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370
see blog comments
or Twitter comments,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.230
is that changing what you're
taking from the debate?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.879
And I think we know
the answer is yes.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.670
So that's one of the
themes that I'm really

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.086
starting to focus
on, particularly

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:38.100
in my medium politics
class, but also

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.957
how it relates to how
we elect a president.

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:42.040
We have our majors doing
a lot of different things

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.010
when they graduate.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.610
Some take the path
where they really

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.210
want to get involved in politics
or the governing process.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.480
We have a lot of other students
who obviously go to law school.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.950
Actually we have
a lot of students

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.470
who are business
majors and either

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.460
a double major in political
science or a minor.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.168
One student I'm thinking
of in particular

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:00.900
ended up double majoring in
film and political science,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.740
because he's in the
documentary program.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.520
I always make the argument
of why political science is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.910
the best major on campus.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.229
It has so many important links
to all the other real world

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.640
implications of what we do.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.810
I think it's just that linchpin
to global competitiveness

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.510
and this understanding
and knowledge

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.170
of the world in which we live.
