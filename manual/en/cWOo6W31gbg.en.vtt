00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.867
The Little Pianist

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:26.617
By Brij Kothari

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:28.367
There was once

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.617
a little boy

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:31.700
named Azul.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.533
He loved to play the piano

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.950
and dreamed

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.700
of becoming

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.117
a pianist some day.

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:42.950
Every Sunday,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.867
Azul

00:00:43.867 --> 00:00:46.450
went to his piano class,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.367
and practiced every night

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.283
at home,

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.950
just before going

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.700
to bed.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.033
Azul became

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.367
good at it

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:58.450
because he

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.867
was so sincere.

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:02.533
He would forget

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.617
to brush his teeth

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.783
but would never forget

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:11.283
to practice playing the piano!

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:12.533
One day,

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.700
Vicki,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.700
his piano teacher

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.367
told him,

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:18.533
“Azul,

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.117
you will perform tomorrow

00:01:21.117 --> 00:01:22.617
in front of a

00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:24.700
large audience.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.617
You are getting to be

00:01:26.617 --> 00:01:29.033
quite the pianist!

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.033
Your fingers move

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:32.450
like a squirrel

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.867
on the piano keys.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:36.283
But

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:40.117
there is something missing.”

00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:42.117
“What is it?”

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:43.117
Azul

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:46.200
just had to know.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.950
He really… really

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.950
wanted to be,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.617
not just a good pianist,

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:55.783
but a great pianist.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.867
Vicki smiled.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.367
She whispered

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:02.617
into Azul’s ear

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:03.950
a piano teacher’s

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.367
secret.

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.033
“Play with your heart,

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.367
not with your fingers.”

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:13.783
As always,

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:14.533
Vicki

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.283
pulled out her box of stickers.

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:18.367
Azul

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.533
held out his hand

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.783
and Vicki stuck on it,

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:25.033
a gorgeous sticker

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.867
of a butterfly.

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.783
“There,

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.533
think of this butterfly

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.200
when you want to play

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.117
with your heart,”

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:46.700
she said.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.533
That day,

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:49.783
when

00:02:49.783 --> 00:02:51.867
all the children

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:54.450
played in the park,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.700
Azul

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.617
just stared

00:02:57.617 --> 00:02:59.783
at his butterfly.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:02.367
He wondered,

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.700
“I can play

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.450
with my fingers

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.700
because I can

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.033
move them.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.533
I can touch

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:14.033
the piano keys.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:15.867
How can I play

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:17.700
with my heart?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.033
I can’t even see

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:25.200
my heart.”

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.033
For the first time,

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.533
in a long time,

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.367
Azul went to bed

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:37.700
without playing the piano.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.283
The night

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:40.950
before his

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.367
performance,

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.033
he did not practice

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:47.367
because he did not know

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:48.783
how to play

00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:58.450
with his heart!

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.450
When Azul woke up,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.367
he looked for the

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.117
butterfly sticker.

00:04:04.117 --> 00:04:05.533
Oh no!

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.200
The sticker was

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.450
gone too!

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.533
Now

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.700
Azul was

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.950
nervous.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.283
Really nervous...

00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:19.033
He tried playing the piano,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:21.533
but his fingers would

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:22.867
just

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:25.117
not move!

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:26.283
However,

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:28.283
that did not stop

00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:29.617
the clock from ticking.

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:31.783
the clock from ticking.

00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:33.117
Soon

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:36.783
it was performance time.

00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:38.283
The piano

00:04:38.283 --> 00:04:40.200
was in the middle

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.700
of a round stage,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.200
surrounded by

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.867
rows of people.

00:04:47.867 --> 00:04:49.200
Azul

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.033
walked onto the stage,

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:53.950
sat

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.367
on the piano bench

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.950
and closed his eyes

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.200
for a second.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.617
Remembering

00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:07.117
Vicki’s words,

00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:11.283
he thought of the butterfly.

00:05:11.283 --> 00:05:14.283
In the quiet of the auditorium,

00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:15.450
Azul

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.117
heard the flutter of wings.

00:05:21.117 --> 00:05:22.783
A butterfly

00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:24.950
sat on his shoulder

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.450
and started to hum

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.033
a tune.

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.450
His fingers

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.533
began to move

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.867
by themselves.

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:37.283
His heart

00:05:37.283 --> 00:05:39.283
began to play

00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:43.033
the butterfly’s song.
