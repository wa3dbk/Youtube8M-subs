00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.250
The NIBEye presents a solution to the world's
vision problem.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.600
Each NIBEye incorporates seven technologies.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.600
The first technology, a biocompatible titanium
alloy, comprises the outer shell.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.000
The second incorporated technology
is a hydrophobic artificial cornea.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.500
A multi-focal intraocular lens focuses light
from any distance onto a silicon retina.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.000
The rubber-backed retina, the fourth technology,
is curved, keeping peripherals in focus.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.680
The NIBEye uses arrays of electrodes, a fifth
technology, implanted into the visual cortex,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.539
allowing a patient to see.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.289
The sixth technology, a biobattery, enzymatically
converts blood glucose from the surrounding

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.060
blood vessels to electricity, powering the
NIBEye.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.729
The final technology, a Brain-Machine Interface,
allows volitional movement of the NIBEye.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.020
The NIBEye allows for perception of the entire
visual spectrum resulting in a visual experience

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.450
identical to that of a human eye.
