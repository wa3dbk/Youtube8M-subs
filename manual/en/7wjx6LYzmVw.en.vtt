"Childhood Constipation and Cow’s Milk"

00:00:07.368 --> 00:00:13.590
Back in the 50s, it was suggested that 
some cases of constipation among children

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.536
might be due to the 
consumption of cow’s milk,

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:21.139
but it wasn't put to the 
test until 40 years later.

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.730
We used to think that most chronic 
constipation in infants and young children

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.072
was all in their head, they were anal 
retentive, or had some intestinal disorder,

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:33.370
but these researchers studied 
27 consecutive infants

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.951
who showed up in their pediatric gastroenterology 
clinic with chronic idiopathic constipation,

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:41.472
meaning they had no idea 
what was causing it,

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:45.890
and tried removing cow milk 
protein from their diet.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.536
Within three days, 21 out of 
the 27 children were cured.

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:57.303
Symptoms completely regressed when cow’s 
milk protein-free diets were used,

00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:02.802
and there was a clinical relapse during 
two subsequent cow milk challenges,

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:05.906
meaning they then tried to give 
them back some cow’s milk

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:09.571
and the constipation reappeared 
within 24 to 48 hours.

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.743
And they did that twice. 
Same result.

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:17.037
They stuck with the milk-free diet, came 
back a month later, and they stay cured—

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:20.035
and their eczema and 
wheezing went away too!

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:24.369
The researchers concluded that many cases 
of chronic constipation in young children—

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.161
more than three quarters it seemed—may be due 
to an underlying cow’s milk protein allergy.

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:37.738
Chronic constipation is a 
common problem in children,

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:40.600
for which fiber and 
laxatives are prescribed.

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:44.900
If that doesn’t work several laxatives at 
progressively higher doses can be used,

00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:47.600
and that still may not work.

00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:51.900
Five years later a considerable 
number of kids still suffering.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.900
In fact, it may even 
extend into adulthood.

00:01:54.904 --> 00:02:01.640
So, to cure the disease in just a few days 
by eliminating cow’s milk was a real breakthrough.

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:07.210
But it was an open study, meaning 
not blinded, not placebo-controlled,

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:11.730
until … this landmark study was published 
in the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.860
a double-blind, crossover study: 
cow's milk vs. soy milk.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.850
Sixty-five kids suffering 
from chronic constipation,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.350
all previously treated with 
laxatives without success;

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:26.080
49 had anal fissures and 
inflammation and swelling.

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:31.420
An anal fissure is where there’s a rip 
or tear in the anus, very painful.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.020
They gave them either cow’s milk or soy milk 
for two weeks and then switched it around.

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:38.650
So what happened?

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:43.780
In two thirds of the children, constipation 
resolved while they were receiving soy milk.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.580
And the anal fissures 
and pain were cured,

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:50.820
whereas none of the children receiving 
cow’s milk had a positive response.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.680
In the 44 responders, the relation with 
cow’s milk protein hypersensitivity

00:02:55.684 --> 00:02:59.980
was confirmed in all cases by a 
double-blind challenge with cow’s milk.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:04.450
All those lesions, including the 
most severe anal fissures,

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.280
disappeared on cow’s milk-free 
diet yet reappeared within days

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:14.650
after the reintroduction of cow’s 
milk back into their diet.

00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:18.380
This may explain why children drinking 
more than a cup of milk a day

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:24.380
may have eight times the odds of 
developing an anal fissure.

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:29.450
Cutting out cow's milk may help
cure anal fissures in adults too,

00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:33.140
but then given them some 
cow’s milk challenge

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:39.030
and their pain goes from 0 back up 
to 8 or 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.

00:03:39.032 --> 00:03:42.300
As I said, very painful.

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:47.800
Cow’s milk may also be a major contributor 
to recurrent diaper rash as well.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.320
Why though?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.480
All the studies looking at biopsy tissue samples 
in patients with chronic constipation

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:59.150
because of cow’s milk protein hypersensitivity 
have signs of rectal inflammation.

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:05.100
Bottom line: for all children with constipation 
who do not respond to treatment,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.070
a trial of the elimination of cow’s 
milk should be considered.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.960
Studies from around the world have 
subsequently confirmed these findings,

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:20.400
curing up to 80% of kids’ constipation by 
switching to soy milk or rice milk.

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:22.530
A common problem with 
the studies though

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.430
is that when they switched kids from 
cow’s milk to nondairy milk,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.790
the kids could still have been 
eating other dairy products—

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:32.860
they didn’t control the background diet…
until now.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.830
2013 study got constipated kids off 
all dairy and 100% were cured,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.330
compared with the 68% in the 
New England Journal study

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.600
where the background 
diet was unrestricted.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800
In fact, in that original 
study 20 years ago,

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:55.170
the cow milk was replaced by 
soy milk or ... ass milk.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:03.920
Either was better than cow milk, but 
no mammary milk at all may be best.
