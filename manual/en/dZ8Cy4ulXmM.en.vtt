00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.070
So now we are going to go through and do just
the basic triads for 1,2,5 and 6 in the key

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:18.790
of F. So you got what a triad is 1,3,5 of
each scale so you have a root, a 3rd and the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:34.960
5th so a F it's F. G minor, we got G, B flat,
D you see I'm just going up D and then C and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.230
we have C,E, and G and then your D minor.
D,F, and A about of all the scale so you can

00:00:42.230 --> 00:01:02.820
go through and just play your triads. Funny
things is to do a dew wop thing like

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:18.299
and it is basically a 6,8 you got 1,2,3,4,5,61,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,
go ahead and triad and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.039
get those triads out of your fingers. Then
you just move up and down, you can invert

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:35.460
them to we take 1,3,5 and put 5 on the bottom
it basically gives you a 4th and a 3rd for

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.360
intervals. So 4 notes in the scale and then
the 3 notes in the scale skip it. Or you can

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.539
put the 4th on the top so here I have a F
major triad and I take the top 2 and put them

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:10.819
on the bottom. So have fun utilizing your
triads and get that scale under your fingers.
