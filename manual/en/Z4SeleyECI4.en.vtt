00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.520
What's the plan?

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.820
Get under the fence.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.060
Hey guys what are we doing?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.660
Uhm, someone posted to the Austin sub-reddit

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.160
that they needed their car jumped by 4pm

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.380
It's 3:16 and they're just a little up the road

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.320
Barbara couldn't go because we had someone coming sown to get a tour of the office...

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.320
and so we thought lets bring the tour along.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080
Would you guys be doing this if it was like 2am?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.060
No

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.800
If it was 2am I would have down voted it.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.500
She doesn't have a Facebook and asks someone she really knows? She has to ask strangers

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.460
on the internet

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.800
Well people on the internet are coming!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.900
Brandon you know where this place is right?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.880
Uh, yeah. I mean I haven't been looking for it but...

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.740
It should be on our left.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.080
I think this is it up ahead.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.500
I wouldn't get those yet we're not gonna need them.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600
Hey uh... where you at?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440
We're by the management office are you in a different part of the complex?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.300
That would be really funny

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.460
I hope we're looking at the Austin sub reddit not the Boston sub reddit.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.060
Should I go walk over there and see if...

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.660
We're splitting up

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.640
Is there a different Arts apartment complex?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.560
Gus, that is totally on you.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.380
Barbara said a hundred times ' we're in the wrong place'.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.580
Turning radius!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.380
Fuck that curb...

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.640
Woah!

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.940
Thats ok we got it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.660
Is that her?

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.160
Yeah that's her!

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.080
So she doesn't drive a Dodge she drives a Chevy.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.380
Hi! Thanks guys.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.240
So what happened?

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.780
Well, we bought this car for a thousand dollars about a week ago...

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.760
and it's nothing but trouble.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.420
Are they still at... I took em out didn't... you guys didn't... nobody put them back in?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.400
Yeah I didn't move the truck you guys left...

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700
I didn't leave! I would've...

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.020
I just wanna say...

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.900
That you...

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.680
I told you! I told you to put them back in the truck!

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.620
We all saw them on the ground!

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.680
Within one sentence you explained why it was your fault and then immediately shifted blame to everybody else

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.380
How did you do that?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.620
I said don't take them out of the truck! I said "don't take them out now!"

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.720
I said put them back!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.140
What was the worst that could happen?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.640
This!

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.580
Turns out there's someone about four feet away that has jumper cables.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.640
If only this had happened about...

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.680
Notice that we drove all this way, and she's like "oh we need jumper cables? We can just ask these guys."

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.020
Yey!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.560
So that only cost about ten full man hours of RoosterTeeth time,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.260
an $80 set of jumper cables,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.740
and about $30 of gas.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.600
Go get 'em.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.080
Let's leave
