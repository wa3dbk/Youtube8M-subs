CASEY CORMIER: Now, if we have a total of
this many sharps, seven sharps, this is as

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.760
many sharps as we can possibly have. One sharp
above D sharp or B sharp here rather will

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.930
be a half step above B sharp is C sharp and
this would be the key of C sharp major. Remember,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.390
C major has all naturals so C sharp major
having all sharps makes sense. Everything

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.849
has to be sharped to change it. Let's look
at flats, okay? You just have to memorize

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.020
that one flat indicates we're in the key of
F major, there's that B flat in F major and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.050
everything else is natural. Okay, now we can
use the rule. The second from the last flat

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.800
is the key signature so if we have two flats,
the first flat is B flat, our key is B flat.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:03.100
We have three flats, the second from the last,
furthest out is E flat, our key is E flat.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.509
We have our--as many as we can seven flats,
then this is our flat, this is our key signature,

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:22.850
okay? This is F, A, C, C flat, and it makes
sense once again that we would have this all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.960
flats in the key of C flat because C has naturals.
So, this is your way of determining your flats

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.200
and sharps. If you look down here, if we had
a key signature such as G major, remember

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.710
F sharp once that has G major. Well, any F
in here is going to be implied to be in a

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.460
sharp, unless there is a sign like this in
front of it which makes it natural. So, this

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:57.100
is E, F sharp, F, E, it will sound like [PLAYS
NOTES] so these two Fs are different but when

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.179
we go back to here, if there is not a natural
written in front of here after a measure change,

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.600
it is implied that this is now back to an
F sharp, so get used to these little things,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.080
those little features of naturals and reading
key signatures. Practice.
