00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.440
Tonight, in that garden I gazed at

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.100
the clouds crossing over the moon

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.400
Awakening the memories of you

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.920
The fireworks we've been longing for

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.140
and the satisfication with silent times

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.180
Because we bumped straight into love we made it up with them

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.640
A night's breeze without you

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.460
seems just lonely to me

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.080
As if it tried to play tricks on me

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.720
there's nobody here I want to see

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.440
Are you filling your heart

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.320
Covered with cracks with someone else?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.800
I won't drag my heart along

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.120
before I can't forgive it

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.780
Tonight I innocently stared at

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.800
the flowers illuminated by the moon

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.040
I'm familiar with the awakening of sensitivity

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.580
Not being aware that my heart

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.740
is lost within neediness

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.920
Just narrowing your sight

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.420
can get you feeling that sick...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.240
A night's breeze without you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.160
becomes a bit calm

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.660
I see, that's how I am

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.400
Just someone given up upon?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.020
In these days I can't find anything in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.940
The thing I await is virtue

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.400
Knowing our uninteresting past

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.800
I looked upon the thousandth night

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.300
Seems like I'll find out that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.640
I'm not filled with loneliness

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.300
Leaving my thoughts

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.440
listening to the night's breeze

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.620
A night's breeze without you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.500
becomes a bit calm

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.000
I see, that's how I am

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.700
Just someone given up upon?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.420
In these days I can't find anything in

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.320
The thing I await is virtue

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.800
Knowing our uninteresting past

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.000
I looked upon the thousandth night

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.940
Not even awaiting dawn

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.140
I leave my thoughts as a dark night

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.340
Like I learned by the night's breeze I silently go wherever I want

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.220
Crossing the sea and the sky
