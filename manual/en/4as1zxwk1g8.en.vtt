00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.719
Hi I'm Josh from espares.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.969
And in this video I'm going to show you how
to change the door hinges

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.039
on an American-style fridge freezer.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.640
Now I'm using a Rangemaster fridge
freezer for this but the process should

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.750
be fairly similar

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.910
for most types of American fridge
freezer. Now safety first. make sure even

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.619
plug your appliance from the mains

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.940
and as a precaution I've also removed
the shelves and any items

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.789
from the inside of the door as well now
tools you going to need for this

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.790
of phillips screw driver and I'm using
an

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840
eight-millimeter Spanner for undoing the
bolts

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.250
holding the hinge in place. Now if we
just have a look at the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.300
top hinge here there are four bolts

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.210
holding it down and there's also two
locating pins.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.370
Now once I've undone and removes these four bolts
the locating pins will continue to hold

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.559
the hinge in place

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.969
sohn also need to lift the hinge out of those

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.310
while holding the door as a
precaution. So I'm just going to start by

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.310
undoing the four bolts. Now I'm free to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.130
remove the hinge I'm just gonna keep my
hand on the door as a precaution

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.880
Generally the seal around the door
will hold it in place

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.830
but even if it's just knocked slightly it
can then fall off and get damaged

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.390
so I can just left the top hinge of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.860
put that to one side and I'm now going
to lift

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.860
the door away slightly and up of the
bottom hinge.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.450
Now you don't actually need to
remove the door in order to replace the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.799
bottom hinge but in this case I'm doing
it just to give you a better idea

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.799
of the process. Now to remove the bottom
hinge

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.770
we first need to remove this a bottom
kick plate.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.950
And to do that we have to unscrew

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.280
the screw here and another one her.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.280
Now I've removed the bottom kick plates

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.599
it gives me better access to the bolts
holding the bottom hinge on

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.319
under here. So I can take my spanner and
just undo

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.319
the bolts underneath.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.189
Now the next thing I need to do is
removed this door locating cam from the

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:40.989
old hinge

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.069
and transfer it onto the new hinge

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.770
I can now fit the new hymns to the
fridge and also reattach the kick plate.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.170
Now before I put the door back on

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.950
the hinge needs to be properly greased.
So you can either recover

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.110
the grease from the old hinge or if not
you can use either petroleum jelly

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.110
or car grease. I can now put the new
hinge in place on the top

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.620
so I'm just going to drop it into
position

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.940
over the locating pins.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.790
And I can now bolt it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.140
back into place.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.950
And then we have to new hinges fitted to
an American fridge freezer.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.129
Now it's important that the door is
level once it's put back in place

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.030
on most appliances this is achieved just
by adjusting the feet.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.510
But on some machines it may be necessary
to adjust the hinge slightly as well.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.640
Spares for American fridge
freezers

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.019
and other appliances are available on the
eSpares website.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:15.890
Thanks for watching.
