00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.510
This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas, and I'm doing a series of lessons on machine knitting.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.700
And this is the second lesson in a group about how to master your knitting machine's garter bar.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.500
And the garter bar is very helpful when you're decreasing.  Now, very often when we're knitting,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
we're given an instruction like this, which says:

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.470
"Decrease 6 stitches evenly across the row."  And I've got 30 stitches now,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.640
so my question is, "Where do those six decreases go?"

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.560
Now the first step to figuring out how the math works with that is to add one to the number of

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.529
decreases that I need to make.  So I need to make 6 decreases.  Add 1.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.380
I need 7 groups of stitches.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.540
I don't want my decreases to be on the very, very end of the row.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.389
I want the end of the row kept even for seaming.  So to keep the decreases from being on the end,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.479
I need seven groups so that the decreases will be in between those seven groups.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.330
Then I take the  30 stitches

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
and I'm going to divide.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.639
If I take 30 and divide by 7, then I can see I can have 7 groups of 4 stitches

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.049
and I'm going to have 2 left over, because 4 times 7 is 28,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.940
so I'm going to have a remainder of 2 -- 2 stitches left over.  So here are my seven groups.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.780
that would be where the decreases are.  They go in between them, but I'm going to have an extra stitch on the two ends,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.229
so that means this end group will be a group of 5 and this end group will be a group of 5.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.419
Now I'll just do the decreases right on the knitting machine before I do any moving around with the garter bar.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
So, I'm going to decrease.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.940
I've got a group of 5, then a group of 4, 4, 4, . . .

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.220
4, 4, and a group of 5 at the other end.  And you can see that that is 1, 2, 3,

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.039
4, 5, 6 decreases that I needed to do.  And I'm just going to move each of these

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.599
onto the needle to the right of it .  It doesn't matter -- it could be right or left.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.799
So I'm actually doing the decreases with a transfer tool.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.519
Now if you're decreasing evenly across the row,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430
you end up with these little holes.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.090
We certainly don't want holes, and besides, the knitting machine

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.989
will lay yarn in this empty needle and then your decrease is gone, so that's not at all what you had in mind.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.269
What you actually need to do,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.450
since we are tied to these needles -- we don't have sticks for needles like a hand knitter --

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.819
we need to move all the stitches in so that there are no holes.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.179
Well, if I were to move all the stitches in -- and I've done it before with one of these transfer tools --

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.989
then I'd have to move these over, and move these over, and I would

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.910
constantly be moving a few stitches over.  Or maybe I would take the whole business off on waste yarn

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.359
and then pick it back on.  But the garter bar

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.360
provides a wonderful shortcut for getting all of these stitches moved in.  So let's start by bringing the needles out,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.959
and of course I'm going to put the stopper on.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.939
Now I explained in the first lesson how to adjust the stopper so that it fits your machine.

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.529
The reason these come with the screws on them is that they don't fit every machine,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.019
so you have to adjust it.  Once the stopper is on, the needles cannot move left or right.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.089
They are quite rigid and they can't move forward or back, in or out. They are ...

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.590
They're stuck right there.  So I'll just slide the knitting back,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.099
which opens the latches, and

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.410
I'm going to use my credit card tool to just slide across and open the few latches that

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.769
didn't open because there was no yarn on them to open them.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.200
And then I'm going to take the garter bar and use it as a stitch holder again.  I just lay it in

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.769
in the hooks of the needle and yank the stitches onto the garter bar.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.730
Some of the needles have two stitches on them because of the decreases,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.889
so that's no problem.  I just yank both stitches onto the garter bar.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.640
And I have too many needles, don't I?  If I'm going to decrease by six stitches,

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.569
then I'm going to have to get rid of six needles,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.499
so I'll get rid of three on the left, three on the right.  If I do that evenly,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.089
then I can still use the needle numbers on the strip to help myself keep track of the count of how many needles

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.690
I'm supposed to have.  Now I take the garter bar, and I find the point on the bar that has the first stitch.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.690
I just lay that in the hooks.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.590
And I just pop those first four stitches onto the needles.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.709
I like to use the pad of my finger for moving stitches with the garter bar.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.530
Didn't get that one all the way.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.039
A little push.  Okay.  Then I move over, because there was a hole, so I filled in the hole,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.609
use my finger and poke the next one's on,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.780
lift up, move over, . . .

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.290
So I continue across the needles, filling in

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.950
the stitches.  And when I get to an empty spot, I have to move over so that I can

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.260
put a stitch on that one.  This way, there are no holes and

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.779
the knitting has become narrower by decreasing evenly across the row.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.330
There are plenty of situations in knitting where it's much more attractive to increase or decrease

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:23.820
evenly, and very often you see this instruction to increase or decrease evenly on garments.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.960
So I've decreased across the row.  This instruction is something you see a lot with hats,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.890
so as you get to the top of the hat, and the

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.739
knitting needs to be narrower all over so that it will fit the head.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.719
Okay, I just pushed that back, and I proceed with the knitting.  So I will do that,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.899
because what I want to do is knit a few rows,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.630
take it off, and get it in front of the camera so that you can see how that looks on the knit side.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.440
Okay, I'm just going to clip the yarn and drop it off the machine.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.429
Here is a decrease right here.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.259
The row of stitch moves up like that and

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.969
here is one that just vanishes underneath another one.   So see what a nice,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.540
tidy looking decrease that forms?  I think at this angle you can see them very well.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.720
coming on across.  So that is how to use the garter bar to do

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.140
decreases all the way across a row of knitting.
