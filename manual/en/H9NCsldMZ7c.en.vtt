Quick Weight Loss for Women (fast weight loss)
Video.
When it comes to weight loss
unfortunately the women get the short end

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.820
of the stick is definitely harder for
women to lose weight in fact

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.460
women have been hardwired to

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.359
not lose weight

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.839
no matter how cheesy what i'm about to
tell you sounds it all makes perfect

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.679
sense if we stop and think about it

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.070
let me explain

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.739
it all stems back to the hunter-gatherer
days of our ancestors men were not built for

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.269
fat storage at all

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.339
men were built to be lean and fast,hunt food

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.800
how men can even accumulate that all
goes completely against our genetics

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.250
on the other hand

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.210
women were built for fat stores to
be able to survive and care for children

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.840
during famine

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720
their essential fat stores are
many times higher than men

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.340
when they were built to accumulate as
much fat as possible and to not lose those

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.640
accumulations for childbirth milk
production and child-rearing

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.739
unfortunately

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.800
we've been built to survive

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.790
not to look good

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.170
women have a couple of major fat storing
roadblocks that hold them back

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.140
first of all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.380
women's fat cells are bigger have more
fat storing enzymes in them

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.350
men's fat cells have more fat burning
enzymes and are much smaller

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.370
women honestly do have a lot more
working against them

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.810
which is why the steps Ill be outlining
in this presentation works so well

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.710
estrogen multiplies fat storing enzymes
making them gain weight around their

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.840
but and thighs like it's an olympic event

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.509
darn those childbirth genetics

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.650
third

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.340
crash dieting. it puts our bodies instantly
into starvation reducing fat burning

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.050
enzymes by up to fifty percent our
bodies literally freak out

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.790
not only do we tend to lose muscle mass
when crash dieting but our fat burning enzymes

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.470
can decrease

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.950
!!!!

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.560
This shall help you understand why it's
harder for gals to lose weight

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.760
so is it actually possible to overcome
these silly genetics

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.050
well i've got some great news you can and
i'm about to share with you one simple tip

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.320

well-known so-called diet programs

mega rich weight loss companies make
money off of people like you and i

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:19.589
by selling us stuff that leads to at best
temporary results

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:20.889

to actually being able to eat some bad

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.979
foods and still burn fat
