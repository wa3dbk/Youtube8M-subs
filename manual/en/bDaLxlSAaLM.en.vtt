00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.569
What's up?

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.590
This is your boy, Jino, back again, and I
want to tell you how to do traces for legs.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.309
Now, when you do traces for legs, it's like
how you trace on a drawing, or on a piece

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.890
of paper.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.050
Same thing for legs, arms, or anything else.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.190
This time it's for legs.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.630
You can do anything you want.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.330
You can use your knee caps.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.880
There's not too much you can do with your
legs, unless you get on the ground which you

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.249
can do, you can convert to that.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.140
Now, you're going to use your knees.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.710
Your knee is really good because it sticks
out and is very prominent, you can see it.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.140
So, you're going to go, one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.140
Let's try that.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.829
We are going to do a whole eight count, just
knees, which is your leg.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.359
So, five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.410
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.999
Now, you can reverse that as well and make
it sixteen counts.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.250
Let's try that.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.590
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.270
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.540
Back, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.820
Now, you can take those in multiple speeds
as well.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.010
You can go, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.330
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850
It will be clearly seen.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.571
If it's a certain beat, you can really kill
it.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:28.571
So, let's try it again.

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:33.200
We are going to [reverse feet], we're going
to take it four times, and after that we're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
going to double it.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.270
So, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.680
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.090
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.930
Quicker, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.340
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:17.900
Now, let's try it with some music.
