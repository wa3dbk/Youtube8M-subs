00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.010
Today on this 2007 Crown Victoria, were going
to install part number 13707 from Curt.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.910
Now this is what the hitch looks like once
its installed on the vehicle.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.820
Next well go ahead and give you some measurements
to help you out in selecting some accessories

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.299
such as ball mount, a bicycle rack, or cargo
carrier.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.620
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground will be 13-1/4 and from the

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.181
center of the hitch pin hole to the edge of
the bumper will be about 5-3/8.Now well go

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.609
ahead and show you how the hitch is installed.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.320
First thing were going to do is to get underneath
the vehicle and our two straps have to be

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.850
moved from the frame.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.200
Well reattach these straps at the end of the
install.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.110
Then well go ahead and hold up our hitch underneath
the bottom of the frame and well get into

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.430
position about one inch away from the end
of the frame.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.379
Then well go ahead and clamp it into place.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.230
Now you definitely want to have an extra set
of hands to help do this while you hold the

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.460
hitch and install the clamps.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.159
With our hitch clamped up well go ahead and
use a half inch drill bit to mark our holes.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:02:32.540
Then well go ahead and drill it out with a
pilot hole bit and then 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:03:06.950
go back at it with a half inch bit.
