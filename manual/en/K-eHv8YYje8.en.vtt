00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.910
This is pretty easy to work with. Firstly,
there are three cards that are not in play.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.009
These never get into play. These are the mystery
cards. Three out of twenty-four, I think that's

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.760
one eighth or twelve point five percent. There
are very few card games that have cards out

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.280
of play or in a kitty. I mean, a lot of games
the cards are temporarily in the kitty and

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.939
somebody bids for the kitty and they take
it in to hold in their hand. So you have three

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.670
cards out of the game. So you don't know what
they are, but they certainly impact the distribution

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.410
of hands. Sometimes you think, oh my god this
is hopeless I'm going to lose to the right

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.830
and lo and behold the right is in the kitty.
So sometimes you get lucky and there is a

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.580
certain amount of luck in this game. Perhaps
a little higher than other games, but there

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.890
is still a great skill factor in working with
partners who understand the meaning of how

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.790
to cross trump hands and do that sort of thing.
So if we turn a heart, normally, and this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.979
actually holds up pretty well, you're going
to find each hand and I mentioned this before,

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.730
each hand will usually have one trump and
there will probably be a trump in the kitty.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.750
Well, let's see if this holds up. We've got
two trump here, one trump here, zero trump

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.760
here, but we happen to have two trump in here
if it turns out hearts are going to be named

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.710
trump, and of course one trump in the kitty
so this one happens to have two. So it's two,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.181
two, one, and unfortunately he didn't have
any, but normally you expect each person to

00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:28.730
have a trump. These could have been easily
divided this way as well. Secondly, when this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.990
card, again this is good exercise in bidding
when you have this card turned it goes pass

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.930
because he can't order, pass, that's a good
card for him to have, but not enough to order,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.690
pass. He's thrilled to take this into his
hand and get rid of this and without even

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.830
having to worry about this, this hand is very,
very tempting hand to even call a loner on,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.120
very tempting, a lot of people would do it
because it has an off suit ace and an off

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.130
suit king, the odds favor making them all,
partner happens to have the right, it's a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.950
fifty -fifty proposition. The right could
have been in the kitty or in partner's hand

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.900
or in either one of these hands. So its fifty
percent possibility of making a loner, but

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.250
you also needed help on here. He chose to
go to make all the points is what he did.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.950
Again, I'll have players argue with me saying
oh I'd call a Lone. Well, then you would have

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.530
lost the king of diamonds. So it all depends
on your approach to the game. Aggressive players

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.481
will call this a lone all the time. So that's
a little thing about percentages, plays in

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:29.780
the hand, remember three cards out of the
game changes the dynamics of the hand.
