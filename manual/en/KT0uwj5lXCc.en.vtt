00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.110
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace an electronic

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.890
cooling fan. In this step we're going to talk
about the proper service procedure for reinstalling

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.760
our radiator reservoir and over flow. What
I'm going to do first is line it up and start

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.539
my bolts. We have two bolts on this particular
vehicle, the number of bolts will vary depending

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.180
on the make and model. You're going to want
to make sure to start both bolts before tightening

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.870
down any of them, what that will do is give
you the wiggle room necessary to line up all

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.410
the fasteners. If you were to tighten one
down before they're all installed odds are

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.290
you wouldn't be able to get the very last
one in. Once you have both bolts started,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.760
I'm going to take my ten millimeter socket,
it's a deep well, my three eighths drive ratchet,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:04.929
and tighten it down. These bolts do not have
to be extremely tight, as you can see it's

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:12.821
making a sandwich out of that Bakelite bracket
between the bolt head and this metal clip

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:19.229
here. Over tightening will damage the bracket
or strip out the metal clip. Go ahead and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:41.590
get my last mounting bolt, alright. From here
what I'm going to do is get my over flow tube

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.380
as you can see it doesn't have a clamp on
it, some do and some don't. Manufacturers

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.569
don't necessarily have to put them on, due
to the fact that the over flow tube does not

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.130
carry any pressurized coolant. Slip it back
into it's retainer clip and slide it onto

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.399
the nipple, and make sure it's fully seated.
From there I'm going to take and reinstall

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:18.319
my over flow hose onto the radiator outlet
in a wiggling method. You can see once you

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.890
have it on you're going to wiggle it on there,
just like so. Once you have it wiggled on

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.360
into position, I'm going to take my channel
locks and reinstall the permanent tension

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.170
spring clamp. Now as you can see there's a
pattern on this hose from where the clamp

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.630
has been the entire life of the vehicle, more
than likely. That hose is use to being in

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.880
that position, and really wants to be back
in that position. So what we're going to do

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.170
is line up our hose clamp with the pattern
on it. And you will have to do some wiggling,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:03.560
they don't give you a lot of extra space on
a permanent tension spring clamp.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.620
What I'm doing now is lining up the pattern
with the hose clamp and releasing it once

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:16.180
it's in place, right there. And that is the
proper service procedure for reconnecting

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.569
your over flow and fill reservoir back to
the radiator.
