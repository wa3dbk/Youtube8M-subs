00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.800
With all of the talk about 4K and ultrawide
displays, you'd be forgiven for forgetting

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.500
that a lot of people aren't even using 1080p
screens yet. While high resolutions and crazy

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.469
aspect ratios can be awesome to have, for
the majority of people they really aren't

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.460
necessary - most people just want a display
that looks good without breaking the bank.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.540
This monitor from BenQ promises to do just
that. My name is Stephen Potter, and this is the BenQ EW2440L.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.920
So, the monitor comes relatively well packaged,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.909
with nice thick, hard foam, so you shouldn't
have to worry about it getting damaged in

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:41.899
transit too badly. Along with the monitor,
you'll get a regular HDMI cable, as well as

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.280
an HDMI to MHL connector for hooking it up
to your phone or tablet. BenQ have also thrown

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.389
in a fairly large velcro cable tie, which
is definitely a nice addition considering

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.600
the complete lack of cable management on this
monitor.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.760
Regarding I/O, on the EW2440L you get two
HDMI inputs, one VGA port, line in and headphone

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.240
out. My only real complaint here would be
that I'd personally prefer to see a DisplayPort

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.549
in rather than a second HDMI port, but BenQ's
choice here is understandable as some users

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.869
may wish to use this monitor with multiple
devices such as games consoles and phones,

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.960
which only really output to HDMI.
The build quality of this monitor is a bit

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.570
of a mixed bag. It's relatively well put together,
but I have to question BenQ's material choices

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.189
on this one. About half of the monitor is
covered in this brushed, matte plastic, which

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.520
is fairly nice to be honest, but the other
half is covered in possibly my least favourite

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.039
material: glossy, black plastic. So, what's
the problem here? Well, it picks up dust and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.789
fingerprints like nothing else I've ever seen,
and any attempt to clean it will probably

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.850
leave it with hundreds of microscratches.
Definitely not so hot...

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.259
While we're on the topic of the drawbacks
of this display, let's get into the stand.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.819
It's fairly sturdy, but only offers simple
tilt adjustment, with no pivot or swivel at

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.479
all. I'd generally be okay with this kind
of thing, but the problem lies in the fact

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.429
that to my knowledge there's absolutely no
way to VESA mount it at all because of the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.280
layout of the connections around back. So,
if you have dreams of using this display in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.060
portrait, on a multi-monitor stand, or just
using something completely different instead

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.640
of what's in the box, you can give up now
because it's not going to happen.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.909
One interesting thing about the base of this
monitor is that it has its own phone stand

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.750
built in. Now, normally this might be a nice
addition, but it opens with a rather horrible

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.730
mechanism that requires a lot of force and
makes a nasty snapping sound. It also, unfortunately,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.879
only supports relatively small devices in
portrait, and while I expect the intended

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.420
use is to place your phone there and use it
with the included MHL cable to mirror the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.560
display, this simply didn't work with my LG
G3 for whatever reason, so I didn't find myself

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.549
using the stand at all.
On the bottom right of the monitor there's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.549
a line of capacitive buttons for controlling
the OSD. To be honest, I'm much more of a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.709
fan of physical buttons than capacitive ones,
but this is one of the better implementations

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.900
I've seen. They're nice and easy to access,
and responsive, without being too easy to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.720
accidentally activate. The menu system itself
is simple and well layed out, with everything

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.909
sorted fairly logically.
Looking at the display, you'll notice the

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.659
relatively thin bezels around the panel. While
I do like the look of them, in their product

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.430
images BenQ hugely exaggerate just how slim
they are - I mean, take a look at this picture

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.180
from BenQ next to a picture of the actual
monitor. Now, this could just have been an

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.370
innocent mistake in the Photoshop department,
but if it's not then that's downright misleading

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.459
behaviour. I was relatively lucky, as I did
my research and knew what to expect, but I'd

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.140
guess that the average consumer probably wouldn't
do that much. I'm not complaining, as the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.860
bezels are still extremely thin, and it still
provides an extremely immersive experience

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.939
for gaming and watching movies, but I'm really
not a huge fan of this practice.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.180
On the plus side, picture quality is where
this monitor really stands out. The EW2440L

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.049
boasts an extremely good 3000:1 contrast ratio,
which is typical for a VA panel. What this

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.780
means is that dark colours really are displayed
as being dark, and there's very little noticeable

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
backlight bleed. Colours are vibrant, without
reaching the point of oversaturation, and

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.030
while I can't speak objectively without a
colourimeter, a lot of BenQ's VA panels at

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.220
this price point have very accurate colours,
meaning this display is probably good enough

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.550
for most amateur photo and video work. Viewing
angles are pretty good as well - while not

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.700
quite as good as an IPS panel, as you'll still
get a slight contrast shift off axis, there's

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.550
no noticeable colour shift, and most of the
time you shouldn't notice it at all.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.200
The EW2440L comes with a pair of speakers
built in, and while I'd generally recommend

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.920
avoiding monitor speakers if you have any
choice in the matter, these aren't actually

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.480
too bad. They won't get loud enough to fill
a room, but they should be ample enough for

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.850
personal use. What really surprised me was
how little distortion there was overall - they

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.090
don't sound particularly tinny or completely
muddy, which is a nice change from most built

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.930
in solutions. But don't just take my word
for it: take a listen for yourself:

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.360
So yes, the EW2440L isn't perfect. But it
doesn't have to be, and at this price point

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.950
you can't really expect much better. You won't
see better image quality for less than £50

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.120
more, and while the overall package is ever
so slightly flawed, it's still one of the

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.920
best out there. And it's for that reason that
the EW2440L is getting a spot on my desk as my personal display of choice.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.720
