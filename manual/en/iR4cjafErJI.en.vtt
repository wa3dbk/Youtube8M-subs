00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:35.440
Peopleóas in plural, as in severalóhave
declared this one of the worst games ever

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.440
made.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.140
And if they indeed believe that, I would urge
those critics to spend just one day beyond

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.580
the walls of their coddled little world in
which only indie darlings and marquee releases

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.830
from major publishers warrant the practice
of their job.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.010
If you think this game is bad, try covering
the Wii in 2011.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.329
Then you can come tell me, after youíve emerged
from catatonia, how maybe Amy isnít quite

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.180
as bad you thought.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:17.600
Itís worth mentioning, given the influence
of hype in this industry, the disastrous response

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.229
this game has received since its release earlier
this month.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.889
The Xbox 360 version has an abysmal 2.3 on
Metacritic, a site that aggregates review

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.200
scores from prominent game publications.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.499
For some perspective, thatís lower than Sexy
Poker, Game Party 3 and Calvin Tuckerís Redneck

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:39.749
Jamboree.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:45.640
Amy isnít as bad as Calvin Tuckerís Redneck
**** Jamboree.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.170
Aside from illustrating how pointless review
scores are, I mention this to temper the prevailing

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.319
narrative about how Amy is a disaster of catastrophic
proportions.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.079
This is a very bad game, thereís no disputing
that.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.700
But itís far from the worst game ever made.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.990
Amy is a collection of genuinely interesting
ideas held down by terrible execution, another

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.560
one of those games that embodies the unfortunate
cliche...

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.280
Oh, what mightíve been.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.170
Amy is a survival horror game in which disappointment
is the greatest obstacle to survive.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.590
It tells the story of Amy, an autistic girl
with strange abilities.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.120
Playing as her caretaker Lana, youíre riding
on a train with Amy when thereís suddenly

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.870
a massive explosion.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.000
You regain consciousness to find a ravaged
world where survivors are relegated to the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.810
shadows, mumbling about the end of days.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.250
The story is like a George A. Romero interpretation
of Rain Man.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.250
Amy is the key to Lanaís survival, and when
youíre separated, Lana experiences firsthand

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.690
the horrific effects of the infection thatís
destroying the world.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.410
She starts to hear voices, she is haunted
by visions...and if she doesnít get back

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:17.770
to Amy in time, she dies.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.350
The idea is Amy is the purifier keeping Lana
safe from the infection, and that really serves

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.190
as the foundation for most of Amyís gameplay.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.120
When walking hand-in-hand with Amy, Lana is
fine.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.160
But when the game separates you, whether to
solve a puzzle or for a narrative purpose,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.110
Lana slowly begins to die.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.650
She can stave off the infection with an injection,
but ultimately, her only chance for survival

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.090
is to get back to Amy.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.320
Basically, itís an interesting survival-horror
twist on the old light-and-dark mechanic.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.510
Itís an idea weíve seen in other horror
titlesóuh, think Shadows of the Damnedóand

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.370
even games like Metroid Prime 2.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.350
So it is a great concept, but tragically,
Amy is only ever great in theory.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.700
The gameplay that surrounds that concept is
almost shockingly ba-nal, with a combat system

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.710
that feels 15 years old and controls that
make those tank complaints about Resident

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.190
Evil seem like nitpicking.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.900
Fortunately, puzzles are the gameís focus.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.600
Unfortunately, theyíre repetitive as hellóno
pun intendedóand stop being interesting the

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.910
fifth time youíve been asked to send Amy
through a crawlspace.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.240
There are some genuinely clever ideas beneath
the utter mediocrity that defines this game,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.590
and the sad thing is that the game itself
doesnít seem to know how to capitalize on

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.590
them.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.570
And for that, Amy is a massive disappointment.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:54.680
Itís not the worst game ever made, but thatís
the only compliment it deserves.
