00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome to a new edition of the MiWuLa-News.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Four special exhibitions in the Wunderland.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
From now on you can experience

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our past special exhibitions in the Miniatur Wunderland. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Besides our successful exhibitions 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"The Divided City" and "Utopia 2009"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you can now see the new exhibition "Swiss Trains - The History of the Raethian Rail".

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Furthermore, we present to you the first completed model buildings of the airport.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Everyone who couldn't find the time to visit these, now gets their chance. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
For further information, as always, please visit our website.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The transition for the vehicles from the Knuffingen segment to the airport area is now completed.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Axel and Tina have established the connection between the car system charging station and the new Airport Knuffingen.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Vehicles from the airport segment can now use the same charging station as the ones from Knuffingen

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and, if necessary, may drive in one segment as well as the other.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have a small record to announce:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Our "No. 13" - the ABX Trailer Tram - 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
has absolved 10.000 real kilometres since the first day of operation on the 20th of August 2001.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A remarkable performance for such a small vehicle. For comparison: 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is equal to the distance from Hamburg to Kuala Lumpur. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
During this time the train went through four battery packs, ten transmissions, five motors, 21 handlebars 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and two complete sets of tyres.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
A respectable amount of 841 maintenances was necessary to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
remove dust or to grease transmissions and axles.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We are looking forward to the next 10.000 Kilometres.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The construction of the various parking structures for the airport is in full swing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The first parking structures are already being competely decorated with thousands of cars and figures.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Here Manfred is decorating the hand-made parking garage P2,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
a detailled replica of the original at the Airport Hamburg, including many figures. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
A gigantic construction, with room for over 1.000 vehicles.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In the electronics workshop, the final touches on the buildings are being made, where they receive their lighting.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
For the lighting of the parking garage P5, a smaller model for about 700 parking spots,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the plug contacts are being installed and the cable routes are incorporated, hidden in the stairwell.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For cleaning purposes or maintenance of the parking structure 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the seperate levels can later be dismantled. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Aside from the parking garage, each vehicle is also outfitted with lights. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Such effects as these glimmering lights can someday be discovered and admired.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Recently, the first placing rehearsal was done for some models in the airport segment. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Especially the largest of all models 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
- the parking garage P4 -

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
was a real challenge for all participating model makers. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Kai and Tina, who have been working on this ardous task for months now, were of course also present. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Four people were needed to place the huge P2 parking structure on its future position. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Time to admire our own work for once.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We will go into further detail on all the parking structures and their construction in a later report.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Another model is this large hall, which will soon be implemented in the airport: 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This is the business-flyer-hangar. It's elaborately designed by Tina.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Here she can be seen manufacturing the gates for it. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The preparations for the construction of the airport terminal have begun:

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Kai is already planning the first measurements for the airport floor plate. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
very time-consuming project.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Recently we presented the Pushback in a MiWuLa Report. Its technology is now being installed.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Sascha is currently designing the lighting for this little aircraft tractor. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Unlike its bigger brother, this version of the pushback vehicle is too small 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to drive on the layout some day. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Certainly it will look great anyway.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Also, the finger docks, shown in an episode of Gerrit's Diary, are going into mass-production. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
In the terminal area ten of these finger docks will carry passengers 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
out of the aircraft in continous operation. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Furthermore, the Segways, already known from the Hamburg segment,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are being manufactured specifically for the airport. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Elke pays attention to every detail, like these mudguards made out of tin foil which will later be painted. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
All that is missing now are their little drivers.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The construction of vehicles is also taking up speed.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
SÃ¶nke, one of our airplane-crafters, had a crazy idea: 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The construction of a special plane.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It is supposed to fly under the name Love-Air 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and will come with a few surprises. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But until then the plane will have to spend several hours in our technical workshop. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Bobby is currently busy designing a small park with a sculpture exhibition. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The first art pieces are already being created, for example flamingos made out of a hedge. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
On the complete and fully-modeled edge of the layout, lavish details are of the highest priority. 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
With lots of flowers and own ideas, Bobby creates a colourful contrast to the large airport surface.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Judith has designed a small water canal. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
To represent water in a realistic manner, a special resina is used for the circumnavigation of the airport.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But it spreads very fast:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That's why it has to be absolutely leakproof.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Otherwise there isn't much in the canal and everything's under the layout and causes a big mess. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So I'm busy with spackling, sanding and more spackling, 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so no small holes can emerge.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The canal is pre-painted and then comes to life with various colours.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Little holes that possibly emerged could still be covered with paint, if necessary. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Over 3 months ago, Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Immediately after the first news coverage we decided to help the victims of this disaster.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Together with Germany's Relief Coalition "Aktion Deutschland hilft" we looked for an institution that urgently required help.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That's how a hospital in Port-au-Prince was located that needs long-term support.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Thanks to the concern of our staff,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the company and, of course, our visitors, we were able

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to raise the considerable amount of 70.000 Euro.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We would like to use this space to thank you for your consideration and generous donations.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Besides a Car System truck, a ship, a mountain and an airplane, 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
this locomotive of the model BR 101 was auctioned.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The locomotive was bought by a lady, who

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
could let it be designed and painted by our model makers to her heart's content.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The locomotive is already riding through the Wunderland. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The former monastery mountain was auctioned by the FC St. Pauli Fan Club.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The devotees of this soccer club organized themselves over the St.Pauli-Forum and raised money nation-wide.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The mountain is now named "Mount Saint Pauli", and deservedly so.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And that's it for this edition of the MiWuLa-News.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Thank you for watching.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
See you soon.
