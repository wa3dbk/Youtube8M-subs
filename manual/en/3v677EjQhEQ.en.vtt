Hi this is Dr. Young. I'm a Facial Plastic Surgeon in Seattle 
 Washington. What I'm doing right now is a face lift.

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:12.098
What I want to show you is the difference between 
 a mini lift and deep plane face lift.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:15.906
And I wanted to show you the anatomy because its important to understand.

00:00:15.906 --> 00:00:20.503
Right here we have the face exposed through this incision

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:27.725
And when we do mini face lifts and short scar 
 face lifts a lot of what that entails is

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:31.164
just picking up the tissue here and pulling it back

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:39.010
and then sewing to some structure over here that is harder

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:39.010
and then sewing to some structure over here that is harder

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.932
What we've done here is elevated the skin and the muscle is underneath

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:51.595
And typically when you do S face lifts or quick face 
 lifts they entail just taking this muscle from the top

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:57.214
and pulling it back and sewing. That depends on a lot of scar tissue.

00:00:57.214 --> 00:01:04.621
holding on to the elevation. And its very dependent on 
 that. Now the other way to do it.

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.222
The more traditional way of doing a face lift is by elevating the muscle

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:15.349
Which we have done here. You can kind of see the muscle. Right here.

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:18.135
Now we're underneath the muscle and here is the parotid gland.

00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:27.621
We're going straight into this area and were also developing a 
 plane over here to release all of these structures

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:29.632
And really allow the face here to release

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:30.836
And really allow the face here to release and really pull and reset

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:40.890
and so that's the difference between these quicker face lifts that entail pulling the 
 tissues up and not really readjusting the muscles like were doing here

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.330
This is more of a traditional face lift when you go underneath the muscle

00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:50.130
Some times people limit this dissection to this point

00:01:50.132 --> 00:01:54.780
However I will incorporate my dissection all the 
 way over here over the smiling muscles

00:01:54.776 --> 00:02:03.040
Where I'm really going to pull on the face which will really have 
 more of an effect on the nasolabial folds and the jowl area

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:09.750
So that's my intent there. But I wanted to show you the 
 difference between how some people do a mini face lift

00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:12.260
as opposed to how some people do more traditional face lifts where they go

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:20.200
underneath the muscle. And this is just a video showing a visual presentation of 
 underneath the muscle in a traditional deep plane face lift. Thank you.
