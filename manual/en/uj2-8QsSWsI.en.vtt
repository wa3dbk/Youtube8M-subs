00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.129
Steven: I do save regularly.

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.200
One small direct debit and then I usually...

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.400
any cash I have left over at the end of the month I put away.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.000
Antoinette: Every month I try to put away, like,
half of my wages into my savings account.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.909
Essan: I put money aside in a jar.

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.380
I've got a £1, sort of, jar

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.300
and it's called our Date Jar.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.000
Whenever me and my girlfriend have a spare pound
we just put it in there

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.500
and when it reaches a certain amount we get to go on a date.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.640
Emily: I'm just starting to save, so...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.100
I'm living with family at the moment so I don't have to pay rent

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.340
and just saving in a bank account.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.000
Got a joint account with my boyfriend.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.150
Clark: I try. I've just started saving as much as I can.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.000
Basically, when I get paid I try to keep half of whatever I get as savings.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.550
Donna: I save in bonds as well. £100 a month.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.900
And you do £50 out of his bank a month.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.000
Like, in his own building society.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.560
Gary: Whatever loose change we have of our own

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.519
we just put in our own separate tins.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.270
Donna: Yeah, because I have more than him so I don't want to share.
Gary: Don't lie! Donna: Yes I do!

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.189
Gary: Wait til the tins are full up and that's it.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.000
Donna: Cut them open and that it. We have them ones that are sealed
that you can't open until they're full.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Well, you can open them, but we don't until they're full, do we?
Gary: That's it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
Donna: So we save a lot.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.500
Gary: We need to do anything like that -
Donna: We go into our tins, really.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.330
If it's an emergency we'd have to break into the tins, I think.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.070
I wouldn't touch my bonds and you don't touch your savings, really,
do you?

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.660
Gary: Got my little hideaway.
Donna: Hide away a bit. Oh.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.830
Julia: Well, I just have a savings account

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.200
and then other things such as I've got pets
so I have pet insurance for those sort of emergencies.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.399
Gordon: What's in the ISA.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.700
There's not exactly a load in there
but that's the emergency fund, basically.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850
Steven: I do have some money put away.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.600
I have tried to change career which has cost me some money
so I don't have as much as I used to have.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.610
But generally, if I don't put away each month,
even if it's something like £100,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.600
I get quite annoyed with myself
because I do try to save every month if possible.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.000
Antoinette: I just include it in my savings.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
In case anything does happen then my savings is there
if I really needed it for an emergency.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.339
Emily: I did actually stop smoking,
so that is something I have cut back on.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.500
Steven: Going out with friends, nights out,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
maybe not go out for as many meals.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.900
Last-minute events I have to say "no" to, occasionally.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.400
Nikki: Well, I have stopped smoking,
so that's made me save a lot more money.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
Antoinette: Going to restaurants.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.959
I don't really go as much because I don't feel it's necessary,

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.000
so I can use that money to save to things that I actually want.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.359
Donna: We're only allowed one fill-up of each vehicle per month.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.300
After that, you're on your own.
You walk it or you fill it up out of your own money.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.050
Brenda: Budget. If you can budget, budget.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.000
Steven: Keep an eye on your account.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.200
Be careful of... Don't go out on spending sprees

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.300
and then think, where's all my money gone?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.000
Keep an eye on your account regularly, I think.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
Antoinette: Be strict on yourself and spend within your means.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.300
Don't go above your means

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.000
because that could be detrimental.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.579
Essan: Get a banking app, yeah,
and then you can just check how much you've got all the time.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.619
It's tactical.

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.189
Emily: Move in with family if you can.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.800
That's helped a lot
because we have got a little bit of savings now,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.000
whereas before we didn't have anything.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.819
We were living hand-to-mouth, so that really helps.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.000
Donna: I have a sealed tin, that'd be mine.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.400
Or, take it straight out of your, like, bank into another account

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.800
so you know straight away at the beginning of the month it's gone.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.400
That'd be my tip.
