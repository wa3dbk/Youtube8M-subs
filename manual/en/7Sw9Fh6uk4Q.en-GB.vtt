00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.620
Struck by lightning,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.840
sounds pretty frightening,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.240
but you know the chances are so small.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.660
Stuck by a bee sting,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.900
nothing but a bee thing,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.200
better chance you're gonna buy it at the mall

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.400
But it's a 23 or 4 to 1

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.520
that you could fall in love by the end of this song,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.900
So get up, get up,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
tell the bookie to 'put a bet up'

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.480
Not a damn thing will go wrong.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.720
The odds are that we

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.160
will probably be alright.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.980
Odds are we're gonna be alright,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.560
odds are we're gonna be alright tonight.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.680
The odds are that we

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.060
will probably be alright.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.000
Odds are we're gonna be alright,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.160
Odds are we're gonna be alright for another night.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.200
Hit by the A-train.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
Crashed in an airplane.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.700
I wouldn't recommend either one.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.280
Killed by a great white,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.520
or a meteorite.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.600
I guess there ain't no way to go that's fun.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.460
But somewhere in the world

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.160
someone is going to fall in love by the end of this song.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.340
So get up, get up,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.700
No it's never gonna let up,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.860
so you might as well sing along.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.040
The odds are that we

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660
will probably be alright.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.580
Odds are we're gonna be alright.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.260
Odds are we're gonna be alright tonight.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.140
The odds are that we

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.680
will probably be alright.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.540
Odds are we're gonna be alright,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.640
odds are we're gonna be alright for another night.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.620
Sure things go wrong.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.400
But I'll take my chances odds are long.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.100
So why not

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.100
play?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.100
Stuck by lightning,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.340
sounds pretty frightening.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.640
But you know the chances are so small.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.140
Hit by the A-train.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.400
Crashed in an airplane.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.840
Better chance you're gonna buy it at the mall.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.900
But it's a 23 or 4-to-1

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.160
that you could fall in love by the end of this song.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.440
So get up, get up,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.680

will probably be alright.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.580
Odds are we're gonna be alright,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.200
odds are we're gonna be alright tonight.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.200

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.660
will probably be alright.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.520
Odds are we're gonna be alright,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.320
odds are we're gonna be alright tonight.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.100
The odds are that we

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.640
will probably be alright.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.580
