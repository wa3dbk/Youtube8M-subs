Hello hello, my name is Echo

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.140
and today I'm going to show you how to draw yourself in the style of the glorious cartoon: Adventure Time. 
YEAH! ENTHUSIASM!

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.520
Let's get started! The first step in drawing yourself in any style is to figure out and define what YOU look like.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.740
I know it sounds kind of silly, but just go with it. 
If you were a character in Adventure Time,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.600
what would you look like? Do you have curly hair or straight hair? Do you have long hair or short hair?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.500
What kind of clothes do you wear? Do you wear tank tops or hoodies? Do you wear t-shirts?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.620
It helps to make a list of all of the things that define you as a visual "character". 
Take me for example,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000
I wear a lot of red and black. I usually wear things with sleeves.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.520
I love clothes with hoods. Usually have side bangs

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.040
but I always have these things hanging down by the sides of my face.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.540
And if my hair isn't down then it's usually in a ponytail. The next thing you'll need to do is define your body type.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.540
Maybe you have curves like Fiona, or maybe you're tall &amp; thin like Marceline. There are lots of characters in the show that you can take inspiration from.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.940
Sometimes it can be helpful to have a picture of yourself as a reference.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.520
Once you have a list of characteristics that define your personal appearance

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.960
then we can start drawing! All great works of art begin with a circle. This will become your head.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.500
After you have the circle that's going to become your face you need to move on to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.100
the rough outline of the body. Once you have the basic outline of the head and the torso, then you can add the neck and arms and legs.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.890
This will give you a base to start with. Something very distinct about the Adventure Time style

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.660
Is that the arms in general are very noodley.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
Very technical term there, Echo...

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.040
If you're not completely comfortable with drawing the basic figure for your character

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.860
or it's just not coming out the way that you want it to,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.480
You can always Google image search 
"Adventure Time base".

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.860
This will bring up tons of images of the basic form for Adventure Time characters

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.580
Tracing other people's work is a fantastic way to start to LEARN a style. When you find an image you like you can print it out

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.480
and then trace over it, or you can just put your paper directly on the screen and trace it from there.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.940
Just be careful not to break it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.740
[glass cracking sound]

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.180
Once you have a base in pencil, then you can start adding your features. For me, we would add my ponytail, my side bangs,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.790
my side hair,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.110
What do you call those things?

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.679
And then we would move on to the face. Usually Adventure Time characters don't have noses

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.960
except for the Ice King, who has enough nose for everyone.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.020
you get it?...

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.560
cuz he's got a big nose?.. okay...

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.380
Usually Adventure Time characters just have two black dots for the eyes. Next for my character

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.620
I'm going to be adding my black tank top and my red a black jacket because

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.679
everything I wear, and everything I own, is black and red because one day it just took over like a disease.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.060
moving on

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.429
Remember when you're drawing your Adventure Time character that you should only have four fingers, because no one's had five fingers for 20 Blabillion glaybels!

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.720
Then once you have a completed pencil sketch

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.820
Just go over it with pen, wait for it to dry, and then erase your pencil marks. After that you get to color it in however you want!

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.520
Personally I like coloring my sketches digitally.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.040
Awesome! Finished! Now you can make creepy fanfiction comics with your favorite characters! And now, for the sake of an added example,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.280
I'm going to be drawing a couple of my YouTube friends in the Adventure Time style.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.180
SWIPE LEFT

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.980
