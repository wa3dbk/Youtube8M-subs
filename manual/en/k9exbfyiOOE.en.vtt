00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
Hi my friends, look: Today we will

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.710
transfer any image, photo,
a drawing,

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.989
a fabric okay? and to do so
let's do

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.269
it will be mixed

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.679
tail with water (two parts water and
tail) for a glue very

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.599
weak right?

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.470
This glue we will

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.079
use

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.419
and we will put all the
surface of a sheet

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.550
by looking good

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.790
spot especially in the corners

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.460
and edges.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.610
In this paper we will put up one
cloth. In this case is a fabric

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.240
blanquita as possible and as
thin as possible. After this the fabric would spend

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.890
any time

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.800
we want to work

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.040
the pegariamos, or coserÃ­amos
the work we do.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.970
Once you have stretched well

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.130
we put a load off and
let dry.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.380
Once we have done this to us
we go to the printer,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.420
and we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.600
is

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.410
cloth paper

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.320
in the printer. We will put in the
position your printer

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.030
ask us to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.940
to print. In this case the fabric
I have set up. If your printer

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.810
asks down ... down.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.140
You go to your computer,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.040
choose the photo or drawing, or letters you want

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.520
print

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.310
and we'll print how?

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.390
With the system

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.540
normal, as if what you should do in any
another color document

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.700
and full-page okay?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.830
My printer is a normal printer,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.150
not laser,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.510
nor is industrial, nothing. Is a
printer

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.370
we normal
any of us

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.140
home.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.230
So should yours
equal work.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.720
Well, now it's just
wait for the printer

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.020
go doing their job.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.780
I also wanted to say that this type
what jobs you can wash

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.309
hand perfectly.

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.579
Obviously I would not put the
or washing with bleach

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.219
but if it gets dirty

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.539
yes you can wash it with no problems, so

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.389
It can be perfectly

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.589
to use it to make a
cushion, to

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.879
make a bag or

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.759
for any other things.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.240
Notice that rather than remaining!

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.790
What is surprising?

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.319
Me and love this system
download photos

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.609
to the fabric. Now simply
We took off and as we have done

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.519
the glue was very weak

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.139
it comes off too easily.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.279
And we have the job done.

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:49.779
Yes now

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.619
only you need to

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.019
paste

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.259
or sew fabric

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.319
on the job you want. I am
I sure this will serve to

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.309
do a lot of things.

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:06.999
I hope you liked it, I hope you do, and here I leave some

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.469

other jobs. Please give me subscribe
