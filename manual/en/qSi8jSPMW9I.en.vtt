Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village. I'm going
to show you how to make a birthday cake pop

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.000
card. This pop up card uses a slightly different
technique where you use a single sheet of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.901
a card stock. You really need card stock for
this technique. I'm going to use a half sheet.

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:26.769
So here is my half sheet of card stock, you
need a exacto knife, a pair of scissors, some

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:38.290
marking pencils, some pens or decorative pencils
to do some accent, a ruler and a simple pattern

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.080
of a birthday cake. We are going to start
with our half sheet of card stock. You want

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.540
to fold that in half so you want to match
the corners exactly and hold those down. Then

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:02.230
just slide your hands to the edge and crease
that line. Now turn it over and on the back

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.799
we are going to measure a inch and a half
from the center on both sides. I'm going to

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.499
mark this, this is a dark card stock I'm going
to mark it with a white marking pencil. I'm

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.170
going to mark another inch and a half there
and a inch and a half there. I'm going to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:27.380
move down, we are going a inch and a half
from the center. A inch and a half here and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:38.049
a inch and a half here, and just draw a line
through your two dots. Not too dark cause

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.819
later you will want to erase that, if you
don't want to see those lines. Okay so now

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:56.280
you have two lines there. Now take your pattern
and we are going to trace it but we are only

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.279
going to trace the outside of the birthday
cake. You put the center we folded up our

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:11.580
pattern in half exactly and we are going to
place that half crease right in the center

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.069
crease of the card. We are only going to trace
the outside of the cake. From everything outside

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:28.100
of the line that you mark. So anything that
over laps and is outside of that and you are

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:38.579
just going to trace that much. There and then
place that back and do trace only the other

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:52.010
side. Everything on the outside of the line.
So you have something that looks like that.
