The President:
Hi everybody.

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:03.861
This World AIDS Day
we commemorate how far

00:00:03.861 --> 00:00:07.465
we've come in the fight
against HIV AIDS, remember

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:10.101
those we've lost, and commit
ourselves to the work

00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:12.337
we still have to do.

00:00:12.337 --> 00:00:13.971
Today more people are
receiving lifesaving

00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.873
treatment that
ever before.

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:18.576
Millions of infections
have been prevented.

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:20.345
And around the world
people with HIV

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:22.280
are living full and
healthy lives with

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.515
the dignity and
respect they deserve.

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:27.185
We're closer than we've
ever been to achieving

00:00:27.185 --> 00:00:30.688
the extraordinary; an
AIDS- free generation.

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.624
But we've got to keep
fighting, all of us.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.326
Governments, businesses,
foundations,

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.162
community groups, and
individuals like you.

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.299
We've got to stay
focused and committed.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.002
Science is on our side,
momentum is on our side.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.805
It's up to us to
finish the job.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.675
The United States is
committed to doing our part.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:54.412
Through Pepfar we're helping
more than 7.7 million

00:00:54.412 --> 00:00:56.914
people worldwide receive
lifesaving treatment.

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:59.550
This year we provided HIV
testing and counselling

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.687
to more than 14 million
pregnant women.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:05.656
Among those who tested
positive, 95 percent

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:08.426
of their babies
were born HIV free.

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:10.528
And we provided testing
and counselling for

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.297
nearly 57 million people
and care for more than

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:16.033
five million orphans and
vulnerable children.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.569
We're proud of the work we're
doing at home and abroad.

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.905
And we're going to do more
of it because we know

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:23.941
that HIV AIDS affects all
of us no matter where

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.676
we live or who we are.

00:01:25.676 --> 00:01:27.678
And we know it's our
responsibility,

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:29.814
it's part of our common
humanity to help

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:32.383
get medicine to the
people who need it.

00:01:32.383 --> 00:01:34.886
On this World AIDS Day
let's remember all

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.189
the heroes whose hard
work brought us this far.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.392
Doctors and caregivers,
scientists and social workers,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:46.130
mothers, fathers, and
activists of all kinds.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.666
Let's remember the brave men
and women in West Africa

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.035
fighting another disease
right now, ebola.

00:01:51.035 --> 00:01:53.104
They need our help too.

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.772
And let's recommit
ourselves to achieving

00:01:54.772 --> 00:01:57.775
an AIDS- free generation
in our lifetimes.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:01:59.977
It's a goal worthy
of our best efforts.

00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:01.746
And it's finally
within reach.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.514
So let's get it done.

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:05.716
To all of you dedicated
to this cause and to all

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:08.786
of you fighting this
disease on the front lines,

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:10.154
I want to say thank you.
