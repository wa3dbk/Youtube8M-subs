00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.560
You'll need scissors, a flat screwdriver, and
tweezers or needle nose pliers for this job

Step 2: Select the slat that is even with the
windowsill

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.509
or slightly below it. This will be the
new bottom slat of the blind.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.540
Step 3:

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.730

bottom rail.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.810

cords and save them for step 6.

and let the excess blind fall away. Your
blind

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.960

Step 5: There are three cords. The
braided leather cord,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.030
the connecting cords, and the smooth lift
cords.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.010
Pull the lift cords free at the slats
below then

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.880
remove the excess slats below the new
bottom slat.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.430
Step 6:

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.430

For the moment do not insert

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.510
plugs into the holes.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.190
Step 7: trim away any excess ladder cord

bottom rail reinsert the plug into the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.859
