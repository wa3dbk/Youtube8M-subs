00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.700
Must I seriously do it?

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.380
You don't seem too willing about it.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.780
That's a given. Because I'm not troubled at all.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.560
■ But I am. ■
That's a given. Because I'm not troubled at all.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.920
That's a given. Because I'm not troubled at all.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.170
...Ah, I see...

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.350
H-Hold it. What's with that attitude of yours? Aren't you the one that isn't willing?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.220
...No, it's because you're just not willing to do it... That's why I don't know what to do.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.400
I-I didn't say I'm not doing it.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.580
As usual, I don't understand what she's really thinking at all.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.670
Come to think of it... my memory loss, you probably fabricated all of it right?

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.920
Yes, I'm sure that's it!

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.670
■ Everything I've said is real! ■
Yes, I'm sure that's it!

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.930
Sorry about that, but everything is the truth!

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.050
Guh... It feels that I'm getting to think the same if you keep putting it that way...

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.280
Oh!? Could this be brainwashing!?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.270
That's not it!

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.350
Well, don't you feel terrible knowing that you are missing a piece of your memory?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.120
Well, more or less I feel the way.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.870
However, I don't have any regrets if it's my otaku memories.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.600
■ Are you serious? ■
However, I don't have any regrets if it's my otaku memories.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.320
Hey Kirino. Are those words... your true feelings?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.820
True feelings, super true feelings.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.320
.........

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.400
W-Why are you giving me the serious look...? Uwah, don't get all teary-eyed!

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.820
All right. Five minutes will do. If you don't like it you can give it up. So please chat with the two of them.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.620
Hmph... if I say I don't want to?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.150
■ What are you saying!? ■
Hmph... if I say I don't want to?

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.070
What are you saying!? Hurry up and sit in front of the computer.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.170
W-What's that supposed to be, an order?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.050
I am capable of anything for the sake of recovering your memories.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.480
A-Anything...

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.660
Tch, you've got some nerve even if you're clearly a pervert.
