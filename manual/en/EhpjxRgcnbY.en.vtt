00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.120
We're going to do a little skippity do die
here. And go from our insular half uncial.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.400
Jump over, what we call the Carolingian minuscule.
And make our way to a book hand, 11th through

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.440
15th centuries that or there abouts. And it's
what I, what I'm going to call the Northern

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.920
Gothic. And this sample that I'm going to
show you, is very generic. O.k. Here is a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.850
beautiful book, The Glories of the Tre's Riches
Heures Du Duc De Berry. O.k. And if you can

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.780
get your hands on this book. This book has
beautiful examples of that hand. With incredibly

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.359
rich illumination. But the Gothic hand is
another one of those hands. Sometimes, it's

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:56.079
referred to as black letter. In type, it would
be referred to as black letter. And that terminology

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.530
comes from the fact that the letters were
so densely created. So densely drawn. That

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:17.509
the whole look of the page actually started
to be like black. So

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.509
again, what you have, is a letter that. Is
kind of, scrunched this way and scrunched

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.220
this. And pulled that way. And with lots and
lots of angles. And you know what? It's a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.320
pretty easy letter to draw, compared to the
Roman for example. And yes, we are now at

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.509
a point on history. When we have very distinct
upper and lower case letters. Only we call

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.859
them, majuscule and miniscule. Get to about
here. And then you've got to pull over. Come

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:57.830
down and then down this way. The counter should
be same with, as the broad edge. Counters

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.659
in between the letters. The spaces in between
the letter need to be even. You know what,

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.490
sometimes they would put this little bit of
a, sort of a hook like thing. On the ascender,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.140
just to, just to give a little indication
to the eye of the reader. That is is in fact

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.000
an ascender.
