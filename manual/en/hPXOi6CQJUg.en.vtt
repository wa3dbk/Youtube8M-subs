00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.960
Hey everyone.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.170
I’m gonna talk about creating an interesting
bed of droning tracks today.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.910
How I’m gonna go about doing this is using
this Fulltone Tape Echo.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
On the floor i have Keeley Comprssor and I
have an Electro-Harmonix Freeze Pedal.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.310
Between these three devices and the volume
knob on this Fender Stratocaster, I’m gonna

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.520
create a whole bed of tracks that altogether
are gonna be automated and almost create like

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.610
an orchestra of ambient sounds.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.059
Now how I’m doing this is basically the
Keeley pedal, the compressor, I’m just using

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.379
that to get some sustain because I’m playing
completely clean, so to get some sustain out

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.010
of the guitar I have the compressor on pretty
hot.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.930
So just when I play a note — or swell a
note it just grabs it.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.020
Now the freeze pedal I use sometimes.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.300
If you don’t know what the freeze pedal
does, it grabs just a minuscule snapshot of

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.559
your tone and just holds it like a drone.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.130
Almost kind of gets like an organ-y type of
sound to it when you grab a note or chord.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.440
I’m just gonna be grabbing notes because
I’m gonna create chords, right?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.170
So we have three chords that I’m gonna be
arranging feedback loops for here.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.280
So I’m gonna lay out feedback loops for
three different chords and from there, I’m

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.540
gonna automate them in and out.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.300
So it means for a G chord I’m gonna lay
out the root, 3rd, 5th, and octave and I’m

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.970
also gonna do that for a C chord and a D chord.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.439
After I get all that done I’m gonna go through
and I’m gonna automate the intervals, so

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.700
when your chords change, whenever I need them
to change, the feedback loops will change.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.659
In Logic what I did was I set up a bunch of
tracks you’ll be able to see here and I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.420
labeled it what note and what interval it’s
going to be.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:02.400
I’m using an amp simulator on the main track,
and that is this Softube Vintage Amp Room.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.909
To prevent myself from having like 30 instances
of this plugin open, I got the sound I really

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:15.720
wanted on this first track here that the guitar
is going into from my Avid Mbox.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.390
From there I set the output of the track to
bus one.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.420
So each of these following tracks that I set
up for the root, 3rd, 5th, octave, are all

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.590
gonna be set to the input of bus one.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.140
Meaning that it’s gonna record the sound
that’s coming out of this first track.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.250
And I don’t have to have multiple instances
of Vintage Amp Room open.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.550
Saves some CPU juice.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.000
Let me give you an example of how I’m gonna
do this.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.360
I’m gonna set up an 8 bar loop.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.240
Let me explains hat each of these components
do.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.480
So the freeze pedal, watch what happens when
I hit a note.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.590
[guitar + freeze pedal]

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:20.330
And I grab it with the freeze, hands are free,
you hear how it sustains that note.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.330
A little reed-y, organ-ish.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.330
The delay, you can hear it do kind of warbly
weird things, distort, alright.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.030
I might do a combination of these two.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.050
So I might get something cool happening with
the freeze pedal.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.160
[guitar + freeze pedal + delay]

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:49.960
And I’m gonna set it up now, I’m gonna
do the third which is a B note for a G chord.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:04:13.020
Ok, we’re gonna follow this through with
each interval that I want to add to the chord.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.299
The 5th, and I might actually change some
of the delay settings up here — the times.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.170
Ok if I just wanted to listen back to this
chord.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:37.990
I’m going to hear all the tracks together
that I just recorded.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.580
And I just created a 4 bar loop out of the
8 bar loop that I’m just gonna have cycle

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.220
over and over again and we’re gonna work
from there.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.340
It’s not completely smoothed out yet but
we’re just starting to get the idea together.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.969
[ambient guitar drones]

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:07.090
You kind of just really hear it, it’s kind
of just a collage of each thing, tones, textures.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.669
As you’ll notice I have recorded a bunch
of tracks here and there’s some automation

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.939
that I was messing around with — moving
some of the notes around.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.669
Let’s first listen to the notes that would
just be in the straight G chord.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:40.270
If I solo any one of these you can hear root,
third, fifth, octave, alright.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.039
Same thing for a C chord.

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:53.810
And I have a D chord over here as well.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.669
Now this is different than using a keyboard
to create chords with samples on it because

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:07.349
what’s unique about this is each one of
these loops that were recorded has some inconstancies

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:14.039
or imperfections which makes them rub against
each other in different ways, different overtones,

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.430
there’s different speeds that the tape echoes
or repeating themselves, and when you combine

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.620
them together it’s just, it creates a little
bit more of a imperfect industrial kind of

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.689
ambient sound than just using a synth pad.

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:40.370
Where it really gets fun is if we pull up
a section of the song and we — I’m gonna

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.581
set up like a G chord and I’m gonna show
you a few things that like we can turn it

00:06:44.581 --> 00:06:46.580
into other chords.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.529
Here’s a G chord.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.740
With a third.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:07:00.781
I can very easily turn this into a G-Sus,
Sus-4 there right now.

00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:02.120
Put the 3rd back in.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:23.100
Turn it into a Major 7 by adding the F sharp
which is the 13th chord in.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.379
Turn that into a 9th chord.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:32.080
Add an A in.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.939
6th chord.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:43.830
So there’s a lot of options if you know
music theory that you can play this like an

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.270
instrument.
