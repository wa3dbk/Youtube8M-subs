00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.400
[Traditional Māori instruments (13 secs)]

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.699
[Narrator] Mokoia Island sits in the middle
of Lake Rotorua. It is the setting for the

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.820
most famous Māori love story, Hinemoa and
Tūtānekai.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.160
Hinemoa, a beautiful young woman of noble
birth, belonged to the Tūhourangi people

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.160
who were a subtribe, or hapū, of Rotorua's
Te Arawa tribe. They lived at Ōhinemutu on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.989
the shores of Lake Rotorua. Hinemoa was so
beautiful that young men would instantly fall

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.430
in love with her. But because of her high
rank, her hapū decided they would choose

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.430
her husband.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.150
Tūtānekai was a strong and handsome young
man, who could wield a mere, or club, with

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.150
skill. He was from the Ngāti Whakaue hapū,
and lived on Mokoia Island. Tūtānekai first

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.140
saw Hinemoa when he attended a meeting on
shore. Like other men, he fell in love with

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.400
her at first sight. And she fell in love with
him, even though they were not able to speak

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.619
to each other.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.440
Though Tūtānekai's father was a chief called
Whakaue, he was actually conceived as a result

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.390
of an affair between his mother and a visiting
chief. Tūtānekai's mother was forgiven by

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.710
Whakaue, who brought up the boy as his own
son, but people knew that Tūtānekai was

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.440
illegitimate. Because of this, Hinemoa and
Tūtānekai kept their passion for each other

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.870
secret, because they feared their families
would disapprove.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.760
On returning to Mokoia Island, Tūtānekai
played beautiful yet sad music on his flute.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.870
It wafted across the lake where the lovesick
Hinemoa sat on a rock and listened to the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.870
mournful sounds. Hinemoa's hapū became suspicious
so pulled their canoes up onto the shore so

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.450
that she would have no way to paddle over
to the island and join Tūtānekai.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.060
Eventually Hinemoa could bear it no longer,
and decided to swim across to Mokoia Island.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.049
She took some gourds to help her stay afloat.
When she reached the shore she hid in a hot

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.510
pool. In order to attract Tūtānekai's attention,
each time his servant came by to fill a gourd

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.510
of water, Hinemoa, disguising herself in the
dark, broke it. Eventually Tūtānekai came

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.060
to see what all the fuss was about. He saw
his beloved Hinemoa, and they spent the night

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.879
together.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.219
Though the families initially opposed the
romance, the resulting marriage was eventually

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:52.709
approved and it cemented a strong bond between
the two hapū, creating peace in the Rotorua

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.709
district. This union is still celebrated through
oratory and songs by Te Arawa.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.529
The famous story has spread beyond Rotorua.
A 1913 film, titled Hinemoa, was among the

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.489
first movies shot in New Zealand, and the
words of one of New Zealand's most well-known

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.120
songs, Pokarekare Ana, are often slightly
changed to suit the legend. Te Arawa singer

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.469
Sir Howard Morrison sung the song, as did
Dame Kiri te Kanawa, and Rolf Harris even

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.569
recorded a version.
