00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:20.704
I was blind to the light of day

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:26.671
From all the logic there was no room left

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:33.986
Trembling beside you 
and the drug in me is not yet finished

00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:40.001
I'm breathing you 
and the taste is already bitter

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:46.431
The glance is different 
and the cold is piercing

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:52.905
You're hiding, 
breaking my body

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:59.132
The glance is different 
and the cold is piercing

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:03.460
How another day goes by 
without a breath

00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:09.948
Nighttime comes slowly, 
time stands still

00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:16.511
Nighttime and you 
are the silence that remains

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:27.313
Falling with you for one moment 
at the end of the game...

00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:37.929
(And only the silence that remains)

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.498
With dozen lonely nights 
in my empty bed

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:48.182
Waiting for your touch, 
drying tears instead

00:01:48.183 --> 00:01:50.557
I can't forget them

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.982
Promises you made had no faith

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:57.544
You never really kept them

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:01.493
And now it's goodbye...

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:06.480
Oh, now that love is gone

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.672
Where do I belong?

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:12.326
Was it right or wrong?

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:13.930
Look at me now

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:20.344
Finally I know 
it's time to say goodbye

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:26.766
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:32.709
I can't live the lie, 
no reason to cry

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.462
But now it's just time, ooh... 
(It's time to say goodbye)

00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:46.001
Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:52.059
Can't live the lie, 
no reason to cry

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:04.393
But now it's just time, oh...

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:07.606
(And now it's time to say goodbye).
