NARRATOR:

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.950
The Pacific Northwest provides beautiful places
for recreation, with outstanding scenery and

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.970
wildlife viewing.
We hope for safe and healthy interactions

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.830
for people and wildlife.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.029
The U.S. Forest Service, the National Park
Service, and Washington and Oregon Departments

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.419
of Fish &amp; Wildlife
would like to offer this advice when recreating

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.980
in areas that mountain goats call home.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.510
Hiking, camping, and climbing in mountain
goat country provides great challenges and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.260
personal rewards.
it also presents opportunities to interact

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.579
with mountain goats.
These encounters can be either positive or

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.289
negative experiences, depending on the behavior
of people AND goats.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.600
Interaction between goats and people has been
observed for years.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.429
These wildlife experts have some practical
advice to guide these interactions:

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.110
So what our job to do is to both observe the
mountain goat behavior,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.360
and also how the visiting public interact
with mountain goats when they encounter them

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.710
on the trail.
What we are going to be looking for is how

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.869
close those goats approach people,
and also how close the people approach goats.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.799
I want to point out three aspects of goat
biology that are integral

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.659
to setting up the situation that we are concerned
about: the interactions between goats and

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.520
people.
The first is what we are seeing here: this

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.060
very steep terrain is where goats like to
spend time.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
This is their way of getting away from predators.
Unlike some species that get away from predators

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.380
by running,
goats will be very happy to stay in this kind

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.039
of area. So they don't necessarily run from
people.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.070
A second aspect of goat biology is their natural hunger for salt

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.170
that occurs principally in the late spring/early
summer -- May, June, July - this time of

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.939
year.
Many places goats are attracted to natural

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.359
salt licks where they'll spend time.
People are another source of salt for goats.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.750
The third piece of the puzzle that is of somewhat a concern is that,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.820
despite the facts that goats may appear to be
docile and very gentle creatures, within goat

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.630
society, they're actually pretty aggressive. Goats

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.710
do a fair amount of defending their own turf,
butting each other with their horns. So that,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.980
should that situation occur with people
getting too close, there is some danger from

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.319
goats because they can be fairly
aggressive with each other -- they're generally

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.260
not aggressive with people,
but they have the capability to become rather

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.379
belligerent.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.379
I'm standing here on the top of Mt. Ellinor,
just made a long hike up to the peak here.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.950
As you can see it's a pretty small area
up here. There's not a lot of room to maneuver.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.989
There's not a lot of room for people AND
goats. So that's why it's important for

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.200
us,
when we're up here, to hold this ground

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.690
for ourselves, because to allow goats in here
would be too much into our personal space.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.760
So the first thing I always like to do is
just to make sure that I account for my gear,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.760
and then my gear is secure and not providing
its own set of attractants for the goats.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.250
My clothes have sweat on them by the time
I am up here - my pack straps and my hiking

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.010
pole straps.
So I want to keep that stuff near me and make

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.680
sure that I'm not separated from it too
much

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.090
so that the goats can get at it and chew on
it because, number one, it could ruin my gear,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.090
but also provides them with a bad example
if I allow them access to that.

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.230
So that if I see a mountain goat up here,
the first thing I am going to do is just

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.579
start talking to it in a regular voice and
letting it know that I am here, and trying

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.640
to get it to move off,
because there is just not enough room for

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.200
us both to be on this peak together.
It's really tight quarters and that has

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.849
recipe for a bad situation if I let it get
too close.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.909
So, I'm gonna just start talking to it saying,
"Hey, goat. Hey, goat. Go on. Get out of

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.549
here."
Try to use just as low a voice as I can to

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.719
get it to move off.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.780
If it doesn't move off, I raise my voice
and create more movement, and so forth.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.319
Really, don't be afraid to yell. I mean,
project your voice out there:

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.890
"Hey! Get out of here! Go! Go!" Really,
really project it out there.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.400
None of this stuff is rocket science.Its just
about making your presence known.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.300
It's stuff that anybody can do: just letting
the animal know you are there, standing firm,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.180
standing your ground if it does try to approach
you up here.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.620
And if necessary, picking up some small rocks
and throwing them in their direction.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.509
It's kind of asserting your right to exist
and have your own personal space up here.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.820
What we're recommending in order to keep
goats wild and people safe is:

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.570
Never allow goats human food. Number one:
don't feed them.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.139
Try to avoid allowing goats salt, either from
your body, your pack, clothing.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.699
Urinate off the trail so that the trail doesn't
become a long attractant for the goats.

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.699
In summer, when goats are attracted to salt,
and they approach you in an insistent way,

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.710
stand your ground, yell, wave your arms, be
aggressive toward the goat in that situation.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.990
However, once summer passes: if you are in
the autumn and there's a goat that's approaching

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.220
you closely,
particularly if you can tell it's a male

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.090
goat -- a billy goat -- at that point
we are recommending that you it space. Don't

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.690
challenge it because it may, in fact, challenge
you back.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.410
You don't want to get into an aggressive
situation with a male goat in the fall.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.500
So give it plenty of room -- as much as you
can because, at that point, it is no longer

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.650
interested in salt:
It may actually view you as a competitor for

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.020
mates.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.389
NARRATOR:

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.330
To summarize, please follow these guidelines
to keep goats wild:

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.620
Keep your distance and stay at least 50 yards
away from them, half the length of a football

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.169
field.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.509
If a mountain goad approaches, slowly move
away from it to keep a safe distance.

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.849
If it continues to approach, stand your ground,
chase it off by yelling,

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.449
waving a piece of clothing or throwing small
rocks.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.150
In the fall give mountain goats more space
and move out of their way.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.860
Never surround, crowd, chase or follow a mountain
goat.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.620
Maintain control of your companion pets.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.819
Do not feed the mountain goats or allow them
to lick your skin or backpack.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.199
If you need to urinate while hiking or camping,
please go away from the trail to avoid leaving

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.940
concentrations of salt and minerals near the
trail.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.919
All of our goal is to welcome the public to
both the park and the forest,

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.139
and to enjoy your recreation opportunities,
because it is YOUR national park

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.190
and YOUR national forest, and to enjoy wildlife that inhabit these

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.759
areas in an appropriate way,
and have a safe and fun visit. And also know

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.150
where to go if you have problems:
to let us know if you encounter mountain goats,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.419
especially those that are behaving in an aggressive
manner.
