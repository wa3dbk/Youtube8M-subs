Live long...

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.060
And prosper.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.584
No.

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:54.140
[ kirk ]
we are assembled here today...

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.143
To pay final respects
to our honored dead.

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:07.653
And yet it should be noted that
in the midst of our sorrow...

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:11.022
This death takes place
in the shadow of new life...

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.608
The sunrise
of a new world,

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:17.746
A world that our beloved
comrade gave his life
to protect and nourish.

00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:22.468
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one,

00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:26.755
And we will not debate
his profound wisdom
at these proceedings.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.911
Of my friend,
I can only say this.

00:01:37.517 --> 00:01:41.821
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:43.805
His was the most...

00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:49.094
Human.

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:53.398

honors... Hup.
