00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.800
(soft music)

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.040
- [Curtis Smith] Welcome back, I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.953
We have a letter from Allen in Los Lunas

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:12.734
who says, "How do I save
seed from my garden?"

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.532
You know, there are a lot of
plants you grow in a garden,

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:15.712
a lot of things you can do, and Ron,

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:17.174
you said you had some chilies here

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:18.904
that you wanted to save the seed from.

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:20.936
Why'd you want to save these seed?

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:22.532
- [Ron Jobe] Curtis, this is a very hot chili.

00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:24.716
I got this last year and I really

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.128
liked the taste of the chili,

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.414
and it was a good productive.

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:29.817
I look for a robust vine,

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:32.030
and one that has a lot of pods on it,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.784
and these are the ones that
I will save for my seed.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:37.516
- [Curtis] Those are fully
red and maturing very well?

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.751
- [Ron] Right, and even
if they dry on the vine,

00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.918
as long as the pods don't
burst, that's a good indication.

00:00:46.192 --> 00:00:47.299
- Okay.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.782
While we're here, let's go
look at some other things

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.773
he might want to save
from his garden, too,

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:53.760
and the reasons, you know,
it's got the flavor you want,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.999
the pods you like.

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:55.832
And I see squash.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:57.236
Some people want to save squash seed.

00:00:57.236 --> 00:00:59.451
Now, a lot of squash are hybrids,

00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:02.559
and so we really shouldn't
save our seed from hybrids.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.246
But if you've got one
that you did want to save

00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:06.562
that's not a hybrid
type squash, you'd look.

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:08.746
This one, this is a yellow
zucchini you've got?

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:10.188
- [Ron] That's a yellow zucchini.

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:11.855
- [Curtis] Okay, and so it's yellow.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.384
The color's still bright
yellow, it's not ready,

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:17.543
but this one over here
has begun to turn orange.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.768
- [Ron] Yeah, that one's more mature.

00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:20.601
- And so this is one that you'd

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.047
want to be collecting or even let it go

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:23.388
a little longer than this.

00:01:23.388 --> 00:01:24.770
Don't collect 'em too early.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.436
Right now, I can press
it with my thumbnail,

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.133
and it's giving some, but my thumbnail's

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.571
not breaking through it, so
kind of like a winter squash,

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.267
you can determine when they're ready

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.658
by using your thumbnail.

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:37.774
And then you've also got
some gourds we could look at.

00:01:37.774 --> 00:01:38.911
Some people like to grow gourds,

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.757
and that's a good one to save seed from.

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.424
- Yeah, I grow birdhouse gourds.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.240
They're real easy to
grow, and it's easy to,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.640
I'm lettin' 'em dry on the vine right now.

00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:54.050
- I see.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.253
Still heavy and still
soft, so they're too early

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:59.087
to take the seed out of
this, but once they've dried,

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:01.041
you can take the seed from a gourd

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.927
and replant them next year.

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:04.258
- [Ron] Right.

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:06.483
- Okay, and then some people like flowers,

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:08.677
and flowers are a good
one to save seed from

00:02:08.677 --> 00:02:11.135
But again, you have to be
careful if they're hybrid,

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:14.581
if they're a variety that has
to come back from bought seed,

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:15.839
you don't want to save 'em.

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.739
But you have some marigolds,
let's go look at those.

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.739
- All right.

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:23.830
- [Curtis] Well, Ron, you got a lot

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.839
of marigolds blooming here.

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:25.822
This is a pretty one.

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.503
- [Ron] Yeah, this is the
wife's flower garden here.

00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:31.125
- Look at these, you know,
a lot of nice flowers,

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.691
some that aren't ready to harvest yet.

00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:35.574
And if I look in here,
we'll find something

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:39.292
that, there we go, here's
one that's beginning to dry.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.215
So we can break that off,
and if we open it up,

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.714
we'll find the marigold seed inside.

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:46.373
Just a matter of cleaning those out,

00:02:46.373 --> 00:02:49.227
taking these with a black
seed, setting them aside,

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:50.680
saving them in a dry, cool place

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.240
until next year to plant 'em.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.850
Some people just scatter
'em in the garden right now

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.145
and they're ready to go.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:57.710
And I notice you've got zinnias here.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.732
Some of these have finished flowering.

00:02:59.732 --> 00:03:01.430
You got some dry flowers,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.243
and their seed are a little different.

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:05.108
Let's see if we've got
any mature ones in here.

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.108
There we go.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:13.134
And these will be, again,
a black seed, much broader,

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:14.454
and these are the ones
you want to clean out

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:16.659
from all the other chaff.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.630
Clean 'em up, save 'em
in a cool, dry place

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.905
until next spring and
you can plant them again.

00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:23.625
- [Ron] Yes, a lot of
people save flower seeds.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.458
- They're fun.
- They are.

00:03:24.458 --> 00:03:26.040
- And you get all kinds of differences

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.149
from ones you grow.

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.794
And I see you've got some cosmos over here

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:30.440
that look like it has
some mature seed on it,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.554
and again, that has a
different kind of seed.

00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:37.128
Beautiful flowers, that's a little bit

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:38.698
of powdery mildew, but this one right here

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.477
looks like it's got some really good seed,

00:03:40.477 --> 00:03:42.107
and it shatters very easily,

00:03:42.107 --> 00:03:44.671
so just that touch and the seed fall out.

00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:47.111
And again, it's these black seed here.

00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:52.048
Clean the chaff up, save the
seed in a cool, dry place,

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:54.567
and that's all you need to do.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.068
Okay, and for the chilies
though, it's a little more work.

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:01.287
We need to take those
seed out of the chili pod

00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:03.680
and get them dried out before
we put 'em in any container.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.848
Let's go see how you do that.

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:05.681
- Okay.

00:04:08.184 --> 00:04:09.633
- Well, Ron, here are
these pods you picked

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:12.348
just a few minutes ago, hot chilies.

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.494
Now, I've touched 'em, my
nose is gonna start burnin'.

00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:17.587
- Yeah, these are real
hot chilies, Curtis.

00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:20.241
I usually let the pod dry
before I take the seed out,

00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:22.874
but for today, I'm gonna open one up

00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:25.937
and show the seed inside,

00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:28.386
and try to keep from burnin' my hands.

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:29.219
(Curtis laughs)

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:33.743
I advise anybody to use
rubber gloves doin' this.

00:04:33.743 --> 00:04:35.779
- [Curtis] Well, the
seed are fully formed.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.841
- [Ron] And there's more
seed up towards the stem

00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:38.928
than there is at the bottom.

00:04:38.928 --> 00:04:40.269
- [Curtis] Of course, that's
where it's the hottest, too.

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.102
- [Ron] Right.

00:04:41.102 --> 00:04:43.360
- So be careful, wear gloves
when you're doin' that,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.226
but you can harvest the seed.

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:45.506
You could take 'em out now and store 'em,

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:47.304
but the simple thing to
do is let the pods dry,

00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:49.732
then just crumble 'em up, as you said,

00:04:49.732 --> 00:04:53.318
wearing rubber gloves,
and then separate the seed

00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:54.239
from the chaff.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.072
- Right.

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:57.721
- Then you can store 'em,
again, in a cool and dry place

00:04:57.721 --> 00:04:58.889
until you're ready to plant 'em.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.931
- Right, but the secret
is, you want the seed dry

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:02.922
before you store it, or it'll mold on you.

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:04.748
- It will mold if you don't dry it first,

00:05:04.748 --> 00:05:06.265
and that's with all seed.

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:07.098
Ron, thank you.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:08.530
A lot of people like to save seeds,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.354
and these were some that
you had handy for use,

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:11.969
and there are a lot of other
things people can save,

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.895
but the key is, don't use a hybrid.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:14.728
Thank you, sir.

00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:17.720
- Thank you for coming down, Curtis.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.360
(soft music)
