00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.280
Visiting schools throughout
the country for his recent report,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.560
Sir Peter Williams observed
much existing good practice

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.560
in mathematics.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.480
However, his review
does identify some key areas

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.320
where maths learning
could be significantly improved.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.520
One school
that particularly impressed Sir Peter

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.200
is the inappropriately named
Weeke Primary in Winchester.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.960
So what are they doing at Weeke
to strengthen their maths teaching?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800
What are they doing
to make maths real?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.840
Alice the camel had five humps.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.040
Alice the camel had five humps.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.040
Alice the camel had five humps.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.800
So does Alice go...

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880
I think here
where we're most successful,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.440
we do get the child right
at the heart of the learning

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.920
and the children can see
that the teacher knows them well,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.440
they've taken the time
and the trouble

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.960
to A) find out
what their interests are

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.320
but then to put that into planning.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.680
And that takes time and effort
and children appreciate that,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.080
they realise that
their own interests are being used

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.040
to help with their learning.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.840
So that relationship between
the children and the teacher

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.400
is what makes a success.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.800
Okay, so hands ready.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880
So we go down...

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.840
What I always try and do is start off
the lesson with a warm-up exercise,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.680
some sort of breathing, some sort of
active standing up, clapping,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.960
anything really just
to get the children on the ball.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.720
Then we tend to do a song, anything
that has counting in it really

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.080
that the children
can get up and enjoy singing.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.240
Then before I start the main input
of whatever the lesson's going to be,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.480
I will do some sort of number work.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.080
Can you show me two?

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.560
Two.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.480
Show me seven.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.120
Seven. Good girl.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.840
The most important thing
is that the children have fun,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.640
they look forward
to coming to their lessons,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.920
they're energetic and they are
learning through their actions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And 10!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.480
Well done, well done.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
How many spots on this side?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840
Can you show me?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.560
How many spots
on this side of Bill the ladybird?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.760
Show me. What do we do, Sam?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.920
I don't want them to get to Key
Stage 2 and say that they hate maths.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800
I want them to get to Key Stage 2
and really love it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.200
and understand it.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280
How many? Show me.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.240
There's 10. So shall we show
how we do that as a number bond?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.760
We say zero and 10

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.120
equals 10.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.240
I devised these symbols
at the beginning of the year

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.320
alongside the children

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.400
to make the maths
more personal to them

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.000
so that they have ownership
of their mathematical learning

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.760
and I think
it's really worked quite well.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.840
What is an equals sign?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.400
Equals, Sam.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.760
I didn't know when I devised them
how well it would go down,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.720
if they would
actually remember it or not.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.960
But they have and
they have really taken it onboard

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.880
and now
when we're doing any addition,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.280
they use those symbols as well
and it really reinforces the point.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.000
...add nine equals

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.280
10!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.160
Brilliant.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.720
They actually get to get up
and use their bodies

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.840
and they're
always having to think ahead

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.560
which is key in maths.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000
They've not learnt it by rote

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000
because they have
to remember those symbols

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
and where they're going to put them.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.960
Zoe, how many spots on this side?

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.440
Two.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.640
What Sir Peter
particularly liked was the culture.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.120
He liked the fact that fun
and enjoyment and confidence

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.080
underpinned what we do in maths.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280
The teachers have to be relaxed
and confident

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.960
and they have to have fun
teaching the subject.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.080
I'm just going to wait for everyone
to have the right sausages up.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
Three

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.320
add seven

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.880
equals 10!

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.280
There are more smiles
across the corridor

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.760
where Jane is teaching
a mixed Year 3 and 4 class.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.560
Hundreds, 10s and units.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.240
Hundreds, 10s and units.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.800
Numbers in the columns.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.240
Numbers in the columns.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.840
Two lines, two lines.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.760
Two lines, two lines.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.320
- Add.
- Add.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.840
- Add to the right.
- Add to the right.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.640
- Add to the left.
- Add to the left.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.080
- Boing, 10s over.
- Boing, 10s over.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.280
- Boing, hundreds over.
- Boing, hundreds over.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.200
- Pull it under.
- Pull it under.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.040
I want the children to learn

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.760
without knowing
that they're actually learning.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.480
So I think if you make the lesson
really fun and enjoyable,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.960
they forget that they're learning and
they just do it without thinking.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.600
George!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.720
Now using our rap, what's
the next thing we've got to do?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.360
Two lines, two lines.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.680
Two lines, two lines.
Let's put two lines, two lines in.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.560
The success criteria
we developed together as a class

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.360
and we looked at column addition

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.080
and then we wrote lists
on a step-by-step guide

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.600
on how to achieve that.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.080
Add the right, then add the left.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.920
That's to tell you that
first of all you add the units...

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Once we'd done that
we've simplified it

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.120
and then the children
created their own actions

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.840
and their own rap to go with it.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.200
Boing, 10s over

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.320
because you have to put the 10...

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.080
And if they've got a little routine
or a little rap,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.120
then it can help them
work out what the next step is

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560
and just make it a bit easier
for them to get through their work

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.920
rather than panic, I think.
