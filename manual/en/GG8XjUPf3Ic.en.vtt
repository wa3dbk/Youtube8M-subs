SUE: Hi. My name is Sue. I'm with Georgia
Career Institute on behalf of Expert Village,

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.150
and we're going to talk about freehand nail
art today. And now I'm about to show an abstract

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:44.730
design. You can use simple designs to make
a nail look beautiful. And now we're going

00:00:44.730 --> 00:01:07.950
to use the dotter. I put polish on like a
hard surface where I can take my dotter and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:21.310
just dab it in there and start to dot. Make
sure the nail, like the dotter, is touching

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:57.979
the nail, so the polish will come off and
you'll look smaller as it goes up. Okay.
