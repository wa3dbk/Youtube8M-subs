00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.420
This video shows how to resolve common issues
with microphone or audio line-in connections

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.100
on your computer.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.910
Using a microphone with your computer lets
you record audio, or chat with others online.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.759
While many HP computers come with a built
in microphone, there are a variety of external

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.240
audio input devices that you can connect to
your computer through an audio line-in or USB port.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.589
For computers that have analog audio ports,

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.730
the audio line-in port is usually pink and
indicated by a microphone icon. If you are

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.250
using a headset to chat, you will need to
also connect the headphones to the audio-out

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.250
port, which is typically green or indicated
by a headphones icon.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.960
If you are using a USB audio device, connect
it to a USB port on your computer.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.750
To see if your device is recognized by your
computer, type "sound" from the Start screen,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.430
and then select Sound from the search results.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.430
To view your connected audio in devices, click
the Recording tab. If your device is not listed,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.680
right-click an empty area of the Sound window
and click Show Disabled Devices.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.610
Right-click the device you want to enable
it or set it as the default device.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.300
Green bars next to the device name react to sound
and indicate that the microphone is active.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.280
Stereo Mix is the built in audio device used
to record audio originating from your computer.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.170
If you do not want to use audio from applications
on your recording, right-click Stereo Mix

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.950
and select Disable.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.780
You can also find more options by selecting
Properties.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.690
To hear the audio from your microphone make
sure your speakers or headphones have the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.100
volume turned up, click the Listen tab and
check Listen to this device, and then click Apply.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.940
 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.420
Click the Levels tab and move the slider to
adjust the input volume, or press the mute

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.539
button to turn mute on or off.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.859
In the Advanced tab, you can choose the audio
quality, and check whether to allow applications

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.819
to take exclusive control of this device.
Only disable this option if you are having

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.349
audio problems when running more than one
application at a time, such as talking with

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.200
a headset while playing a game online.
When you have finished making changes, click OK.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.900
If you are still having problems with your

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.249
microphone, try updating audio drivers by
typing device manager from the Start screen,

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.969
and then selecting Device Manager from the
search results.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.389
Expand Sound, video and game controllers,
right-click the name of the sound hardware,

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.609
and select Update Driver Software. Click Search
automatically for updated driver software

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.439
and wait for Windows to update the driver
software.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.439
The Recording audio troubleshooting tool can
fix common problems with audio recording.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.439
From the Start screen, type troubleshooting,
and then select Troubleshooting from the search results.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.719
Under Hardware and Sound, click Troubleshoot
audio recording. When the Recording Audio

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:18.719
window opens, click Next. Select the device
you would like to troubleshoot, click Next

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.219
and follow the on-screen instructions.
If you are still experiencing problems, try

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.290
some of the following troubleshooting steps.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.349
Make sure cables are properly connected to
your computer. Even if the microphone is already

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.249
connected, removing and then reconnecting
it might resolve a connection problem.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:42.659
Try connecting the microphone to another computer
to see if it is your computer or the microphone

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.760
that is not working.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.650
Make sure your audio device has power and
replace the batteries if necessary.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.000
If your microphone is not working in only
one application, see if there are updates for that software program.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.159
