00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.440
Throughout DC Comics history, Batman and Superman
have gone toe-to-toe on multiple occasions.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.640
Whatever their reasons, the Dark Knight and
the Man of Steel haven't always been on the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.390
best of terms.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
On the surface, a god-like superhuman with
the Man of Steel's powers would make quick

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.560
work of a billionaire in a cape and cowl;
yet, Bruce Wayne is more than your usual costumed

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.410
vigilante - with more than a few tricks up
his sleeve.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.500
Here are 4 Ways Batman Can Beat The Man of
Steel.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.110
Weaken Superman with Kryptonite

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.180
Although Superman is near-impervious to human
weapons, he does have an Achilles heel: Kryptonite.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.040
Obviously, an invincible Superman wouldn't
be much fun in a fistfight, so Kryptonite

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.870
is always the most likely way to even the
odds.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.659
But viewers have seen Superman weakened by
Kryptonite again and again - meaning Zack

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.260
Snyder will need to find a new (and memorable)
way for Batman to use the alien substance

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.620
to his advantage.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.600
Fortunately, Batman�s cunning has led to
several delivery methods, including Kryptonite

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.160
gas, a Kryptonite ring, or outright Kryptonite
impalement � not to mention a Kryptonite-infused

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.040
Arrow (courtesy of Green Arrow).

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.710
Control Superman with Threats Against Others

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.570
Superman's vulnerability to Kryptonite is
well-known - but it's not his only weakness.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.660
Throughout comic history, Lex Luthor, Batman,
and others have controlled the Man of Steel

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.500
with a threat of violence against innocent
lives - especially those closest to Clark

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.200
Kent.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.210
In John Byrne's "Man of Steel" origin story,
Batman exploits the Kryptonian's bleeding

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.640
heart by promising that a bomb hidden somewhere
in Gotham will detonate should Superman breach

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.200
an invisible field around the Batsuit.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.000
He was bluffing - but Superman couldn't take
the risk.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.420
Thatt might sound far-fetched for some versions
of the superhero - Adam West's Batman would

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.940
never think of sacrificing innocents to hunt
a villain or keep Superman at bay - but other

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.870
versions have been less virtuous.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.989
A crueler Batman might not think twice about
using Clark Kent's love for Lois Lane, or

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.659
the people of Metropolis against him.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.280
Most versions of the Batman have proven to
be willing to do what their fellow heroes

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.170
aren't � and it could work � just as it
did when threatening Darkseid himself (along

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.099
with his entire planet) in "The Supergirl
From Krypton."

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:42.159
Fight Superman with Technology &amp; Gadgets

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:49.639
Brawn doesn't always beat brains, and in Batman
lore, brains come in two varieties: strategy

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.920
and technology.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.120
Movie fans know most of Batman's signature
toys (Batarangs, Bat-vehicles, and Bat-grapple

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.519
guns) but over several decades, Bruce Wayne
has gone from a well-trained vigilante to

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:15.950
a full-on tech genius - 
a man who out-maneuvers opponents in and out

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.200
of his Batsuit, designing some of the most
effective crime fighting weapons and vehicles

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.680
in the entire DC Universe.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.650
Batman employs both in Frank Miller's "The
Dark Knight Returns," setting up Superman

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.980
and Batman�s fight while utilizing a mechanized
Batsuit to take on the Man of Steel.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.540
Since its introduction, the utility belt has
housed laser cutters, smoke pellets, remote

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.420
detonators, and even a collapsible sword - with
Batman�s cowl sporting night vision, sonar

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.069
detection, and instant environmental analysis
via Bat Computer uplink.

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.559
No single gadget could defeat Superman, but
using multiple resources in the same fight,

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.659
Batman could easily stay one step ahead of
the Man of Steel - until Kal-El is either

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.010
worn down physically (depleting his solar-powered
abilities) or mentally (ready for a superhero

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.010
heart-to-heart).

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.510
An Ideological, Not Physical Victory

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.150
Achieving victory isn't always the same as
winning.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.079
And depending on the conflict, Bruce Wayne
can still beat Kal-El - even if Batman loses

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.920
the physical fight.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.569
In several Superman storylines, the Kryptonian
refuses to be held accountable to anyone,

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.450
helping or harming world governments as he
sees fit.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.320
In those stories, Batman doesn't need to crush
Superman to beat him - only show the world

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.620
that even a god can bleed.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.820
Comic fans saw a similar idea at play in Zack
Snyder's '300,' (where a group of Spartans

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.160
gave their lives to simply prove a 'god-king'
was a mortal man), and "The Dark Knight Returns"

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.440
in which Batman simply opposes a government
that wields Superman like a superweapon.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.960
The Dark Knight still 'wins' if he shows the
people of Metropolis (and Gotham) that, together,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.450
they are not powerless against Superman - and
that the Man of Steel doesn't get to decide

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.650
what's right or wrong.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.560
If a single man can stand against a god - Kryptonite
suit or not - it would make both Superman

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.960
and humanity think twice.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960
Three's a Crowd

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.200
The final possibility is that Batman wouldn't
have to face Superman alone.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.170
Depending on which DC heroes and villains
are around, Wonder Woman, The Flash, or even

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.850
Lex Luthor could offer their help in takingd
down the Man of Steel.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.560
Just as Frank Miller's Dark Knight counted
on Green Arrow to weaken Superman, Batman

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.070
could take a beating from the Man of Steel
- simply distracting the Kryptonian while

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.250
other heroes take positions.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.000
It takes sharp story-telling to introduce
other players without undermining the main

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.780
event, but a third party (be it hero and villain)
could be all that's needed to give Batman

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.470
the upperhand.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.850
These are just a few ways that Batman could
beat Superman.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.020

can beat the Man of Steel?
