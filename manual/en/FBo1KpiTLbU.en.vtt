00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.900
Hey guys Smallkiwi again and this is how you
play Witch Doctor.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.210
Witch Doctor is an intelligence based support.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.450
His Q is a bouncing nuke that stuns, his W
is a toggleable short range aoe heal over

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.370
time, his E is a small AoE debuff that deals
extra damage based on damage dealt and his

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.840
ultimate is a channeled ward that deals massive
damage to enemies in range.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.100
Witch Doctor’s Q is best used versus 2 closely
grouped enemy heroes or on a single enemy

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.550
standing near a single creep as this will
deal the maximum damage and stun to each.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.760
Avoid casting it on single targets or when
enemy heroes are standing near groups of enemy

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.820
creeps.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.880
His Q can also be used to push down creep
waves, and can even be cast as you are leaving

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.120
a lane to earn gold in your absence.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.220
Early game Witch Doctor’s E can help secure
ganks fairly quickly, so don’t neglect to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.030
cast it, just remember that its range is fairly
short.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.520
His W can be used later in the game when pushing
to help sustain allies’ health pools.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.380
Witch doctor’s ultimate is only effective
if he can avoid being stunned for the duration

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.460
and enemy heroes remain within range, so combo
his ultimate with an effective Q to quickly

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.690
burn down multiple opponents.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.620
Also remember that a BKB will protect witch
doctor from many spells that would otherwise

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.620
interrupt his ultimate.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.660
Max Witch Doctor’s Q first, and put points
in his E at 2 and 4.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.860
Prioritize R over Q over E over W.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.909
At the start take 3 iron branches, a tango,
and some clarities.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.880
Purchase either the courier or wards depending
on your teammates.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.320
The core of witch doctors build are arcane
boots, a wand, plus a mekansm and/or urn of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.500
shadows, again depending on your team’s
composition.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.040
Finally an Aghanim’s Scepter is an extremely
powerful item for Witch Doctor, so build it

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.640
as soon as possible.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.000
After your Scepter consider building a BKB
if it would protect you from the enemy team’s

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
stuns.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.451
A shadow blade will allow you to initiate
ganks easily and provide an escape, and you

00:01:50.451 --> 00:02:14.340
could consider a necronomicon, eul’s scepter,
shivas guard or scythe of vyse.
