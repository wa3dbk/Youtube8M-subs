00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.880
Sometimes students in my classes are
surprised

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.950
that I care about the quality of their
writing.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.777
But I'm always surprised that anyone could
imagine that there could be

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:16.362
any area of scholarship or any area of
dealing with the world where we

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:20.719
wouldn't care about how we write and how
we speak to each other.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:30.719
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:46.818
I study ants and because I'm interested in
how an organization can work without any

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:48.525
central control.

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:52.760
So in an ant colony there's nobody in
charge, nobody tells anybody what to do.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.300
The ants can only perceive what's right
around them.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.310
And yet somehow the colony can function
and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.250
reproduce, and adjust its behavior to
changing conditions.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.200
And I'm fascinated by how very limited
individuals

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.610
working in the aggregate can do such
complicated things.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.831
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:19.908
I'm always surprised by the idea that a
scientist doesn't need to know how

00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:23.160
to write, because a scientist lays out an
argument.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.230
Of course we use numbers and measurements,
but

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.660
we use them in the service of making an
argument about ideas.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.460
About asking questions and answering them.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.150
So a scientist needs to be able to talk
and to write just as anybody does.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.790
There is nothing special about science
that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.360
lifts us out of the need to communicate
with each other.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.140
So writing in science is important in
exactly the same way it's important in any

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.862
other area of scholarship.

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:56.505
Or in any other way that people want to
talk to each other.

00:01:56.505 --> 00:02:01.673
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:04.561
Thinking about my work and talking about
my work and

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:09.000
writing about my work are all different
stages of the same process.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.780
One of my favorite things about studying
the behavior of ants is those moments when

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.750
I'm quiet and watching, and see things
that I never thought of.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.400
But I'm always trying to put together what
I see and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.890
to make patterns in my mind out of the
patterns of their behavior.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.730
So, in writing I have time to think and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.880
to lay out an argument and to put together
my thoughts.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.515
So, writing really helps me to think.

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:46.272
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:48.436
The first step in writing is by far the
hardest,

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:52.330
because that's when I have to figure out
what I really want to say.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.330
And in the beginning, all I want to do is
to get it down on paper somehow.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.219
And not worry very much about how I'm
saying it, but

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.646
just try to be clear about what it is
exactly that I want to say.

00:03:03.646 --> 00:03:07.984
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:10.790
Everything I write, I write over and over.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.620
So I learned a lot about writing from my
dissertation adviser who

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.760
covered every piece of paper I ever gave
him in red marks.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.890
And paid enormous amount of attention to
the details of grammar, to reference,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.404
to the rhythm of a sentence, and I learned
a tremendous amount from him.

00:03:31.404 --> 00:03:35.703
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:40.476
For students, for people starting out,
when you have a lot of ideas

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:44.950
thrown at you, and it's hard to see how
they all fit in.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.270
Then the words, the names, the jargon
become a way

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.510
of trying to learn to talk in this new
world.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.320
And when someone really understands what
they mean to say,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.400
they don't need jargon anymore.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.096
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:05.940
When I write, I have something I wanna
say.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.210
And I try to say it as clearly as I can,
and

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.900
I hope that the reader will understand it.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.570
But I don't know how the reader will take
it.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.010
Writing is always a peculiar one-way
conversation.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.010
I say something and I don't have any way
of checking how it will be heard.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.529
So, if I write about ants, and someone
reads it and they say,

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.656
wow I really like that or that was really
interesting.

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:33.441
I don't really have any way of knowing
what it was that that reader

00:04:33.441 --> 00:04:35.540
saw in what I wrote.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.240
So it's an offering.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.929
I, I put it out there, but I don't know
how people will take it.

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:46.395
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:48.607
Until I wrote my first book,

00:04:48.607 --> 00:04:53.495
all of my writing related to my work was
articles for journals,

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:57.938
and a journal article in science has a
particular style.

00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:03.096
There are certain parts you can only say
certain things in certain parts.

00:05:03.096 --> 00:05:11.000
And in writing a journal article I have to
squeeze what I want to say into this form.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.240
And when I wrote my first book I imagined
myself writing it for other academics.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.670
And it was a wonderful surprise to realize
that anybody could understand it.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.640
So I didn't really set out to write a book
for everyone.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.588
I set out to write as clearly as possible
what I wanted to say to

00:05:29.588 --> 00:05:33.382
my peers about the work I was doing about
ants.

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:39.702
And it was a delight to realize that I
could simply speak in my own voice and

00:05:39.702 --> 00:05:46.039
I would be able to talk to a much wider
range of people than I had imagined.

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:56.039
