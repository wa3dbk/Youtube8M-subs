In this video, I’m going to show you how
to create this great looking chroma key shot

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.090
behind me in Veescope Live for iOS
Now what you are seeing behind me is green

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.520
screen that is being created with Veescope
Live for iOS

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.289
Veescope Live for iOS is available on the
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
It’s really easy to setup and use and I’m
going to show you how to do it.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.650
As you can see behind me, there’s nothing
more than just a green screen.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.920
I’m going to show you how to set this up
in Veescope Live.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.720
In Veescope Live, start out with the Keying
tab.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.710
The first thing we are going to do is white
balance the camera, so we are going to need

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.510
to use a white card.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.800
Click on the magic keyer, and click the next
button.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.640
Hold the white card directly against the green
screen.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.110
Veescope Live will find the white card and
optimize the camera settings.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.670
Remove the white card and click on the next
button.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.550
Veescope Live will adjust the color to find
the optimal color for the green screen.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.410
When it’s done, the green screen should
be perfectly optimized.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.590
The next thing to do is to pick a background.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.930
Go to the background tab, and select anything
from the camera roll.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.010
We can use this Palm Tree shot or we can go
back and pick again and we can use this brick

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.360
wall shot which is what I’m using right
now.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.470
With Veescope Live we can zoom in and reposition
the background just how you want it.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.720
When you are ready click the use button and
you are ready to go.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.410
