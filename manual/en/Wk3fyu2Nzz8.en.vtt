00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.259
Hi guys. Van here from RCNightmare.com. Today
I’m going to walk you through how to replace

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.259
the stock slipper gear in a Traxxas 4x4 with
the center diff.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.079
So as you can see here I have the 4x4 –
 the Slash 4x4 – with the top off here.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.559
So okay the slipper is right here – right
behind the motor here so to get access to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.799
that all we need to do is remove the two screws
that are right here and then the two screws

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.129
that are underneath that are right here. I’ve
already done that just to save us a little

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.200
bit of time here and then for demonstration
I’ve already removed this cover just to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.460
give us better view of everything.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.460
Here it is with the stock slipper gear in
there. So with the 4 screws – 2 on top and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.290
2 on the bottom – it’s really straight
forward. Just slide the rear assembly off

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.960
and there you have it. This is the slipper
gear. Just go ahead – just pull that right

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.810
out and what you see coming out there is the
drive shaft – that can stay in there. We’re

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.009
not replacing that.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.009
So, here it is – slipper gear. It’s fine
but you can upgrade it to a center diff which

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.439
is actually pretty nice. This way your power
to the front and power to the back is not

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.480
locked together so it’s not 100% to the
front, 100% to the back. Depending on your

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.480
driving condition, it will actually move the
torque back and forth.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.760
Okay, so this is the replacement center diff
here.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.530
The thing to note is – if you’re just
going to do a straight replacement – make

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.230
sure that the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.230
spur gear on the old diff here is the same
number of tooth as the one you’re replacing.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.349
This one is 54 and 54 so it matches. But even
though it does match – what we want to do

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.319
too is mesh the pinion to the spur gear but
the process in putting this back is just as

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:42.819
easy as it was to take it out. So this end
goes right in there – fish around to find

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.500
the aluminum drive shaft. As you can see there’s
a bearing right there right? It needs to be

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.209
seated on the chassis.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.709
Okay, so there it is. It’s just a matter
of fishing the end of the shaft here onto

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:25.849
the opening of the drive shaft. So as we can
see it's in place. For this demonstration

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.340
I’m not going to do the gear mesh. The gear
mesh will be in another video so if you need

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.060
to see how to do that, by all means please
check out.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.060
So there you have it. With the new center
diff in place now you can just go right ahead

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:53.520
and slide the rear assembly back on. When
you’re putting this back on, there’s a

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.050
notch on the back of the truck here – I
don’t know if you can see it real well.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:13.050
There’s a little notch here and that needs
to go over this little notch on the end of

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:20.809
the rear assembly. So let me just get that
started. Actually, the way to do it is get

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:30.869
the other end of the center diff into the
rear assembly there and just slide that on.

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.990
And then what I find works is I just turn
it over like this and then move the truck

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:44.990
back and forth with the front wheels on the
table or ground. This way it spins the diff

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.610
and gets the shaft lined up to go into the
rear housing.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.610
There you have it. That part’s in there
and from here it’s just a matter of 2 screws

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:05.289
up at the top and 2 screws up at the bottom
to reattach the rear assembly to the chassis.

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:13.889
Alright, so I hope that helps you guys out
if you’re ever interested in replacing the

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:20.879
stock slipper gear with a center diff. Okay
