00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
playing a steady, fast, funky,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
syncopated rhythm

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:37.000
trumpet &amp; bass join in

00:00:37.000 --> 00:02:22.000
playing jazz

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Charles Lazarus)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Having grown up listening

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to many styles of music,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as I got older and became a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
professional trumpet player,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I immediately became

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
interested in composition,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and so I started trying to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
borrow these elements from

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
different styles of music,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
mixing them together

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to see what happened, and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that's how I started writing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
if you look

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
at the symphonic world,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the music of Gustav Mahler

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
incorporates folk melodies.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In early jazz, Scott Joplin

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
mixed syncopated dance rhythms

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
with Sousa march rhythms,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
which created an interesting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and important element

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to ragtime music.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So that sort of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
kitchen chemist aspect

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of mixing different styles

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of music together

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
has always been

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
interesting to me.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The pieces that we played

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
here today are

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
based on hula dance rhythms

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and spiritual chants.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Kilauea's Fountains is a piece

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that's meant to represent

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the flowing fountains of lava

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
from the Hawaiian volcano

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Kilauea,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and Dance Honu

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is a children's song, and it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in homage to the Hawaiian green

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.000
sea turtle, the honu.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
playing to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a slow-paced rhythmic beat

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Most of my career,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I played in small ensembles,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
from brass quartets, chamber

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
music groups, jazz ensembles,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but for the past 10 years,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I've been a member of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the Minnesota Orchestra.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Playing in a symphony is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
very different

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
than playing in a jazz ensemble

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in terms of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the kind of refinement

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that it requires

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and the nature of playing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
with 80 or 100

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
other people on stage,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but I tend to approach

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
all music the same way.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
The way I look at it,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
there are 12 different notes

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in Western music, so we should

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
learn to play them in as many

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
different ways as possible.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I try to keep it simple,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and that makes it a lot easier

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and more fun to play too.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The thing that I enjoy

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the most in music

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
is the variety of music.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So I love switching

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
from one style to the next.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The thing I like about

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
writing music is that you can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
incorporate all of my favorite

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
things into one piece of music,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and it's sort of like

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a ristretto shot of espresso

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
as opposed to just your regular

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
filtered coffee--it's very pure.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's all action-packed there

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in one piece.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So that, I think,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is the thing that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000
gives me the biggest thrill.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
playing to a smooth jazz beat

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I love to improvise. I started

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
playing music when I was 5.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
My family had a piano,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and I would just play by ear.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I would gather the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
family together to play

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the latest creation,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
whatever it might be.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
As I continued into music, after

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
learning how to read music,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I always wanted to improvise,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and not just in a jazz style,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
but I wanted to improvise

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
like rock guitarists.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
If I heard native music

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
or bluegrass, all styles,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I liked the idea

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
of being spontaneous

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and learning different

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
ways to improvise.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Playing with Craig Hara

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and Tommy Barbarella

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and Jeff Bailey is

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
extremely satisfying.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
They have an incredibly vast

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
array of experience

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
from playing

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
with rock bands like Prince

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to every kind of ensemble

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
you can imagine,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and the interesting thing

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
about all 3 of them

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is that they all started

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
on trumpet.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They were all trumpet players,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
so they understand what I do.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Actually Craig is

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
a professional trumpet player

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
as well as a drummer.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So I feel like there's a bit

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
of mutual understanding there

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that's a lot of fun.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
