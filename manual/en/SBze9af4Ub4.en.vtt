Hello , it's me again

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
and today we'll examine this violin
by Nagoya Suzuki model 220-OF.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
In this video we have two
violins with different sizes:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
1/4

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and 4/4.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
There are also other sizes of violins,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for example, 3/4 and 1/2.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
A 1/4-sized violin is suitable for
children from 4 to 9 years old.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
For my hands suits the
full-size 4/4 violin.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Body top of the violin is made of spruce,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
back and sides are made of maple,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
neck, fretboard and chinrest
are made of ebony.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.000
This violin comes with a bow,
rosin and a handy case.
