00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.370
Starting with Super Mario Kart in 1992

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.190
we've been witness to numerous games
 that feature mascot characters

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.600
bouncing around in go-karts

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.370
using crazy weapons to gain an advantage.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.720
The kart racing genre has spanned
 multiple hardware generations

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.190
and has been host to the likes of Crash Bandicoot

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
Diddy Kong

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.630
and yes, even Metal Gear Solid's 
Cyber Ninja.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.050
For whatever reason,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.560
Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog never 
really had any games

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.400
that fit neatly in to the definition of a 
"kart racer".

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.800
The closest the blue blur ever came was

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.390
Sonic Drift on the Game Gear

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.270
and though it was a nice novelty then

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.180
by today's standards it's 
rather embarrassing.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.020
This brings us to 
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.200
Sonic's first serious endeavor in the genre.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.150
Created by the team responsible for

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.500
Outrun 2006 and Virtua Tennis

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.740
can this speedy hedgehog keep up 
with the genre's titans?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.760
All-Stars Racing does not stray far from

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.100
the kart racing standard.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.320
The game's 24 tracks are broken up in to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.060
six Grand Prix cups, accessible at

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.700
three difficulty levels:

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.870
Beginner, Advanced, and Expert.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.600
In addition to the usual Single Race 
and Time Trial modes

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 the game is complimented by 
a lengthy "Mission Mode"

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.580
which lets you hone your skills

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.680
with specialized challenges

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.430
such as drifting as much as possible

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.080
or overpowering a boss 
before time runs out.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.480
If you're looking for some 
human opposition

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.930
there's the game's multiplayer mode

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.110
featuring split-screen and online racing.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.270
The game lets you get behind the wheel of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.710
22 racers spread out over

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.390
more than a dozen franchises

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.570
and though the roster resurrects 
obscure characters

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.760
like Alex Kidd and Ulala

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.820
it is clearly weighted in favor 
of Sonic and his friends.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.650
Even with the emphasis on the Sonic franchise

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.150
the driver roster is considerably more diverse

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.100
than the tracks you are allowed to race on

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.190
of the 24 venues, only six 
Sega properties are featured:

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.890
Sonic the Hedgehog

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.300
Super Monkey Ball

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.010
Billy Hatcher

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.300
Jet Set Radio Future

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.710
Samba De Amigo

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.440
and House of the Dead.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.270
The spread of environments in each 
property is also a little skewed

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.580
as you race through Sonic's 
Seaside Hill three separate times

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.850
but each of the three 
Super Monkey Ball tracks

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.740
are set in unique locales.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.850
As of this review Sega is already hinting about

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.920
future downloadable expansions

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.860
but it would have been nice

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.150
to see a wider variety of 
race venues right out of the box.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.250
Depending on who you are

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.280
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing 
is either

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.290
the kart racer you've been waiting for

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.270
or a source of immense frustration.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.740
As Nintendo's focus on 
accessibility has increased

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.740
the Mario Kart series has begun 
to move away

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.020
from skilled gameplay and more towards

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.600
unpredictable chaos.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.810
It has begun to feel like

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.910
Mario Kart punishes you for 
being in first place

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.530
as many of the weapons and 
items are specifically designed

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.630
to disable the lead driver.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.220
Though it breeds an environment where

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.630
even the most inexperienced 
players can win

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.130
there are only so many times you can

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.100
lose a race to a lucky item 
before it feels less like luck

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.670
and more like cheating.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.220
All-Stars Racing responds 
to this by being

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.570
far more rewarding to skilled players

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.880
it is equally important to both drive well

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.790
and use weapons intelligently.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.730
This is never more obvious as it is in

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.440
each racer's "All-Star Move".

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.950
All-Star Moves are designed 
to shake up a track

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.940
and hopefully provide 
a struggling player

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.860
with an upper hand over his competitors

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.860
but unlike Mario Kart's 
"Lightning Bolt" or "Blue Shell"

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.740
an All-Star Move does not 
guarantee an easy win

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.830
it requires a fair amount of 
skill to use effectively.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.500
In the right hands, an All-Star is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.160
a valuable asset for evening the 
odds of a one-sided race

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.150
which makes its omission 
from online multiplayer

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.510
a disappointment.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.030
The emphasis on skilled play 
ends up being both

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.070
a blessing and a curse in this regard;

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.510
though not as prominent as 
in Mario Kart

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.660
if you join an online race and aren't 
as skilled as the competition

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.890
you're going to be left in the dust.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.470
If you want to stay competitive

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.190
mastering drifting technique on the game's

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.450
narrow, winding tracks is not a suggestion

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.300
it's a requirement.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.240
Unfortunately, it doesn't quite feel like enough.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.350
Kart racing veterans will 
most likely breeze through

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.780
all six Grand Prix mode 
cups in around two hours

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.240
and unlike Mario Kart, 
there's no incentive

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.570
for playing the same tracks 
on harder difficulties.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.800
Every race you complete earns you

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.470
"Sega Miles", the game's currency for

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.890
buying unlockable content

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:16.930
but regardless of whether you're

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.120
playing on the easiest difficulty 
or the hardest

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.010
you earn roughly the same amount.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.240
In terms of raw numbers,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.520
All-Stars Racing has the 
same amount of content

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.800
as other games in the genre

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.990
but rather than spread it out as a reward

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.320
for finishing the game on 
each difficulty setting

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.500
it's instead unlocked a 
little too quickly and easily.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.800
Plus for all the options the game offers

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.130
in customizing a race

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.680
there are no reverse or mirror mode options

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.530
something other kart racers use to

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.120
showcase existing tracks in a new context.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.790
Online multiplayer may provide 
a considerable amount of replay value

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.830
but even that feels a little neutered

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.240
as the arena-based modes like

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.550
"Battle" and "Capture the Chao" 
cannot be played online

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.550
only via split-screen.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.190
I could sit here and nitpick a 
handful of other little problems

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.190
but at the end of the day

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.760
none of that changes the fact that 
All-Stars Racing is a fun game

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.750
and well worth the price of admission.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.170
If you've been getting 
frustrated with Mario Kart's

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.490
growing emphasis on being 
a chaotic party game

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.040
instead of running a good race

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.420
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing 
might just be what you're looking for.
