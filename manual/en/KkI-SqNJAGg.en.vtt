00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.010
La Cumbre near La Paz at 4700m...

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.146

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:16.416
the Death Road down to 1200 m...

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:17.751
to Corioco.

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:19.708

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:20.676

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:21.484
Good.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:21.922
Yeah...

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:23.107
It's a pretty day...

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:24.245
but ahh....

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:25.835
This is another one of the...

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.360
crazy things that we're doing on this trip.

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:29.063
So...

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.229
We'll see how it goes...

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.397
yep...

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:45.475
The first stop on the World's Most Dangerous Road.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.790
It's still paved here.

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:52.086
Ha ha ha...

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.487
That's cheating!

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:59.396
Right now doing the next part which is the...

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.026
Down...

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.933
Technically the World's Most Dangerous Road.

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:04.132
Instruction

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.680
Yep.

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:05.832
Instruction time...

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:07.067
Ha ha ha...

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:08.477
Be careful!

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.802
Stay on the left side until the end.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.006
From here until the end is three hours.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.489
Glad am not on that bus huh!?

00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:31.891
Well green means go.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.160
Not a whole lot of space on this road.

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:49.250
Not much room here...

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.450
Alright, I need two hands now!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.300
How are they going so fast, so quickly?

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:04.820
Well, they are...

00:02:33.437 --> 00:02:34.940
Five months ago.

00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:37.870
This was an accident two months ago.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:45.410
So we made it...

00:02:45.473 --> 00:02:46.670
Survived the Death Road...

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.490
Yeah but we still have survive it on the way back.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.870
Oh yeah that right.
