00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.540
Behind me is something very special!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.620
In 1984 BMW opened its Technik department

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.440
and they designed very nice things.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.600
This is the departments first result for BMW.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.560
A 2-seater roadster

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.580
Which was the first 2-seater roadster since the 507.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.100
The Z1 is a very special car.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.200
Designed by Dutch designer Harm Lagaay, so thats always good!

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.760
And he truly made it into a special car.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.220
It is almost entirely made out of plastic

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.640
All the panels at least.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.040
This made them easy to replace.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040
I'll get back to that later.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.380
But this is definitely the most intriguing part of this BMW Z1

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.380
the fantastic door!

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.320
Isn't that great?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.320
And you can drive it this way too.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.660
So let's get going, so I can tell you more about this car.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.880
It is certainly special!

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.340
Although getting into it is tricky!

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.520
So supple!

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.880
So let's get back to Harm Lagaay's design.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
He really studied how cars behave.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
So downforce was really important to him

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.880
so the car would handle well.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.120
Thats why there is a wedge in the front

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.020
and a plastic bottomplate.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.260
So the air can flow well underneath the car.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.840
And the muffler, yes, that is how far he has gone with this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.220
the muffler is shaped in such a way

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220
that the air flowing over it

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.200
creates a little more downforce.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.640
This pushes the back down more.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.840
It's truly bizarre.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.780
If you look around this car

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.860
you see several parts and tricks that ensure the airflow around this car is optimal.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.320
Fun thing is that all of this contradicts with the fact that this car can be driven with open doors.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.140
I could just open the window while driving, or I can do this..

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.180
Nice right?

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.440
I can just stick out my hand like this, comes in handy when the indicators are broken!

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.900
On a technical level, the Z1 has a lot in common with the BMW E30 3-Series.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.260
Not the doors of course.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.720
But parts of the chassis and the engine are the same.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.460
The engine in the Z1 is the M20B25, similar to the engine in the 325i.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.560
Which was the E30 3-series back in the day.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.920
It has 170 horsepower, and takes care of 0-100km/h in 7,9 seconds.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.660
It has a top speed of 220km/h.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.640
I get a strong urge to really put the hammer down

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.340
and get it into the high RPM's.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.960
But this car has only done 900 kilometres.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.280
So technically it isn't run in yet.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.120
So that is quite exceptional for a car from 1989..

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080
And this is one of the early productions, chassis number 21!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.820
So I cannot trow this car around like I normally would.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.020
I can feel that everything in this car is meant to make it handle well.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.360
Very precise and with rear wheel drive, which helps the balance because the front wheels are just for steering.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.840
When BMW introduced this car

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.820
they wanted to make a very hip and cool car.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.080
You can see this in the seat upholstery.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.300
A camouflage print, which is hip again at the moment.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.700
Our cameraman Martijn is currently wearing a sweater that matches very well!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.940
But it may not be everyones taste, which is the risk of these interiors.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.480
But the seats are not the only style feature.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.360
BMW figured it that it would be cool if Z1 owners

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.180
could buy it with two colours.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.260
As I have said before, all panels are made of plastic.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.300
And the idea was that the customer could detach the panels and in about 40 minutes

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.200
could fit the car with a new panel set.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.240
This car colour for example is urgrün

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.680
but you could buy another panel set, for example red.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.920
So you can come to your footballclub in the weekend and claim you bought a new car!

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.240
But the system BMW thought of

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.220
thought of may not be the right wording for this..

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.120
It was a bit a-typical German, not what we were used to from BMW.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:09.400
Because it took 2 days of manual labour to change all the panels on this car!

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
2 days!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.740
Not very practical to just change the colour for a bit.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.880
We borrowed this BMW Z1 from our good friends at Gina Classics in Drachten.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.500
I regularly claim that their cars feel like they are new or looks new

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
or has been restored to new.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.980
But this one is genuinely new!

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.520
It has done only 900 kilometres.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.160
In totally original state.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.080
the paint job is still 100% original.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.200
As you might expect from a car with 900 kilometres on the clock.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.780
It is a truly remarkable car.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.620
It is urgrün metallic and you may take it home for 57,500 euros.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:05.020
Which is quite a safe investment, because a car in this state is so ultimately rare..

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.060
Many of these cars are bought as an investment

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.580
it may be worth 20.000 euros more in 5 years!

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.540
Try making those returns with investments in gold or stocks.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.740
Cars are not just nice to look at, they are very wise investments, so buy plenty of them!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.020
Just do it!
