00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:12.570
Get your head out of the fridge and sit down,
it's time for some Waeco bush cookin'.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.429
The only way we go is with Waeco.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.220
Now we've been driving all day.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.360
It's pretty late, but we're hungry.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.590
I've got some hungry boys behind me here,
so I'm gonna cook up something pretty quick.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.880
Pretty simple.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730
And I'm gonna call it corn fritters.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.730
Alright?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.730
It's very simple.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.140
Few ingredients.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Not hard at all.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
Let's have a look down here.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.140
I've just pre-cut it up here.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.470
I've got a bit of bacon.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.840
I've got some shallots.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.540
I've got some onion chopped up fine.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.930
Of course, I've got some corn.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.940
A bit of garlic.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.010
A bit of basil and a few other little bits
and pieces I'll tell you along the way.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.270
So first of all, whack in a bit of self-raising
flour.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.270
Probably about that much.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.620
That's a fair bit.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.700
2 eggs.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.210
Just crack 'em, whack 'em in.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.100
Just like that.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.041
Give them a bit of a beat up there before
you mix them in.

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:05.000
Alright, so my eggs are just beaten up a little
bit there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.540
And now what I'm looking for is I'm trying
to create a bit of a paste.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.060
Like a pastey mixture.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.710
So I've got a bit of a batter going.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.140
Now I put my ingredients in, so I just grab
'em and whack 'em in.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.500
Just throw them in there.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.350
Oh, we'll throw them all in.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.590
And now the whole thing, what's it called?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.130
Corn fritters, so you better put some corn
in.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.390
Like that.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.060
And let's have a little look at our mixture
here.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.980
There, that's lookin' tasty.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Lookin' very tasty.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.421
Alrighty, so I've got that little bit of a
paste goin', now I'm gonna add a little bit

00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.440
of a treat to it.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.090
I'm gonna put a little bit of lemon zest in.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.140
Just a little bit of garlic.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.780
Alright, we're gonna be ready for the hot
oil now.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.830
Now the hot oil's been going over the back
here.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.759
So I've got the hot oil in my pan.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.630
Not too hot.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.890
You don't want it too hot.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.890
So you get yourself a nice spoonful of it.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.250
And whack it in like that.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.140
Spread it out so it's thin.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.140
We just wait now.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.390
We just want that to brown on one side, then
we flip him over.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.340
So it's just a quick flip.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.740
Like that.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.940
See that's nice and golden brown there.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.580
You don't want them too thick.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.850
You get them too thick, then they're not going
to cook inside.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.209
You want them to cook fairly quickly.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.340
And I reckon we're done.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.650
Let's get that out.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.030
Let's stick him on the plate.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.480
Now let's get another one in there.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.190
What I might do is I'm gonna make this one
a bit bigger, but I'm still going to keep

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.860
it flat.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.860
Yep.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.670
I reckon we're ready.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.900
Let's get her on the plate.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170
Nice looking fritter.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.640
We'll knock that off.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.670
There we go.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.650
Have a look at there.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.220
And there you see inside.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.239
Golden brown.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.239
Beautiful.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.880
Nice and soft inside.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.420
And it tastes great.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.959
There you go.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.819
Quick, easy meal.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.430
Feed the animals behind me there.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.310
Keep 'em happy.
