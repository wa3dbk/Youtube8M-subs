00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:40.787
What am I going to do this summer?
Hey Kirsten.

00:00:41.068 --> 00:00:44.349
Is that your Spanish paper, Juliana?

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.806
I wish. Actually trying to figure out how
I'm going to spend my summer.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:52.567
Everyone says I should do an internship
but they all look really lame.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:57.661
I know right? Working for free for some
random company doing other crap work

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:01.940
is not my idea of a worthwhile summer.
You could take more courses but

00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:04.661
spending all summer in class without a
break would make me nuts.

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:07.256
Plus you would just be racking up more
and more debt.

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.136
What are you doing?

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:11.035
About 3 months' worth of laundry.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:14.638
If I'm going to APhi formal tonight, I'm
gonna need something clean to wear.

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:16.443
Not now, I mean this summer.

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:22.131
Oh, alright. Yeah, I am going to do 
undergraduate research. (What?)

00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:27.285
I was talking to some people in my lab and
they said I can apply for a grant that

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:30.435
would pay me to do my own independent
project this summer.

00:01:30.435 --> 00:01:32.695
You science people have it so easy.

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:35.628
I don't think it is just for people in
labs.

00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.569
Yeah, but I do not know anything about
putting together a research project.

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:42.226
What would I do? Oh- thank you Alvin, you 
have no idea how much I needed this.

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:45.506
Do not touch. I am about to do an
important service to the world.

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:47.037
And what is that?

00:01:47.288 --> 00:01:51.945
I am going to show the negative effects of
over caffeinating yourself. We live in a

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.126
world that worships the rush of caffeine
and we become so dependent on it we don't

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:59.088
realize the negative effects it has on our
bodies.

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:01.349
Ok Morgan Spurlock. What are you going
to do?

00:02:01.477 --> 00:02:05.849
I am going to drink 5 shots of espresso
and an energy drink.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.160
(That sounds stupid.) And Kirsten will
record what happens to me on video.

00:02:11.317 --> 00:02:16.258
Shut up Alvine. You know how much it bugs
me when people mispronounce my name.

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.600
Ok, sorry. Kirsten, will you please assist
me?

00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:27.126
-Impressive, how do you feel?
-Ugh. So what were you guys talking about?

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:40.336
-What lame options I have for the summer.
-I know, right? This school has seriously

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.868
dropped the ball on summer. They always
say they value experience but they need to

00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:49.025
put their money where their mouth is. We
need real opportunities to do our own

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.930
independent work, dammit. This school
needs to support my summer.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.838
You've heard of undergraduate research,
haven't you?

00:03:56.037 --> 00:03:59.899
-No idea. Sounds stupid.
-We have the summer undergraduate

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:04.336
research program that gives students money
to live during the summer so they can do

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:06.806
their own independent project that they
create.

00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.405
-Really?
-Yeah. -Glad they were listening.

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:12.848
If you could get paid to do anything this
summer, what would you do?

00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:16.900
That's easy. I would open up a killer
restaurant that just serves pie. No. I'd

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:22.492
study what the great philosophers said
about something really cool... like jokes.

00:04:22.648 --> 00:04:28.868
No. I would write a total original movie
about giant space robots that crashed into

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.618
the earth and could turn into cars.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.057
-Didn't they already make that movie?
-Three times.

00:04:34.088 --> 00:04:37.826
No. I would open up a school to teach
people with depression how to surf.

00:04:37.856 --> 00:04:40.304
-It would be totally awesome.
-We live on a lake.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:45.089
No. I'd get a bunch of tables and just
pile them up and make this huge table pile

00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:51.558
thing. No. I could totally learn how to
fly. I feel like I can fly right now.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.119
Let's make a parkour video. That would be
totally awesome.

00:05:10.423 --> 00:05:12.504
What am I going to do this summer?

00:05:13.804 --> 00:05:21.524
(horrifying noises and children giggling)

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:39.496
I don't think that's the right question. I
think the real question is...

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:42.869
what do you want to know?
-What?

00:05:43.027 --> 00:05:48.711
Instead of focusing on what you might do
this summer think about what do I want to

00:05:48.912 --> 00:05:51.308
learn more about. Start there.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.996
Well I want to do something that is
meaningful.

00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:06.277
That is a great place to start. Now all we
have to do is figure out what would make

00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:08.899
a meaningful summer for you.

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:12.685
Summer Undergraduate Research Grants must
be really hard to get, huh.

00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:14.966
They can give away as many as they want.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:20.496
Yeah. Hold on a second. Who are you and
what are you wearing?

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:23.651
I told you I don't have many clean
options left!

00:06:23.843 --> 00:06:27.120
No, I wasn't talking to you I was talking
to... where did he go?

00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:28.686
Where did who go?

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.468
He was right here. He was dressed like a 
bad Shakespeare play.

00:06:32.498 --> 00:06:37.223
You have to come. Alvin is hanging onto a
cliff. Don't ask.

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:50.154
This seemed like a better idea in my head.
