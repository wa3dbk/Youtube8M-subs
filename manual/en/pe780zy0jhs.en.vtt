I am a paralympic swimmer because I do have muscular dystrophy.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.000 position:78%
And I’m definitely proud to be a past paralympian.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.000
I went to two paralympic games.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.000 position:97%
I swam in 2000 at Australia, won three gold medals, broke three world records, and a silver medal.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.000 position:97%
Then I swam in Athens, where I won two bronze, another silver.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.000 position:91%
I trained with Windsor Aquatic Club for most of my career.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.000 position:98%
We are like the only swim team in Windsor that is fully integrated.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.000 position:72%
Both Kirby and Vicky have CP – Cerebral Palsy.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.000 position:97%
But they’ve both really learned to overcome that in the water.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.000 position:56%
It’s not…when we dive in that water,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.000 position:97%
it’s not about what disability you have or what you suffer from or what goes on,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.000 position:83%
it’s just about being athletes together and training.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.000 position:56%
We practice at the St. Denis Centre.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.000 position:97%
They swim all two hours of every practice right with the team.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.000 position:98%
There’s the elevator. Kirby, you know, goes up to the desk, gets the key.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.000 position:95%
She can get here by herself because it is accessible for her.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.000 position:69%
We help her, assist her getting in the pool.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.000 position:98%
But we put her on her chair and she’s lifted out by the use of the chair.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.000 position:97%
Basically, we just hook it up to kind of like a crank system that lowers into the water.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.000 position:98%
We have another athlete help her onto the chair and just kind of supervise.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.000 position:98%
And it’s just by cranking it up that she’s able to come out of the water.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.000
That has been unbelievably helpful.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.000 position:97%
Getting to be a part of something that is so important like an inclusive club,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.000 position:92%
or you know, just even being here with the younger kids and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.000 position:95%
teaching them how important it is to not see the limitations,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.000
but to see each other as athletes.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.000 position:98%
To have a team that is so inclusive, it makes the girls feels like there’s no difference.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.000 position:78%
The other athletes, they don’t see the disability.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.000 position:97%
How awesome is that? For anybody to be able to come and leave your limitations

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.000 position:97%
and all your challenges at the door, come and do something you love to do.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.000 position:98%
And, I mean, you see it in their heart and in their eyes when they’re practicing,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.000
how much they love to be here.
