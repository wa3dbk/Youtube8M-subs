00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.660
Often when we consider X-rays, we think of
broken bones or teeth. This is because they are

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.059
dense tissues and show up well on X-ray.
Soft tissues do not absorb X-rays and so the

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.600
signal is far less attenuated. Even more importantly,
we cannot differentiate between the different

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.600
types of soft tissue. If we could introduce
something dense, this will absorb the X-rays.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.840
Metals are dense, and so opaque to X-rays.
And so they can be used to add contrast to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.840
the image. Barium is one such metal. It has
an atomic mass of 56, and so is very dense,

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:47.019
compared to tissue. Of course the problem
is that barium ions in solution, are highly

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:54.019
toxic and very reactive. However, if we use
barium sulphate, this is extremely insoluble

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.069
in water, so there are no free ions, and it
is a powder. This powder can be given as a

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:10.500
slurry in the water, which can be swallowed. The
density of this mixture can achieve 4.5 g per millilitre.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.320
The radiographer then takes a
series of images, using a technique called

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.700
fluoroscopy. This is done as the patient drinks
or swallows the slurry. Here is an X-ray before starting.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.700
Can you pick the oesophagus in this
image? What about now? You can easily see

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.659
the oesophagus, as the slurry passes to the
stomach. If there was a partial obstruction

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.200
in the oesophagus, or a leak, it could be very
easy to see. So in summary the barium absorbs

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:55.100
the X-rays. This means the signal is attenuated.
So the image appears dark. Hopefully, you

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.619
can now see how we can combine the different
concepts to build up a procedure that can

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.450
provide the information that the doctor needs.
