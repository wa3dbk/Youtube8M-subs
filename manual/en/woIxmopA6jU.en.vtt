00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.040
We're machine stripping
at the moment.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
I have to keep an eye
on what the machine's doing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800
in case he gets near
any significant archaeology.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.000
The skill involved in using
one of the machines is amazing.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.960
because they've got a machine
into archaeology,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.240
and around archaeology, without
knowing what they're looking at,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.520
follow a series of instructions,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.000
but also manage the material
they're machining away,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.320
so they don't block themselves in
or run out of space.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.000
The machine driver
spends a lot of time

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.040
making sure the machine's level.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.560
At the moment he's just clearing
where his tracks are gonna stand.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000
Because the machine will rotate
round 360 degrees,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.320
and the arm will move up and down,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.800
and the machine can't do anything other
than that to level itself.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.200
So, they'll spend a great deal of time
making sure they're perfectly flat,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.000
before they start pulling the soil back.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.320
The big area that we're working in,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.120
it was cleared in the 1930s,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.560
and possibly again in the 1950s.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.960
It seems they've machined
a great big terrace,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.920
a flat terrace, into the area
across where we're looking,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.240
before they built the territorial army
structures that were here before.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.520
I think that was the 1950s.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.600
Just a little bit, mate.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.720
So, in the process of that
machine strip over 50 years ago,

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.320
they've actually disturbed
or completely removed,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.920
a huge amount of archaeology.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.160
The job that we've got today,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.840
is to try and strip off
enough of the disturbance,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.040
so we can see the archaeology,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.760
but try not to destroy too much
of the archaeology in the process.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.800
It is quite difficult.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640
Just a little bit there.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.640
Now, I've got another person
helping me as we go along.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.160
Because as you'll see, the machine
will leave bits of soil behind,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.560
on either side of the bucket
as it's pulling back.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.840
It's not possible for him to do
a completely perfect pull,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.400
because the blade's so wide,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.680
and he has to try and keep it
as flat as possible.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, the archaeology
isn't necessarily flat,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.600
and there's some places
where we've already seen

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.400
that things have been
pushed in deeper,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.480
probably in the 1950s,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.000
when they'd been disturbing
the whole area.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.560
So, the bits in between,
we shovel away straightaway,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.320
and it stops the rain
turning it into mud,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840
and it stops it washing into the
features that we're concerned with.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.160
So, I'm gonna carry on
in this whole area,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.320
taking it to join up
with the H1 excavations,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.720
that we've nearly completed already.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.200
And ideally, we're gonna have a lovely
series of archaeological deposits,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600
that go from the medieval period,
where I'm stood,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.880
all the way back to the Roman period
in the far corner.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.920
So, I'll carry on
watching the machine...

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320
..picking out the odd find,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.360
and then making sure we get enough of
the disturbance out of the way.
