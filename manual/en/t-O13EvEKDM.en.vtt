00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.770
Alright, so Lenovo sent me their new H210, this has been pretty big and rumored

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.680
for a while, it's a very affordable system, very powerful, brand spanking new out of the box

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.710
and brand spanking new from Lenovo, if you look at it they kind of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.290
changed their typical K series desktop that they've had for so long,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.110
it doesn't have that big button in the middle, this is the H series,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.320
so it's a little bit different, you'll notice that it looks a lot nicer,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.910
it's probably meant more for a college student and a business user, than the previous case

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.330
which was probably meant just for everyone. I guess they're getting more specific

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.490
in what they make their models for, so as you can tell it does look nicer,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.910
let's talk about what's inside which is a little bit more important

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.390
than what it looks like on the outside. This thing has an E7200 Core 2 Duo

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.920
from Intel, it's one of the faster Core 2 Duo processors, it's very quick,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.880
clocked at 2.52 gigahertz which is very quick, it's got four gigs of RAM, it's got a very large

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.980
hard drive, 640 gigabytes, and it's got pretty much everything

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.960
you could possibly need, it's got a DVD burner right there,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.510
15-in-1 card reader, actually this is a 16-in-1 card reader, see right there?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.770
It's MS, MS Pro, MS Pro Duo, SD, XD, SD, and even CF, which is awesome,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.150
I love those CF cards, it's very important that it has that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.570
for me because I shoot a lot of CF cards, your power button is right up here above it,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.750
if you look up-- let me tilt it forward so that you can see it-- your very hidden power button

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.860
right there, your DVD drive is right there and it does pretty much everything,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.700
it's dual-layer and it does Rs, RWs, and pretty much all the other medias.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.430
Now this is a Home Premium machine it does run Vista Home Premium,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.100
i'll show you the back... so again it is loaded with four gigabytes

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.360
of RAM which is enough to run Home Premium without any issues at all,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.830
showing you the back connectors, these are your power supply,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.520
your two PS/2s for your keyboard and your mouse, you have a nice little serial port

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.100
and onboard graphics are right there, that is your VGA output,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.790
if you wanted to get a videocard on this computer, you could

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.200
because it does have a PCI Express x16 card bus adapter inside, and it is available and free,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.540
so if you wanted to get a little video card and play some games on here

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.320
you very well could, this is the same processor in this computer that's in the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.200
Crysis Gaming Machine from Ultra, so ironically enough you could definitely

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.790
add a videocard in there and play some games, you've got four USB 2.0 ports

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.400
to complement the ones that are also available on the front, and you have 10/100 ethernet

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.780
right there, alright and also as well as onboard graphics you have onboard audio,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.110
so you don't need to worry about anything else, you have four expansion slots,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.110
so if you want to add any TV tuners or any extra peripherals

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.830
you can also do that no problem, and get this special note-- look over here,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.400
see this? This is how Lenovo goes out of their way to make sure their computers run professionally,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.200
they're quiet, these are little rubber stoppers and these completely eliminate all the vibration

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.870
that this fan will produce to make it even quieter.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850
Check this out too, also included in the box on this Lenovo is a keyboard

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.300
and mouse, so you don't have to worry about buying one if this is your first computer,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.540
or you're replacing a system that's completely obsolete, you're going to get

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.240
a brand new keyboard, brand new mouse, and i'll tell you what if you're also a beginner,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.610
Lenovo has a special system that they put in these computers, and it pretty much

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.100
is a one-key recovery system where on the hard drive, on a seperate partition

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.850
that you're not going to use, it has all of your recovery information,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.410
sort of like a restore disc, but it's all on the hard drive,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.360
so if anything goes wrong, you can literally boot off of that part

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.580
of the hard drive and you can restore your system fully and completely in the event

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.100
that you get a virus, or something occurs and you have a problem,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.740
you can go ahead and restore the whole system no problem, just through there

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.940
and you don't have to have a disc which is fantastic,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.750
also another thing included in this-- check this out, Lenovo has included

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.180
their Veriface technology. Now if you don't know what Veriface is, take a wild guess.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.790
It verifies your face. Rather than having a password or a fingerprint,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.790
it figures out that hey,this is the person looking at my computer through the webcam, 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.720
it measures the distance between your eyes, between your ears and of your mouth

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.730
and it pretty much figures out that you are you, your face is unique no matter what,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.170
the distances between your eyes never changes, no matter what,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.300
and it kind of figures out hey, that's this person,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.550
and i'm going to go ahead and let them in.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.820
Here's the best part, let's say someone else comes up

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.900
and tries to get into your system, the veriface technology

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.560
will actually capture an image of the person who's trying to break into

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.420
your system. So that's pretty cool, if you're living in a dorm or you 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.600
have little brothers and sisters who are trying to get into your stuff...pretty annoying.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.220
Veriface technology pretty much eliminates that problem. So again, 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.450
this is the H210 by Lenovo, it's very affordable, very powerful,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.830
state of the art, it is 45nm on the processor, the E7200 at 2.53 gigahertz,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.890
so it's very fast, plenty of RAM using the latest operating system,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.150
Vista Home Premium, awesome deal, if you have any questions on it, e-mail me,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.280
and i'll see you guys next time. The Lenovo H210 desktop is available

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.300
from the retailers listed here, or for more information you can type in T71-4145

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.740
