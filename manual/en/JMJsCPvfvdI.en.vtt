00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:35.283
To me Natural Bodybuilding is the purest form of bodybuilding.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.668
Natural bodybuilding is more than just a sport,

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:43.020
it's a passion, it's an attitude, it is pure love.

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.067
My Name is Mischa Janiec,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.259
I am 21 years old and from Switzerland.

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:01.916
I am now trying to adjust my swiss accent for the interview.

00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:09.879
I am currently working as a self-employed personal trainer and as a fitness trainer at the gym.

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:20.586
I have come to Natural Bodybuilding 3.5 years ago.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:24.474
Reason was that I had scoliosis,

00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:30.402
I was pretty weird with my spine and I noticed this quickly,

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:32.971
when I stood or sat.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:37.260
I then logged on to a physiotherapist,

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:43.511
she has taught me some exercises that didn't thrill me.

00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.055
I was very lazy at this time,

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:52.924
Thus, it has emerged that I did not do this, I've made it very lazy.

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:59.047
I was then sent back to her, she just said you need to do something.

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.879
And I've come to the gym.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.592
This I liked much better.

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:11.272
Because of the success I had, I was very motivated within a few month 

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:15.757
and that was the reason why I started with the sport.

00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:40.744
Why I did compete?

00:02:41.338 --> 00:02:44.942
That was at the 2010 Swiss Cup SNBF,

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:49.831
this was my first competition I have seen as a spectator.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:55.008
I was then invited by colleagues whom I've met through the sport.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:59.336
And that night, I saw the junior class.

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:03.084
There was the winner of the junior class,

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:07.781
the son of the President of the SNBF, Julian Strickler,

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:14.392
This night he had been so beautifully symmetrical, he had such a good shape,

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:16.488
That blew me away.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.622
When I saw that, I just knew I want to do that, too.

00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:27.230
Next year I'm standing on this stage and will also rock that stage.

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:54.238
This year I'm doing completely off-season, 2012 is fully dedicated to building.

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:58.861
I have decided that, because I just noticed

00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:04.730
I have still pretty strong deficits, especially in the back and legs.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.442
And in general, even after the entire competition season, I thought to myself,

00:04:09.942 --> 00:04:14.164
just another year, then I can start really cool in the heavyweight division.

00:04:15.483 --> 00:04:20.436
I certainly start again in 2013 SNBF

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:27.380
and perhaps I would not be averse to a start at the International Class GNBF.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.268
That's an option. The aim would certainly be

00:04:31.768 --> 00:04:39.161
to qualify via SNBF for the World Cup, which would be the plan.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.429
My goals over the next few years is to continue Natural Bodybuilding successfully,

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:41.969
I will certainly do some contests.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:48.495
That last year was a great experience and I am ambitious and motivated,

00:06:48.995 --> 00:06:51.853
to get still a lot out of my body.

00:06:52.353 --> 00:06:57.863
Which, of course, more and more is coming, is the desire to do photo shoots, etc.,

00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.278
it gives me a lot of fun.

00:07:00.778 --> 00:07:10.758
And of course, it would be cool to do motivational videos along with cover shoots like Greg Plitt.

00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:15.883
That would perhaps eventually overlaps with Natural Bodybuilding

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:21.680
because you have certain ideals as a fitness model.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:29.156
Since you can't have 75er or 70 quads, perhaps more important,

00:07:29.656 --> 00:07:33.037
is to go for definition, mass building would then be neglected.

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:38.839
But my goal is certainly to pursue further the sport and just keep fit,

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:44.106
most of my life over, till I am no longer able to work out. 

00:07:44.606 --> 00:07:46.918
That would certainly be my goal.
