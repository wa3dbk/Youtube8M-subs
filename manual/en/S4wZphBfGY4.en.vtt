Spyro might be my favorite series for the
original Playstation.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.850
I loved the characters, environments and gameplay
more than just about anything on that system.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.970
Recently, I reviewed some of the Legend of
Spyro games, which is basically a reboot of

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.200
the series that uses some of the same characters.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.020
However, that series added in some more RPG-like
elements, and while the games were fun, I

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.870
always felt that a game like this is how Spyro
is meant to be played.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.580
This is Spyro: A Hero’s Tail for the GameCube.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.340
Oh, pun alert!

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.160
Tale is spelled like a dragon’s tail, yep.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.390
I get it.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.680
A Hero’s Tail follows Spyro and his friends
like Sparx and Ember as stones known as dark

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.300
gems are being released throughout the land
by a Red dragon that the Elders warm Spyro

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.300
about.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.610
As Ember puts it, the gems are “pure evilness”,
and Spyro is tasked with ridding them from

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
the world.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.640
You’ll also have the ability to play as
some of Spyro’s friends for certain parts

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.180
of the game, like Blink, a mole who has the
ability to dig and find secret areas and jump

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.510
on walls like a ninja.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.740
It’s a really nice way to change up the
pace.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.750
I was also pleasantly surprised by how funny
some of the writing could be in this game.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.200
While the Legend of Spyro games take the series
in a bit of a darker direction, A Hero’s

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:52.910
Tail still feels very light-hearted, and this
is reflected in the humor of the game.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.800
Gameplay in A Hero’s Tail actually feels
very similar to the earlier games in the series.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.330
From the charge and fire breath to gliding,
Spyro definitely plays like you’d expect

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.330
him to.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.970
Controls are also very tight, although I did
find it a little odd that you can’t pull

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.930
Spyro up when he’s in midair.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.110
Instead, pulling on the analog stick just
flips him around, and this is a little weird

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470
when you think about gliding in most games.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.370
Platforming is great with challenging jumps
that don’t get too frustrating, and enemies

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.190
are all varied and require different attacks
to defeat.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.530
You might need to charge at one to knock its
armor off just before killing it with a breath

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.530
of fire.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.290
Spyro: A Hero’s Tail also features some
puzzles that may require you to, hit a few

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.060
switches to open up a series of doors, for
example.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.560
These are also really well implemented, and
they don’t feel overused.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.260
I also loved the visual style that the game
uses.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.570
It’s kind of cartoony and sort of like a
painting at the same time, and there’s much

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.920
brighter color than in the recent games.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.280
Voice acting isn’t quite as good as in the
Legend of Spyro series, especially Spyro in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.070
particular, but Blink is hilarious with the
tone of voice he uses, as is Ember.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.060
I think some of this might be due to the writing,
and as I said before, it’s really well done.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.470
Although A Hero’s Tail doesn’t really
jump out as being head and shoulders above

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.780
other games in the Spyro series, it is still
really well executed addition.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:22.190
I just wish Wayne Brady or David Spade were
in it.
