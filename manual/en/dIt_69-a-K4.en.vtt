00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.360
Hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.640
welcome back to another session with
your VahChef at vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.500
bhindi anar wala.  Basically we're going to
use

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.610
the pomegranate seeds powder along with okra

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.780
and we're going to just make it a
fry kind of thing and it's going to be

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.579
very tasty

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.780
so the dish what I am making today's
very very easy

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.520
not every dish has to be difficult and
complicated there are some dishes which are

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.870
very simple very tasty

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
so for this take some oil in a pan when the oil is hot

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.989
you can going to add some cumin seeds, now add finely chopped onion

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.359
okay and we're going to saute these onions till they're

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.659
slightly colored okay and also in this

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.079
we're going to add some chopped ginger and

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.580
some turmeric now add some salt

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.620
in this and let it cook for a minute

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.510
now we're going to add the cut okra just look at the way I have cut

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.200
in a diamond-shaped an add to this put
the lid on

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.810
and in between just keep sauteeing the okra

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.880
so that this is nicely cooked

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.759
and you know once it's cooked you
remove the lid and then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.780
you know kind of roast then it'll
become nice and done

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.200
so we have to add this anardana that is the pomegranate seed powder

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.530
chilli powder in the last I'm going to
tell when to do that you know

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.229
the Okra is also almost getting
cooked and this onions also

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.950
slightly golden here little more than
what I wanted now we're going to add

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.070
chilli powder and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.840
pomegranate seed powder now

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.189
just make sure whether the salt is you
know added perfect and if not

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.340
they won't taste good so make sure add
the right amount of salt

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.899
and sauteed it for another minute or so you know this is looking nice dark and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.320
perfect

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.460
because the pomegranate seed has little bit of sweetness and also sourness

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.020
and the right amount of salt will make the
okra very very tasty

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.120
Okra is cooked in tamarind gravy traditionally

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.490
and amchur powder and all that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.980
it goes very well specially with little sourness so

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.270
this dish is perfect now add the
tomatoes

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.819
and chopped coriander and also if you
want you can squeeze in little bit of lemon

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.260
juice

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
look at the way how this dish is changing
colors and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.880
this is good and also very nice colorful

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.069
switch off the flame and this is ready to serve.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.400
Now you know when you eat this just make sure

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.010
take a piece of tomato also and
that's when you'll enjoy this

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.260
Thoroughly now let's try this okra

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.370
just too good

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.580
Vah! difference very easy to make

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.590
and enjoy with a slice of tomato and it'll be

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.590
so perfect...mmm....super

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.120
