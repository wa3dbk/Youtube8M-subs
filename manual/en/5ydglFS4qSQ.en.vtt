00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.120
What we have in common...is never enough!

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.300
When you're down bring you up..start over again!

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.400
One thing you can count on...like the wind and the rain.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.740
I am here, never fear, we'll get through the pain!

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.700
One thing keeps me smilin'..and we both know it's true.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.560
I'm always your friend...I'm always your friend!

Take a drink, let us think, we'll get rid of the sad!

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.720

One thing keeps me smilin;...and we both know it's true..

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:04.720
I'm always your friend......I'm always your friend....I'm always your friend....I'm always your friend!

We'll get through the night.....We'll get to what's right!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.360
Standing tall...wise to all... the wrong to your right!

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.860
One thing keeps me smilin'....and we both know it's true!

00:02:47.240 --> 00:03:02.180
