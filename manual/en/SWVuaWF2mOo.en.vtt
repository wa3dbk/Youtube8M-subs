00:00:01.386 --> 00:00:04.256
Hello, I'm Frank DePaola,
MassDOT's Highway Administrator.

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:08.706
On August 15, MassDOT reached a
major milestone by demolishing

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:12.076
and replacing fourteen bridges
in just ten weekends on I-93,

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.716
one of the most heavily
traveled roads in New England.

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:18.856
The project is known
as "93 Fast 14."

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:21.656
It is an excellent example
of how MassDOT works safely

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:23.716
and efficiently to provide
lasting infrastructure

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:26.286
improvements while minimizing
construction-related impacts

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:27.466
for you - our customers.

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.316
Last summer, a deck
failure on one

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:33.226
of the I-93 bridges
required emergency repairs

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:34.936
which tied up traffic for days.

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:38.076
MassDOT responded
quickly to the event,

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:40.456
but we knew that substantial
construction work would

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.136
be required.

00:00:41.136 --> 00:00:43.596
Careful traffic management

00:00:43.596 --> 00:00:46.396
and communications would be
necessary to minimize the impact

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:47.476
of replacing the bridges.

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:51.456
MassDOT used several
cutting edge innovations

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.676
to replace the deteriorated
bridges and construct new ones

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:56.606
with the least possible
impact on traffic.

00:00:57.676 --> 00:00:59.496
These combined approaches
allowed MassDOT

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.236
to replace the bridges
in less than a year,

00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:04.226
rather than the four or more
years the project would require

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.476
using conventional methods.

00:01:07.486 --> 00:01:10.376
Through careful planning,
MassDOT limited work on I-93

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:13.916
to off-peak hours, confining the
highest-impact work-replacing

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:15.176
the bridges- to weekends.

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:18.206
To accelerate project
development,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.326
MassDOT employed Design/Build
contracting to advertise,

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:24.786
procure and award the contract,
which took only five months.

00:01:25.256 --> 00:01:27.686
Just four months later, the
first bridge was replaced.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.876
The "93 Fast 14" project has
been called the most ambitious

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:33.656
bridge replacement
project in the country -

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.186
and now it can be called
one of the most successful.

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:39.376
To replace the bridges,

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:42.226
each weekend MassDOT closed
the necessary local roads

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:43.876
on Friday nights at 6pm.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:47.396
Pre-fabricated modular
bridge panels-a key element

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:50.586
of the rapid construction- were
escorted to the site at 7:30.

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.916
Each 55-hour closure
of I-93 began at 8 pm,

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.086
when state police secured
the highway work zone.

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:01.246
Barrier transfer
vehicles, or Zipper trucks,

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:03.596
deployed a temporary
barrier, creating two lanes

00:02:03.596 --> 00:02:05.506
in each direction on
one side of the highway.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.096
Crews applied temporary
pavement markings

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.516
to allow a contra-flow
traffic operation.

00:02:14.516 --> 00:02:15.766
To implement the crossover,

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:18.686
the state police led a rolling
road block which allowed crews

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:20.936
to place barrels,
opening the median.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.966
With the detour in
place, traffic was led

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.856
through the crossover
to the opposite side

00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:34.816
of the highway, by 10 pm.

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.656
Once the work zone was secure,

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:48.406
crews began to demolish the
existing superstructure.

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:52.926
Each weekend, demolition
began with a team

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:54.776
of excavators tearing
apart the roadway.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:03:00.846
Steel plates protected the
local roads beneath from debris.

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:08.336
Crews cut the beam
ends and diaphragms

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:09.356
and pulled out each beam.

00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:26.326
They cut steel beams
into manageable lengths

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.526
for removal from the site.

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.796
This process continued until
all the beams were removed.

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:44.326
Laborers sprayed the site
with water to minimize dust.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:48.336
In the meantime, bulldozers push
aside the debris beneath the

00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:49.406
bridge to be hauled away.

00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:53.986
Demolition took most
of each Friday night.

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:00.196
On Saturday mornings, the
demolition was complete

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:01.586
and site cleanup was underway.

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:04.856
Crews had already completed
substructure repairs,

00:04:04.856 --> 00:04:07.286
allowing panel installation
to begin right away.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:11.546
"6:00 am we start
puttin' it back together.

00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:14.066
The pieces are here on site.

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:14.986
They're up on the highway.

00:04:15.436 --> 00:04:16.806
The cranes'll mobilize in.

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:17.876
They're local.

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:19.876
And - hopefully the first -

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:31.946
piece will be flyin'
in by 9:00 am.

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:35.016
Once each modular unit (or
panel) was lowered into place,

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:37.476
ironworkers connected
them with diaphragms.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.486
Carpenters built forms
between the panels.

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.966
Crews placed reinforcing
steel bars within the forms

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:52.466
to reinforce the concrete
connections between the panels.

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:57.726
Throughout each weekend, MassDOT
traffic engineers monitored

00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:00.806
regional roadways for
backups or accidents.

00:05:00.806 --> 00:05:03.406
They provided real time
traffic information to drivers

00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:05.636
through message boards
posted around the region.

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:09.296
They adjusted signal timing
on local streets as needed.

00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.736
State and local police directed
traffic and were on-site

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:15.916
to respond to emergencies.

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:20.446
At the end of each
Saturday, all the panels

00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:23.126
and the form work were in
place, ready for concrete trucks

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:26.006
to arrive and begin to
pour the closure concrete.

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:37.686
"it's a high early
strength concrete

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:38.586
that we've never used before

00:05:38.586 --> 00:05:41.876
that was developed
especially for this project.

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:44.296
It comes up to - design
strength very quickly.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:48.016
We're able to put traffic onto
the bridge within four hours

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:49.696
after it's actually placed."

00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:53.166
During each closure
pour, the contractor

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:56.186
and MassDOT independently took
samples to analyze the strength

00:05:56.186 --> 00:05:58.786
and quality of the concrete
at an on-site mobile lab.

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:05.426
Milling, approach grading,

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:07.936
and some full-depth paving
took place on Sundays

00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:09.606
after the closure
concrete cured.

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:17.486
To prepare the roadway
for traffic,

00:06:17.486 --> 00:06:19.226
workers installed
temporary barriers

00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:26.396
and applied pavement markings
on each new bridge surface.

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:31.426
"Now that we've got the bridge
completed - the next step is

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:34.646
to get the local road
and the road above open.

00:06:34.646 --> 00:06:37.086
And that's when we come in,
make sure it's safe to open,

00:06:37.276 --> 00:06:40.226
all the barriers put back
in place - there's no debris

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:43.266
in the roadway, sidewalk
is open and accessible.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.516
We'll do one last run through,

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:47.436
making sure everything's
off the road."

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:50.606
Each weekend, the bridge
replacements were completed

00:06:50.606 --> 00:06:53.876
early and all roads were fully
reopened several hours ahead

00:06:53.876 --> 00:06:54.406
of schedule.

00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:57.346
Paving, line striping,
barrier construction

00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:00.316
and other associated work will
occur during the upcoming weeks

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.396
in off-peak hours.

00:07:04.426 --> 00:07:07.336
This project has established
MassDOT as a national leader

00:07:07.336 --> 00:07:08.886
in accelerated bridge
construction.

00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:12.286
By replacing fourteen bridges
in under 55 hours each,

00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:15.306
MassDOT has proven how
successful innovation can speed

00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:15.976
up projects.

00:07:16.546 --> 00:07:19.286
Our approach provides
quality infrastructure assets

00:07:19.286 --> 00:07:20.496
in a safe environment.

00:07:20.496 --> 00:07:24.136
It minimizes impacts on people
during construction critical

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:26.676
to providing you with the best
possible customer service.
