00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:29.990
The first day consists of classroom.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:45.809
We spend about two hours in the classroom
going over plan of the week.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.100
After that they go into what we call the swim
room, which is underwater initial memory mechanical

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.629
release device, which basically gets them
to start thinking underwater, using reference

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.629
points.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:17.290
Using handles and levers to eventually help
them escape the overturned vessel.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.210
After that they go into what's call MSWET,
Modular Underwater Egress Trainer.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.470
Basically you strap them into a seat, flip
them upside down, they release their seat

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.640
belts, jettison a window and pull themselves
through the egress, another stepping stone

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.100
towards doing the RBS dunker.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.020
They will go upside down and EGRESS out of
that.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:51.420
The second day of training starts at 8.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.690
We get them in here and we start right off
the bat.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.970
Put them into the RBS.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.910
We have one person in the front seat, we have
a person in the back seat, and we run them

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.369
through four rides throughout the course of
the day.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.360
So it will be one ride out the front and during
daytime conditions, one ride in the backseat

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:25.720
during day time conditions for each student.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:50.689
Going through the dunking experience was actually
kind of nerve racking, a little bit because

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:57.030
its not a natural movement because your buoyancy
goes up, so you want to swim down to get out,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:09.700
which is completely unnatural thinking.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:34.291
Then we switch to night time conditions where
we will do a night ride with a student in

00:03:34.291 --> 00:04:13.629
front and a night ride with a student in the
back seat.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:28.250
It definitely makes you have a much more appreciation
for the boat from a safety as well as a EGRESS

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.740
standpoint about things you need to do, things
you may not have known prior that could potentially

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.730
be harmful inside the boat or dangerous or
the unknown things inside the boat.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.030
You become much more aware of what's going
on inside the boat when you're underwater

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.040
and its dark and theres a lot of variables.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.320
And all those variables kind of come together
here.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.010
The training center, was wonderful training.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.090
I like to tell the guys, not they are the
subject matter experts of underwater EGRESS

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.090
for an RBS.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.780
So they need to come back and just not keep
that training in to themselves but they need

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.510
to spread it to the rest of the boat crew.
