00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.820
In this video, you're going to learn one of
the most important parts of dancing, musicality.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.820
Hey what's up YouTube?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.820
This is El Tiro.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.740
You're tuned in to tutorial Thursday where
you'll learn epic new dance concept to add

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.870
to your freestyle or choreography.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.610
Now today, musicality it's so so important.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.710
It is the essence of the dance.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.800
But first, in order to listen to music, you
have to have nice gear.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.500
So not only do I want to tell you about my
cool, new sponsor, Aquaflex earphones but

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.190
actually how you can get some of these for
free.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.190
The Aquaflex earphones are made just for the
athlete.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.780
They have insane quality and they are fitting
to your ears so whether you are running, whether

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.109
you are head banging, whether you are sprinting,
whether you are dancing of course, they're

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.069
going to stay in the ear and they're going
to sound great.

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.789
So whether you have elephant size ears or
dwarf ears, these are going to fit, no matter

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.960
what.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.780
Not to mention, you can actually talk on the
phone with on these bad boys too.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.300
So you could kind of be dancing and talking
on the phone and head banging.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.960
I mean, you can do it all.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.760
Plus, they're even waterproof.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.710
So I'm going to be giving away 10 of these
bad boys.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.010
But first, let us learn about musicality.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.070
At the end of the tutorial, I will let you
know how you can be one of those lucky 10

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.070
winners.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.070
Let's go!

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.810
So for today's lesson on musicality, we're
going to be breaking down one song and we're

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.120
going to find three things, the snare, the
bass and the instrument.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.320
Now, songs are all about patterns.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.112
So as a dancer, you got to listen to the music,
pay attention to the details, and then you

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:41.110
can have a nice flow, musicality and beat
manipulation.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.780
So you can practice beat manipulation and
musicality to exact same songs that I'm dancing

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.780
to.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.840
Check the info box below, click the link and
you'll get few samples.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
Let's go!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840
So the first part that we're going to be looking
for is the snare.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840
It's usually the easiest part to find in any
song.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.540
Listen, we should do a little clap.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.960
Easy right?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.410
Now as you move to it, and kind of do a hit,
dimestop position.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.090
Just do a hit!

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.819
Simple ok, now, we're going to listen for
the bass.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.239
First, I'm going to do it kind of act it out
with a fist bump.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.489
Same thing, I want you to do a hit.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.219
Once you got it, ready?

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:46.709
I'm just moving with the chest.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.709
Cool!

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.469
Last part, we're going to pay attention.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:00.599
We're looking for the sound of the instrument.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.659
It's kind of a nice little waving motion.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.659
So we're going to do cool!

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:12.640
So once you've picked all those three sounds
out, then freestyle in dancing musicality

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.810
is incorporating all three.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.879
Like so
So next time you practice dancing, I really

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.269
encourage you to pay attention to every single
sound the song has.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.879
Again, I really encourage you to check those
links and get your free tracks from my website,

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.819
poppingmusicdance.com which you can practice
to.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.879
They're made just for this style of dance
of popping animation.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.299
So check them out.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.299
Have fun!

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.620
For tomorrow's freestyle Friday, I had a really
cool opportunity to collaborate with the DJ.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.959
He played any beat and I dance to it.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.700
So it's a cool example of kind of how you
master listening to music, you can dance to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.700
anything.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.950
Now, if you want to get your hand on the free
Aquaflex earphone, here's what you got to

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.950
do.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.930
Two things, one, make sure you are following
@casecoinc who makes the earphones, and of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.370
course my channel then, just comment below

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.279

But each time you comment has to be 5 unique
friends and I'm going to pick one lucky winner.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.060
