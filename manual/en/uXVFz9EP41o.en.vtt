00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Fazaila: Today
is Eid,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.889
its more interesting in Pakistan because

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.960
normally your relatives are living right next
to each other and you get to see everyone

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.960
every single day but here you only see each
other once in a while because of work, college, and everything.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.400
One of the points of Eid is
to wear new clothes, new shoes, its more exciting

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.550
with new clothes 
0:00:46.550,0:00:47.950,0
She wears Shalwar Kameez on Eid day
but only for a little while.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.190
On special occasions she ll wear it,
but again only for a short while

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.800
I'm not saying she doesn't wear it at all but most of the
time she is in English clothes.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.510
I told you to get dressed in Shalwaar
Kameez and you still come down in this

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.159
-It doesn't matter
-Of course it does. We're going to Green Street.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.439
If you're dressed like this its no good.
Nan: Its dark now. Nobody is going to see her.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.439
-Nan is with me on this. I don't care.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.530
I like music, and I like rapping and I like

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.530
writing my own lyrics because writing my own
lyrics I get to express how I feel
0:01:28.759,0:01:33.460
because sometimes you don't want to tell anyone else
what you really think and how you feel
0:01:33.460,0:01:37.110
and you just want to word it like poetry or something
like that.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.110
(singing): See my poetry has power, nothing is clever.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.210
Let me give you this metaphor to give you an idea.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.549
I don't tolerate or generate hate. I learn
from mistakes this is a religious...

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.049
-You girls here are useless.
You don't know how to cook and clean.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.009
You know my parents is pure sexist, you know like
they are the top.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.759
Girl 1: Yeah, its like that in Africa as well. 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.759
Women are supposed to stay
at home, not work, cook cook clean, cook clean

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.700
Fazaila: Exactly like Pakistan
Girl 1: have babies, cook clean, cook clean 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.690
Its like we are a machine like, you know! We are
like machines that always produce kids

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.690
We got better things to do in life like. I've
got work, I've got a career to think about,

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.050
I ve got so many ambitions like to do stuff.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.050
I always wanted to be one of them cops

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.129
Getting the person on the floor and beating them proper,
pulling a gun to their face..

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.970
I really like that I wanna do that to someone. We've got
to make a living for ourselves

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.970
Enjoy yourself before you're dead!

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.094
A total embarrassment what she is wearing.
Our own traditional clothes are so nice. 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.379
I told her so often to wear them,
but she still comes out dressed like this. 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.780
The Qu'ran says to keep our body covered.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.800
-It doesn't say to cover it with Shalwaar Kameez. 
-But I don t like it. Our traditional clothes are best.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.470
Woman in shop: The same with my girls
One wears traditional, the other English

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.560
Fazaila: I prefer this to jeans
because its so baggy. So you can't see my figure. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.000
Woman in shop: We're not English,
we are Muslims and we should stick to our traditions

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.440
Fazaila: Scarf, Hijaab, it doesn't matter.
What counts is the inside.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.200
I have seen more girls in a Hijaab having boyfriends
than girls who don t wear it!

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.000
Children nowadays don t listen. She wants
a Shalwaar Kameez now but I am refusing. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
She should have got one instead of the tracksuit she bought.
-Everyone is looking at me.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:50.159
I feel so uncomfortable now. Its all wrong.
I should have listened to my mum and worn Asian clothes.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.530
Fazaila s mum: If she is going
to do everything English, then she is bound

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.630
to turn English. Fazaila: It feels like I
am a prisoner. I am not allowed to go out

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.380
my house. I m stuck in these four walls and
I don t get a chance to explore the world

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.380
that s how it feels. I m a bird who should
be flying but I am caged. Fazaila s mum: Now

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.370
shut up and stop talking ..where are you going?
Come back. Fazaila: I can t be bothered with

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.830
this any more. Fazaila: At the end of the
day I was born here and its not my fault I

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.280
was born here. Its not my fault that I was
brought up here. But now that I know whats

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.180
going on I am going to take my own route.
