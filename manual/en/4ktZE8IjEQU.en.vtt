00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.800
An intimate and public place at the same time.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.180
A meeting space that was born in Universidad de Chile station

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.080
in order to bring art closer to people from santiago

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.260
that travel daily in this underground place.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
The perfectly treated artworks

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.940
give a solemnity aspect to this means of transport

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.180
that is used by two million people daily.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.760
MetroArtes celebrates its anniversary with more than 30 works

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.140
in different stations,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.460
which will increase after future inaugurations of Line 3 and 6.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.460
This initiative is not unnoticed by users.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.460
It is good that in this public places that are quite frequented by pedestrians

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.940
are being taken by artistic expressions.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.660
It is good because it is a way of innovation and, thus, the metro will not be boring.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
It is fantastic, but, unfortunately, I think people will not value it.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.780
Javier Pinto, MetroArte director, has worked with the implementation

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.360
and development of all artistic projects that are seen on the metro stations.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.400
Metro wants to make more human its services.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.060
We transport people.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.060
And by transporting people, we are transporting different worlds.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.020
We have lots of people in a psychological journey,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.800
parallel to a physical journey.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.740
We have many opportunities to "touch" those people.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.180
Eliana Simonetti, visual artist, had the privilege to exhibit her herbalist in Bellas Artes station.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.440
A Metro characteristic is its meticulousness

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.140
It is, almost, an underground place.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.220
One may think it is art antithesis.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.840
But, on the other hand, it has that intimate thing galleries posses,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.940
churches posses, that kind of protected things.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.540
MetroArtes was founded in 1993.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.180
Painter Hernán Miranda was the person responsible of exhibiting

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.000
the first work: "Interior Urbano" in Universidad de Chile Station.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.600
"Ojo Azul" was exhibited in Baquedano station in 1997, being the second work of the artist.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.360
When Hernán Miranda are in the stations, he turns himself into the spectator.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.560
And he even has to look at their creations.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.800
It is interesting because you are anonymous in front of thousands.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.460
I have stood in front of both when I have to go to Universidad de Chile station

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.740
and I can feel that I have contributed to culture.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.960
Portraits with identity is what Guillermo Lorca tried to exhibit in Baquedano station.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.660
Six people from Santiago are immortalized after three years of their creations.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.920
Language is different, artistically speaking,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.240
because, despite that apparent realism, painting has something that makes you realize

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.240
it is a painting above materiality.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.820
So, at some point, I tried to change things by replacing advertisement placements

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.860
with a scale-related language.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.740
Everyone can be part of MetroArte's project.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.980
You just have to have a proposal and a clear interesting project.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.220
Metro is in charge of the space and coordination

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.260
while artists and sponsors must finance themselves.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.220
Tenders for the new lines are opened

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.340
Selecteds are not chosen yet.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.060
MetroArte is still waiting for a project that catches people's attention.
