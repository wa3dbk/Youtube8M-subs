00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.195
Namaste. Mera naam Elly Awesome hay.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.275
Hey awesome people! I'm Elly Awesome, and as you probably know,

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.365
I'm Australian. I've tried some Indian Snacks before

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:11.545
in a taste test video, but today I'm trying

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.485
real Indian meals. Real foods

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:17.125
that aren't just snacks. Hello to all my Indian viewers.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.585
Thank you for the love and all the feedback on my

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.675
Indian snacks video. Because of you, I am doing this.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.725
and I'm really excited to try

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.455
some real Indian food. First up, I have

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.945
onion pakoras. Yes, I have notes,

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:33.815
because I don't know what everything is. I've never tried this before. Of course

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:36.815
I've had things like butter chicken and lamb korma, but all this

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:39.215
is new to me. So, I got these onion pakoras

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.235
which I believe is onion deep fried in

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:43.235
chickpea batter.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.255
Oh my goodness

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:51.065
That is so good. The restaurant I got this from

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:53.865
smelled so beautiful inside with all the spices.

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:56.965
This is really lovely. That's the pakora.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:01:00.145
There's all these different flavors in here. Different delicious herbs

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.075
and spices that I am not sure what they are

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:06.105
but it is really excellent.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.105
It's not like onion rings or anything. It's amazing. Completely different.

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.185
Spices that tingle on your tongue. I'll give this a 10/10. Now I'm

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.105
going to move onto main meals. That was an entree.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.655
This is chicken tikka masala.

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.175
Oooh it has a lemony smell.

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:25.275
I'm not sure how you all eat this in India, but this is what I

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:28.255
do at home in Australia. I make it up.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.975
I put some of the curry or the dish

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:32.985
onto my naan.

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:35.415
Wow, this smells so unique and flavorful.

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:37.285
And then I put some rice

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.355
Woah

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:47.395
Flavor explosion. Wow! You know what?

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:50.285
I think this actually has cardamom in it, which is that licorice sort of

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.305
flavored spice that I didn't like in the Indian snacks video,

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:55.115
but in this

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:56.815
it's a burst of flavor

00:01:57.405 --> 00:02:00.465
and it's really good. This chicken masala

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:01.465
reminds me of butter chicken

00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.885
but it's next level. It's a whole different

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:08.085
version of butter chicken. It's like, leveled up. It's amazing.

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.240
It's got all these herbs and spices in it that, again,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.760
tingling in my mouth

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.020
Mmm

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.640
It is just so...crazy, this mix of flavors. On it's own,

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.205
the spoonful I just had, it's a bit overpowering. But in naan

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:26.655
with rice. thumbs up. I can easily give that a 10/10,

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.745
but for people like me, Australians,

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:32.695
or for people that don't eat much Indian food, it might be a bit strange for

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:35.005
younger kids. The flavors might be

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.925
too different. But if you wanna

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.935
try something new, and exciting, and flavors you may have never

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.925
eaten before, all in one package

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.455
this chicken masala, excellent. Now I'm going to try

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.535
Palak Paneer. This looks like a very watery, uhh,

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:52.495
soupy thing.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:55.835
It's very colorful, this rice. It's got bits of yellow, bits of orange

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:59.215
mixed in with white rice. I think this Palak Paneer

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:02.465
is a spinach...tofu thing.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:05.445
This is somethin when I look at it, I'm think ugh

00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:08.085
I dunno. And when you tell me there's spinach in it. I also

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:11.635
think, ugh, that doesn't sound like it will be good.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.100
But, let's try it. How's my eating technique, by the way? Is this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.540
how you eat it? I don't know.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.580
Mm

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.195
It's actually quite good. Spinach isn't

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.560
too overpowering. It's very nice.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.460
Ohmygod.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.640
How do you eat Indian food? Or is it just messy?

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.175
It reminds me of spinach puff pastries.

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.945
Like a spinach and cheese thing in a

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.855
puff pastry triangle. This is either a piece of cheese or tofu.

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:40.645
I think tofu.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.885
Tofu is quite plain. I didn't taste much there. (laughs)

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.500
Which is sometimes good. (laughs again)

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.680
It doesn't look very good, but it tastes good. I only brought two clean plates into my room

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.495
so I'll be trying this in the same plate. This one

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.665
Dhal Masala, and it is my last dish.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.585
Now I don't remember what's in dhal masala, but I will tell you what it tastes like.

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.405
I'm pretty sure this is a popular

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:05.865
vegetarian dish from India.

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:07.265
Smells really...strange.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:10.295
I have no idea what that smell is.

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:12.015
I really need you to teach me how to eat this.

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:21.695
Woah.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.640
I don't even know what this is.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.035
What does this taste like? Like a musky flavor?

00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:29.105
I don't think you can use that to describe food but... (laughs)

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:32.075
I think, chickpeas? It must be chickpeas.

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:35.035
Oh, I think I forgot to give Palak Paneer a rating. I would give that an

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:38.445
8/10.  So far my favorite is the first one.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.865
This one, well this is a whole another flavor for me.

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:44.895
I've probably never had anything that tastes quite like this. It's a

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.080
very, very unique flavor. It's almost like smoked chickpeas. And it's not the flavor of chickpeas

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.620
when they come straight out of the can and you were to just put a spoonful of chickpeas in your mouth.

00:04:53.145 --> 00:04:56.215
It's nicer. It's pretty good. I feel like I'm liking it

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:59.345
more and more as I go. But this did catch me off guard

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:02.605
when I first tried it, so for that, I will give it a

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.595
7/10. Because, I think it's great, but I think

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:08.715
I need to eat more of it to get more used to it. Everything Indian

00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:11.665
is very interesting.  Okay, I am now very excited because

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:14.465
I am now going to try desert.

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:17.175
This smells like a fruity syrup. I am assuming

00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:20.245
that is for the Gulab Jamuns, but I'm not sure.

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:23.405
Here are the gulab jamuns. This is basically

00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:26.735
flour...a floury dough...

00:05:26.735 --> 00:05:29.355
...ball thing. You may remember in my last Indian taste test

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:32.095
I tried these before, but they were straight from the can

00:05:32.095 --> 00:05:35.095
I'm hoping these are different and super fresh.

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.535
Woah

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:40.425
Oh wow

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.520
it's just melting in my mouth. Woah, the texture!

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.080
It's so...soft.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.880
It almost crumbled and just broke apart

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.480
and fell apart in my mouth. But it's soft,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.675
and floury, and...wow.

00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:01.565
I definitely got a few bits of coconut in there too which was awesome.

00:06:01.565 --> 00:06:04.675
You can see here what it looks like, it's just a...

00:06:05.145 --> 00:06:08.495
uh, some sort of dough, I think. And it's basically sitting in

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:10.335
syrup of some kind.

00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:15.695
Woah. It's almost like a caramel, crossed with

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:18.745
a jam. These are one hundred percent better

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.695
ten billion times better than the gulab jamuns I

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.515
had from the can. You guys were all freaking out that I

00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:27.405
didn't like gulab jamuns. Well guess what, I like them.

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:30.535
The canned gulab jamuns were bad.

00:06:30.535 --> 00:06:33.325
But you all told me I should try fresh ones, so I am

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.880
and I do love them. They are great. You're right, they're better fresh.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.615
India, you have amazing food, and I'm

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:40.905
so happy that all the Indians watching told

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:43.925
me to try real Indian meals.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:46.985
It feels really awesome to try something different and new

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:50.065
I was actually a little bit scared to try these things because

00:06:50.065 --> 00:06:52.645
I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend to people

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:55.755
like me, who usually just eat butter chicken or lamb korma at

00:06:55.755 --> 00:06:58.795
Indian restaurants to try something new, try something

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:01.875
completely different, because the flavors from India

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.905
are amazing. Please share this video with your friends if you enjoyed it.

00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:07.495
Subscribe if you want to see more taste tests by me,

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:10.365
and hopefully I will see you next timeee.... bah-BYE!
