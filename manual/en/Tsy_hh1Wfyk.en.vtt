00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're in front of the gas station,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but I still don't see a Food Lion, Dora.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hm...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Do you see a Food Lion?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Yes!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Give me the binoculars.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
No, they're mine!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Tyrant.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(...Look through the binoculars.)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
...Oh.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I see it! Look!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's go!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Here we are in front of Food Lion.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And now, thanks to your help,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we have all the ingredients

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that we need to make

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the cream cheese and cooked chicken rolls.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And what should we do now?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We need to go home to cook them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Dora, can we use your house?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Of course!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Let's go!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We're about to start cooking--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Oops, sorry.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
--the cream cheese and cooked chicken rolls.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Mm.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Are you ready?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Remember, you need to be with a parent

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
if you're about to...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
About to cook.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Yes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Let's cook!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Hola, estás vayen--veyen--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
UGH! I told you we need to practice!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I'm Dora,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and...I'm...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There should be a CVS nearby.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
No, not yet.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Oops.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Is it really recording?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Is it seriously recording?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
He waved!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
HONK

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Watch us on channel 43!

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's recording.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's recording.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
...For cocaine tea,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Ms. Giamoni's favorite.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Am I recording this?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
¿Sí? Are you? No?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Okay, yeah. Now we're recording.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Are you recording?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's recording?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's been recording.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Oh.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Look! Boots!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That was so funny.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Gah!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Why am I waving? Oh my God.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Ahora...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I should flash them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's recording, Sheetal!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Sorry! I thought we were practicing!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Nope, nope, we're not ready.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's recording!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
From Millbrook?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Oh.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The Food Lion is NOT over there!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
No, we need to go to the gas station.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Oh!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Yes!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now it's on.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Come on, Dora la Exploradora!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Do it!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Is it going? --Yes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Is it really going? --Yes.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Nuh-uh.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's recording!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
No it's not.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
No, because there's no red light on.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The red--

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's recording it's recording--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
She's so tired.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Okay okay okay.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
READ!

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
To cook

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the cream cheese

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
...and cooked...chick--

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I told you, don't say it together!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We have to do that part over.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
No we don't.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We need to go home to cook them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Dora, can we use your house?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
(What a pretty car...)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
SHEETAL!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We need to go home to cook them!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That was my line.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Oh

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It was such a pretty car!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Okay, ready?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Here--

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
GET OVER THERE!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Move over!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I was so ready!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Okay.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I'm so scared of you right now.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay. Here we are in front of

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Food Lion.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
That looked like I slapped you

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in the butt!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Whoo hoo!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's on, it's recording,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
do your scene.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Okay, okay, I think we're ready.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Get up!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You--

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We've spent 4 minutes and 22 seconds

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
on BULL.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I--

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I wasn't the one laughing--

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Your turn! Go, go, go!

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Okay, if you'll stop laughing!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Whew.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Stop laughing. --Okay.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Okay, I'm finished.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Stop laughing, monkey!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Hater!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Don't you dare answer that call.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Hello?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
She doesn't want to go to prom with you!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Ay!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
What?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Eew...

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Um...it's not really working.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Why?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I don't know?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's not, like, fizzing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Is it supposed to fizz?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In oil, yeah. That's why it popped

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the first time we did it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Maybe it should be on.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Shut up!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Who turned it off?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You turned it off!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
All your stuff is on it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Oops.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Ow, my hand hurts really bad

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
from where I burned it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Why are you recording this?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Grease.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Grease, grease, grease.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And calories, and death.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I don't know if I'm in here or not. Okay.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Wait, let me go check.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Oh, it's recording isn't it?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Scoot over that way a little.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
No, a little more that way.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's recording, it's recording.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Oh, there's blood. There's blood, there's blood.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
What?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WHAT?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm going to vomit.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It's--
