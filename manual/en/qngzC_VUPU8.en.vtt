Hey everyone. Jason here. Today I'm excited
to show you my latest LEGO creation,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.800
which is this kinetic sculpture of a Da Vinci
style flying machine.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.990
Before I show you the details, I'd just like
to say I've created instructions for it,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.020
which you can find on my website, if you'd
like to try and build one yourself.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.830
I've also submitted it to LEGO's CUUSOO site,
uh, so if you'd like to see it potentially become

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.650
an official LEGO set, uh, be sure to
head over there and add you support.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.460
I would certainly appreciate it.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.260
You can find links, uh, to both of those in
the description as usual.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.390
Okay, let's take a closer look.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.390
So as you can see right now it is being operated
by a motor in the back here.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.600
Right now I'm using this old nine volt motor
but you can just as easily use a Power Functions, uh, M Motor.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200
But we'll stop it for now.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:59.610
Take it off. And if you take off the motor
you can also power it manually using this crank on the side.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.300
And it is operated quite easily.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.879
The flapping of the wings is achieved through
a pretty simple set of Technic liftarms,

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.800
which you can see here.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.159
Attached to these cranks which achieve a
somewhat realistic flapping motion.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.720
You can remove the flying machine and the
pilot from the stand quite easily.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.709
You just pop him off.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.880
And that way you can fly him
around through the air.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.179
And while he's not attached to the stand you
can operate the wings just as the pilot would

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.869
by using one of these links here.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.869
If we take a closer look at the stand, you
can see I have a simple piston built into it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.359
And that way as the wings flap, the machine
will move up and down in time with the flapping

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.089
of the wings to give a little bit more realism.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.830
So that's about all there is to it. I'll put
him back together now.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.680
As I said at the beginning of the video, I do
have instructions for how to build it on my website,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.960
and I have also added it as a project
on LEGO's CUUSOO site.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.820
I think it makes a great display model, especially
a desktop model, a great conversation piece,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.320
it's fun to play with and kind of mesmerizing
to watch.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.860
I hope you enjoyed the video. Keep on building,
and we'll see you next time.
