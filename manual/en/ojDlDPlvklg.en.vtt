00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.490
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
a Cystoscopy.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.869
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.270
The lower urinary tract allows your body to
store and release urine.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.829
It's made up of two parts, the bladder and
the urethra.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.100
Your bladder is a hollow organ that expands
as it fills with urine.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.680
Because it is made of muscular tissue, it
can also contract and force urine to pass

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.960
out of the body, through the urethra.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.010
Your urethra carries urine from the bladder
all the way through the opening in the penis.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.719
Your doctor feels that it is necessary to
examine the interior of the urethra and bladder,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.699
to try to determine the cause of a problem
that you may be having.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.710
Symptoms that may call for a routine Cystoscopy
include:

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.110
* Persistent infection of the urinary tract
* Bladder stones

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.579
* Bleeding while urinating
* Irritation due to polyps, or

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.729
* Changes to the bladder caused by cancer.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.690
Cystoscopy is a simple procedure during which
your doctor will insert a well-lubricated,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.350
instrument called a cystoscope through your
urethra and into your bladder.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.360
The cystoscope allows your doctor to visually
inspect the interior of your bladder.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.909
It also allows your doctor to remove small
pieces of tissue for later examination and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.060
even to crush small bladder stones, should
any be present.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.990
Any tissue that your doctor removes from your
bladder will be sent immediately to a laboratory

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.980
for analysis.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.960
Your doctor will ask the laboratory to check
for any sign of cancer or other abnormality.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.307
So make sure that you ask your doctor to carefully
explain the reasons behind this recommendation.

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:09.307
The nurse will swab the penis with an antiseptic
solution.

00:02:09.307 --> 00:02:14.840
Your doctor will then lift your penis upward.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.180
A well-lubricated cystoscope is gently inserted
into the urethra, the opening at the head

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.140
of the penis, and slowly guided inward.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.340
When the cystoscope reaches the back of the
penis, your doctor will pull the penis downward

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.070
in order to create a straight path into the
bladder.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.000
Once the cystoscope is inside the bladder,
your doctor will inject a small amount of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.349
water through the cystoscope and into the
bladder.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.480
The water serves to expand the bladder, helping
your doctor to better examine the interior.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.799
It also helps by washing away any blood or
remaining urine.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.870
You may feel a sense of fullness as though
you need to urinate.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.890
You'll be encouraged to relax and not to try
to retain the water in your bladder.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.970
As the team completes it's inspection, they'll
be looking for suspicious tissues.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.470
If they find bladder stones, your doctor may
try to crush these so that they can pass out

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.560
of the bladder during normal urination.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.780
If the team finds a suspicious growth they
will use a special grasping tool to take a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.160
sample of tissue in order to send to a laboratory
for analysis.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.130
When the inspection is complete, your doctor
will remove the cystoscope and you'll be asked

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.489
to empty your bladder.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.150
Your doctor will probably ask you to wear
a temporary Foley catheter.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.700
A Foley catheter is a narrow tube inserted
through your urethra and into your bladder.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.579
The catheter is connected to a bag that is
attached to your leg by a strap.

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.459
While the Foley catheter is in place, urine
will pass from your bladder into the bag.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.620
You will not need to urinate into a toilet.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.170
The nurse will show you how to change the
bag when it is full.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.489
An appointment will be made for you to return
to the doctor's office in a couple of days

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.370
to have the catheter removed.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:47.800
As soon as the anesthesia wears off and you
feel comfortable, you'll be allowed to leave.
