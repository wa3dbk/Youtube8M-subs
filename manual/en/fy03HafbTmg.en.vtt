00:00:02.392 --> 00:00:04.064
- [Both] Hey, guys!

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:05.132
- [Voiceover] We're eleventhgorgeous.

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:06.050
- [Voiceover] And we like to talk about

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.302
makeup and fashion on YouTube.

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.587
- I love it for applying bronzer.

00:00:11.587 --> 00:00:13.517
- It's scented! And it smells amazing--

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:15.024
- Are the new ones not scented?

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.091
- I don't know!

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:17.171
- Because it looks--

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.392
- She loves it long time.

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.306
- I love you long time.

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:24.366
- And I was like, "Sure,
lippies, let's go!"

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.285
And they came with us.

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:27.840
Frickin' love it.
- [Stefanie] It's amazing.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.547
- [Voiceover] We like to
think we know a thing or two

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:31.648
about applying our makeup.

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:32.461
- [Voiceover] But we also don't

00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.586
take ourselves too seriously.

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:36.851
- Self, what else can I
do to improve on awesome?

00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:38.370
- That's what you're asking yourself.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.312
Am I worried I'm gonna
break out tomorrow? No.

00:00:42.312 --> 00:00:43.687
And it kind of makes you feel like

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:45.739
you've got movement on your face.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:46.946
- Ooh, movement's good.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.319
I'm so excited I could scream.
- [Tracy] Whoo!

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.562
- [Stefanie] The higher the wing...

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:50.943
- [Both] The closer to God.

00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:55.065
- Triple XL nudes, that's sexy.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:56.307
- So go get you some of that.

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.086
- Yeah.

00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:00.509

talk about affordable fashion.

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:01.741
- [Voiceover] And like we said earlier,

00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.166
we also like to keep it fun.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.059
- Get you some!

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:07.463
- I can't find my mouth.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:08.566
- Shut up.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.785
- [Voiceover] You shut up!

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:10.843
- [Voiceover] You're not constipated,

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:12.746
you're happy because you're
having a girls' night out.

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:14.662
- [Voiceover] Who needs boys
when you have chocolate?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.504
(mumbling)

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:20.280
(burp)

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.244

00:01:21.244 --> 00:01:23.368
- [Voiceover] We love
going on amazing adventures

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:24.564
and seeing the world.

00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.829
- [Voiceover] And as
YouTubers, it's our duty--

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.220
- [Voiceover, laughing] You said "doody."

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.823

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.661

It's where dreams come true!

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:47.263
Yay!

00:01:51.723 --> 00:01:53.077
- On the way to L.A.!

00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:04.443
- So we did the CoverGirl photo shoot.

00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:05.302
- We did.

00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:06.926
It was amazing!

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.661
- [Stefanie] We are in Times Square

00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:16.516
and it is so big.

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:19.059
- I mean, y'all, the lights are so bright!

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:23.757
- It's so ugly out here.

00:02:23.757 --> 00:02:25.479
Why would anybody want to go to the beach?

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.637
I'm happy.

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:27.963
The water's so pretty.

00:02:27.963 --> 00:02:30.343
I gotta put sunscreen on as
soon as we get over to our area.

00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:31.481
- So 'til then!

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.619
- 'Til then!

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.963

00:02:34.963 --> 00:02:36.682
♫ The sun'll come out

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:38.516

00:02:38.516 --> 00:02:43.244
