I would like to say that if you are having
a problem with your TV be sure to check the

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.400
model number first. The model number appears
in this little box over here. Every TV is

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.410
different, this is a Sony LCD TV but you will
see the model number and serial number over

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.730
in a box like this. The model number are very
important because that is what will help you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.150
to identify what parts are needed to repair
your TV. If you are having a problem with

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.650
your TV, please feel free to comment in the
comments section below this video or send

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.060
us a message on YouTube with your TV model
number and the problem that you are having.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.710
This way we will be able to help you diagnose
the problem and suggest a fix. So the first

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.620
thing you are going to want to
do is make sure you have unplugged your TV

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.820
from any power source and that you have also
grounded yourself properly. Next you will

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.030
want to take out the screws in the TV that
are holding the back cover on it. Every back

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.620
cover of at TV is different but most are held
in by screws and can be easily removed. So

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.250
we have removed all of the screws here on
the back of the TV, now we are just going

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.250
to remove this back panel.
Over here we have the backlight inverter,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.780
this part can often be covered by a metal
or plastic cover so you may have to take out

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.159
some screws to get to this part if you are
going to replace it. The backlight inverter

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.659
is what controls your CCFLs or your light
source for the TV. The backlight inverter

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.670
again takes the power from the power supply
and turns on the lights that supply the light

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.549
for your TV. The backlight inverter is typically
connected to the panel and you will want to

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.909
be extrememly careful when you are removing
any of these pieces. There are different types

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.189
of connections from the backlight inverter
to the panel and typically most are fragile.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.950
Some common problems with the backlight inverter.
So if you turn on your TV and you see your

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.230
image show up on the screen for a second and
then the screen goes black it could be your

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.349
backlight inverter that is causing this problem.
So if you have sound coming from your TV but

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:27.349
you don't have an image it could also be the
backlight inverter that is causing this problem.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.909
