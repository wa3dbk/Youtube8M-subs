00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.910
Hey what's up it's BrightMint this is part
2 of my NX90 review for WePC.com

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.129
The NX90 has a large full HD 18.4 inch display
with an edge to edge glass surface.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.740
It's great that they have included a bluray
player because you can defiantly appreciate

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.630
high resolution content on this screen
It's a sharp looking screen the backlighting

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.570
is even except colors appear slightly washed.
Also, it's a glossy display so it might show

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:35.219
reflections in some lighting conditions.
Even though this laptop is intended as a multimedia

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.140
laptop the 1GB GeForce 335M graphics card
will still handle most games on the market.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.670
With the frame rate listed in the corner here
is Mass Effect 2 at max settings and maximum

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:00.539
anti-aliasing at 720p.
Crysis is playable as well except I would

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:20.440
recommend low settings at low resolution if
you want a playable frame rate.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:39.210
The Bang and Olufsen speakers are pretty comparable
to full size desktop speakers you would find

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.410
for a pc
The speakers can fill a room with sound and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.400
have a larger dynamic range then other laptop
speakers.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.690
They still lack bass and may distort at higher
volume levels. But compared to most laptop

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:04.700
speakers on the market they are brilliant.
The small TV antenna they included as spotty

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.950
reception at best.
Luckily they did include an adaptor which

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:30.560
can be used with a regular TV antenna or cable.
This is the keyboard for the NX90 it's a pretty

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.920
full-size keyboard the key travel is a little
shallow but it's OK

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.810
the key spacing is pretty good for a laptop.
The media keys are pretty much featured everywhere

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.860
on it.
The power button is a little too easy to press

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.520
And some of the keys are a little cramped
in there like the arrow keys and the side

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.530
keys.
It's a little bit hard to get oriented on

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.510
the keyboard because the nubs are a bit too
shallow.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.480
So i would not really recommend it for office
work but it's an OK keyboard.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.170
By the way this keyboard has pretty much no
flex on it whatsoever it's pretty rock solid.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.370
One of the biggest down flaws on the NX90
is these indicator lights right here.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.900
They always shin in your eyes and they are
really bright for no reason.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.830
The touchpads on the NX90 are both multi-touch
so you can rotate zoom and swap to the next

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.830
picture pretty easily.
You can also do things like page scrolling.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.340
Because the touchpads are so narrow and the
screen is such a wide format it takes a while

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.340
to scroll over because you keep running out
of space.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:28.810
I have also noticed that because the touch
pads are in such close proximity to the keyboard

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.330
you will often hit the side keys accidentally.
I find that the touch pad drivers are pretty

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.330
basic compared to other drivers.
But it can still do things like reprogram

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.610
the buttons.
So now the left side buttons would be back

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.880
and forward in the browser and the other side
still works as a normal mouse.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:56.300
One of the nice things about the NX90 is even
with a lot of ports plugged in you can pretty

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.070
much hide them all and make them invisible
when you close the laptop.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:09.680
And it still has a plenty of room
This is the webcam for the NX90 it is pretty

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:21.350
grainy
And it is also pretty laggy as you can tell

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.690
And it has got this dark spot up in the corner
because the label is not centered correctly.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.780
Ah the microphone is pretty good.
But overall I would not recommend using the

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.870
webcam at all.
The NX90 has a Intel core i7 Quad core processor

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.910
this particular version is the 720M version
I have been running CPU load tests at 100%

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.210
over 3hours now.
And overall the laptop remains cool and the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.699
fans are pretty quiet.
As for portability the NX90 is a huge laptop

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.510
it's not going to fit into any laptop bags
And it was intended to be a full on desktop

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.540
replacement.
It weighs in at 9.7lbs which seems like a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.400
lot but it's pretty typical for a laptop of
this magnitude.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.260
It get's about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of battery
life which is pretty comparable to similar

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.370
laptops in its class
Considering everything this laptop was designed

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.050
for people that want an entertainment computer
Without it dominating there space like a desktop

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.490
and cluttering there life with cables.
For people that want a laptop with just enough

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.100
portability to bring around there house
and enough style to blend in anywhere in any

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.580
room
if your that type of person I feel you will

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.740
really enjoy this laptop
if not it may fall short of your desires.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.270
In so many ways I think that NX90 is like
a concept car

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.880
It's primarily focused on having a new style
and introducing new ideas

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.420
not everything is practical for a mainstream
audience

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.290
and it goes beyond the boundary’s to showcase
new technology’s and start entirely new

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.910
philosophy of how things should be done.
It's designed to imagine what the future may

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.159
look like for laptops
