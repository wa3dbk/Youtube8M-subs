Hi everybody, Melissa here.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.650
This show is about the basics of bottle-feeding
with formula.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.950
There are really three different main types
of formula.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.391
And you're going to talk to your doctor figure
out which one is the right choice for you.

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.480
But I'm going to quickly run through them
here.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay, number one cow's milk formula.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.439
I've got some examples here.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.080
I have Similac and I have Enfamil.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.100
You can also find lactose- free formulas.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.730
Here's one that is a soy-based infant formula.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.620
And you can get lactose-free formula's that
are based on cow's milk.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.730
So talk to your doctor, figure out which one
you want to use.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.870
When it comes to what type of formula, again,
three main types: powdered formula and then

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.950
you can also get liquid formula or concentrated
liquid formula.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.949
Now most people I know use the powdered formula
for a couple reasons.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.829
Number one, it's very easy with powdered formula
to make smaller or larger quantities and not

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.140
to waste it.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.960
It's also good storage wise because it doesn't
take up as much space and it does tend to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.050
be cheaper.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.270
However, if you're going on a long trip or
something like that and you don't think you're

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.630
going to have access to water you might want
to consider one of the liquid formulas.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.600
It's sort of a nice option.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.299
So in terms of how to prepare and store powdered
formula, first make sure you use an iron fortified

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.229
infant powdered formula per the recommendation
of the American Academy of Pediatrics during

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.190
your baby's first year of life.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.490
Always check the expiration date on the formula
can.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.990
Formula can go bad and can be unsafe for your
baby.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.929
Once a can is open it's good for one month.

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.590
Lastly, formula actually has a very short
shelf life after the powders mixed with water.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.130
So do not leave powdered mix formula at room
temperature for more than one hour and always

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.600
throw out what your child does not drink.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.509
Good reason to not make more than you need.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.729
Once you mix the powder with water, it will
keep for up to 48 hours in a refrigerator.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.319
Okay, now can I use tap water in making formula?

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.630
This is something on which you should check
with your doctor.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.030
I did talk to my doctor about this and he
said in New York City it's fine.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.400
But you have to make sure because in some
cases actually fluoride levels can be too

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.030
high and doctor's will want you to alternate
between using tap water and using other types

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.030
of water.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.350
So this is something you should check out.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.500
Okay, so let's now get down to the mechanics
of how you're going to prepare your formula.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.890
Now the first thing you to want to do you
want to make sure you have a very sterilized

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.960
bottle and nipple and that you're hands are
clean.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.020
So wash your hands carefully.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.700
And here I am, I've got my bottle, I'm going
to use my Born Free bottle.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.340
And Born Free actually has these nice inserts,
these of course all have to be clean too.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.390
And he first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to put my water in my bottle, not the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.330
other way around, because that can skew the
measurements of the formula.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.560
So I'm just for demonstrations purposes, I'm
going to pour up to four ounces, and I'm using

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560
my Brita.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.730
So this is tap water but it is sterilized
tap water.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.070
So I go right up to the four ounces on the
bottle and then I'm going to add my formula.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.810
I'm going to use the one I've already opened,
wait not that one, I've got to get the Similac.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:24.090
Okay, so typically with formula, one level
scoop of the formula is equal to two ounces

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.090
of water.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.680
So we have four ounces here, not being a great
mathematician, but that's going to tell me

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.760
I need two scoops of formula.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.820
And I'm going to make sure that they are quite
level.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.730
All right so I round it out like this and
then I use my clean index finger to just,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.570
just like that, just you make your cookies
when you don't want to over do it on the salt

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.570
or sugar.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.600
Okay, so there I go.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.520
Nice smooth rounded scoop full.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.860
It's really, really important that you don't
underestimate it in terms of the quantity

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.860
of formula.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.390
You want to make sure that your baby is getting
all that nutrition and you cannot underdo

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.390
it.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.390
That's very, very important.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.610
It's better to use room temperature water
because that's going to dissolve more quickly

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.500
and more easily in your bottle.So now, I've
attached my little Born Free piece, I'm screwing

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.780
on the top of my bottle.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.959
Make sure you get this on level and tight
sometimes when I'm in a hurry it goes on slanted

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.449
and then it will leak.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.000
Then I'm going to put on my top and I'm just
going to shake and I'm going to wait.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.150
And those clumps are going to go away.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.100
And I'm going to wait until the formula is
completely dissolved into the water.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.230
Do not give it to your baby before its completely
dissolved into the water.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.680
Okay, I'm not drinking this on camera guys.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.730
You're going to have to imagine how good it
is for the baby.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.730
I'm not going to go that far.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.550
But I'm going to make sure it looks totally
incorporated.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.640
Okay, looking good- shake it back and forth-
looking good.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.500
Okay, let's talk a little bit about warming
up your baby's bottle and how you're going

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.772
to want to do that.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:51.960
Do not warm bottles in the microwave.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.960
This can cause unevenness in temperature.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.990
The best thing to do is to take your prepared
bottle of formula out of the fridge one hour

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.110
prior to use or place your bottle in a pan
of hot water.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.160
Then test a few drops on the backside of your
hand to make sure it's not hot but just luk

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.290
warm.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.670
When it comes to bottle feeding your baby,
and I'm a big fan of back position, but make

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.180
sure that you're sitting in a way that's very
comfortable for you and the baby is nicely

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180
propped up.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.300
And you want to make sure that her head is
over her tummy.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.100
And then, when you give her the bottle- I'm
going to keep the top on here because otherwise

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.510
it's going to start to leak down- you want
to make sure that there is no air at all in

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.320
this nipple area so that there's not any excess
air that your baby is ingesting because this

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.820
can cause colic or gas and a very, very fussy,
fussy baby.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.710
So you're going to sit like this, you're going
to prop up your bottle, it's going to be kind

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.500
of coming from up above, and you're going
to start giving your baby the bottle in that

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.500
way.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.170
So I hope that these little tips will help
you in giving formula to your baby.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.680
And I'll see you next time!
