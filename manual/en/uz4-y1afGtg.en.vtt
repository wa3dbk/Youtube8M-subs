00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:24.750
You know what's crazy about this?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.300
This is a two-pack.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.039
As in, two games in one...pack.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.150
Which means there's, like, double the content,
right?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.130
And yet...there's seriously, like, maybe an
hour's worth of content in this entire cartridge,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.130
combined.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.380
And that's being generous.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.030
Hey, I've seen chewing gum commercials.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.390
I know how this is supposed to work.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.409
Double your pleasure, double your fun.

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:52.430
It's supposed to be multiplication.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.420
Not...freaking division.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.470
So I don't even know what to call this game.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.610
I guess it's Matchbox Missions: Air, Land
and Sea Rescue (slash) Emergency Response.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.080
Takes longer to say the name, than to play
the game.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.860
You start it up, you get two options.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.140
You can play either Air, Land and Sea Rescue
or Emergency Response.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.530
Spoiler alert, they both suck.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.830
Double spoiler, Emergency Response is even
worse.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.830
See how that works?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.990
You double things, there should be more.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.750
So let's start with that.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.000
Emergency Response.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.080
It's basically just a top-down police chase.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.950
You can either be the cop or the fugitive.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.170
When you play as the fugitive, you have to
outrun the cop and get out of town before

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.500
he slams you off the road.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
Play as the cop, and you have to do the opposite,
and slam the bad guy off the road.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.560
Too bad that's...way easier said than done.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.350
So the first problem is that...the driving
in this game is awful.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.159
No matter which side you pick, you're gonna
be slower than the other guy.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.159
It's ridiculous.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.650
You try to outrun the cop?

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.630
He bumps into you, like, every five seconds.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.630
You can't shake him.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.920
And not only because the cars are too slow
and the driving mechanics suck...but also

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.000
because the roads are narrow, so you're obviously
gonna slam into things.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.030
Oh, and it never tells you where to go.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.770
So you just drive around aimlessly.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.810
You know, while Officer D*ck Breath plays
bumper cars, and your slow-ass car just...whatever.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.050
This sucks.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:33.510
So then you switch to Air, Land and Sea Rescue.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.680
And all the sudden...it goes from insanely
hard to the easiest, most forgiving game in

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680
the world.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.200
You have a couple different emergency vehicles,
each one has a couple rescue missions...and

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.319
it's way better than the other game.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.860
Which says a lot about terrible the other
game is, because this still sucks.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.760
Anyway, the rescue missions all have pretty
much the exact same format.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.980
You have to drive around the screen and pick
things up.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.099
Whether it's survivors, or supplies, or whatever.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.450
Drive around, grab stuff, win the game.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.810
In fact, you can finish all the missions for
each vehicle in minutes.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.760
There's really not much here, in terms of
content.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.239
Or gameplay, for that matter.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.660
It all feels the same.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.010
Fortunately, Air, Land and Sea Rescue at least
mixes things up in terms of the vehicles.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.400
You have the helicopter, the ambulance, the
rescue boat...and even though they feel pretty

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.680
much the same, there's at least an aesthetic
difference.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.910
The boat levels are probably the most fun
you'll have in the entire game, actually.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.430
You have to navigate these maze-like waterways,
locating the targets...that part actually

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.500
doesn't suck.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.300
But all the other vehicles suck.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.750
And for some reason, the helicopters can't
fly over buildings.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.370
That's the kind of quality you can expect
here.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.080
I don't know if these games were released
individually, and this is, like...a compilation

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080
of the two?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.760
That would be ridiculous.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.520
They don't even have enough gameplay combined.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.509
And buying them on their own, you'd be better
off throwing your money into a fire.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.139
This is an ugly-sounding, boring-looking,
poorly controlling game.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.050
With a title so long, you can tell no one
cared.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.110
They were, like, "Eh, who cares what we call
it?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.599
Did you even drive that cop car?"

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.460
It's Matchbox Missions: Air, Land and Sea
Rescue (slash) Emergency Response.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.939
One of the most pointless Game Boy Advance
games, ever.

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:41.930
Thanks to Daniel, from Palm Coast, Florida,
for sending it in.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.889
And giving me a headache.
