00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.500
The President:
Hi, everyone!

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.834
This stack of books right here
is called the Federal Register.

00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:07.533
For decades, copies have
been printed, bound,

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.200
and sent to thousands of
government offices all across

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.734
the country every single day.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:15.400
And while you might think that
most people just can't wait to

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.066
dig into their copy
as soon as it arrives,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.066
the truth is no one reads this
thing and that's because it's

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:25.166
been available on the Internet
for years which means taxpayers

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:29.433
have been funding some
pretty expensive doorstops.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.667
So we're putting an end to
that, saving you millions

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.934
of dollars each year.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.800
But that's just the
tip of the iceberg.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.133
Everyone knows that getting rid
of the deficit will require some

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.500
tough decisions.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.467
And that includes cutting
back on billions of dollars

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.567
in programs that a lot
of people care about.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.266
But what should be easy is
getting rid of the pointless

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:51.433
waste and stupid spending
that doesn't benefit anybody.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:54.967
Waste we should be getting rid of
even if we didn't have a deficit.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.266
We're off to a good start.

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.734
Over the last two years we've
pulled the plug on all kinds

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:00.533
of ridiculous practices.

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.166
Apparently the government used
to overnight containers filled

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.734
with nothing.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.633
Don't ask why that is.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.467
Sure, some of these
cuts aren't that big.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:11.767
But no amount of
waste is acceptable,

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.100
not when it's your money,
not at a time when so many

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
Americans are already cutting back.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400
Just as families are
living within their means,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.800
government should, too, so we
could invest in the things that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.000
we know will create good
jobs and grow the economy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.066
Things like education
and technology.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.367
Besides, after a while
all these cuts add up.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:35.667
Already we've identified about
$33 billion in savings just for

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:36.967
this year.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.300
And we're not finished;
not by a long shot.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.700
Did you know the Federal
Government pays for a website

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.133
devoted to a folk music ensemble
made up of forest rangers?

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.600
They're called the
"Fiddling Foresters."

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.133
♪♪ (music playing) ♪♪

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.233
I'll put their music on my
iPod, but I'm not paying

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.233
for their website.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.800
And there are hundreds of
similar sites that we should

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.767
consolidate or just get rid of.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.800
And, by the way, you're not
only paying for websites no

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.367
one needs, you're paying for
thousands of buildings all

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:06.967
across the country no one uses.

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.867
For the last decade the
government has owned a massive

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:13.000
and completely empty warehouse in
the middle of Brooklyn, for example.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.166
Now, the government hadn't been
able to sell this building and

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.166
others like it because of red
tape and Washington politics

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.033
that held things up for years.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.934
But we're finally cutting through
all that and plan to get rid of

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.500
these buildings
in the months ahead.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.066
All of these efforts to
target waste and make

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.400
government more efficient
have been a priority for

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.266
my Administration since day one.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.000
But as we work to tackle
the budget deficit,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.734
we need to step up our game.

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.533
We need to go after every dime.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.700
We need to make
government work for you.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.667
That's why, starting today, I've
asked the Vice President to lead

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.467
a renewed effort to hunt down
misspent tax dollars in every

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.900
agency and department
of this government.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.300
We're calling it "The Campaign
To Cut Waste" and I know Joe is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.266
the right man to lead it
because nobody messes with Joe!

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.967
The Vice President:
There's a new standard
by which the government

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:04.800
is going to function
from this point on.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.100
The American people are
entitled to transparency.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.400
By that I mean they're entitled
to be able to figure out where

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.266
their dollars are going
and they're entitled to

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:18.467
accountability to make sure that
we're using the dollars for what

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:19.934
we said it was for.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.100
That's our job.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.934
And we take that
job very seriously.

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.867
Look, a lot of this depends on
new, sophisticated methods,

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:33.333
but it also, it also, we know,
depends on relentless focus on

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.467
making this a priority.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.567
A focus that can't be delegated.

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.166
We're holding ourselves
accountable and we're deeply

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.734
committed and focused on making
government function better.

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:45.700
We're not just eliminating
fraud and waste.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.700
We hope to be instilling an
entire new culture with not

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.333
only our Administration, but
every succeeding administration

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.567
will in fact pursue.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.600
We're going to give you
the government you expect

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.967
and deserve.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:03:59.200
So I want to thank you all.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.500
And we're ready to get to work!
