00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.900
Hey I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to tighten a door knob. Now

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.710
over a period of time just from daily use
you can get into a situation like this where

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.930
over a period of time your door knob will
loosen up. So essentially what we want to

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.359
do to make it easier to work on you want to
go ahead and open your door just a little

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.029
bit where you can reach around to the other
side. Now you'll always get a little bit of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.520
wear spots around here so you want to, and
the door knobs are designed so that there

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.149
is a little bit of play in them so they will
move up and down if they are loose so what

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.539
you want to do is you want to hold the back
side of the door knob with your hand. Now

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.399
I'm right handed so I'm going to use my left
hand to hold the back side and then I can

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.699
position that door so that it is covering
up any wear rings that are caused on the surface

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.679
of the door so we don't want that to show
after we tighten that up. Now most of your

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:08.000
door knob handles are with a Phillip's tip
screwdriver is what you are going to use to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.810
cover this up and it has that common hex pattern
in that screwdriver so that is how you recognize

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.250
what a Phillip's Head is. Specifically this
is a #2 Phillip's and it comes in three different

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.450
sizes. #1 is your smallest tip and #2 is your
standard tip and then there is a #3 for a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.399
larger screws. This is a #2 Phillips. Now
what you will actually do is you'll approach

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.439
the screw at an angle and you want to make
sure you use a longer screwdriver such as

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.970
this which is just a standard screwdriver
and then we'll work on one side so keeping

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.229
it located where you want it. You want to
just tighten that up so it is snug. It is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.690
important not to overtighten this. You don't
want to strip out these screws and make them

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.640
difficult. So what you want to do is you want
to put enough pressure and you want to just

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.180
snug these up just so there is no more movement
and then also before you close the door it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.760
is a good idea once you have snugged this
up to go ahead and rotate it a few times just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.220
to make sure there is not any binding. If
there is some binding and you close the door

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.250
it can be a little difficult to get the door
back open so in this case the door knob rotates

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.380
freely and you can go ahead and close the
door and you can double check it and sure

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.860
enough it is nice and tight and it is not
moving. I'm Tim Gipson and that is how to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.359
tighten a door knob.
