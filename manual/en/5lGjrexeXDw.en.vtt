00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.779
Being back in UNESCO Heritage city Malacca,
Malaysia on our one year travel anniversary

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.900
was the perfect chance for us to eat Thali,
an Indian meal made up of various dishes typically

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.040
including rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad,
chutney and pickle.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:30.150
It is lunchtime here in Melaka and today we're
eating at the Selvam Banana Leaf restaurant,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.460
which is an Indian restaurant.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.320
We've been here several times during the week.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.120
It is one of our favorite places so far.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.530
It is really popular with locals, so we're
going to show you what a Thali set meal looks

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.530
like.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.270
When I was backpacking in India three and
a half years ago I subsisted off of Thali,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.760
so I'm thrilled to be having the opportunity
to eat it again here in Malacca, Malaysia.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:06.030
Thali is an Indian meal that consists of various
kinds of dishes.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.939
It can be served on a platter or - in this
case- we're having it on a banana leaf if

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.939
you take a look at it down here.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.219
It comes with different vegetables, curries
and rice.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.060
Typically you would eat this using your hand;
however, someone has to hold the camera, so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.009
I'm going to be using cutlery and Sam will
demonstrate how it is done the proper way.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.009
Alright boy, dig in.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.009
Get them fingers dirty.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.009
You mix it around here.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.009
There we go.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.009
That's awesome stuff.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:42.009
Sam and I ordered two different Thali sets.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:02:19.640
He is having the vegetarian one and I am having
the chicken but the only difference is that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.610
I get a little plate with a chicken curry
on the side.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.710
Everything else we got was the same.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.230
We have the same dhal, the same rice and the
same chips.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.970
Take a bite of that chicken to see how it
tastes.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.840
I already have a chunk here.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.260
It is very tender and you can tell it has
been cooked slowly for a long time.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.500
It is really good.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Is it spicy?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.220
Of course, a bit of Indian spice in there.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.710
One thing I absolutely love about Thali is
the concept of the bottomless refills.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.510
You eat until you're fully satisfied.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.860
That means if you go through your rice - and
you finished your rice and you want more - you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.030
call them over and they load you up.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.760
It is perfect for a hungry boy.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.080
Our Thali lunch came to 22 Ringgit which is
roughly $7 USD and that included three drinks,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.610
two different Thali sets (including a chicken
and a vegetarian) and a roti pisang banana

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.189
flat bread for dessert.
