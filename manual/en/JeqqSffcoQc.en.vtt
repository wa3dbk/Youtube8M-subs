00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.800
Not all inkjet printers are created equal;
for photo printing you want a really particular

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.520
kind of inkjet printer.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.580
The good news is, there aren't actually that
many that you need to consider.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.180
The realm of photo-quality inkjet printing
is pretty small, so you'll probably just be

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.940
looking at about half a dozen printers.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.300
For the rest of this chapter you're going
to sit in with my class at the Oklahoma Summer

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.190
Arts Institute as I talk with them about all
of the issues you need to consider when you're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.860
trying to pick a good printer for photo inkjet
printing.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.059
And we're going to start that right now with
a discussion of why inkjet is better than

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.610
the other printing technologies that are currently
available.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.500
There are a lot of different printing technologies
out there.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.280
There is inkjet, which we've been using.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120
There are also Laser printers which you might
have used.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.890
And there are some other technologies what
you might not have heard of, like dye sublimation

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.350
or thermal wax.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.420
For the most part, as far as photo printing
goes, it's entirely about inkjet these days.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.010
Those other technologies, like thermal wax
where, those were printers that actually had

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.100
kind of like crayons in them that were melted
onto the page.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380
Most of that has gone away.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.409
Dye sublimation, or dye sub, is still around,
and one nice thing about dye sub is it gives

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.340
you a truly continuous-tone print like you
get in the darkroom; it's not a bunch of dots

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.659
or anything like that.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.789
The downside to dye sub is you have to print
on special dye sub paper, so you don't have

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.820
a lot of paper options and it's expensive
and the prints can be a little soft.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.840
Laser printers are nice because they're cheap.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.060
They're cheap to buy, and they are cheap to
use.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.520
Cost-per-print wise is cheaper on a laser
printer than anything else, even a color laser

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.200
printer, but they don't have-- they're not
continuous tone.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.540
It's more like a newspaper.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.540
You look up close.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.130
You can see little dot patterns.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.280
They don't have the color gamut, meaning they
don't have as wide a range of colors.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.130
Their detail isn't the same, and you can't
print on lots of different media like glossy

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.869
paper and stuff like that.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.250
So it comes down to inkjet.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.100
And inkjet it's a technology that's been around
for quite a while, and it's called inkjet

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.060
because it really is just that.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.280
It's a bunch of ink, and there is a little
nozzle that's goes "splzzzz" and spits it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.860
all over the page in the shape of a photo.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.210
Now you might have an inkjet printer at home
that you use for printing out Microsoft Word

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.820
documents and things like that, and it might
be color, and it might do an okay job of printing

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.820
a photo.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.630
What we have here is an actual inkjet printer
designed specifically for photos.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.690
This specific one is an Epson Stylus Photo
R2880, and they still make this printer.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.660
It's also been supplemented by a new printer,
the R3000.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.370
The important thing about this printer is
it uses--it doesn't have the sticker on anymore--the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.410
Epson K3 ink system, which is a very particular
set of inks that's great for photo printing.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.040
So what happens when you send an image to
the printer is as you know, onscreen every

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.900
pixel is an individual color.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.080
So the pixel in the upper left-hand corner
might be red, and that red has a particular

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.130
numeric value.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.370
That value is sent to the printer driver,
which tries to translate that single dot of

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.890
color into a pattern of printer dots of the
same color.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.910
So this printer has eight different inks in
it, I believe, and those are mixed together

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.190
to create every other color.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.590
But they are not mixed together in the way
that you would in a painting studio, where

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.710
you glob a bunch of different inks together
and swirl them around, and now you've got

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.700
a final ink that's a particular color.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.870
Instead, it's more like what you see in a
magazine.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.840
They lay down patterns of dots in particular
ways, and it just so happens that if you lay

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.190
down out one of ink colors in a certain way
next to some of the other ink colors, you

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.500
get fuse or whatever.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.720
So a single-colored pixel on screen is represented
on your page by maybe a hundred printer dots,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.760
teeny, tiny, little printer dots.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.750
So the first thing--the first mistake that
people often make is they see the resolution

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.670
of the printer--and this printer will list
its resolution as 1440 dots/inch or 2880 dots/inch

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.820
and they think, oh my gosh, I have to have
an image that's 1440 pixels per inch.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.180
And that's not true, because a single pixel
on your screen is represented by a whole bunch

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.350
of printer dots.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.120
And we'll talk about resolution later when
we talk about how you size your images.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.370
So there are a number of different things
to think about when you're choosing an inkjet

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.370
printer.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.620
There are inks, whether you want to print
black-and-white stuff, how big you want to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.820
print, what kind of computer you have, and
so on and so forth.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.010
So we're going to talk about those in the
next couple of movies here.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.229
For now I'd just say the thing to learn if
you're serious about photo printing is don't

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.960
worry about any other printing technology;
get an inkjet printer, one specifically designed

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:58.740
for printing photos, and we'll talk in a minute
about what the differences are between that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.430
and the inkjet printer you might already have
at home.
