00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.400
Hey everyone!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.080
Jaystepher here with a tutorial on a park bench

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.320
that is easy to construct and is scaled for minifigures.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.620
First let's take a 6 by 8 plate.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.360
This is going to be the base.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040
You can use any size you wish.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.300
Now take two studs.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.500
Let's place two on the left

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.760
right next to each other.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.340
Skip two studs.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.340
Place two more on the right.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.760
These are going to be the legs.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.420
Next take two 1 by 2 plate with vertical stub.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.180
Let's place one on the left

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
and one on the right.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.460
These are going to be used to attach the back of the bench

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.360
as well as to raise up the bottom.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.740
Now use a 2 by 6 plate.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.760
Place it right on top of the 1 by 2 plates with stubs.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.120
Now use two 1 by 2 jumper plates.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.900
Place one on the left

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.160
and one on the right.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.200
The bench is not complete without arms.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.300
So let's take two nozzles.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.000
We're going to place one on the left

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.800
and one on the right

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.940
where the nozzles are facing the same direction

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.060
as the friction stubs.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.460
Let's begin the back of the bench with a 1 by 2 plate with fork

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.580
and a 1 by 2 modified plate.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.380
Looks like it has three bars.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.000
Let's place the fork right underneath like so.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.800
Let's make two assemblies.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.060
So take another 1 by 2 plate with fork

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.700
and another 1 by 2 modified plate

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.580
with the three bars.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.440
Now simply slip the forks right inside the stubs.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.200
Raise them up where they touch he arms.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.780
And there is the park bench.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.280
Let's test it out with Jay The Surfer.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.860
He needs a place to rest after a long day surfing the waves.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.100
As you can see, it's scaled for minifigures.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.320
It is easy to construct and fun to build.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.660
This park bench will be perfect for any Lego park

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.600
or a place where a minifigure needs to have a seat.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.300
Thank you all for watching!
