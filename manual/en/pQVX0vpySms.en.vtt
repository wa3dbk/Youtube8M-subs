This is Betsy from Classroom Caboodle.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.750
Today I’m going to share a first day of
school activity packet to use with intermediate

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.180
students.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:22.960
Okay, so we all know how crazy that first
morning of school can be.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.079
And what do you want to have students doing
while you are checking in new students, dealing

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.230
with student supplies or generally getting
things arranged in the classroom to start

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.300
your day?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.950
On the first day of school, what I do is I
have a packet sitting on each student desk.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.040
This packet I created with questions that
will help me get to know students a little

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
better.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:56.960
So the first two pages, students get to write
all about themselves.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.870
I also include in the packet a little writing
prompt that even on the first day of school

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.799
helps me get to know students a little bit
better as writers.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.229
The prompt is: If you have $100, what would
you do with it?

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.289
The students love this idea, and it’s a
great day to remind students about what your

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:18.929
writing expectations are.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.890
Of course, we want them writing in complete
sentences and using paragraphs and the best

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.170
spelling that they know how to use.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.109
And just for fun, I created a back-to-school
word search.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.840
Everybody loves these.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.219
And then...if...and this is available on my
Teachers Pay Teachers store called Classroom

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.950
Caboodle, too.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.409
On the first day of school, the homework I
give students is to give their parents homework.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.179
This is a little questionnaire that students
take home to their parents.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.469
This is getting the parents’ viewpoint of
their child: on what are their strengths,

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.539
their weaknesses, maybe cultural things that
they celebrate in their family, and anything

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.790
that I need to know to better help their student
throughout the year.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.450
And it's the student’s job to make sure
that this gets filled out and returned on

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.459
the second day of school.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.400
So again, you can find this packet on my Teachers
Pay Teachers store.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:37.199
It’s a great way to keep the kids busy on
that first morning on the first day of school.
