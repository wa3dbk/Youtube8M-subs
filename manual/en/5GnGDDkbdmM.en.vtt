00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.440
The next thing I would to like to show is
playtime, which I think is really important

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.300
for students. And, this does not have direct
application to bead making but it is in general

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.830
a fundamental aspect of bead making. We are
going to take a cane of beautiful glass. This

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.800
is transparent cobalt. And, I am going to
heat it in the middle on the torch. Gradually

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.020
further out and I am going just play with
it like a taffy ball. We are going to compress

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:43.329
the glass together. You can see the gather
developing. Just gently take your time on

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:52.679
this. It is balling up in the middle and there
is no right and wrong other than you not hurt

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.980
yourself, but you can kind of see it is like
taffy. And, I am just swirling it and mixing

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.280
it. Be careful not to let your hands slip,
or the glass break and find yourself speeding

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.479
towards the flame with one of your fingers.
So, go nice and easy. Do not force things.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.880
And, if it is starting to get out of control
and soupy, you know, pull away from the heat

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.470
and let the glass sort of settle down. Let
the heat soak in. There is usually a time-lag

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.369
between when you put heat in and when the
glass moves. So, play with that time-lag.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:40.270
You can see that beautiful shape that we are
having now. You can reheat it. It takes more

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.860
heat and time to heat a fat part part of glass
than a thin one. So, if you heat the handle,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.219
part where you are connecting onto the glob
with, that is going to pull apart really quickly

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:58.830
like that. Oops. So, go reconnect. You can
always go back. Glass has no memory. You can

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.530
reconnect and do that accordion thing as many
times as you like and this is a very valuable

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.890
exercise to gaining familiarity and facility
with this marvelous magical substance known

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.140
as glass. Gradually stretching out and reheating.
Do not rush. Do not be in a hurry. And, at

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.120
some point though we will make a decision.
The heat is evenly spread. Now pull slowly,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.130
slowly, slowly and as it gets firm, pull faster
and faster. Shrinking down the diameter of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.070
the glass to about one and a half millimeters.
And, there you have it. It freezes relatively

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.760
quickly. I am holding steady. You can also
put it in the vertical to make sure you have

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.890
a straight line. The glass is still extremely
hot so only pick it up at the ends that you

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.720
know are safe. Reintroduce the glass to the
flame and there you have it. Put your hot

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.200
end away and this middle portion is hot so
do not touch. You will burn yourself. The

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.790
goal, however, is not burn yourself badly
in any event. Minimize the burning and there

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.920
you have a beautiful piece of stringer. From
here we are going to make, in the next segment,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.209
going to make a two color stringer.
