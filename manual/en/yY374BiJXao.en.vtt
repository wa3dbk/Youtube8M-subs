00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:09.750
Okay, after having adjusted the ball links
for fluid motion, I need to pull up the swash

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:30.989
plate pitch compensator assembly, and connect
these ball links. Okay, one of the last steps

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:40.190
completing the rotor head assembly is installing
the fly bar paddles. Now, depending on your

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.960
model, they'll attach in different ways, but
you really want to make sure that you're holding

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.420
this shaft securely, especially if these screw
on, which I think probably most of them do.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.870
Now, just like the length of the fly bar,
we want to verify that we have the same distance

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.210
on both of the fly bar paddles on the fly
bar. You want to be really careful with this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.930
part. It's absolutely imperative that you
do not bend this fly bar. If this fly bar

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.689
is bent, you're going to have all kinds of
flight issues. Okay, it's extremely important

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.409
that the fly bar paddle, this part here, and
this fly bar assembly cross piece, that you

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.649
sight down these, and you can see that the
paddle and that cross piece are level. That's

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.250
extremely important. If this is tilted up
or down, you're going to have some problems.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:49.909
Okay, now I am hooking up the final two ball
links to the pitch control arms from the swash

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:02.079
plate here, and that will complete the assembly
of the rotor head. Now, what you want to do

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:10.690
is go back over your work, make sure that
all the parts work freely, there's no binding,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.570
there's no grittiness, you can't feel any
resistance in this assembly, because this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.100
has to work absolutely freely in order for
your helicopter to function properly. Pretty

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.770
cool, huh?
