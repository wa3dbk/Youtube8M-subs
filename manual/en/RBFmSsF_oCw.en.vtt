00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.339
- Hey everyone, how's it going?

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:05.834
So I am back with a new
Dress It Yourself video,

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.935
but before we get into that,

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:12.057
let's just talk about the
elephant in this room.

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:14.100
Yes I did get a haircut,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.722
and I went pretty dramatic this time.

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.394
I'd gone shorter then this before,

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:21.275
but I haven't gone short
in a very, very long time.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:23.191
It took me awhile to get use to,

00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.405
but I am really, really enjoying
this new short hairstyle.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:30.621
So I'm starting my New
Year's off really early.

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.326
I will have to talk more
about this transformation

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:34.499
in another video,

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.737
but for today's video

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.342
we're doing a Dress It Yourself.

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:41.511
I have been in love with red lately.

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:43.972
And I feel like red is my color.

00:00:43.972 --> 00:00:48.140
Coincidentally, red is
also the color of 2015.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.265
I use to hate red because I feel like

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:53.307
it's such a grownup color,

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:55.687
but now it's really like grown on me.

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:59.147
And I feel like my skin complexion
looks better against red.

00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:01.190
So that is why I've been really loving it,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.065
and I have been obsessed
with flannel shirts lately.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.726
And I think it's due to
the cold, cold weather.

00:01:07.726 --> 00:01:09.185
So today's video I'm going to show you

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.743
three different looks that you can style

00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:14.460
with this red flannel.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.460
(soft electronic music)

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.301
My first pairing, I'm going for a softer

00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:28.973
and relaxed approach.

00:01:28.973 --> 00:01:31.434
Since the shirt has a loose boyfriend fit,

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:34.975
I like to pair the top
with well-fitted jeans.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:37.065
I like jeans with a good amount of stretch

00:01:37.065 --> 00:01:40.345
for flexibility and comfort.

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:42.649
To keep me cozy I decided to go

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.820
for a thick, chunky sweater.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.855
This makes the perfect outer layer.

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:50.289
For shoes, I went for my brown booties

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.912
to balance with my sweater.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.314
If you live in colder climates,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.535
layer a nice wintery coat on top

00:01:56.535 --> 00:01:58.462
to keep you warmer.

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:00.958
This cozy look is perfect
for any day activities,

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:05.091
like running errands, or meeting
friends for tea or coffee.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:10.009
(soft electronic music)

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:21.850
Leather immediately adds edge to any look,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.821
and I cannot live without
these leather pants.

00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:28.654
This first look I put together is

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:31.614
for a casual holiday party.

00:02:31.614 --> 00:02:33.321
Although this is a casual outfit,

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.958
the faux leather In the high heels

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.955
add a nice posh appeal.

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:41.373
(soft electronic music)

00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:42.922
And then on the same night,

00:02:42.922 --> 00:02:45.997
I just slip on a vest
to meet up some friends

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:48.797
for a movie date.

00:02:48.797 --> 00:02:50.759
This whole outfit is not overly dressy

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.723
for an evening look,

00:02:51.723 --> 00:02:53.139
but it's definitely an upgrade

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.891
to being simple and laidback.

00:02:55.891 --> 00:03:00.891
(soft electronic music)

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:13.236
For my second outfit choice,

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:15.860
I wanted to encorporate the unexpected.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.833
If you work in a relaxed type of business

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.039
where it's not just pant suits,

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.373
try being playful with your choices.

00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:24.207
I decided to pair my plaid top

00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:26.620
with this nicely shaped wool shirt.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.992
The zipper detailing really adds

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:29.742
a more dynamic personality

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.683
to the overall feel and ties in with

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:35.515
anything for a less traditional pairing.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:40.515
(upbeat music)

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:53.557
That is it for today guys.

00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:54.855
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.353

00:03:56.353 --> 00:03:57.493

00:03:57.493 --> 00:03:59.908

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.288

00:04:02.288 --> 00:04:05.214
or is there an item that you have been

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:07.823
obsessing over this wintertime.

00:04:07.823 --> 00:04:11.297
Mine is obviously flannel plaid shirts,

00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:13.631
and also anything red.

00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.802
So I hope you guys enjoy this video.

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:17.915
I really hope on, continuing on

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.967
making these styling videos for you.

00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:21.595
I know that some of you guys

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.058
have been missing these videos,

00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:24.974
cause I started my YouTube video

00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.483
doing lots of styling videos,

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:28.097
and then somehow last year,

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:29.153
in the last couple of years

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:31.139
I gravitated more toward DIY.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.950
But I want to go back to

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.201
making styling videos and just, you know,

00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:37.536
showing you guys that side of me

00:04:37.536 --> 00:04:39.161
that I enjoy so much.

00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.623
I plan on doing at least once a month,

00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:43.457
toward the end of the munch.

00:04:43.457 --> 00:04:45.001
Oh munch, I said munch.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.499
Toward the end of the month

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.124
and I hope you guys enjoy this.

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:50.005
Talk to you next time.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.016
Chow.
