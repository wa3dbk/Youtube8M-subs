00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.429
I'm Courtney Matlick with Stahls' CAD-CUT®
Direct.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.230
With fall sports season just around the corner
many apparel decorators are busy decorating

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.250
team uniforms.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.320
Although it's already a bury time of year,it's
a great time to maximize your sales by offering

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.070
customized fan apparel to go with those team
uniforms.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.710
For every person who's on the field this season,
there will be at least five people in the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.190
stands cheering them and the team on.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.440
And each one of them from parents to siblings
to neighbors classmates and friends each one

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.800
of them represents an opportunity for decoration.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.420
With CAD-CUT® material and a variety of special
effects available, it's easy to create custom

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.969
garments that are also fashion forward.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.780
Let's take a look at some of the sales opportunities
this fall off the field.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.699
Decorating fan apparel creates opportunities
for a variety of fan markets.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.879
I'll start by decorating a woman's v-cut sweatshirt
with CAD-CUT® Glitter Flake for a fellow

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.159
student cheering on the team.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.720
When selecting a blank for you design, it's
important to choose a garment that will flatter

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.890
your customer like this fitted sweatshirt.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.281
The CAD-CUT® Glitter Flake on the garment
is a hot seller among young females, cheer

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.860
teams and dance squads.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:30.360
And it's sure to get your garment noticed.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:47.090
(MUSIC)
What good is a sweatshirt without a matching

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.399
pair of sweatpants to bring the look together?

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.049
Customizing full outfits sets is easy with
CAD-CUT® materials.

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.410
Mix and match Glitter Flake colors and designs
to create a full outfit package to sell to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.920
your customers.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.160
Pair together a sweatshirt, pants and t-shirt
and sell the package at a discount to make

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:20.640
the most off of every sale.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:38.209
(MUSIC)
Bling is big make your designs really standout

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.610
by offering your customers CAD-CUT® Glitter
Flake on a complimenting bling t-shirt like

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.260
this sparkle tee from Pennant Sportswear.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.150
For each of these designs I've used a piece
of clip art from the Stahls' CutUPS template

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.959
package and personalized for the customer.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.911
Sell more this fall by offering to personalize
the garment with the customer's sport, player

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:15.099
name or number.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:34.500
(MUSIC)
There's no bigger fan then Mom and she presents

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.180
an opportunity for customization as well.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.319
Polyester fan jerseys are a great way to offer
fan apparel that compliments the look on the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.640
field.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.760
Rather then stock multiple materials in your
shop, you can us Glitter Flake on these jerseys

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.909
as well to jazz up the sporty look.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:04:06.200

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.910
or personalize the back with a players name
and number and charge an extra $10.00.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:38.530
(MUSIC)
Our 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.470
final fan apparel item is for a male student
friend or dad cheering on the team.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.440
When choosing a garment to decorate for fall
sports it's good to pick a garment that fits

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.740
the fall climate in your area.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.840
For this reason we've chosen to personalize
a performance sweatshirt with FashionFILM

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.110
Electric.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.270

unique finish that's sure to appeal to all

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.270
markets.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.490
For only pennies more then a regular heat
transfer material you can offer a foil look

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.940
that won't crack or peel when laundered.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:35.780

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.569
add on sales is unlimited.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.949
If you're currently decorating for local teams
this is a great way to add to your current

sales by offering these items to fans, parents
and students to show there local support.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.970

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.970
the door.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.820
