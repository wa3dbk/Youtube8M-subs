Hi, I'm Jennie from JustPoppin.com and
today we are going to be popping

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.210
Popping Sorghum using the oil in a pot
method.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.200
I don't know if you've ever seen sorghum
before, it's these cute little grains and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.630
they pop tiny, crunchy and delicious.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.850
We have the stove on medium. I've added 2
teaspoons of olive oil already.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.170
We're just waiting for it to get shimmery.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.410
And incidentally 2 teaspoons of olive oil is
80 calories. So it's a very healthy snack.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.640
The oil is shimmery and ready to go. I'm
going to add the sorghum grains and just

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.890
get my pot glove on here. Give a little
shake.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.880
I've got my splatter screen ready here.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.640
Because it really doesn't pop very high so
we're actually able to do this without a lid

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.460
on the pot. But a splatter screen is always
a good idea. Mostly just to avoid burns

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.730
from the oil.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.890
Which is why I have my glove on my
stirring hand.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.530
And as soon as it starts popping we're
going to turn that stove down to about 4

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.540
so...

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.920
And...One little pop. There we go. OK so
it's just about 4. You can hear it get going

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.610
now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.700
It actually doesn't take too long. Woo!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.350
We're actually using the pot from our
stovetop popcorn popper. But since a lot

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.810
of folks don't have those we thought it
might be nice to show you how to pop

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.800
without a popper. And as you can see, it
doesn't take much.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.660
Just make sure the sides of your pot are
high enough.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.600
Otherwise you'll have a big ol' mess to
clean up.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.730
Smells delicious. The smell is so good
yeah, it's making my mouth water.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.340
Why don't you toss in that eh, we have  a
quarter teaspoon of Flavacol popcorn

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.610
salt. And we use less in this than we do
with actual popcorn. About half as much. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.180
Could also add grated Parmasan cheese.
Plain popcorn salt. Some sea salt.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.530
Mmmm. Drizzle it with chocolate when
you're done. Now you're talkin'.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.280
Some herbs. Grated cheddar cheese
even.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.060
You won't get 100% of the grains to pop.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.310
But you'll get most of them popped so
just keep an eye on it.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.700
You don't want to burn what's already
popped.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.470
Ok, we're looking good.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.000
Let's tip it out here.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.220
And it will be HOT.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.640
Shake it out on your plate or in your bowl.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.370
It stays hot surprisingly long.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.410
So let's just, so I don't burn myself, give it
a little stir here.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.340
And these unpopped ones are completely
edible.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:43.470
Mmm. Ahh. So good. Unlike old maids in
popcorn, they're crunchy and so good.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.810
Just remember to chew carefully.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.320
Mmm.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.080
Thanks for watching. And happy poppin!
