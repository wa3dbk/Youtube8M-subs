00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.260
The story is a little too long, Tchê

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.000
I had seen on television, some guys surfing

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.760
This one, this one. That was called Tow in.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.200
And there in Town in that this experience was born

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.000
When you have a good horse, and must be a Criollo horse, because it's low height and fast.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.400
and with the robe in the horses back we came surfing, okay!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720
Whenever there's a flood, he called

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.360
And would say: "Tchê, wouldn't believe! Today was classic in the brook".

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.200
This other day, we went to Montenegro,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.700
There was Ramon, who's a great friend of the ranch

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.180
Our friend Pipo, who was taking pictures, got all wet, was trying and was beautiful too

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.560
I'm not a man that runs away from a challenge myself,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.120
I observed, to see how to do, rough way

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.900
But chê... it's pretty hard, I have to tell you

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.020
You can pull out a whole world of maneuvers, you can do the turn around the paw as we call it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.760
In the end, what everybody wants, is to have fun, to laugh

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.380
Well, My name is Lucas Zurrilho

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.100
and I practice the Criollo Surfing.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
My name is Eduardo Taura Cura

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.540
And I practice the Criollo surf

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.200
I also drink mate.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.980
My parents always wanted me to be a champion of the golden brake, right?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.540
I wanted to win the golden brake too, but my biggest dream ever

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.520
But my biggest dream was to win an award at that surf film festival...

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.420
Which is Mimpi, right? Is that the name?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.100
Mimpi Film Festival... big deal.
