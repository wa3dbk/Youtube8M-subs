Hi guys! Welcome to new minecraft snapshot 12w07a!

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.170
Today, we are going to show you new things in here.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.260
Choppa is here with me

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.240
Hi!

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.120
And CzechIdiot guards small villagers.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.280
We will see them in the second.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.240
So, what is new here?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.160
There is this interesting glowstone, which is not glowstones.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.280
Can you turn it on please? "Oh, yeah, yeah, i just have to find the controll room"

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.200
That, what i would like to say is that the lamps are bit bugging in multiplayer.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:42.140
As you can see, they are glowing, but i would have to log out to see it.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.100
Okey, so how do you craft it?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.110
*Show it* So, we put redstone around the glowstone and than we have this lamp.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.050
How does it work? It works simply, you can put it here

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.190
It is going to glow, as glowstone, so it is ok.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.070
But as i said, in multiplayer, there are some bugs.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.290
As you can see now, it is working!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.100
What can we show next?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.220
Height, which is now double high. Maximal high where you can build is...

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.230
...256 blocks

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.250
We have builded a little tower to show you.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.150
CzechIdiot built it.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.190
It is a astronomical tower

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.260
Well, something like that :-D.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.020
It takes a bit of time to get up

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.090
You donÂ´t have to fly on the top of the tower... 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.130
Okay, i will show you coordinates, here you can see the high.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.220
I will fly on the top of the tower

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.090
As you can see it is really 256 blocks!

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.190
Cool!

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.210
Hi Czech! I will jump down.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.290
Ehm, where? Where are you? "In the water"

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.240
What is next here? Small villagers!

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.070
Lets go in!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.090
As you can see, we have put redstone lamp everywhere!

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.010
Behind the wall is redstone, under the ground is redstone, redstone is everywhere...

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.150
And now, where is the small villager? Tell me Czech.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.020
Here?

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.080
Yeah, here is he!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.080
Poor villager!
