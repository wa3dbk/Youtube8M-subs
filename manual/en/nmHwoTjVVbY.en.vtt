00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.510
All rolling element bearings have internal
clearances.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.180
Bearing clearance is the play that exists
between the rolling elements and the inner

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.410
and outer races of the bearing.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.480
Bearings must have internal clearances when
the machine is NOT operating because the races

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.470
will expand with the rise in temperature that
occurs when the machine is operating.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.620
Rolling element bearing clearances or "fits"
are classified from C0 to C5.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.050
C0 fits exhibit very small internal clearances
and C5 fits are much looser.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.130
Most machines in industrial manufacturing
utilize C3 fits.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:18.040
Factors that determine bearing clearances
include: the fit, the type of bearing, and

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.290
the diameter of the shaft.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.270
With a C3 fit and a 1" diameter shaft, the
clearance is between .5 thou and 1 thou.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.330
With a C3 fit and a 4" diameter shaft, the
clearance is much larger; between a thou and

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.780
2.5 thou.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.470
Because of bearing clearances, the shaft can
be displaced both radially and axially.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.119
Radial clearance is the play that exists perpendicular
to the shaft.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.180
Some bearings also have axial clearance, which
is play that exists parallel to the shaft.
