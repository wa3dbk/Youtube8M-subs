So the next painting from again Schiele is
a painting of his wife in 1980. It's, she's

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:25.529
sitting in a chair but the background also,
as spacious as it was, on the other painting,

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:37.589
what is really, how to say, touching on the
painting, that his wife died of Spanish flu

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:48.339
that year, and she was pregnant, and she died
three days after that. Because of the wide

00:00:48.339 --> 00:01:03.719
clothes it's not so recognizable that she's
pregnant, but she is. And the face of her,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:18.740
it's a bit impersonal because Schiele's style
of painting portraits, the faces were rather

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:30.359
not specific because he showed the eyes like
spots, little black spots, and so on, so it's

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.990
also about a kind of a tendency in cessation,
a kind of a contact symbolism that they want

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:50.359
to show not only a person, rather a symbol
of something, a woman, the manhood, and so

00:01:50.359 --> 00:02:00.369
on. And that's why I think that the painting's
made like this, where had he this message

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.130
rather not to make a portrait of his wife.
