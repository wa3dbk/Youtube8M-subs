00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.139
Ice Core Records: From Volcanoes to Supernovas

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:19.560
Narrator (April Hobart, CXC)
To study space, scientists usually use telescopes

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.500
in high and dry places atop mountains.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.900
Or they gather their data remotely from observatories
far away in space.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.580
There are other ways, however, to learn about
the cosmos.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.620
Researchers have been traveling for decades
to some of the coldest places on the planet

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.140
– Antarctica and Greenland – to uncover
some of the secrets from space that have been

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.900
left behind on Earth.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.540
Dr. Gisela Dreschoff is one of those scientists.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.109
Since the 1970s, Dr. Dreschoff, a professor
at University of Kansas, has been traveling

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:59.660
to these harsh and remote locations to conduct
her science.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.210
Dr. Dreschoff:
I've been going to Antarctica (South Pole).

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.510
I probably spent a total of two years at the
South Pole, but each season only a little

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.100
bit, so 13 times in Antarctica.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.110
I’ve been at Vostok Station and several
seasons in the Arctic.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.409
Narrator:
Dr. Dreschoff originally went to Antarctica

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.110
to study gamma ray radiation coming from space.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.840
Dr. Dreschoff:
I was actually doing, with my colleague Zeller,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.770
a remote sensing project, and determining
the radiation background of Antarctica using

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.060
a gamma ray spectrometer and helicopters and
C130s and so on.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.369
And so we did that for several years, and
so as background, as we were flying over ice,

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.939
there’s nothing coming from below in terms
of radiation, and so all we were measuring

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.719
was radiation coming from space.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.899
Narrator:
Soon, Dr. Dreschoff began looking at ice cores,

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.759
cut from hundreds or even thousands of feet
below the frozen surface, for other clues

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.310
about the cosmos.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.160
Scientists study ice cores to track phenomena
that happened in the Earth’s past including

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.410
climate variability, forest fires, and volcanic
activity.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.780
Dr. Dreschoff, however, was interested in
effects from the Sun.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.290
She began looking for so-called solar proton
events, where there is an outburst from the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.290
Sun.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.420
Dr. Dreschoff:
The charged particles coming from the sun,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.519
we figured, should produce ionization of the
atmosphere.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:56.000
And so especially what I was interested in
was individual solar proton events.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.890
General solar activity had been suggested
from auroral activity once before, but I wanted

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.870
to see if it was possible to see individual
solar proton events, because then that would

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.510
mean, if we could see those, it would mean
the signal was real, that you know, it could

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.160
only have come from the sun.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.409
Narrator:
Charged particles from solar activity follow

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:26.460
the Earth’s magnetic field lines and enter
the atmosphere above the polar regions.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.280
The particles ionize nitrogen and oxygen,
generating oxides of nitrogen called nitrates

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.770
as the end product.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.549
Dr. Dreschoff:
We figured that any particles, energetic particles,

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:51.420
charged particles, coming into the polar atmosphere
should generate ionization, ionization of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.420
nitrogen and oxygen.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:00.129
When that is ionized, it easily forms chemical
bonds, oxides of nitrogen, and the ultimate

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.930
oxidation product is NO3.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.580
Narrator:
Dr. Dreschhoff explains why the polar regions

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.110
are the best place on Earth to look for this
type of signature from space.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.181
Dr. Dreschoff:
Polar stratosphere, it gets so cold during

00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:23.820
the winter, it freezes out, and when it freezes
out, it comes down to the surface as gravitational

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.599
sedimentation, so it comes out quite fast,
fast compared to any diffusive processes.

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:40.630
So that means if there are gigantic, and there
are, gigantic eruptions on the sun called

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.750
solar proton events, when these protons enter
the polar atmosphere they come spiraling down

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.380
the open magnetic field lines in the polar
regions, so they easily make it into the deeper

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.380
atmosphere.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.649
Narrator:
However, Dr. Dreschhoff began to wonder if

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.980
signals from even farther away in space could
be detected in the ice cores.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.290
She started to look for traces of historic
supernova explosions, including those tied

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.159
to famous supernova remnants observed by Chandra
and other telescopes today.

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.580
Dr. Dreschoff:
Looking at the two Antarctic cores, and looking

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:26.920
at the signal, and comparing these two cores,
we found that there are particular impulsive

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.080
events, nitrate events, which within our dating
error, (which means for South Pole about ten

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:42.450
years of dating error and for Vostok thirty
years of dating error), within these error

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.110
bars, these peaks corresponded.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:51.410
We compared 1200 years, because South Pole
is only 1200 years, so 1200 years at the South

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:02.210
Pole with 1200 years at Vostok Station, and
there we found a peak near 1006, 1054 (Crab

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:14.750
Nebula), 1320 and 1572 and 1604, which would
be Kepler and before that Tycho and so on.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.080
Narrator:
It is very important for astronomers to know

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.550
precisely when these supernovas exploded.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.160
While there are some historic accounts by
people who may have witnessed these stars

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.370
exploding hundreds of years ago, having another
line of evidence would be very exciting.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.370
Still, Dr. Dreschhoff cautions that her data
are not conclusive, and like most scientists,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.380
she needs more data.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.210
Dr. Dreschoff:
I certainly cannot say 100%.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.260
Nobody can.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.260
Okay?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.599
First of all, as I said, here we are with
a number of impulsive nitrate events, and

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:53.780
embedded in that, let’s say, are supernova
signals.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.430
Now, if I have just one core, well, it can
be pretty good if my data are very good.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:07.030
If I have two cores, or three, then it becomes
pretty good, you know it’s getting better

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.430
and better, but you can never be absolutely
certain.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.430
Never.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.130
Narrator:
So here we have two seemingly separate fields

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:21.390
of science – geology and astrophysics – coming
together to try to solve some very intriguing

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.020
questions.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.190
In our next episode, we’ll learn more about
Dr. Dreschoff’s research and the controversy

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:55.430
surrounding perhaps the most famous supernova
explosion of all time: Cassiopeia A.
