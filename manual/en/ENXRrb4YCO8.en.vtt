00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.699
With RealFlight Expansion Pack 6, the opportunities
for adventure are ready and waiting. All you

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.939
have to do is pick the one you want. You can
discover how it must have felt to fly the

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:18.300
world’s first jet fighter. Float among the
clouds high above the earth in a steam-powered

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.340
aerostat. Take a tiny, seven-and-a-half inch
span electric for a slow-speed spin indoors

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.960
or push a Navy seaplane past Mach One after
a wave top takeoff. There are 14 more aircraft

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.120
in store and three new flying sites to explore
in RealFlight Expansion Pack 6. You can find

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.989
wide-open sites like Silverton Prairie all
across the U.S. and airfields like the Jefferson

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.289
Airstrip all over the world. But the only
place you’ll find this 3D Water Park and

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.519
Obstacle Course is Expansion Pack 6. You can
watch the patterns of the living water fountain,

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.549
or test your skills against the challenging
obstacle course during the day or by the neon

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:09.170
lights of your own aircraft. Whether that’s
the RJX Hobby extreme ninety or the Matt Chapman

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.380
Eagle 580 from Great Planes! Eighteen aircraft
and three new sites make Expansion Pack 6

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.600
more fun. But there are also two incredible
bonuses that make it the most value-packed

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.510
Expansion Pack ever. Bonus number one is a
free upgrade to RealFlight G4.5 for modelers

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.700
who currently own RealFlight G4. It includes
every G4.5 feature, including RealRendering™,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.679
the Depth of Field Effect and all aircraft
and flying site choices. And that’s still

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.689
not all, because bonus number two gives you
every aircraft and flying site choice from

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.950
Add-Ons one through five. Just think of it:
The newest Expansion Pack, eighteen new aircraft,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.280
three new flying sites, a free upgrade to
G4.5 and every aircraft and flying site choice

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.340
from Add-Ons one through five all on a single
disk! It’s an outstanding addition for RealFlight:

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.740
“The most realistic recreation of R/C flight
ever.”
