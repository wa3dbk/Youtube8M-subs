00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.459
Hello, again, everyone!

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.259
I want to talk to you today about something
that has really changed my skin recently,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.990
specifically the skin underneath my eyes which,
for me, has been a real problem, especially

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.460
over the past year.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.550
As I've mentioned before, my skin has just
been getting really, really dry and one of

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.819
the areas that just has not responded to any
treatment has been my under-eye area and that's

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.420
a problem because, as you know, if you have
dry skin around your eyes, then your concealer's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.259
going to stick to it and it's really, really
unpleasant to look at.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.949
It's also uncomfortable.

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.760
You know, this goes back to my whole "I'm
not using powder" thing.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.960
Part of the reason is because the skin gets
so dry that any amount of powder just turns

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.440
it into alligator scales.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.239
So, it's... it's a problem.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:56.120
So, I got a sample of the Josie Maran argan
oil in a MyGlam Bag, I think in January, so,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.350
just last month and I started using this under
my eyes and it made such an amazing difference

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.689
within even just a week.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.450
It made such a difference -- I can't even
believe, honestly, because I've used a lot

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.049
of different products under my eyes.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.490
I've used Aquaphor every night, I've used
different skin care oils and nothing has made

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.870
as big of a difference for me as this has.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.329
These little guys retail, I think, for $14
and if you're just using it as an eye treatment,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.979
it'll last quite a while.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.980
They recommend that you use it for your cuticles,
your hair, your body, whatever.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.719
I'm personally not inclined to go buy an expensive
skin care oil for something like cuticles

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.500
because a cheaper one like grape seed oil
will do just fine.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.840
I'm sure this is wonderful for cuticles, but
I'm not going to ... it's expensive stuff.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.480
So, all I do is wash my face.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.700
I do my toner and my toner's for dry skin,
so I bring it up under my eyes and then I

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.359
use one drop on my fingers and then just dot
that--I get it right up in here because I

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.679
get little, tiny, crepey creases up in here
and I wanted to really moisturize that area

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.990
and get it to relax a bit.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.990
And it has.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.190
It's made a very visible difference, I think.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.910
I tried to get some before and after pictures
for you guys, but my skin is so shiny and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.220
so translucent, it's really hard to photograph
that close.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.950
You just end up seeing all my blood vessels
and stuff, so I'm going to spare you.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.501
But, you can take my word for it.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:31.170
If you have dry skin under your eyes and if
you've been struggling, trying to find something

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.190
that will keep it from looking flakey under
your concealer, I would definitely recommend

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.940
picking this up.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.080
Like I said these are $14 and it's not the
Josie Maran brand necessarily that you need

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420
to get.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.920
I've never used a different type of argan
oil, but it's not like this is the only brand

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920
of it.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.710
You can find ingredient suppliers who sell
skin care oils and buy argan oil that way

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.240
and I'm sure it's a lot cheaper.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.010
Or you can just go to Sephora and buy one
of these guys.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.710
Either way.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.730
And also, I don't want to say that there's
no other skin care oil that can do what argan

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.720
oil is doing -- for me, at least.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.540
There are a lot of different skin care oils.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.200
They all work very well for different things
and for different people.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.140
I've used grapeseed oil under my eyes, which
is a nice oil, and I really, really like it,

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.490
but it wasn't doing what argan oil was doing
for me.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.650
That's not to say that there's another oil
that wouldn't do the same thing that argan

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.890
oil's doing for me, but over the past month,
I've been using the argan oil and it's been

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.780
making a huge difference, so that's why I'm
recommending this specific oil.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.880
But, if you don't want to purchase the argan
oil, if it's not available near you, you can

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.890
try a different kind of skin care oil.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.890
I would be careful.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.800
I'm going to talk about comedogenic oils in
another video -- comedogenic meaning the types

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.250
of oils that are pore-clogging -- but in this
video, I'm just going to say that for really

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.410
dry under-eye skin, using a skin care oil
and, in this case, argan oil, has made a huge

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.410
difference for me.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.560
Thank you, guys, very much for watching.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.240
If you have any questions, let me know, and
if you like the video, please give me a thumbs

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.480
up -- it would very much help me out -- and
have a wonderful day.
