00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.500
It doesn't matter whether you have a home bar with a
kegerator,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.799
or professional bar with many taps.

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:12.859
One of the most crucial things you could do to maintain
the best possible quality in your beer is

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.979
clear those beer lines and beer faucets regularly.

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:17.359
Without regular cleaning,

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.279
yeast can build up and form particles in the
lines and pretty soon you've got little nasties

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.159
floating around in your beer, and you don't want that.

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.550
You should be cleaning out your beer lines about every half keg.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.699
That's about the best optimum time to do it, 
to make sure you have the best optimal quality beers.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.900
Doing so can be extremely easy if you get a beer line cleaning 
kit from KegWorks.com

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.650
Let's take a look.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.440
Cleaning out your beer lines might sound rather intimidating,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.740
but this is all it takes.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.100
You start off with this quart bottle with 
a pump assembly,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.900
specialized spanner wrench,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.700
a faucet brush,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.910
and some cleaning solution and that's it.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.200
So let's go ahead and clear our beer lines out.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.850
The first and most important thing to do

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.750
is to make sure that we have the CO2 turned
completely off.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.640
Now we turn the regulator off.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.210
Next you'll have to take apart your system by unscrewing
your faucet with a spanner wrench

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.050
and unscrewing the coupler from the beer line to clean 
inside the pieces and parts that pour your beer.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.610
And to clean

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.490
the faucet out

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.900
we're going to use this bowl of warm water.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.140
To this we're going to add a cap full of cleaning solution
that comes with the kit.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.010
I'm going to put some of the cleaning solution in this quart 
jar here as well.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.960
Then take apart the faucet, giving it a good scrub with your 
faucet brush, pay special attention to scrubbing the inside of 
your faucet body and the inside of the coupler probe.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.750
Getting inside those grooves is important.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.390
Connect the cleaning jar and pump

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.650
to the faucet shank coupling nut.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.100
Make sure to use the included washer between the
cleaning attachment and the faucet coupling nut.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.160
Use the spanner wrench to tighten it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.160
Then place the beer line end in the bucket and 
pump the solution through the lines.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.840
Disconnect the cleaning jar and fill it back up
with clean water,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.769
just as before pump the water through the beer line.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.609
Repeat this one more time to ensure that all
the cleaning solution has been rinsed from the lines.

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.359
After rinsing, disconnect the cleaning jar and pump

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.269
and replace the faucet assembly.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.599
Use the spanner wrench to slightly tighten the coupling nut.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.169
Next, we can take our beer line that has just been cleaned out.
Make sure you get the washer out.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.340
Put the washer back in

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.559
and attach to the beer coupler

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:43.479
and then the coupler to the keg.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:49.299
Now we're going to open up our CO2 tank all the way.

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.299
Once that's opened properly, we want to 
turn the regulator back on.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.929
Once that's done

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:04.389
put the CO2 tank back into the fridge,

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.849
and we're ready for another cold pint.
