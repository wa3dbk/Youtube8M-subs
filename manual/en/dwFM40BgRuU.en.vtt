00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.410
I told you in the previous clip, I want to
show you now, how to prep the ending piece

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.330
of the piping to fit over the beginning piece
of the piping. And, it's going to look really

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.070
nice when we get it done. But, the first thing
we need to do is, about where we ended, which

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.460
is pretty far, about two inches away from
the very end of the piping. And, I'm going

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.710
to start breaking these, opening this up.
Just snip these, use a seam ripper if you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.660
want. I just use the end, the tips of my scissors.
Just going to take this whole piece off; and,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.460
so you can almost, just open it up and see
the cord. That's good, that's what we want

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.880
to see. But, the idea, of what we want to
do, is move this cord out of the way. Just

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.330
turn this one up, just a little bit, lay this
one in. And, once we do that, we figure out

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.400
how much we want this one to be cut off. And
it's just about right there. And don't be

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.700
scared to do it, just go ahead and give it
a good snip. Cut it out, and now they're meeting

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.740
in the end. And now we just fold it over;
how it's nice and even. And now what we do

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.939
is go back in and continue sewing to the end,
on a back stitch, of course. It's my favorite

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.799
thing to do, and when you get here around
this, just treat it, just like it's just like

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:36.280
the rest of the piping. Just keep on, there
we go. OK, and now that we have this on there,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.789
all we'd have to do is go in and sew the top
layer. And, I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.340
lay it on top, and sew it on top for you.
This is actually really easy and we'll have

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.950
this whole thing done. Remember not to stretch
any of your fabric out, or you'll cause wrinkles.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:03.659
And back stitch there, now let's turn this
over and see what it looks like. That just

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.979
looks really, really nice. You can barely
see where the seam starts and ends. And this

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.721
might be easier for you, than the criss-cross
method, or the other one might be easier,

00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:15.410
but I think this one looks nicer.
