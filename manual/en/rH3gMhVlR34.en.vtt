Hi, my name is Lauren and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm here to discuss short, curly

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.950
locks with you. Since Heather does have a
lot of layers in her hair and there are a

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.750
lot of shorter pieces, plus her length is
a little bit shorter than most people who

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.180
get updos, what you're going to do, it's feasible
actually for you to do this on your own and

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.680
get the desired look that you want but you
have to be conscious of the fact that you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.439
do not have the length of hair in order to
fill in gaps. A good way of doing this is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.729
getting rid of those shorter layers where
you have the longer layers and that your overall

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:40.019
length hanging. You're going to put your tail
comb in the middle of your head, right back

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.449
here, and you're going to do that zig zag
parting. Once you get to the nape of the neck,

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:53.100
simply lower the tail comb and pull your hair
to the side. What that will create is a bit

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.819
of a zig zag pattern that will kind of help
when you have your partings that you won't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:04.059
have any spots and you won't have any holes
within the up do. Since she does again have

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.990
shorter hair, I'm going to separate again
that section into two other sections, two

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.460
smaller sections, and I'm going to use our
small rubber bands which are better for smaller

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.539
diameters. The small rubber bands can come
in clear which I recommend because it blends

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.719
in and not that hard to cover. They come in
black and they also come in brown. You can

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.789
pretty much buy them at any CVS, Walgreens,
beauty supply store, they do sell them and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.090
they're rather cheap and easy to use. You
put them in, take that part away so that way

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.619
it's not in your way and then you're going
to lift the remaining sections. Because of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.069
the way her hairline is and the length, most
short hair updos are going to wind up having

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.750
a bit of a little tendrils coming down. If
your hair is not going to go up because of

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.649
your length, work that into your style and
allow some of those pieces to fall down so

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:10.810
again, you're going to grab your smaller rubber
band, and we'll put a black one in so you

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.599
can see the difference of how they stand out
especially on lighter hair. So you can see

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.599
the difference already, how you don't necessarily
really see the clear one and how the black

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.989
one stands out a little bit. If you do not
have a rubber band that matches your skin

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.680
or your hair, then you're going to have to
really work at hiding that rubber band once

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.040
your updo is done. The beauty of updos and
getting your hair professionally done which

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.650
now you should, after this be able to do at
home, is that you do not see all of those

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.170
bobbie pins and all of those rubber bands
which are the foundation of your updo.
