00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.819
How to Handle It If Your Parents Buy You Dorky
Clothes.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.600
When it comes to clothes, are your parents
still trying to dress you like a fifth grader?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.660
Then you need to take charge.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:24.240
You will need A take-charge attitude Creativity
Maturity and ingenuity or money.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240
Step 1.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.320
Check the store’s return policy.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.109
Some places will issue store credit without
a receipt if the tags are still intact and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.890
the clothes appear undamaged.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.050
So control the impulse to damage the clothes.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.410
Consider trying to sell them on eBay—your
trash may be someone else’s (pitiful) treasure.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.530
Step 2.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.090
If returning the clothes is out of the question,
try donating them to charity.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.350
Explain to your parents that you “have so
much, while others have so little.”

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.350
Step 3.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.350
Make some alterations.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.490
With a bit of ingenuity and access to a sewing
machine (or at least scissors), it’s possible

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.000
to transform something ugly into something
pretty—or, at the very least, something

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.430
non-offensive.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.729
Unless you’re pretty good at garment alteration,
spend a little money to have them professionally

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.990
altered.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.800
Ill-fitting pleated trousers may be bad, but
ill-fitting pleated shorts are worse.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.930
Step 4.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.380
Accidentally ruin the clothes by reading the
laundering instructions and then doing exactly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380
the opposite.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.579
If it says “dry-clean only,” toss it in
the washing machine with a pair of jeans on

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:27.579
“heavy load.”

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.960
Feign disappointment.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.960
Step 5.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.290
Of course, you could always try being honest.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.210
Explain to your parents the importance of
not resembling a vision-impaired septuagenarian.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.549
Refrain from bratty outbursts like, “Just
because _you’ve_ given up on looking good,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.539
doesn’t mean I have to!”

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.110
Remember, the goal is to convince your parents
to stop treating you like a small child.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.350
Step 6.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.400
Your final option?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.979
Work it!

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.340
Make do with what you’ve got.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.080
Do you think that history’s greatest tastemakers
shopped at the mall?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.979
Did you know Some stores use special computer
programs to prevent “serial returners”

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.330
from abusing the return system.
