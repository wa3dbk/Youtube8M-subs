00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.500
There are basically three types of sections
that we can use when foiling the hair. The

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.740
first type of section is what a lot of people
do today, which is a horizontal section that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.609
pretty much runs horizontal on the sides of
the head, coming up through the back and then

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.519
continuing onto the front of the hair. Interesting
thing about this section is because it is

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.411
widely used, typically, we'll get ribbons
or these streaks in the hair, when the hair

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:37.250
is pulled back. Because the hair is done on
a horizontal, or foiled on a horizontal, we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.260
get sheets of color and so this will actually
gives us the illusion of having more weight

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.300
around the perimeter of the head form. The
next type of foil that we could place is what

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.800
we would call a vertical section and this
section actually runs parallel to the wall,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.070
if you will. We basically take a straight
line coming from the top of the head to the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.040
bottom of the head or somewhere in between
that. Basically, it's a foil that runs not

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.960
horizontal, like we had before, but runs up
and down. This type of foil section would

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.310
actually give us more of a ribbon type of
a section where the hair falls down and we'd

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.310
get some ribbon types of effect but that gives
us the illusion of having elongation in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.799
hair. So, vertical types of foils definitely
give us more look for a longer type of hair

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.880
to create more ribbon effect. The next type
of foiling section that we could use is a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.830
diagonal section. The diagonal section is
one of the best to use when foiling because

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.400
we're working on a round surface versus working
on a square surface. Because the head is round,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.320
the diagonal gives us color that would actually
start here and then just gradually fall so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.520
it gives us the illusion of having more movement
in the hair. For haircuts that have a lot

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.090
of layers in them are those short choppy type
of haircuts that like to be tousled or run

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.040
towards the face, this is a great type of
foiling section to use. Again, you can see

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.760
that we have hair that basically goes from
a short to long type of standpoint and really

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.290
works with the round of the head so it's great
to use for those clients that have a lot of

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.200
layers in their hair that way you don't get
color that ends abruptly when we use a horizontal

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.700
or even a vertical sectioning in short layered
type of hair.
