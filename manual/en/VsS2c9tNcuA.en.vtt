00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.400
Alright here's a new board. 
Check this one out. 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.890
A Biostar X58. They're calling this 
the T-Power. And, I'll admit it, 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.680
you know, I haven't been 
the biggest Biostar fan all my life,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.690
this is an awesome board.
It's very, very cool.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.760
It's got an extremely clean layout.
It's got a lot of cool overclocking features.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.730
It's got 12 phase power,
  it's got SLI and CrossFire.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.130
It's got very capable cooling.
It's got the little on/off buttons,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.530
and the little LED screens,
and lots of SATA ports.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.670
It's actually really cool.
And it actually holds a couple

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.800
world records, if you look over here.
I don't know if this is current,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.050
but, 920 right there ,they got it
to 4,662 MHz, 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.750
and they got a 940 up to 48 MHz.
That's a 64% overclock.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.020
So that's pretty impressive. 
I'm not sure if this is up to date.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.320
I think they might 
have beaten that by now.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.690
But, it just goes to show you that at 
one point in time, they were in contention

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.390
for world overclocking records.
 And this board does overclock like crazy.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.160
So, it's very nice. The test one that I had, 
that I destroyed and I took apart,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.400
did very well. It actually 
overclocked very high.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.040
The... host frequency went through 
the roof, it was above 200.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.700
So, it performed very, very well.
Now, let me do my basic rundown 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.850
that I always do 
with all my boards here.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.860
Alright, first of all, socket, LG 1366
Core i7s, 920s, 940s, 965s,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.930
and anything that's 4.8
or 6.4 giga transfers per second.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.920
6 DIMMs, right over here.
Good job zooming out quickly.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070
You're getting better at that
 camera work Producer Dan.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.210
Good job. Yes. Alright, 
1333 is your maximum speed.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.610
You can do 1600 with overclocking,
or you can do 1866 with overclocking,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670
and it has two phase power for 
your memory, which is awesome.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.450
X58 northbridge is
 right down here.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.210
And this is very capable,
all copper cooling.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.930
It is all connected, 
which is nice.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.110
And this is more than enough to
 cool the northbridge of the X58, 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.860
which runs very cool because
 it lacks a memory controller.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.020
Now, what I was going to tell 
you about the cooling on this thing...

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.220
That's about it.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.120
Let's talk about phases of power.
1-2-3-4-5-6.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.830
1-2-3-4-5-6.
That's 12 phases of power.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.190
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
 that is a lot of overclocking potential.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.170
You're gonna get very clean power,
very stable power,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.570
and that makes sure that your 
overclock can run stabile-y,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.440
it's not going to crash on you. The 
ICH10R, which is all the way down here.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.680
No, no, no, right. Right.
There ya go.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.920
That's it right there. 
Is very awesome, as well.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.660
It's a die shrunk ICH9R. It gives 
you six SATA ports on the side.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.700
And it does do RAID 0, RAID 1,
RAID 0+1, RAID 5. 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.840
All through there.
Now additionally, you are 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.500
going to notice that obviously this board 
has three PCI Express X16 slots.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.170
Orange, orange, and white.
If you populate all three,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.870
you're going to get X16, X16, X4.
Instead of X8 like some of the other boards.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.070
So, it might not be the best 
for a triple SLI monster. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.810
But you know what, nowadays,
the GTX295 is king of the hill.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690
And you're only going to put two of 
those and they're gonna go right here.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.280
And they're gonna run on X16.
Besides that, you do have 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.760
a PCI Express X1, right there.
And two green PCI 2.2s which are 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.790
a cool color that I like.
Now, moving down here,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.860
in this little corner, right, 
there ya go. Power, reset.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.650
You got some USB headers and 
Firewire headers down there.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.640
So, that's four USB ports 
on these two headers.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
Your Firewire. You have
 your floppy disk drive.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.210
Yes, I don't know why
 that's there anymore.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.450
But they still use them. And, right back 
over here, your little LED to tell you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.850
your postcodes and any other information
that might be relevant during your boot up,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.760
your initial boot up sequence.
Now, if you move all the way up here,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.660
you see that up here?
Over there? You still got an IDE.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.030
So, just so you know, in case you're 
a dinosaur, or you're just the most 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.170
awkward person on the planet 
and you're buying this like, 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.600
super hi-tech awesome motherboard, 
to use like, your 20 MB per second

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.860
IDE drive from the, 
you know, late '90s.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.440
It is there for you. Let's talk about, a little 
bit about the back panel connectors now.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.840
Starting off from the top, 
you are going to see 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.210
that you have two very nice 
USB 2.0s right there.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.040
Another two very nice 
USB 2.0s right there.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.520
You have your Firewire and this 
little thing that I forget the name,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.850
and, who cares, PS2, whatever.
You got a couple eSATAs right there,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.460
that are pretty awesome. Analog
 and digital audio, which is actually, 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.830
kinda useful sometimes. You never 
know when you're gonna need that.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.430
And I actually like this feature. 
I like to have both. 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.830
I think it's a sign of a quality 
motherboard. You get the S/PDIF 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.640
that's optical and digital,
and the analog and col-actual.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.670
Moving down, you have another 
two USBs, another two USBs.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.650
That's eight, in total, on the back. Plus the 
four there, that's 12 on the board, overall.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.410
And Dual Gigabit LAN,
7.1 channel HD Audio,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.750
that's all really awesome.
And, in case you were wondering,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.890
right up here, eight pin for your 
12 volt. Right there. Okay? Very nice.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.420
Alright, let's move on. I'm gonna show 
you this little pouch that comes with it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.500
and all the stuff 
that they give you. 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.310
So, normally I, I don't always show 
you what's in the motherboard,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.870
or what comes with it.
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.000
This time I do because they gave me a 
pouch, and this made my day interesting,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.840
because they never give you a pouch,
 and I'm very happy about this.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.410
So, ooh, there's some interesting stuff in here.
Alright, let's see what we've got.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.290
Biostar Velcro-y thing. I like that.
With the molex to SATA connectors.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.850
You get three of those and they convert 
pretty much, two molexes to two SATAs,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.150
which is great. Alright, next.
Instruction manual.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.120
Whoa. And drivers and utilities CD,
 as well. That's pretty cool.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.910
And input/output shield, very plain.
Made somewhere in Asia.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:43.440
You also get a piece of steal 
that has been bent.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.550
And, what this does is that... 
is that ah... you ah...

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:00.320
Yeah, okay you also get a IDE cable, 
and you get a two-way SLI bridge.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.040
Very nice. And you get orange 
SATA cables. Those are hard right there.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.210
Check that out.
That is very awesome.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.300
And then you get to 
keep the bag for the future.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.590
You can put whatever 
you want in here.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.780
So, Biostar X58.
Here are the good things:

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.670
It's more affordable 
than the rest of them.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.850
It's only got two PCI Express X16s.
It will run on X16 if they are fully populated,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.420
If you're gonna run GTECH's 295s,
and you're just crazy anyway,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.650
you don't need 
that third one.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.690
You can put a bunch of other stuff, 
including a RAID card in there, maybe?

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.700
So it runs at X8, or X4.
It's still plenty for a RAID card.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.730
So, it's affordable, 
it cools well,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.170
it does SLI and Crossfire, the memory 
goes all the way up to 1,866 with overclocking.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.200
It's got all the great SATA features, but a lot of
times you don't need the extra controller

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.610
for eSATA and all this other stuff.
So, it's just got the basics.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.210
It does have power on 
and power off buttons.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.710
And it does have an LED poster, 
or whatever you want to call them.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.780
It does support 24 gigs of memory.
And it's at a great price, one more time.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.870
So, very awesome.
The X58 T-Power by Biostar.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.930
Good job Biostar, I give you much props.
