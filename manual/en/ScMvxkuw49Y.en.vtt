Hi, this is Jessica Rose and I’m speaking
on behalf of Expert Village and I’m giving

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.260
you some tips on how to dress and look Gothic.
Next tip I’m going to give you is don’t

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.360
be afraid to accessorize and what that means
is you can go ahead and try to find some Gothic

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.450
gloves or purses or sunglasses, things to
add to your look. I’m going to give you

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.840
some examples of that. First of all we have
sunglasses, get, invest in a pair of big black

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.700
sunglasses to go with your look. Next we have,
I recommend that you get some gloves and these

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.980
are a perfect example of some Gothic gloves
to add to your look. I’ve got some black

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:48.130
velvety long elbow high gloves, these go with
a lot of your outfits. Another example of

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:57.649
some gloves that you could add to your outfit
are a shorter version, of some fishnet gloves,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.890
some black fishnets, that’s how it looks.
Another accessory that you can add is a variety

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.750
of different purses, purse choices, here we
have a Gothic looking wallet and you see it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.930
has a silver chain with a buckle to attach
and what makes it really cute and an extra

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.070
decoration is the silver Gothicy looking cross
to it. Okay, next we have a couple of purses

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.990
you could add to your look, this one looks
great with your Gothic outfits, very cute,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.530
great colors, great materials, great concept.
And last but not least, here’s another example

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.479
of a purse that you could add to your wardrobe,
this is a great example because it’s black

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.939
but it also got a hint of color to it with
an interesting design, and some black lace

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.869
and satin, a great addition to your Gothic
wardrobe. So to recap again, do not be afraid

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.869
to accessorize, it will add an extra unique
touch to wardrobe and it, it really helps

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.090
when everything matches well together and
goes together so make sure that you can add

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.249
some Gothic style gloves, purses and sunglasses,
whatever you can think of to go along with

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.969
your look. Thank you very much.
