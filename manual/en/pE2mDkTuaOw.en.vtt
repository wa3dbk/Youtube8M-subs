Hi I'm Antoine and I'm gonna show you how to a Shell with the Snake Puzzle (Rubik's Twist)

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.180
If you have 2 Snakes you could make 2 shells

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.520
and put one on top of the other to make an Octahedron

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.580
First this dark blue one's gonna go like that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.100
Now, this light-coloured one's gonna go like that

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.560
Now this dark one's gonna go like that

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.800
so now you're gonna count 1,2,3

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.280
and then the next one, which is a light coloured one is gonna go like that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.740
now this dark blue one is gonna go up

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.520
so you're gonna turn it around

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.740
and you're gonna count 1,2,3 and then the next one is gonna go like that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.040
After this white one, this dark one is gonna go like that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.540
and now this light coloured one is gonna go like that

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.220
you're gonna count 1,2,3,4, and then the 5th one 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.400
is gonna turn like that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.040
now you're gonna turn this dark blue one

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280
so that these 2 match

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.660
like that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.680
Finally this dark one's gonna go up...

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:34.634
and then it's your shell

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.040
and then if you have another one,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.440
it can put it on top
