00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:07.740
Hi, I'm Alan Sepinwall from HitFix.com, and
these were my 10 favorite TV shows of 2013.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.400
For years, critics have referred to my tenth
place show, CBS' "The Good Wife," by the somewhat-patronizing

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.500
title "the best drama on broadcast television."

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.640
I wouldn't agree with that this year, in that
I have another broadcast show even higher

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.550
on my list, but "Good Wife" took a major leap
forward in quality in 2013, relying less on

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
its gift for guest casting and more on generating
conflict between the show's regular characters.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.930
As Alicia and Cary stealthily plotted to start
their own firm and steal clients from Will

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.800
and Diane, "The Good Wife" felt quicker, funnier,
more exciting and simply better than it had

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
before.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.210
And "Hitting the Fan," the episode where one
firm finds out about the other, was one of

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.860
the year's most satisfying hours of television,
whether you're counting broadcast, cable or

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860
Netflix.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.400
TV is so filled with both serial killer stories
and remakes that I was actively dreading the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.559
arrival of my ninth place show, NBC's "Hannibal."

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.810
Did we really need another murderous mastermind,
especially given how the movie sequels had

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.300
exhausted any interest in Hannibal Lecter?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.000
But Bryan Fuller, the imaginative creator
behind "Pushing Daisies" and "Dead Like Me,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.399
found a riveting new take on the tired material.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.539
He gave us an understated yet chilling version
of Dr. Lecter in the form of Mads Mikkelsen,

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.659
a fascinatingly tragic Will Graham in Hugh
Dancy, and a collection of murder scenes so

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.399
insanely baroque that they moved past fetishizing
the work of killers and played more as twisted

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:19.399
fantasy.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.700
The only downside to the series?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.490
Dr. Lecter's cooking looks delicious.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.970
My eighth place show, TNT's "Southland," was
the rare series to be improved by cancellation

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.840
— not once but twice.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.990
When the series moved from NBC to TNT, the
budget was lowered, a large swath of the cast

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.200
was let go, and the focus narrowed to just
a handful of cops, chief among them Michael

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.070
Cudlitz as damaged veteran patrolman John
Cooper.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.489
In this final season, Cudlitz gave the year's
single best TV performance, first acting opposite

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.979
Gerald McRaney as Cooper's suicidal ex-partner,
then in a nightmarish episode where Cooper

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.920
and his current partner were held hostage
by a pair of violent, irrational tweakers.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.749
Cudlitz's performance throughout was so intense,
so vulnerable, that "Southland" took on the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.719
feel of a documentary in his scenes.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.209
In the final episode, a depressed Cooper goes
for a suicide-by-cop; had the show been renewed,

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.090
he almost certainly would have survived, but
the low ratings means that "Southland" ended

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.250
on the perfect, if tragic, note.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.040
My seventh-place show, HBO's "Boardwalk Empire,"
had perhaps its best season yet.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.439
As always, the period gangster drama offered
beautiful compositions, meticulous plotting,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.780
gripping action and superb performances, with
Jeffrey Wright adding enormously to the cast

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.989
as the hypnotic, wildly hypocritical Dr. Valentin
Narcisse.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.519
And by making the feud between Narcisse and
Chalky White the season's centerpiece, "Boardwalk"

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.650
finally gave Michael Kenneth Williams a proper
showcase, essentially elevating him to co-lead

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.959
alongside Steve Buscemi as Nucky.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.129
Much as I love Buscemi elsewhere, the series
was better served by focusing so much on a

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.390
more charismatic figure like Chalky.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.329
Couple that with a lovely, tragic arc for
Jack Huston's Richard Harrow and a thrilling

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.189
mob war in Chicago, and you have a "Boardwalk"
season that fit together perfectly.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.590
My sixth place show, AMC's "Mad Men," is in
its twilight years, and there are times when

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.409
it feels like we're just going through the
same Don Draper character beats season after

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.409
season.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.049
But by season's end, Don was in a strange,
fascinating new place that allowed Jon Hamm

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.300
to do some of his best work of the series,
and almost every character's life had been

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.300
upended.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.659
The series remains so dense with meaning,
sadness and even humor, and features so many

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.860
fantastic performances, that it remains one
of the most satisfying, immersive viewing

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.180
experiences there is.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.480
How would I feel about leaving "Mad Men" off
my list?

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.099
To quote a very wise man, "NOT GREAT, Bob!"

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.430
The never-ending age of the criminal anti-hero
gave us a few more bastard sons of Tony Soprano

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.760
this year, including AMC's "Low Winter Sun"
and Showtime's "Ray Donovan," both of which

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.569
demonstrated how badly the TV drama business
needs to find a new template to mass produce.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.581
My fifth-place show, Showtime's "Masters of
Sex," also has a difficult character at its

00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:47.359
center in Michael Sheen as sex researcher
William Masters, but it's a much more complicated,

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.060
original and entertaining work.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.659
As Masters and his partner Virginia Johnson,
Sheen and Lizzy Caplan are expertly matched:

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.519
he's cool and rigid, she's warm and flexible.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.160
And the series manages to take on the sexual
mores of the '50s without snickering or seeming

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.959
like a bad "Mad Men" imitator.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.269
"Masters" is fun when it wants to be, serious
when it needs to be, and consistently generates

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.499
major emotional stakes without requiring its
characters to shoot people and then melt their

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:11.590
bodies in acid.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.840
It's its own thing, and that thing is excellent.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.870
My fourth-place show is the Sundance crime
miniseries "Top of the Lake," about the disappearance

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.720
of a pregnant teen in a remote New Zealand
community.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.139
I could have just as easily given this spot
to the year's other two Sundance originals,

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.169
the dreamy, philosophical life-after-prison
drama "Rectify" or the supernatural French

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.729
import "The Returned," because it's been that
amazing a debut year for AMC's corporate partner.

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.300
For that matter, I could have easily gone
with BBC America's haunting mystery "Broadchurch,"

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.040
which, like "Top of the Lake," deals with
violence and child abuse in a small town located

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.280
by a large body of water.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.919
Ultimately, I liked "Top of the Lake" just
a fraction more than the others, thanks to

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.000
Elisabeth Moss' steely performance as the
cop investigating the crime, thanks to the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.120
gorgeous direction of Jane Campion and Garth
Davis, and the way Campion and Gerard Lee's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.831
script explores the case from every legal,
sociological and emotional angle.

00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:02.710
I very strongly disliked my third place show,
HBO's "Enlightened," when it debuted a few

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.710
years ago.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.919
Some of that was the show's unflinching commitment
to portraying Laura Dern's New Age-y Amy Jellicoe

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.620
as an intensely difficult, irritating person.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.520
But "Enlightened" creator Mike White was also
trying something unlike any other show on

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.310
television, and it took a while to adjust
to the show's combination of absolute sincerity

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.560
and unbearable awkwardness.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.650
The second and final season took us away from
Amy's point of view a bit more than the first,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.360
and also had more of a plot, as Amy and her
outcast co-workers plotted to bring down the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.020
horrible company they work for.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.139
Those two tweaks were enough to elevate "Enlightened"
from an interesting curiosity to an absorbing,

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.949
powerful work of art, with an absolute command
of tone and mood and emotion.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.570
I would not want to be in a room with Amy
Jellicoe for five minutes, but I'm glad I

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.280
got to watch these last four hours of her
story.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.110
Netflix's entrance into the original programming
game was perhaps the biggest TV story of the

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.110
year.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.900
Their first drama, "House of Cards," arrived
with a ton of hype and a big star in Kevin

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.550
Spacey, and later in the year, Netflix brought
"Arrested Development" back from the dead.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.379
But the best Netflix original by far — and
my number two show of the year overall — was

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.229
the women's prison dramedy "Orange Is the
New Black."

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.159
Creator Jenji Kohan started out telling the
story of a privileged, terrified white woman

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.330
adjusting to life behind bars, but the series
quickly expanded its perspective and empathy

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.289
to show how all these people from diverse
backgrounds wound up in this place, how the

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.879
prison economy works, and what hopes each
of them have for their time inside these walls

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:18.879
and beyond.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.629
"Orange" featured a huge cast of characters,
many of them played by relative unknowns doing

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:25.690
great work with the opportunity, and each
character was presented with such detail and

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.270
emotion that the series could have easily
reoriented itself around any of them.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.169
Fortunately, we don't have to choose, because
"Orange" gives us a chance to watch, laugh

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.100
with, and be moved by all of them.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.539
As for my number one choice for 2013, what
else could it possibly be but AMC's "Breaking

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:40.539
Bad"?

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.560
Though I had mixed feelings about the series
finale, the seven episodes leading up to it

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.090
made for one of the most gripping, devastating
stretches of dramatic television in the medium's

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.560
history, as Walter White's life, family and
sense of self all crumbled under the weight

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.280
of the unspeakable things he had done.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.120
The episode "Ozymandias" alone was probably
enough to merit the top spot, and most of

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.879
the hours surrounding it were simultaneously
wonderful and terrible in their own right.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.240
We have said goodbye to an all-time great
here.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.539
Heisenberg is dead.

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.050
Long live "Breaking Bad."

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.479
I'm Alan Sepinwall.

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:09.919
Thanks for watching.
