On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Rodney
Fielitz. I'm a certified flight instructor

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.480
in Cottonwood, AZ, and I'm here to give you
the basics of what it takes to become a pilot.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.200
Alright, the next thing we have to teach you
is weight and balance. Weight and balance

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.420
has to do with cross-country flying. You might
want to go cross-country flying, throw all

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.710
the kids and the dog and everybody in the
airplane--and maybe even some cake for Grandma.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.020
But, one of the things you have to learn is
how much weight will this airplane take, considering

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.120
how much fuel you put in there, how much everybody
weighs. The airplane can only carry so much

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.940
weight, and after that, the airplane will
not fly. We have a loading graph in this airplane

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.520
that shows you the different steps for the
fuel, the front passengers, the rear passengers

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.120
and how much weight you can haul. And this
is a critical thing, because one of the things

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.590
with weight and balance is you want to know
where the center of gravity is on your airplane.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.290
We have what we call a Datum Line. Anything
in front of that is forward center of gravity

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.619
or forward CG--anything aft of that is called
Aft CG. There's different characteristics

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.780
on how you can load an airplane. If you load
your airplane with forward CGs, there's different

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.660
characteristics of what the airplane will
do. It's going to take a longer roll down

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.720
the runway before it climbs, before you can
get it off the runway, because you've got

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.400
the forward weight of the airplane too far
forward--and it just doesn't want to climb.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.020
And the other one is called Aft CG. And Aft
CG is probably the most serious--you do not

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.610
like to load aircraft aft. There is a couple
benefits. You'll get a faster airspeed out

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.890
of an airplane that is loaded with an aft
CG. But the worst thing is you'll have a higher

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.830
stall speed and you'll have more violent stall
characteristics. So again, we teach stalls,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.860
but we also want to teach you not to load
the aircraft so you get into an Aft CG--or

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.660
a nasty violent stall characteristic. So,
during your practice, we do weight and balances.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.170
This is also a pre-requirement for your check
ride. You will do your cross country procedures,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.959
and you will go out with an examiner and do
a cross country. You'll also do a practice

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.610
weight and balance. And you'll make sure the
airplane is inside of its envelope. The envelope

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.300
is what we call your safe operating. You can
fly within the envelope--either the front

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.280
or the rear being loaded to max. As long as
you're in the envelope you can be OK. Doesn't

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.270
mean you can't go outside of the envelope.
I teach my kids this--you can go and do things

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.720
outside of the envelope, but someday you are
going to get caught. And you're going to get

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.069
in trouble. So we always teach our kids--and
our people to fly within the envelope.
