MARY:
While traditional
encaustic painting

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.776
requires moving melted wax
to a work surface,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.746
the technique used in
this lesson plan is a safer,

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.482
non-toxic process that
students of many ages

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.917
will enjoy.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.519
I'm Mary Skydama
with Blick Art Materials.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.357
This lesson plan is
Embossed Metal Encaustics.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.759
First we'll create a border
about a quarter of an inch in

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:33.634
on all four sides on
a piece of metal tooling foil.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.837
To emboss, I need to create
a soft surface underneath.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.706
I'm using a foam sheet,
but a stack of newspapers

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.875
would also work just fine.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.079
With a wooden tool, I've done
a quick sketch on my foil,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.149
then I'll emboss my design
from both sides of the metal.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.218
You'll need to be careful
not to puncture it,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.352
but if this happens,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.121
a piece of masking tape
on the back side

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.224
will keep the melted wax
from leaking.

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:59.593
Keep in mind that
the deeper wells

00:00:59.593 --> 00:01:02.362
will hold more wax
and therefore more colour,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.931
while the raised areas
will show off

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.832
the colour of the foil.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.367
When the embossing
is complete,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.870
you'll want to turn up
the edges of the border

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.874
to form a shallow tray.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:20.881
Keep it as flat as possible.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.383
We'll be using a base of
clear paraffin wax

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.786
that has a relatively
low melting point.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.521
This material
comes in a block,

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.757
but for this project,
it's been grated.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.161
I'm using a heaping
teaspoon here for a project

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:41.268
of this size.

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.538
Next we take our piece
to the heat source.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:49.242
I'm using a warming tray
set at about 175 degrees.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.745
You could also use
an electric skillet.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:54.047
It's important not to use
too much wax

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.850
as it will obscure the design
if it is too thick.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:18.372
As it melts slowly,
you will see it turn clear.

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:21.108
To this clear wax we will then
add candle dye

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:22.042
in assorted colours,

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.478
and if you happen to have
old crayons in the classroom,

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:25.479
and who doesn't,

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.448
this is also a great way to
use some of those up.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.584
Add very small
pieces of candle dye

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:34.654
directly onto
the melted wax.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.990
A little will go a long way.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.325
A craft stick will blend

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.328
and move the colours
on the foil.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:44.564
Another option is to
draw directly with crayons.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.466
If you have an area
that's too full of wax,

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:54.541
a paper towel will
absorb some of the excess.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.910
When you're satisfied with
the way the colour looks,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.478
simply turn off
the heat source

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:03.550
or carefully move the embossing
to a piece of board.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.053
The wax will cool
in just a few seconds,

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:08.722
and you can see
that it gets opaque.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:11.625
It's easy to apply more colour
or manipulate the wax

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.729
simply by placing it
back on your heat source.

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.364
When your encaustic is
completely finished

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.698
you should mount it
to a rigid board

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.701
to keep it from cracking.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.836
Thank you for joining me.
