00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.190
Previously on the Disney Car Toys channel.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; Oh, look at that.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.660
My 12 hour shift is up.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.410
I'm gonna leave you in
the hands of the next doctor.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.630
They'll be the ones operating on your son.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.840
Well who's the next doctor on shift then?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.230
&gt;&gt; Well I'm not too sure.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.960
I'm gonna have to check the schedule.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.088
&gt;&gt; Hello!
[LAUGH] Doctor Barbie in the house!

00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:33.846
&gt;&gt; No!

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.320
&gt;&gt; Oh Elsa, don't you worry!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.952
Your boy will be in great hands with me.

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:42.641
I only had like,
two accidents this week, where like,

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.715
last week I kind of messed
up like seven times!

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.441
So I'm doing, like, super good this week.

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:53.381
Plus I'll make sure he looks super
cute in his surgery hospital gown, and

00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:59.070
I'll make sure that his hair doesn't
get messed up in surgery or anything.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.290
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just don't know Barbie,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.330
I, I gotta question your skill,
not to be offensive or anything.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.360
Skills, I'm, like, oozing with skills.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.010
I've had like seven hundred
different careers where you've just

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.120
been like one job, a queen.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.165
Yeah I'm still concerned though.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:20.640
Dr. Ken is there just any way
you could work longer tonight?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.180
Just one more surgery please
can you operate on my son.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.070
Oh well I'm sorry.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.070
I've only had a couple hours of
sleep after a twelve hour shift.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.360
You're gonna have to figure
this out on your own.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.255
&gt;&gt; Oh, this is just so unfair.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:37.440
&gt;&gt; Okay,well, I've got to go.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440
You two have fun.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, my tummy really hurts.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.030
&gt;&gt; Barbie, have you ever operated on
someone who has appendicitis before?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.680
Does it really need to happen right now?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.770
Maybe we can wait till tomorrow
when another doctor's here.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.475
&gt;&gt; You know.

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:59.170
Honestly, I've never really like,
operated on someone before but

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.180
like, I'm sure it needs to happen now and
it's probably like super duper easy.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.660
I could probably just like,
watch a couple YouTube videos.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.070
&gt;&gt; Alex, I'm so sorry you're sick and
want you to feel better.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.300
I, I got you this little
George piggy from the hospital

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.030
gift shop and I hope it cheers you up.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.770
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Felicia.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.230
I love the George pig.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.950
It makes me feel a little better.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, well,
we better start the surgery soon.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.350
I just gotta do some research like.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.186
Google some YouTube videos on,
like, appendicitis or, like,

00:02:36.186 --> 00:02:41.018
how to remove that little thingy from his
intestines or stomach or whatever it is.

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:44.161
And, hopefully they have a lot
of pictures too, cuz, like,

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:45.859
I don't like reading that much.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.438
Anyway, gotta, gotta Google.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:52.490
&gt;&gt; Alex,
I just really want you to get better.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.100
I miss playing with you and,
and you're my twin brother.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.820
I can't, I can't play with you, you.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.633
&gt;&gt; Oh, Alex, my little baby, don't worry,
I won't let Barbie operate on you.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.357
[SOUND] Oh, I love you.

00:03:06.357 --> 00:03:09.011
&gt;&gt; But Mom, what are we going to do?

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.630
We need another doctor.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, I just need some kind
of hero to come down and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.792
save us, to save poor little Alex.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.500
[SOUND].
&gt;&gt; La da dee da da da da da.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.120
Hello citizens Mike the merman here.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.990
I'm here to help you with
my powers of the ocean.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.270
Oh Mike the Merman,
thank goodness you're here.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.420
My son Alex is super sick, and
he needs his appendix removed right away.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.520
But the only doctor on staff is Barbie.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.840
&gt;&gt; Oh my,
having Barbie operate on your son?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
Oh, we can't have that, that would be
worse than being married to Ursula.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.860
&gt;&gt; Oh, Mike the Merman, I am so scared.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.590
You don't happen to be a doctor, are you?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.635
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't necessarily have
a PHD in medicine, but I do have.

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:03.145
Magical powers of the Ocean.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:03.900
[SOUND].

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.810
Oh, sorry, I got a little excited.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.280
Anyways, I can use my powers of
the ocean to remove your son's appendix.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.080
&gt;&gt; Oh my, yes, I'll take anything.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.760
Please, yes.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.800
Use your powers on my son.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.660
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.230
All right,
now let's take a look at the little one.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.740
All right wee little Alex
will you like me to use my

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.940
magical powers to remove appendix.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.700
&gt;&gt; Yes use your especial powers fish man.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.340
&gt;&gt; La da de la da da nah
nah nah nah nah nah.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.900
Here you are, my boy.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.640
Your appendix is removed from your body,
no longer poisoning you.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.200
See, it's right here in my hand.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.350
Isn't it so cute looking.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.180
I removed it all with magic, no scarring.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.129
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I feel so much better.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.300
Thank you.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.010
&gt;&gt; Oh Mike, Mike, Mike.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.750
You did it.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.240
You fixed Alex, oh I can't.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.570
I don't know how to repay you.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.860
Oh I'm so happy, I'm so happy.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.690
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.360
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.680
Enough hugging now.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280
I just got my cape steam cleaned.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.180
&gt;&gt; Oh.
Sorry, sorry.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.850
I just got a little excited.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.080
You know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah Alex, I'm so glad you're better.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, me, too.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.060
&gt;&gt; Well, I better get on my way now.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.420
There's always more people to.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.230
&gt;&gt; Oh, hey guys, I'm back,
and I'm ready to operate.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.250
I watched some YouTube videos,
and I think I know what to do.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.410
I couldn't find, like, a scalpel, but
I found this thing, and it seems,

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.780
like, nice and sharp, so
I could probably use it.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.560
&gt;&gt; Good golly gills!

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.890
No Barbie.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.000
No need for the operation.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.740
I already removed Alex's
appendix with my magic powers.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.890
See I have appendix right here in my hand.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.250
So cute and little.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.945
&gt;&gt; Ew, it looks bloody,
and I can't handle blood.

00:05:56.945 --> 00:05:58.266
[SOUND].

00:05:58.266 --> 00:06:00.620
&gt;&gt; Barbie,
you faint at the sight of blood?

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.910
You've got to be the worst doctor ever.
