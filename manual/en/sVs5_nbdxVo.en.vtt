00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.000
The President:
Forty one years ago, in the city of Cleveland,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.133
people watched in horror as the
Cuyahoga River -

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.900
choked with debris and covered in oil - caught on fire.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.266
Images of the burning Cuyahoga
shocked a nation, and it led one

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.667
Wisconsin Senator the following
year to organize the first
Earth Day

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.233
to call attention to
the dangers of ignoring our environment.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:24.667
In the four decades since, we
have made remarkable progress.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.867
Today, our air and water are
cleaner, pollution has been

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:32.934
greatly reduced, and Americans
everywhere are living in a healthier environment.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:36.500
We've passed the Clean Air Act,
the Clean Water Act, and founded

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
the Environmental
Protection Agency.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.433
And in Cleveland, the Cuyahoga
River is cleaner than

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.800
it's been in 100 years.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.266
But the true story of the
environmental movement

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.533
is not about the laws that
have been passed.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.000
It's about the citizens who have
come together time and time

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
again to demand cleaner air,
healthier drinking water and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.433
safer food - and who
have demanded that their

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.400
representatives in government
hold polluters accountable.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.567
That progress continues today,
as individuals and entrepreneurs

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:09.300
across the country help lay the
foundation for a
Clean Energy Economy

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.600
- one solar panel, smart meter and energy efficient home at a time.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.567
Since taking office, my
Administration has been a

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:19.166
partner in the fight for
a healthier environment.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.033
Through the Recovery Act, we've
invested in clean energy and

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.100
clean water infrastructure
across the country.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.300
We're taking the necessary steps
to keep our children safe and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.266
hold polluters accountable.

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.600
And we have rejected the notion
that we have to choose between

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.633
creating jobs and a healthy
environment - because we know

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.900
that the economy of the 21st
century will be built on

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.166
infrastructure powered
by clean energy.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.500
But even though we've made
significant progress,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.300
there is much more to do.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.600
And as we continue to tackle our
environmental challenges, it's

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900
clear that change won't
come from Washington alone.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.533
It will come from Americans
across the country who take

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.433
steps in their own homes and
their own communities

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:00.800
to make that change happen.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.667
That's why, as we get ready to
celebrate the 40th anniversary

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.033
of Earth Day, I want to
leave you with a challenge.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.734
I want you to take action - in
your home or your community; at

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:14.567
your school or your business
- to improve our environment.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.967
It can be as simple as riding
the bus or the subway to work,

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:20.033
making your home more energy
efficient,

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:23.300
or organizing your neighbors to clean up a nearby park.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.367
Just go to whitehouse.gov/earthday
to learn how you can help.

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:31.100
And then tell us your story
about what you're doing to make a difference.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100
In the end, it's people like you
- the small business owners and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200
community leaders; the teachers
and the students; the young

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.633
people and the grandparents
- who have made Earth Day so successful.

00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:43.800
And it's going to be up to
you to make an even bigger

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.467
difference over
the next 40 years.

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:47.800
So let's get to work.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.200
Together, we can continue to
make progress towards

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.867
a cleaner environment and a
healthier planet.
