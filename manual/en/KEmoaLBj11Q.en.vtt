00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.820
I'm sure most of you already know the lovely Natasha, we know you're lovely don't we

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.470
because you just attracted kisses from a tramp poor girl.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.320
Tasha isn't exactly being seen in

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.130
in her best light right now, look we've got
strong sunshine going on this is the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.609
classical don't do situation for a portrait because the suns coming in over Jayne's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.910
right shoulder, look we've got a strong shadow   going on here, there's a strong

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.820
black shadow

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.859
round Tasha's nose and round her eyes and when her hair comes forward

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.430
this side of her face is really really bright and this side is really dark.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.730
But what if I was to say I could magic that away?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.500
If I was to go cazam,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.629
you see how much softer that is?

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.290
Look, so what am I doing? piece of white card,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.809
It's a reflector, well actually it isn't a reflector, it is a piece of white card.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.059
A reflector is probably the most basic

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.510
easiest light modifying equipment that you could ever use.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.620
All I'm doing with this is just, and I think even from there you can see the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.800
difference on Tasha's face, just by moving the white card around.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.010
you could use anything there are

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.479
purpose-built reflectors such as this last-elite which i'm gonna

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.189
show you in a minute. You could even use a white envelope, anything will do as a reflector

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.670
and where ever you move it to so you can get the light. The closer this is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.090
to Tasha I think you'll see the stronger the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.909
effect of the reflector. so in here we 
got a pretty strong effect but as I move back

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.900
it becomes more subtle, I saw that sneaky look Natasha.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.270
It becomes more subtle as you move back and forth.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.180
wherever you put it, I'm using it now to soften these shadows but look

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.540
see i could put it under here, look. Just to try and look at this area

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.630
of Natasha's chin. So you could bring the light in from underneath.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.780
You can see how it modify's, now you  wouldn't normally use a reflector in such an

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.970
unsubtle way

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.590
as we are here but I just want to show you what it does, but you don't just use a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.240
reflector

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.780
to reflect light in you could use one to
remove it.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.469
if I come over here, all these shadows here are

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.520
not particularly nice on Tasha's face, so let's remove

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.530
all the shadows but instead of adding light, we're gonna take some light

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.209
away.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.020
All I'm gonna do is put Tasha's face

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.489
in shade. Now there are no shadows but she's gone very dark, compared to the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.290
background,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.620
but if you increase your exposure a bit
and expose for Tasha

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.700
rather than the park Tasha will look really really nice, a beautiful flat even

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.230
light.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.550
Okay the rest of the picture has gone bright but it's still a look it's quite a kinda

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.580
interesting look and it really really separates her from her environment.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.860
There we go, lot's and lot's of things

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.080
that you can do with a reflector. So let's have a loot at the purpose built last-elite.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.370
You're being very good at keeping still. Thanks Nat.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.370
Right, so these things, they come in all sorts of colours, shapes and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.760
sizes, you can buy enormous great big things like this which you have to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.040
wrestle with to put away,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.370
you can buy little tiny ones like that which you can hold in your hand,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.300
would you? Thank you.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.940
Right, look at that, cool isn't it.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.400
As you can see this one, we've got a silver side

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.980
and if i reflect some light into the camera lens you can see just how powerful that reflects.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.920
I've also got a gold side on this one, some of them you might have

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.300
a white reflector one one of them and silver because

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.750
the white wont be as harsh wont be as strong as the silver light.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.030
if I just kind of scoop a bit of light onto Tasha with the silver thing

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.090
you can see that is actually it's very
very very powerful indeed as I just

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.610
scoop some light up.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.069
Now something which is you need to

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.739
think about is colour physics, the sun. The light is coming from over there

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.239
coming this way so you need to scoop it up from this side to push it back into

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.239
those shadows.

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.390
This isn't obviously going to work if you're on this side

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.720
because bit of a no brainer really isn't it. With the silver side we're putting in tonnes

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.840
of light that's way too much I could move back quite a long way with this and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.980
still look at that, even from back over here hopefully

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.170
not falling back into the river which you would love wouldn't you.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.620
I can still still scoop up light,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.939
look at Tasha's face, by just pushing some light

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.970
it makes an enormous difference.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.990
That's it, get in close.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.900
Big difference, now the sun

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.240
is going to be going in and out a bit, there's a couple little bits of clouds coming along

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.139
so I quickly wanna show you what the gold sides for. This will add colour

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.759
to your picture, this is gonna scoop up some gold light

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.050
and fill in the shadows with gold. So Tasha now looks like she's been in the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.650
tanning

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.650
salon, so we're not only getting rid of the shadows we're

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.960
sort of putting a colour onto Nat.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.880
Just flip it over to silver again so quickly, that's a neutral colour

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.159
and the gold colour.
