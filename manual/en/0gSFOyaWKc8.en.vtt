00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.290
Bringing goods over land from far away, the
train is a common sight in many Asian countries.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.360
But due to war, poverty and the fear of invasion
the age of the railway passed Afghanistan

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.360
by.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360
Until today.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.770
A modest seventy-five kilometers of track
is enough to connect the neighbouring country

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.450
of Uzbekistan with Afghanistan, passing over
the Soviet constructed “friendship bridge”

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.500
on the river Amu and passing through the river
port of Hairatan.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.740
Completed in less than a year in late 2010,
the cargo line has been a team effort.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.809
Built by Uzbeks, funded by the Asian Development
bank and facilitated by Afghans.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.480
“Ninety people, including the deputy of
railway of Uzbekistan, who's now the governor

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500
of Arqaam, came here and we provided them
a base and security.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.079
We also cleared the area from mines.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.329
If we weren't working hard on this we could
have lost this huge achievement.”

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.960
For a land-locked country like Afghanistan,
a blossoming economy depends heavily on import

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.530
and export, which relies for the main part
on huge convoys of trucks going in and out

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.530
of the country.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.770
As well as huge delays at customs stations,
these convoys are also vulnerable to attack.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.940
As the carriages are sealed at origin, the
train doesn't need to be checked by customs,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.960
making it much quicker.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.470
Haji Najeeb is also proud of the security
his town has provided to their new technology.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.640
“Discipline and security like we have here,
you won't find in 364 districts of Afghanistan.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.360
At night people's doors are open; our businessmen
come and go by night or day without any anxiety.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.360
They load, unload and transfer their goods.”

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.650
The train's terminus is the historic city
of Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of the border

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.940
province of Balkh, but ambitions for Afghanistan's
railways stretch much further.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.800
After three years of training, Uzbekistan
will hand over control to the newly created

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.320
Afghan Railyway Department to preside over
plans to extend the railway lines west through

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.570
Herat to Iran and east through gate of Torkham
to Pakistan.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.420
And although the train is strictly cargo-only
for now, there have been a few passengers

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.020
already.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.009
“Recently the chief of railways in Uzbekistan
visited and I personally went with him in

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.149
train until Mazar airport.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.860
The construction work in one hundred per cent
finished without any problems.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.540
It's ready for use, so now we're just waiting
for the Afghan authorities to open it officially.”

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.870
And perhaps it's not too hard to imagine that
this new transcontinental cargo silk road

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.170
will one day connect Afghanistan beyond its
neighbours and to the rest of the world.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620
This is Ruth Owen, in Afghanistan, for the
NATO Channel.
