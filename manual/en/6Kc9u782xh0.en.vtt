00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.240
Nikita: Hello Rosie.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.874
Rosie: How may I help you?

00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:19.090
Nikita: Rosie, I'm home

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.770
Welcome to the Helen Hayes Hospital
Smart Apartment.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.900
Announcer: The Smart Apartment is an interactive model that replicates
a typical home, but with one very

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.730
important difference. It is equipped with
an array of assistive technology that

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.750
enables individuals with disabilities to
control their surroundings.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.070
The Smart Apartment door opens access to the world
of technology that reconnects

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.050
individuals living with disabilities
with the outside world facilitating

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.270
communication with family, friends, and
colleagues and automating control over the environment.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.300
Your voice turns on the
television, controls the room temperature,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.800
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.180
Rosie: I have adjusted the temperature.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.427
Announcer: and
raises the shades.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:09.070
Rosie: I have adjusted all

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.900
the shades to fifty percent.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.540
Announcer: Suddenly a
world that was once remote is within command.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.060
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.050
Eddy: What we do is look at access
methods such as voice, whether you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.399
wearing a headset, a lapel microphone or
a handheld mic, or a tabletop mic, a

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.410
gooseneck mic in bed, voice is very
powerful. You can just walk into this

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.780
apartment and speak to Rosie. Rosie never
having heard your voice before will

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.440
understand you.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.400
Patient: Close front door.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.800
Announcer: The smart apartment consists of a great
room,  kitchen

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.680
bedroom, bath

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.460
and laundry area. All are designed to be
universally accessible and to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.500
incorporate both high and low tech
modifications and solutions to everyday

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.760
living.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.160
Therapist: As high as you're comfortable.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.360
Announcer: The
model environment allows physical occupational and speech therapists as
well as assistive technologist to work

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.340
with patients one-on-one identifying and
customizing the most appropriate

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.640
technology to meet the individuals goals.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.239
Therapist: Keep going white and you will be on the shower.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.590
Announcer: The blink of an eye. Eye movement is just one method of accessing
the television computer and other

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.680
devices used on a daily basis.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.319
Eddy: Another
technology, which is the latest and

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.459
greatest, is what we looked at earlier,
was the eye gaze component. A peripheral

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.799
that allows the computer to track the
movement of your eyes just as it would

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.380
track a mouse, so whether you moving your
head as a mouse, or your eyes as a mouse,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.120
we have technology to match your
abilities.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.820
Patient: I can see myself using this at

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.996
home anytime yes,  it's a fantastic
product.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.459
Announcer: The press of a button, this

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.160
specialized closet system includes a rod
that can be lowered via remote control

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.019
making a wardrobe accessible to all.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.129
Announcer: Because no one single solution works for
all having an array of technologies

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.080
embedded in the Smart Apartments
environment is a great asset. Commercial

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.830
products including iPads, iPhones, Android
tablets, PCs, and customized programmable

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.140
remote controls, are just a sample of the
devices utilized.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.240
This state-of-the-art interactive Smart Apartment located on
the Helen Hayes Hospital campus,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.480
the first of its kind, gives patients and
community members the opportunity to

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.799
experience a variety of devices that may
help them live autonomously in their own

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.600
homes. We encourage you to plan a visit
to experience the Smart Apartment

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.060
