00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:16.954
A hot hatch used to be all about a big engine in a small car.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:33.021
Now, it's all about CO2 reduction. So here are fuel-efficient ones!

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:39.487
VW presents the new Polo Blue GT with 150 PS.

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:45.605
While Ford has the Fiesta Red Edition, with a 140 PS 1.0 EcoBoost.

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:52.298
Downsizing at speed. How is that to drive?

00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:18.611
In the Fiesta, yes. We know this nice 1-liter turbo engine.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:37.897
It's been tuned to 140 PS but sounds a bit less than the Fiesta Metal.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:49.508
But it has much more torque. Keep it over 2500 rpm and it goes!

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:59.864
The sound is okay. And there's a smooth manual 5-speed.

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:16.176
An engaging drivetrain. The chassis is a bit tighter, too.

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:26.119
Even hints of lift-off oversteer. Good fun all around!

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:37.872
However, the drum brakes at the rear aren't that good.

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:52.054
But it's no proper GTI - no Fiesta ST at that. And the Polo?

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:29.537
The Polo is rock solid. A perfectionist. But fun?

00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:43.825
Not really. It's a bit rougher, but doesn't get playful.

00:03:44.225 --> 00:04:01.622
It corners as well, but at the limit it feels very safe.

00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:09.017
Good, but not exciting. Like the drivetrain: 1.4 turbo, 7-speed DSG.

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:22.637
Faster than any manual. The extra 10 PS and feel like 30 PS.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:34.069
It's fun to go fast. The flappy pedals are alright. But still.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:49.843
The engine has cilinder deactivation for added fuel economy.

00:04:49.843 --> 00:04:58.242
Funny. It does that when you cruise, so it's basically a 3-cil too.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:27.583
Both cars are quite fun, fast and fairly economical. 

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:40.110
But the Fiesta costs 21000 euros, the Polo goes for 9000 more.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.294
Even taking extras into account, the difference is 5500 euros.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:52.628
While the Fiesta is as much fun to drive. The Polo is more advanced.

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:58.785
But overall, the Fiesta just wins as a fun car to drive.
