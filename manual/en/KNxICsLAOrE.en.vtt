Sara: Hi, I'm Sara from Heirloom Creations,
and I'm doing the Ruler of the Month.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.460
This month it's using the Twister ruler.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.219
There's actually two of them.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.631
There is a Lil' Twister that you use with
five inch squares, and a bigger one that you

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:21.450
use with ten inch squares.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.949
And it really gives you a look of a neat block,
without doing a lot of work.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.560
If you just like to sew simple blocks together,
and with a couple borders, you can do any

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.170
of the blocks that are shown in the Let's
Twist book, or there's a new one called Let's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.170
Twist Again.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.820
To start with, you need to sew all your blocks
together.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.350
Now it doesn't matter in which color order
that they go in.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.570
It looks good no matter how you finish it.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
The key is what you put as the border that
kind of gives it some background to the colors

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.199
that you use on the inside.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.359
So they don't have to be as distinct as what
you see here with the blue and the white.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.940
On the Twister rulers, there is a caddywhompus,
X on them.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.990
Now when we used to do this back in the day,
we had square dance, if you remember that.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.890
But all we had was template.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.270
You had your template.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.460
You placed it on here.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.321
But there's a seam right here, so it makes
it...it was kind of hard to balance, and you

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.640
definitely didn't want to work with a rotary
cutter.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.310
It would sometimes go a little sideways.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.530
You didn't want to cut yourself.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.000
The Twister rulers have these little legs
on them, so that makes it so as we position

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.220
these over the intersections, as we're going
to do, then the seam allowance is held, the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.470
ruler doesn't move, and you can use your rotary
cutter with ease.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.790
Now before we start cutting, I want to show
you that when we cut this all the way down

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.880
to all the twister blocks, and sew them back
together, It's going to reduce in size.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
You can see we're about 25 percent smaller
than what we started with, so you need to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.200
plan ahead for your finished projects.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.720
Now of course, all the books and the patterns
for this ruler is going to have that predetermined

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.469
for you, but if you're doing it on your own,
you've got to allow for that extra shrinkage.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.200
Ok so, I have one of these started in the
cutting, because once we've cut it's kind

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.970
of neat to see how this actually all comes
together.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.770
We're going to take our Twister, back to where
that X is on the ruler.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.669
We'll be placing that at any of the intersections...actually
all intersections it will be cutting a square.

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:29.410
There's going to be a slight...about a quarter
inch distance between all these when we're

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.750
actually done, and a little waste that's going
to come out between the blocks.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.500
And you also cut the border.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.859
That's why it's important to have your borders
all sewn on.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.850
That is actually going to be the background
colors when you see this all done.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.000
We're just going to go ahead and just cut
around.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.050
What's nice is that you can extend your rotary
cutter past the ruler, and we'll kind of go

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.590
into that part that's going to get actually
removed, but won't actually make a big difference

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.550
there.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.400
Ok, now for the twisting to begin.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.070
You probably want to have some sort of design
wall, or even an area that you'll be working

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.560
with, so these do not get mixed up into any
unnecessary order here.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.970
Watch as it comes together, these blocks are
just going to...you just twist them into place,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.920
and you'll see those pinwheels starting to
take shape.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.910
Here's the borders.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.700
Now one thing I love about this block, it
is so forgiving.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.810
Once again, all you're going to do is sew
these blocks together, so no triangles, no

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.590
nothing special here.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.920
These intersections at this point, they're
all the same color, so if it's not just perfect,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.630
your eye is not going to be drawn to that.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.140
It's a great project for any beginner.
