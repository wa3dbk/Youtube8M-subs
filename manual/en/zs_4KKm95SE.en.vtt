00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.710
For taking care of your machine, all you need
to do is maintain and keep this area under

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.910
the throat plate clean.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.340
Start off by taking your scissors and clipping
the thread up at the spool and then pulling

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.540
the thread towards you.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.789
This is going to make sure you don't drag
any extra length that you have back up into

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.099
your machine.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.569
Go ahead and take the needle out.

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:27.130
You're going to need your screwdriver for
two things: first, the little, the screw at

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.270
the top here or we can drop that out and then
go ahead and take the presser foot off; just

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.520
snap it towards you and that will come out.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.320
Slide your bobbin case door up and take your
bobbin out.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.670
Now, your screwdriver is going to lift on
this throat plate.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.620
You can do it on either corner here, you can
go ahead and just lift and that is how easy

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.970
it is to get inside.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.471
Next, this part is actually your little holder
here, that is going to come out and then you

00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:00.750
can take your bobbin case out, just lift it
and remove it.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.250
This is where all the hook comes around.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.420
It spins as you take a stitch so it actually
goes around two times for every time you take

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.400
one stitch.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.149
Down in here, this is where all the lengths
is going to be so you've got to brush, you

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.149
can pull that out.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.389
This is my favorite, it's like a little duster,
it's like a sheepskin and it just swooshes

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:24.630
all the lengths out of the machine very easily
and make sure you get nice and clean.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.539
You can even touch the thread scissors and
then that way you can see this will come over

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.170
and if there's any extra threads that need
to be cleared from the selective thread cutter,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.509
you can get to those at that time.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.990
How often do you need to do this?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.780
You want to do it about every three to four
bobbins.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.710
That's a lot of sewing if you think about
it.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.409
Remember no oil comes with this machine because
you definitely do not oil down in this area.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.250
To put the bobbin case back in, you want to
go ahead and again, if there's any extra length

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.859
or dust on the bobbin case you can go ahead
and clear that out now.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.149
Then take the two points and point them towards
the feed dogs.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.930
It's really only one place that sits in here
so just let it rock back and forth that is

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.930
correct.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.230
Then you'll take this part here; this has
a part that needs to be lined up even with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.260
the front of the machine and then it just
lays down flush.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.260
To put your throat plate back on, go ahead
and line up the back part and then press down

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.870
firmly and that is all you need to do.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.690
Next, go ahead and put a new needle in, put
your bobbin in and get everything reset.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.030
One thing I always do is I tell people to
use their needle threader when they're threading

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.030
their needle.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.730
Even if you don't do it on a regular basis,
this is the time to do it because then you'll

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.970
double check that you have put the needle
high enough, up into the shaft there and make

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.120
sure it got properly placed.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.680
If it's got too low then the needle threader
won't line up and then you'll know, "Oops,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.870
something wrong," before you start sewing.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.400
Thread up your machine, test it out and that
is all you need to do about every two to three

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.530
bobbins.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.820
That way, each year you want to take it to
your Husqvarna Viking dealer and have them

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.460
clean and oil the rust of the machine.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.570
They will keep up on all the regular maintenance
for both the machine and the embroidery module.
