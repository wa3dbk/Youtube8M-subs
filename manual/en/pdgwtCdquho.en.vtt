My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.590
make rye bread. Okay, for our first step,
we've got our mixer over here and get it ready.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.900
Notice I put the whip in here and not the
dough hook. We use a dough hook later but

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.050
we are going to use the whip for right now
for this first step. So the first thing I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.680
want to do is I grab my first three ingredients
which is that cup of warm water, not hot because

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.910
hot will kill the yeast, our active dry yeast
and our sugar. So what we are going to do

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.330
is I'm actually going to put the water in
first. Then I'm going to put the yeast in

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:54.230
second and then the sugar. And what goes on
here is, the yeast and the warm water will

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.440
actually start to bloom a little bit and then
the sugar is going to act as its food. If

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.260
it doesn't have anything to eat, it won't
work out right. I'm just going to turn this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.470
up. You can do this by hand if you wanted
but I'm just going to do the mixer to show

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.710
you the whole way to do it. So what I'm going
to do is I'm going to mix this up for a few

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.120
seconds here. Until basically, you see all
of the yeast dissolved. And you are going

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.159
to want to make sure to get your spatula out
for this part and scrape all the yeast down

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.619
off the walls because what will happen is
it will all, when you first turn it on the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.049
first time it will sling some of it up on
the sides. You just want to scrape that down

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.490
and just get your mixer up and going again.
I missed a spot, right there. And you will

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:58.610
see what will happen is your mixture in here,
it will turn a very milky color, kind of a

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.369
foamy brown, really light chocolate milk color
and what's going on there is you are activating

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.450
your yeast. You will also get a really, really
distinct odor at this point. That way you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.230
know that the yeast is working. So, don't
be concerned, it's nothing wrong, it's just

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.889
it's suppose to be brown. So I'm going to
let this go for another five seconds or so

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:27.180
and then we are going to let it rest for ten
minutes. And for that ten minutes we're just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.459
going to leave it alone and not do anything
with it. We're going to turn the mixer off.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.001
So, let's kill our mixer, and let's set our
timer, ten minutes. I'll be back in ten minutes

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.859
and we'll go from there.
