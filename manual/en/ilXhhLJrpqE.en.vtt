00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.600
Shellac, obviously one of the most versatile
finishing products available to us today

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.900
has been around for thousands of years.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.600
It is a natural resin secreted by the lac bug
on certain trees in mainly India and Thailand.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.820
It is used in many industries
including the textile, agricultural,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.500
pharmaceutical and of course wood finishing.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Originally it was used as a dye

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.800
but since the mid 19th century has
been used as a clear varnish.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680
Unfortunately with the rise of synthetic
resins it became less popular.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.900
However, in recent years
it is being used more and more.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.400
Shellac comes in several themes and variations.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.500
In its most unrefined form it is known as seed
lac or button lac and has a deep red color.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.800
In its most refined form it is known
as blonde and can be almost clear.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.350
Basically there are three shades
of colors, garnet, orange and blonde.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
All of these are available
in waxed or dewaxed versions.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.900
Shellac can be sprayed, brushed
or padded onto a surface.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.400
It is very durable and was even
used on flooring in the past.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.300
Some of the pros are: in its dewaxed form
it can go over or under any other finish,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.820
its organic, you won’t poison
yourself or blow yourself up.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
No special equipment is needed to
apply it, thus it saves you money.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.500
You can purchase it pre mixed and
even get it in a sprayable recipe.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.600
It can be high gloss or rubbed out to a satin.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.300
For us luthiers it also has a tonal aspect
in that it can be applied very thin

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.200
so as not to inhibit the tonal
vibrations of the instrument.

00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:56.500
Depending on the color used it can
be clear or add color to the wood.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.400
Shellac also touches up nicely
making instrument repairs easier.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.900
I use shellac quite often in my shop and when
I do I prefer to mix it myself from flakes.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.200
So, let me show you how I do that. When
mixing shellac we use the term pound cut.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.190
For example, a one pound cut would be one
pound of flakes to one gallon of alcohol.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.100
A two pound cut would be two pounds of
flakes to one gallon of alcohol,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.800
three pound cut – three pounds of
flakes to one gallon of alcohol

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.100
and therefore more concentrated. What I am going
to do is show you how to mix a one pound cut.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.300
This is what I use in my shop
for repairs and for finish work.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.900
If I were to mix one pound of
flakes to one gallon of alcohol

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.950
I would have more than I
could use before it goes bad.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.090
So, I am going to divide those proportions down

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.400
and mix one ounce of flakes
to eight ounces of alcohol.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
This will give me a one pound cut in
the proportions that I use in my shop.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.100
Here is a little trick to help
your flakes dissolve quicker.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.600
Place them in a coffee grinder and
grind them into a fine powder.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.300
I then pace this mixture into a container that
has liquid measurements written on the side.

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:13.240
I then add eight ounces
of alcohol to the container.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.100
I then place the lid on and
allow the mixture to dissolve.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200
This could take a day or two.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
If you put it in the coffee grinder
sometimes it takes a little less.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.350
You want to make sure it is all
dissolved before you work it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.850
I also like to write some information on
the bottle. First of all the pound cut,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300
the flavor and the date.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.800
That way I know how fresh the shellac is.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.600
You’ll notice that I am using pure grain
alcohol to mix my shellac flakes

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.600
and there’s some reasons for that.
1.It is not poisonous.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.300
Denatured alcohol gives me a headache
so I don’t even like it in my shop.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.920
Second, if there happens to
be any wax in your flakes

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:56.100
a certain amount of that will dissolve into the
denatured alcohol giving you a softer finish.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.000
Third, the grain alcohol flashes off quicker
and for my method of French polish,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.200
this allows me to get a quicker build.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.100
One the shellac has dissolved, I like to
filter it before I use it.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.200
Once mixed your shellac has a shelf life and
here is how you can tell if it’s gone bad.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.900
Place a little bit onto a hard
surface like a mirror a tile a cd,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.300
anything like that and let it sit overnight.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.500
Come back the next morning and run your
fingernail into it from your thumb,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.510
if it is gummy, it’s gone bad.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.500
If it flakes off, it’s dried, it’s
hard, it’s good enough to use.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.210
Now, I almost never throw
out shellac in my shop.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.330
Even if it’s gone bad I’ll use it for wash coats

00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:39.750
and things that I know is gonna
be taken off the guitar later.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.540
Shellac: a very versatile
and often overlooked finish.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.400
Next time you need to finish your instrument
keep shellac on your list of possibilities.
