Hello, my name is Alyona. 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
I`m glad to greet you on our channel of the Pyvovarovs studio.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.580
Today we`ll tell you, what do you need for making Tiffany stained-glass windows.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:27.060
First we need a glass cutter. We use oil glass cuter with plastic or metallic handle 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:39.660
We need oil for glass cutter, also we need narrow pliers for small parts and cutting glass edges.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.280
We need a wide pliers for separating glass on smaller pieces.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.440
Some pliers has long big handles, other has smaller, like this.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.000
Necessarily we should have a soldering-iron. 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.140
It can be professional or non-professional.  Manufacturer can be different.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.980
Also it has different power, but 80W or 100W is better. 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.240
We need a stand for iron and a solder (POS-61)

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.620
Then we need a can for soldering acid and a brush.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.360
For markings on glass we need a cd/dvd marker. It makes thin lines, that is right for us.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.240
We need a foil to wrap the pieces and fasten them together. 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.440
Also you can have special foiler for keeping foil.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.320
For soldering you need flux, black patina, cooper patina. 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:06.100
You don`t need cooper patina at first, because of complicated process. It will be covered in next issues.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:19.520
We need neutralizer, finishing polish, oxy. Also we need toothpicks (later I tell you why).

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.460
We need a brush to clean you working place from glass shards.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:41.660
We need a rag, preferably white (it`s important). It should be cotton for good moisture absorbtion.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.860
The main instrument is polishing machine. 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.440
It`s also different: “Impulse” or “Crystal”.  

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.380
A polishing head is included with machine, so you don`t need to buy it separately.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.280
