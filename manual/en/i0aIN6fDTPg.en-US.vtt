00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.955
Acting as T1 Emblem!

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:13.328
The photographer requests for T1 pose.

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:16.970
Faker : Do this, Impact! Bengi, Do this!

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.936
Bengi : Why are we doing this?
Faker : I think this is better.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:21.888
Piglet : Bengi and Impact! Do this.
Faker : Wings!

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:27.888
Bengi and Impact, who had to stand in the sides due to
the height, unexpectedly took the wing positions.

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:32.328
Faker : What should the middle people do?
Piglet : One!

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:35.775
Faker : I think only Poohmandu should…

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:37.509
Poohmandu : Hold your left arm up.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:43.509
Piglet : You hold both of your arms up.
Poohmandu : Me? I think it’s weird.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.268
Under Faker’s suggestion, T1 K made a perfect
T1 emblem as Bengi and Impact acted as wings.

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:57.268
The shirt’s short!

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.125
Manager : Poohmandu’s stomach is coming out!

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.072
Poohmandu : It’s because the shirt is short!

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:05.419
Faker and Piglet pet Poohmandu’s stomach.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:09.716
Every cloth is short for tall Poohmandu.

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:13.912
Faith! Loyalty!

00:01:13.912 --> 00:01:19.912
The photographer requests to stand
side by side with arms showing.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:23.759
Piglet : Isn’t this all?

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.759
Bengi &amp; PoohManDu : Faith! Loyalty!

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:58.295
Piglet’s idea of “faith, loyalty” pose brought
lots of applaud from the staffs.

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:04.295
Weren’t we suppose to scream?

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:13.232
The photographer wants a photo of players shouting.
Photographer : Scream after I count to 3.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.072
Instead of a shout out, players gave a silence.

00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:29.072
Bengi : Let’s do this.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.366
The photographer was unsatisfied with the pose and decided to stop the shoot with the ‘faith, loyalty’ pose.

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:43.796
Cheesy

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:49.796
The players look at the ceiling as if they saw an UFO.
(Poohmandu having difficult time with cheesy poses.)

00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:45.469
After the OK sign, the players are embarrassed
of their cheesy poses.

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.469
Faker’s solo shots

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.990
Piglet’s solo shots

00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:01.751
Impact’s solo shots

00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:32.474
Bengi’s solo shots

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:06.495
Poohmandu’s solo shots

00:06:06.495 --> 00:06:12.495
