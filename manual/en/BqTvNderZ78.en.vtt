00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.990
I literally dream about shoes, all the time.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.450
I live, sleep, eat, and drink fashion.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.750
It’s not something I separate; I’m like
always designing.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.700
Historically, you know both in ready to wear
and in shoes, and in accessories it has been

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.140
men. I’m kind of the new cog, which is wait
a minute, why shouldn’t a woman know what

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.160
a woman wants when it comes to footwear.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.470
I am always telling young designers who are
very creative coming out of art schools you’ve

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.239
got to learn the business. In the world we
live today you can’t just sit in the corner

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.519
and draw shoes for example. You have to know
how to market the shoes, you have to know

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.360
how to sell the shoes, you have to know how
to cost the shoes.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049
You know, you don’t design into a vacuum.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.409
To be an entrepreneur, you don’t have to
be like myself, the lead entrepreneur.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.339
You know the people who work for me, they
all have to be entrepreneurs, um, so it's really

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.820
a way of thinking that’s an empowering way
of thinking, it's an accountability, it's you

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.619
can make a difference.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.960
It's going to your job and not just thinking
you’re a cog in a wheel, it's thinking like

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.369
you could affect the wheel, you could innovate
the wheel, you could make it a better wheel.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.179
That kind of thinking is so important for
any type of job, any type of career, and especially design.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.979
I think having my entrepreneurship background
gave me that confidence that I could go out

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.900
on a limb and innovate.
