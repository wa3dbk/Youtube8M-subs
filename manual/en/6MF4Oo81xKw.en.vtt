Today I'm going to tell you how to take a panoramic shots with you phone with PanoSphere app

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.000
First of download the app and launch it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.670
Let’s take a first shot.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.233
Now just keep moving the smartphone according to the green dots on the screen

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.530
depending on the type of panoramic shot you want to get

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.000
Every time you make a picture the screen blinks, meaning you can proceed to the next frame

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This way you’ll get a series of pictures for our panoramic shot

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.130
At the moment I have a circular panorama

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.830
but if you wish you can leave the circle open

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.370
or add some shots above and beneath

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.067
all the way to the sphere type panoramic shot

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.600
When you‘ll finish shooting press “Rendering” button

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.090
The app automatically determines the rendering area

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.067
although you can alter this by yourself

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:23.000
The app has a 4 projection types

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.600
You can also choose the panorama’s center

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.667
and the viewing angles

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:33.000
When all the options are chosen we proceed to the next step

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.767
Here we choose the picture format

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:37.267
saving location

00:01:37.267 --> 00:01:40.833
and start the rendering process

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.500
If the final frame contains a lot of shots

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.000
it’s strongly recommended to use an external power source while rendering

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:54.020
Now, when the rendering process is over and you’ll probably would want to show the picture to your friends

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.040
why would you make such a shot in any other case ...

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.070
So, the JPEG saved pictures can be viewed with a stock Gallery app

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.000
And the IVP ones can be viewed within the PanoSphere itself

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:25.567
Or you can check the pictures on any PC as well

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.819
My name is Andrii Kobzar, app developer, thanks for watching!
