00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.537
The President: Cheese.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:06.606
Narrator: Welcome to
the West Wing Week,

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.607
your guide to
everything that's

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.809
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.011
This week the President
traveled to Fort Dix

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.081
to thank our troops, took
action to protect Alaska's

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.817
Bristol Bay, and announced
historic changes

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.986
to America's
relationship with Cuba.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.355
That's December 12th
to December 18th,

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.458
or "Todos Somos Americanos."

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.394
The President began his
West Wing Week by convening

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.496
his national security
and public health teams

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.732
to receive an update on
the Ebola response.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.567
Meanwhile, over
in the East Room,

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.003
unsuspecting guests soaking
in the White House holiday

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.672
cheer got treated to
an impromptu serenade

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:42.942
by the legendary Motown
artists the Four Tops

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.644
and the Temptations.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:49.349
Male Speaker: ♪ When it's
cold outside I've got ♪

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.286
♪ the month of May, oh. ♪

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.122
Narrator: The holiday cheer
continued on Sunday when

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:57.590
the first family
attended the taping

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.927
of the Christmas in Washington
concert, featuring host

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.863
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
and a serious holiday

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.532
lineup of performers.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.002
And don't forget the elves.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.937
They got some first
family time too.

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:11.738
Elves: Merry Chistmas.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.539
The President:
Merry Christmas.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.307
Hugs, hugs.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.010
What are you doing?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.245
Mrs. Obama: All right,
you've got to be careful.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.613
Oh you're shoe's untied.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.481
The President: Oh that's
a cool move by the elf.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.515
Narrator: The President
kicked off the work week

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.851
with a trip to joint base
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.620
in New Jersey to mark
an important milestone.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.956
After more than 13 years
the President is bringing

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.692
a responsible end to
America's war in Afghanistan.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.761
The President: You've got
new Americans with that same

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:40.200
patriotism, that same sense of
what we're about as Americans,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.038
that same creed that we can
all pledge allegiance to,

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:48.441
regardless of what we look
like or where we come from.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.310
We're fighting on
the same team.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.245
Narrator: On Tuesday the
President took action

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.447
by signing a presidential
memorandum to protect

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:57.050
one of America's greatest
national treasures,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.619
and one of Alaska's most
powerful economic engines,

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.520
Bristol Bay.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.956
The President: It
supports about $2 billion

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.359
in the commercial fishing
industry, supplies America

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.396
with 40 percent of its
wild caught seafood.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.665
It is a beautiful
natural wonder,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.934
and it's something that's
too precious for us

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.670
to just be putting out to
the highest bidder.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.239
Narrator: Later in the
afternoon the Vice President

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.974
attended the
35th anniversary

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.376
of the national menorah
lighting in President's Park

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.812
just south of
the White House.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.581
The Vice President: Happy
Chanukah to everyone.

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.116
Narrator: On Wednesday
the President announced

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:32.218
significant changes in
America's relationship with

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:36.055
Cuba, beginning a new chapter
between our two nations.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.124
The President: I do not believe
we can keep doing the same

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:42.562
thing for over five decades
and expect a different result.

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.497
We know from hard earned
experience that countries

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.534
are more likely to enjoy
lasting transformation

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.036
if their people are not subjected to chaos.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.638
Narrator: That afternoon
the President sat down

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.774
with ABC's David Muir to
reflect on the momentous

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.543
historic events of that day.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:57.677
The President: Change happens.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.679
It's not a straight line, it
doesn't happen overnight,

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.181
but the world has a
way of seeping in,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:06.352
and good ideas about rule
of law and democracy have

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.087
a tendency to spread.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.990
Narrator: As Chanukah continued
into its second day the kitchen

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.293
was koshered and the first
two Chanukah receptions

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.428
took place in the grand
foyer of the White House.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.063
(applause)

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.433
(singing in Hebrew)

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:23.836
Narrator: Well, you've
gone and done it.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.238
Thank you for taking
some time out of your

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.373

And from all of us to all
of you, happy holidays.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.850
(singing)

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.259
The President: All right,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.093
