kiki mclean is democratic strategist who
worked on the killer couldn't have been

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.690
in two thousand eight joe watkins is an
msnbc political analyst and director of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.839
hill solutions a government consulting
firm

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.909
kiki let me start with you have you just
heard my premise do you agree with that

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.320
but it's not a matter of who's more
viscera liberal

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.130
says that the town is so much more
conservative used to being

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.349
and i just have to break your whole

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.310
measuring stick that you've got against
this and it's about the labels you know

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.699
i worked for bill clinton when he was
the chairman of the democratic

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.800
leadership council

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.570
and he was governor of arkansas and that
was a time within the party when

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.780
everyone in the democratic party or
maybe outside the party said no no he's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.360
too conservative to be a democrat i
think the question is the labels you're

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.790
applying don't apply to either of these
men

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.180
both of these men i have led to end
clearly president obama will continue to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.760
leave for the times that they're in but
i think you're using integrated labels

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.960
that don't represent not only who they
are and what they do but they're both

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.330
known for breaking ground and doing
what's right moving forward as opposed

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.630
to saying i'm only for a liberal things
are only for conservative things

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.680
yeah i think they weren't you going to
characterize it somehow

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.110
i'm telling you that is a difference in
which one it is a conservatism of arafat

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.110
personally i mean

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.829
having another one is not a republican
emirates

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.790
we got to be our cibil could lower
republican guy he's he's he's a democrat

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.620
and that he was a very popular
democratic served two terms that he

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.210
didn't get fifty percent for selection
in ninety two because as you recall the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.050
ross perot's in the race is a roster of
the spoiler and uh... and you remember

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.670
that very well but bill clinton was up
more of a centrist at some of the people

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.229
who say more conservative democrat then
that though the president that we uh...

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.360
that we currently have had a long time
as a way of because nobody else people

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.340
bill clinton al you see oftentimes with
for president george ph w bush you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
sometime soon with george w_ bush ads
and he's he's much more of a calm by out

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.200
character now it is post presidential
lopes years but at the same time we have

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.590
to remember that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.770
what fires voters up today is whether or
not they have money to spend with out

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.750
there working

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.390
and as long as you have

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.990
unemployment id nationally at nine point
six percent and in some states in double

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.710
digits give it a lot of angry americans
are going to be voted against the people

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.350
that are responsible for those that
incumbents in both the democrats people

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.240
benefit would on election day joe let me
stay with you for a second look it's not

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640
just uh... the unemployment numbers it's
also the conservative media

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.950
because when clinton was around this
truck i was just saying i think the you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.320
know that that i was saying

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.720
they've although they went after me
day-in and day out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.229
now the robot was in charge they
homeland

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.100
and so it's it's a matter of who fox
news is more angry at

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.159
that gets people riled up

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.959
that it is true that the that did that
some news organizations are accused of

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.219
having a bias one way or the other the
reality is that when you the president

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:48.140
on states

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.550
and i worked in the white house for u_s_
president it's hard to find any by this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.760
terribly complimentary you work your
tails off you try to do the best you can

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.000
for the american people but ultimately
what the people care about are the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.349
results

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.480
the results of numbers weather out there
working without their money to spend

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.769
that's what matters to them and they
state they they really want their

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.760
president to be result or do they want
the members of congress to be results or

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.219
aidid

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.079
and if they feel like i was a spreading
too much money going to grow in the size

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.639
of government they're going to respond
with their votes

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.689
hiding elliot said it's interesting
'cause i think janae grayer hair on

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:19.659
something and it's

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.639
and it's really about results like
you're in the earliest days of his

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.869
presidency and president clinton would
say change does not come easy both

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.889
president clinton and president obama
had pushed for a tremendous change and

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.849
when you push change and you can label
it however you wanting but when you

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.829
pushed change you spend your political
capital down barack obama has placed in

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.479
significant change and change which have
frankly kept us from going into a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.219
full-fledged oppression kept our
financial system upload and now we're

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.419
going to hopefully see the next steps of
what that chain the fruit of that change

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.870
which is beginning to a decrease
unemployment create more jobs move us

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.069
forward half families protected in
health care because at the end of the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.369
day it's like president clinton said
that clip

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:07.059
this election is about a choice it's not
a choice between bill clinton and

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.149
somebody here and again sir brocco
bomber somebody who wants to run against

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:15.709
him it's a choice about do you want what
you have in the past with that undefined

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.019
paralleled spinning when our people know
healing muslim or you know i don't agree

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.880
enola gay american people agree that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.960
we've had so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.949
all my change you see a washington post
poll out today there's many different

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.750
pose a safety showed on more than eight
recent gallup poll tx by a two-to-one

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.900
margin so that they should have more
change in health care reform are not

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.419
less change so i do know my problem is
they want to see you know there is no

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.750
single double bottom up

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.700
the problem is that you conservative

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.199
there today his stick too much so what

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.080
health insurance companies one the drug
insurance companies one

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.069
criticize obama

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.809
well it looks like it if you look at it
was safe if you want to see more people

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:55.309
hired

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.350
you have to make sure that what you're
doing with this way that week

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.020
benefits people who could hire folks

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.229
and so if you publish the job creators
the small business people who create job

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.959
it's not a small businesspeople it's not
a small business analysis of only three

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.520
percent mira loma high scott's
journalist has been carried out ahead

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.369
matters have been yet stopping yelling
cuz i do think that's what people are

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:18.270
tired of

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.370
i think the labels are what people
history i think showers raising

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.400
something important

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.059
do things that are going to help our
economy grow and create jobs

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.819
that's why president obama pushed
through the tax breaks for small

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.139
business republican stood on the side
like these are the kinds of examples

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.919
that really make it clear the choice
we've got

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.849
you're talking about a group of
republicans who wished bill clinton was

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.249
back in office because they were
republicans who as much as they find

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.729
work within unlike john bainer who will
not work with president obama who stood

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.659
on the sidelines with mitch mcconnell
said we just don't have anything to do

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.759
if you're not welimdone admitted he was
at his own up to what's happening right

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.680
now

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.870
proyecto happens democrats have got to
what's happening right now republicans

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.249
the republicans lost

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.279
two thousand six of the other two
thousand eight because they didn't do

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.330
with the voters tended to do which is to
make it better for all of us have to put

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.020
people back to work to lower the the the
the uh... the burden of taxes democrats'

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.300
appeal that they've had two thousand six

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.990
they've raised taxes i've got a mail
order that we had a galilee ten percent

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.360
