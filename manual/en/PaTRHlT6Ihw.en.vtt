00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.419
- If you're into games and I feel like you

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.770
just might be if you're watching this

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.899
video right now.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:06.899
There's a good bet that

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.120
you know who Capcom is.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.000
Love them or hate 'em,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.559
they've created some pretty awesome

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.660
series over the last 25 years.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.030
^ Capcom's early years though we're fairly

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.070
^ mild before taking off with games that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.989
^ we all know like Megaman and Street Fighter.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.359
They put out some decent arcade

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.799
shoot-'em-ups that while not my favorite

00:00:23.799 --> 00:00:25.310
games ever were fairly popular.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.310
In this episode I'll

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.930
be taking a look at one of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.849
those arcade shoot-'em-ups a little game

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.540
known as Commando here in the US

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.900
and its two direct sequels that followed after.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.620
(Intro music)

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.230
Commando released in 1985 was Capcom's

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.539
first big hit.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.539
It was originally called

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.059
Wolf of The Battlefield in Japan but I'm

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.710
pretty sure that the name change was to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.390
capitalise on some of the action movies

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.440
of the mid 80s.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.720
Sure Commando had nothing to do with the

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.390
amazing Schwarzenegger film but I'm sure

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.890
Capcom wanted people to think that it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.830
to think that it did.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.500
This overhead running gun starred

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.360
Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson on a mission

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.399
to kill everyone in his path and destroy

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:22.770
the enemy bases.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.730
He's armed with two weapons,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.899
a machine gun and grenades.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.390
That's it.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.390
There's surprisingly no

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.130
power-ups at all in the entire game.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.140
These little blocks seem like they give

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.240
you something cool but nope is just more

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.999
grenades and those grenades

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:37.979
are super hard to use effectively.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.979
While you can shoot in

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.690
eight directions you can only throw

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.700
grenades straight ahead and the amount

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.259
of enemies and bullets you're dodging

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.210
makes it near impossible to line things

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.429
up correctly.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.429
Commando consists of two

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.070
missions with four levels each.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.330
After you finish all eight levels the whole thing

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.069
loops again with increased difficulty.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.990
It's a pretty straightforward affair.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.299
There's not even any bosses to take on.

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.459
^ Now commando was ported to a number of

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.619
^ different consoles and PCs with varying

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.690
^ level of success.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.690
^ Most people are

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.489
^ probably most familiar with the NES

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.229
^ version but I'd never played it until a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.288
^ recording video for this episode.

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:11.388
^ I'd only played the

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:12.879
^ Commodore 64 version for

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.860
^ the longest time which had the funkiest music.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.810
(Game music)

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.360
You'd think with Commando's success on

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.430
different platforms that Capcom would

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.190
hurry out a sequel well instead they

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.090
spun it off in

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.290
a completely different direction.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.270
In fact we wouldn't see a direct sequel

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.720
until 1990.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720
It was then that Capcom

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.700
decided to use the knowledge of four

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.590
years worth of intense arcade and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.240
console development to give us

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.470
Wolf of The Battlefield 2.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.960
Or as we know of it here in the US

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.530
Mercs.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.710
Now this is where things start

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.870
getting good.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.220
Super Joe was back,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.260
looking decidedly more badass than ever before.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.880
He's out to rescue the president with

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.710
the help of his two friends

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.090
Howard Powell and Thomas Clark.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.290
Together they are Wolfforce.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.480
(Laughs)

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.950
What an amazing name.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.950
That's right,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.330
this time you could be joined by two

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.459
other friends for up to three player

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.930
mayhem as you fight your way across

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.740
seven levels destroying everything in sight.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.710
Harrier jets?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.690
No problem.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.880
Battleships?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.580
Don't make me laugh.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.890
There's just tons of improvements.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.750
Different weapons like a spread shot

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.340
and grenade launcher

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.519
that could be individually powered up,

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.739
destructible environments,

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.750
a screen clearing smart bomb that would

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.550
kill all the weak enemies and do heavy

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.440
damage to the larger ones.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.070
You can even

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.530
hijack enemy vehicles like jeeps tanks,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.290
and boats for over-the-top carnage.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.770
This is all awesome

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.200
but let's face it there's

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.550
one improvement that made me

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.900
really happy.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.130
A life bar.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.140
How can something so simple be so revolutionary?

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.480
While running guns of the era,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.769
especially arcade ones,

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.270
were very reliant on the 1 hit death,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.130
Commando drove me

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.480
freaking crazy.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.840
This is so much better.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840
Now compared to the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.400
amount of ports that the first game got,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.670
Mercs only had a handful with the most

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.040
noteworthy one being on the Sega Genesis.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.140
First let's just get this right out of

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.269
the way the Genesis version is a one

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.390
player ordeal multiplayer is nowhere to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.900
be seen at all.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.360
At first you think this kind of

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.250
kills the whole point of the game but

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.220
then you dig a little deeper.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.310
What's this, original mode?

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.310
That's right the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.050
Genesis includes a whole different

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.260
single-player mode

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.790
that's kind of amazing.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.190
Original mode turns Mercs into a

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.070
kind of action RPG and I know that seems

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.510
like it would never work in a million

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.460
years but stick with me here.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.095
Joe starts out his mission alone,

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:44.940
but as you advance you'll run

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.350
into these shops and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.970
each of these shops you can buy speed

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.730
and firepower upgrades and refill your

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.870
energy if needed,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.520
but where this mode really shines

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.550
is that you can acquire

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.040
party members that you can swap between

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.140
as you advance.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.140
Each one has a different

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.690
weapon and specialty modeled after the

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.710
various guns you use

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.850
in the arcade mode.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.490
If one member is defeated you pick another.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And then when everybody is dead

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.280
then that's game over it's a pretty cool

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.255
approach for a game of this type.

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:13.370
Even cooler is that

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.760
each character has their

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.690
own stats you can upgrade over time.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.580
(Game music)

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.800
After Mercs the series would go in a

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.010
pretty serious hiatus.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.200
We're talking 18 years here.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.600
In 2008, Wolf of The Battlefield Commando 3

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.260
would be released on Xbox Live

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
and the PlayStation Network.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.680
Developed out of house

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.420
by the at times questionable,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.840
Backbone Entertainment,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.970
Commando 3 drops all connections to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.520
previous games in this series but sticks

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.670
pretty close to the execution of Mercs.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.729
The first thing you're going to notice

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.820
here is an awful art style.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.850
It looks like a flash

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.280
game from 2001.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280
The intro level

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.530
sets up things in an interesting way.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.030
You plow your way through enemy lines

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.710
and after defeating the boss the main

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.810
characters get captured.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.810
Then we jump about five

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.490
years into the future.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.169
The team is rescued from a prison camp

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.350
and forced to go on another mission.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.610
Some power-hungry

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.699
dictator?

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:12.699
Whatever.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:13.509
The biggest change to

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.320
the gameplay is that

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.880
now you shoot using the right stick on

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.830
the controller and as a big fan of twin

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.419
stick shooters this made me pretty happy.

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.460
It really helps the flow and finesse of

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.390
the action.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.320
If not making it

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
significantly easier overall.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.340
Unfortunately beyond that there's not

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.160
much in the way of

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.680
innovation here at all.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.030
While Mercs expanded on Commando's

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.370
formula a ton you'd certainly expect at

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.760
least a little bit more after

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.900
an 18-year gap right?

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.940
I mean, the weapons?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.940
Same.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.510
Power-ups?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.720
Same.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.080
Vehicles?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.750
Same.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.720
Makes you kind of wonder

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.370
why they even bothered.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.720
I honestly don't have a ton of love for

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.479
this series in general.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:52.479
I guess Mercs is

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.240
pretty fun especially the Genesis port.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.690
I honestly don't care

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.240
for the first game at all.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.570
Part 3 has its moments but it's fairly

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.479
soulless in the end.

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.479
But what I do have a

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.970
lot of love for the spin-off series that

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.070
took the focus off "Super Joe" and put

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.500
it on another Commando a bionic one.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.810
But I suppose that's a tale for another time.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.600
Thanks for watching.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.060
^ (Captions by Jordan "Link584")

00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:34.123
Wolf Force..

00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:37.840
Wolf Force!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.771
Wolf (coughs)
