Hello it's Super Mummy toys reviewer here

hello my little chickadees

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.540
and today I have something very special

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.080
the Scooby Doo Mystery Mates

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.719
so look at this one

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:15.632
and it says here

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:19.374
it's a Scooby Doo Scooby and Monster pack

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:21.721
and it has 5 figures in it

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:23.865
how fantastic is that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.600
and it's 3+

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.643
and it's very exciting and if you turn it around

00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:31.077
on the back here

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:35.123
it has the Mystery Mates which ones to collect

00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:39.352
and it lists them all, pictures of them and their names

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:42.229
and there's different Scooby Doo vehicles

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.920
and  it says vehicle &amp; figure packs also available

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340
so shall we open them?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.410
and get them out

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:53.253
okay so let's open the back here

00:00:56.642 --> 00:00:57.142
okay

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:00.835
I think I'm probably

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.105
going to open them up here

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.876
okay so first things first

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.860
we have

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.780
[gasps]

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.200
we have Sherlock Scooby

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:26.317
he's got the Sherlock Holmes

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:28.563
little jacket on

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:29.403
and the hat

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.211
his magnifying glass

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.760
Scooby: Hello

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.830
Scooby: Hello Super Mummy Toys

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.860
Hello Scooby Sherlock

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:40.597
are you on a secret detective mission?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.280
Scooby: Indeed I am

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.015
Scooby: I'm looking for Shaggy

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.392
Are you? Okay I'll help you find him

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.635
and then he's carrying his pipe

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.309
he's got a lovely suit, he looks very very smart

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:54.524
[wobble sound]

00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:56.863
there is his wibbly wobbly tail

00:01:57.296 --> 00:01:58.816
they're very well made

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.270
they're not flexible

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.710
so they don't move

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.378
but they're quite sturdy

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.722
and I think they're very well made

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:08.062
so we're going to boing him over

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.651
boing boing boing boing and we'll put him there

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:13.603

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:22.867
is Fred

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.878

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.420
and his muscles, wow

00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:33.574
Fred's got lots of muscles

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:35.904
and there's his blue trousers

00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:37.924

Aah, you're not going to scare us are you?

00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:00.078
Monster: [sniggers]

00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:01.860
Ha, he's actually friendly

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.775
Monster: No I'm not

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:04.060
I think you are friendly

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.509
Monster: Roarrrrrr

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.560
Ha ha

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.860
And this one's called Beast of the Bottomless Lake

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:12.731
wow, let's turn him around

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.407
and this one his arms move

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.360
boink boink

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:19.134
his legs don't move

00:03:19.995 --> 00:03:21.115
but his arms move

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.657
and he's got like a little mohican there

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.020
and he is a monster

00:03:27.092 --> 00:03:28.052
Monster: Roar

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:29.880
so let's boing him over to Fred

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.840
boing boing boing

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:34.302
there we go

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.780
and here we have Daphne

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:40.788
Daphne's very lovely isn't she

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:42.120
look how pretty she is

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.960
with her hair

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.849
and she's got a scarf as well and a lovely purple dress

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:47.713
and she's got her torch

00:03:47.806 --> 00:03:49.886
she's trying to look for people

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.140
boing her over, boing boing boing

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:56.016
and now we have

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.680
[whispers] this little fella

00:04:00.652 --> 00:04:01.212
grrrrrr

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.020
rarrrrrr

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.700
rarrrrrr

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.140
he he, and he's called

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.360
grrrr

00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:11.817
he's called Zombie

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.880
Zombie: I'm gonna come and get you, boink

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.540
ha ha

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.520
now him, his arms do move

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:22.475
but again his legs don't move

00:04:22.928 --> 00:04:24.768
but he's very funny isn't he

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:25.915
Zombie

00:04:26.047 --> 00:04:28.367
so that's those ones from that pack

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.558
so what I'll do is I'll move them all over this side

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:31.901
and then we'll open up the other pack

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:34.256
and this is exactly the same

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:36.005
the Mystery Mates

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:38.962
just it's another box

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.300
okay

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.419
so

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.800
first things first we have

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:52.607
Scooby, but just plain old Scooby

00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:54.484
not Sherlock Scooby, just plain old Scooby

00:04:54.484 --> 00:04:55.609
Scooby: [sniggers]

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040
Do you want some Scooby Snacks?

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.670
Scooby: Ruff

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.474
There you go, chuck you a Scooby Snack

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.553
Ah, he just eat some Scooby Snacks

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.800
so his arms don't really move

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.880
and his legs don't move

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.156
and his tail's quite sweet

00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:11.528
but none of his arms or legs move

00:05:12.122 --> 00:05:14.442
but he does have a magnifying glass

00:05:14.442 --> 00:05:15.761
and he looks very sweet

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.280

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.647
Super Mummy Toys just bibbed your nose

I love bibbing noses, bib bib bib

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.672
Scooby: Stop bibbing my nose

00:05:21.672 --> 00:05:24.028
Scooby: Can I have some Scooby Snacks?

00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:25.514
I haven't got any Scooby Snacks left

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:26.187
you just eat them all

00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:26.880
Scooby: [sobs]

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.860
let's boing him over to Fred

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.020

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.660
so next we have

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.200
this little fella

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.140
dun dun dun dun dun dun

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.660

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.600
and his arms do move

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:47.443
and again his legs don't

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.980
but he's very very sweet

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.240
so let's boing him over

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.180
to his friends

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.300
boing boing boing boing

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.740
and next we have

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.920
next we have Velma

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.720
Velma looks

00:06:08.126 --> 00:06:10.846
very, she looks a bit of a geek doesn't she

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:13.414
she's got her square glasses and her book

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.500
lovely orange jumper there

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.480
but Velma does not move

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.512
so her legs and arms don't move

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:21.561
but she's very good

00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.005
so let's boing her to Frankenstein

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:26.363
boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing boing

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:29.004
and next we have

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.240
Shaggy

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:37.677
[gasps]

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:39.853
and look how many beefburgers he's got

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.460
1, 2, 3, 4 beefburgers

00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.911
Scooby: Ruff

00:06:46.063 --> 00:06:48.463
Scooby, see now Scooby's heard food

00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:49.923
and now Scooby's trying to come over

00:06:50.158 --> 00:06:51.758
to eat Shaggy's burgers

00:06:53.307 --> 00:06:54.667
but he's quite sweet

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.040
he's got a little bit of beard going on there

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.751
with his lovely hair

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.589
his arms and legs don't move

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.084
but like I said at the beginning of the video

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:05.437
these little fellas are very well made

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.451
very sturdy

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.865
so let's put you there

00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:10.680
and then the last one okay

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.560
is the Creeper

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.050
so let's get the Creeper out

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.790
[gasps]

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.960
wow

00:07:22.202 --> 00:07:23.482
now his arms do move

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.577
but again his legs don't

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.050
but he's good isn't he

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.251
so that's the Creeper

00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:30.648
and we'll turn him around

00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:32.537
so you can have a little look

00:07:33.088 --> 00:07:34.688
so my little chickadees

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.620
leave me a comment and let me know

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.879
which one of these Scooby Doo characters

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.900
you like the best

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:44.751
my favourite one

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.404
has probably got to be

00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:47.848
Scooby on his own

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:49.404
so that one there

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:50.380
because I love Scooby

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.811
especially when he goes Scooby Snacks, ruff

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.110
he's very very sweet

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.323
