00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.880
Hello friends

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.960
It?€™s Xeo

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.560
This is the first vlog from MLG Columbus

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.760
We have just arrived at the hotel

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.840
This was a very difficult journey

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.480
Because as everyone knows

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.680
If you work or play for Na`Vi

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.320
Going to places isn?€™t a simple mission

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.360
Same happened again to us

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.040
Everything went as planned

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.360
Basically until we arrived in Boston

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.520
We flew from Kiev to Amsterdam

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.600
And from Amsterdam to Boston

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.720
And after that we needed to go to Columbus

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.520
But when we came to Boston

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.880
The great company ?€?Delta?€  delayed the flight

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.800
And then canceled it

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.080
This way we stayed in the airport for 2.5 hours

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.400
After that we took off to Atlanta

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.520
Another 3 hours and 20 minutes

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.040
We had only 20 minutes as transfer time

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.400
Because the flight was late

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.120
And then we came to Columbus

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.400
To sum it up

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.560
We wasted 25 hours on this journey

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.320
Including all the delays

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.120
And the transfer times

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000
Furthermore,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We came and 3 people of course lost their luggage

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
Because in these situations

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.240
This should happen

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.400
Unfortunately,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.120
I was one of the unfortunate people

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.600
So I?€™m sorry for the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080
?€?Talking head?€  recording

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.240
Hey V1lat

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.480
You should watch this blog

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.200
Because you aren?€™t here yet

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.080
And Kuroky with Puppey

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.600
Basically, we have just arrive

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.040
Everyone took a bath

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.280
Soon we will go to eat

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.320
Tomorrow in the morning the guys will play

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.720
At 5 PM local time

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.520
So we will all have a nap

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.600
Get used to the local time

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.440
And will be playing

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.280
I will probably wake up earlier

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.480
Go to the tournament place

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.760
And will record a video review

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.560
Of the place

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.480
Will look at the guys

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.160
And what?€™s going on there anyway

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Unfortunately,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.840
The internet is really bad in the hotel

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.600
You will watch this video in the evening

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.760
Of Thursday, if I?€™m not mistaken

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.920
So I hope that tomorrow

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.960
I will find better connection

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.800
And the videos will be uploaded faster

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.360
A few words about the hotel

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.760
It?€™s a good hotel

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.400
Let me show it to you now

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.040
Here is the hotel

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.680
We have a few doubles in the room

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.880
I?€™m lucky to be alone for now

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.240
Because ZeroGravity comes only later

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.400
That?€™s basically the whole deal

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.120
This is basically it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.320
From the players we have seen only ixmike

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.600
That didn?€™t realize what?€™s the weather is

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.680
With shorts and a jersey

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320
It?€™s about 5-6 Celsius outside

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.400
That?€™s the happy Crystal Maiden guy

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.040
That?€™s it
