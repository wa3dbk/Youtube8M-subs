00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:09.616
Today, we are baking the most simple and delicious apple tart ever.

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:13.897
A sweet pastry crust, homemade apple
 compote, well-arranged apples,

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:17.702
sugar, butter and
 an oven is all you need!

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:22.606
Spread 200g/7oz 
of homemade apple compote onto the base.

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:26.832
I made this one with cinammon and vanilla.
  It adds a richer flavour,

00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:30.971
and makes it soft and creamy.

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:34.061
Peel 4 apples.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.887
Remove the bottom stem end and 
peel from top to bottom.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:45.849
Cut in half and core.

00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:52.215
Now cut the halves into thin and even slices.

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:57.032
The taste of tart actually varies
depending on the thickness of the slices.

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.154
Arrange the slices in a circle.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:04.133
Place them nice and close together  
as you need to add quite a lot of slices.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.644
Arrange the slices all the way around
forming a pretty sun shape.

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:13.499
To finish off the circle, lift the first slice
and slide the last one underneath.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:17.318
Place apples pieces in the middle.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:19.432
And form another circle on top.

00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:23.084
Add 2 slices on top in the middle.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:28.175
Brush 20g/2 T. of melted butter 
to moisten the slices.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:33.891
Sprinkle with brown sugar, depending 
on the sweetness of the apples, then bake.

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.325
So for how long are we going to bake it?

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:38.741
We preheated the oven at 170°C/330°F 
and we're going to cook it for 1 hour.

00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.961
The trick to make a good apple tart is to cook it
 slowly so the apples are soft and candied.

00:01:44.694 --> 00:01:48.802
The tart is now cooked and still warm.

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:50.822
The apples are candied.

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:55.880
I really like the idea of adding a little sugar,
 making the top of the tart slightly crispy.

00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:58.205
And the butter that softens the apples underneath.

00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:04.311
Apple tart: 1 sweet pastry crust, 200g/7oz of apple compote, 4 apples, 20g/2 tablespoons of butter, brown sugar.
