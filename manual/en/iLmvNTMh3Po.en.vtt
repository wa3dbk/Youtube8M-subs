00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.490
White wedding flowers.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.940
There is such a wide array of white that's
available really all year round that certainly

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.799
you can count on white in any season.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.450
The trick is to open your mind a little bit
and to consider also ivory shades and to consider

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.509
white in all its various hues.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.890
Sometimes I have a bride who will come to
me and actually have a swatch.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.070
She'll have a swatch of either her dress or
a bridesmaid dress, particularly when it comes

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.339
to white and wanting to match white flowers
with a white piece of fabric or a white ribbon.

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.339
It's never a good idea.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:51.469
The best idea is to try and have white flowers
with a dress that's not actually white.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.940
If you have a wedding dress that's ivory and
you have white, white flowers, the flowers

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.860
are going to look more bright white than your
dress and vice versa.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.150
If you have a very bright white dress, you
can have flowers that really range in flowers

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.630
from white to ivory.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
If you're interested in matching exactly,
you're going to be disappointed.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
To be open to the possibility that flowers
come in their natural state in a whole wide

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.430
range of white colors and to have a bouquet
that is going to be a range of those whites,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.210
a range of ivories.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.560
It also gives it a little more texture.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.780
Another thing to consider with white flowers,
particularly in terms of bouquets, is that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.280
it's a really nice idea to add some pop of
some color, again, to give it more texture,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.310
to make the bouquet a little more vibrant,
and to break up the space a little bit.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.910
Certainly with centerpieces this is also helpful.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.689
Consider for an all-white, monochromatic look
adding a little bit of purple, a little bit

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.210
of grey, maybe a little bit of brown, something
to give it just a little bit of pop of something.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.400
I think you'll be really pleased, even more
pleased than say with a totally monochromatic

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.549
spectrum for the white.
