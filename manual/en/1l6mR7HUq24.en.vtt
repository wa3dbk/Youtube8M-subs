00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:06.640
A major announcement from Sony is expected
after leaked photos showed what is believed

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.250
to be a controller for the highly-anticipated
PlayStation 4.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.350
The console has not yet been officially announced,
but this is a look at one of the snapshots.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.090
The controller looks similar to past versions,
but reports say a couple tweaks have been

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.090
made.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.250
“One of the biggest and most obvious changes
in the alleged photo is the addition of what

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.190
seems to be a touchscreen interface … the
rumored PS4 controller will also have a loudspeaker

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.830
in the center of the controller, directly
above the PlayStation logo.”

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.309
Sony released a video in late January which
helped kickstart many rumors about a new PlayStation

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.579
device, suggesting the company would have
a big announcement on February 20..

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.050
Owners of previous Playstation consoles might
be in for another surprise.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.780
The Sociable notes discs from previous consoles
won’t work with the new device, but...

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.600
“Instead, backwards compatibility will be
delivered using a streaming service whereby

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.600
games are delivered in real-time over the
internet from remote servers.”

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.449
According to CNET, competition from from other
game consoles is no matter.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.949
The PS4 will have to prove its worth over
earlier Playstation devices, most notably

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.949
the PS3.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.079
“The PlayStation 3 has matured into a fantastic
gaming system.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.520
At first, there weren't many exclusive titles
for the system to brag about, but fast-forward

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.170
nearly six years and it's the PS3 that's the
one to beat.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.960
Sony must maintain this luxury into the next
generation.”

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.299
But a blogger for Attack of the Fanboy — a
site dedicated to all things gaming — takes

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.619
it back even further, claiming the PS2 was
the company’s last great console.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.860
“The [PS2] is like the Volkswagen Beetle
of gaming consoles … Go to any retail game

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.250
shop for new and used games and the library
of PS2 titles is far bigger than PS3.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.100
… Gamers want games, plain and simple.”

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.039
So, how much will the device set you back?

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.590
A writer for The Salt Lake Tribune doesn’t
expect it to be as high as the initial price

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.590
for the PS3.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.719
“I can’t imagine it costing more than
$400 or less than $300.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.479
Sony made the mistake of overpricing its PlayStation
3 system when it was first released in 2006,

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.119
at $600.”

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.729
If you never got the chance to buy a PS3,
the Christian Science Monitor has some good

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.729
news for you.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.700
They report a new gaming console will cause
the price of the older console to drop by

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.930
more than 60 percent, according to some forecasts.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.340
None of the information released about the
PS4 has been confirmed by Sony.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
The company will hold a press conference Wednesday
in New York City.
