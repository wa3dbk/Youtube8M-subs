00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.820
All right, here are some tricks of the trade,
shortcuts, call them whatever you want but

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.070
they're really going to help you out in fashion
design.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.560
First thing is always have a good croquis
that you've developed, okay?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.730
That's what's going to make everything easier
when you're sketching your clothes.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.659
I'm just going to sketch and talk through
this but, one thing is, you never want to

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.119
start with pen, unless you're really confident.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.989
You always want a good mechanical pencil.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.320
You start your sketch in pencil; you know
you can just always go in and erase the pencil.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
I'm going to do like a gown with a train here.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:53.059
I have my little croquis underneath so that's
helping me out, making it go real fast.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.390
And another thing that you want to always
have on hand, because even if after you've

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.239
inked in your sketch, is whiteout.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510
Whiteout is a great thing.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.120
It will never show up on a scan when you finally
scan the finished product into your computer,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.550
because you can then print it out and have
a gorgeous, clean version; that's another

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.550
trick.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.140
So do your sketch, you scan it in, you lose
all the whiteout and whatever else you've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.860
done to it; even if you've done patchwork
or what have you, you'll never know.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.680
Photoshop is a good trick for coloring things
in, though I don't use it, I'm kind of old-fashioned

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.290
that way.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.880
You know you really don't have to draw hair.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.880
Hair is not that important.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.570
You don't have to draw hands if you don't
want to; it's not about the hands.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
You want a good eraser because you are going
to mess up, I promise.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.970
A definite don't is do not ink until you're
ready because you don't want to have to redraw

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.970
something.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.530
Especially if you have a client sitting right
beside you; they're not going to want to sit

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.220
there and watch you draw it all over again.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.740
Another great thing is to have a sketching
kit that you can pretty much take with you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.300
wherever you go because you never know when
you're going to get inspired to do what you're

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300
going to do.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
You want to have it on-hand so that you get
that idea right out of your head before it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
gone.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.810
It's happened to me a million times and I
learned my lesson.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
Once I'm happy with the sketch, I will usually
go in and give it some ink.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.870
And even at this point, you still can ink
in the sketch and not worry about the pencil;

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.960
that's what erasers are for, it's no big deal.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.860
So here we go.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.170
And try to keep your lines smooth and beautiful.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.840
And don't be fazed if they break because that
just adds some dimension and what not, "character"

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.260
we'll call it.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.370
She's in a long cap sleeve gown.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:00.210
I'm really into like elongating the body with
seam lines; that's one of my things.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.350
And even if you don't go straight over your
pencil lines, just kind of go with the flow;

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.640
let your body feel it as you go.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.290
Don't over think it; that's a big no-no.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:24.600
Give it some bead work.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.180
And like you know, even if you're drawing
lace, if you're drawing a plaid, what have

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.730
you, as long as you have a piece of the fabric
on the same page, it really could just be

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.459
a little squiggle on the sketch; it's not
really meant to be that literal.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.780
Don't get too hung up on those details.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.450
Because it's all about giving the notion of
what the finished product is going to be and

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.160
showing who you're making it for, or who you're
trying to get your point across to, right

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.160
there and then.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.300
Those are some of the tricks of the trade,
shortcuts, et cetera.
