00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.000
ASSEMBLY

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Assembly of your new AT Gold is very simple.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First, select the upper and lower stem assembly. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Holding it in front of you, select the lower camlock, the one closest to the stem assembly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Twist the lower camlock CLOCKWISE to loosen it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Then, loosen the upper camlock by twisting it COUNTER-CLOCKWISE. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Depress the spring clips to extend the shaft.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Next, press the two mounting washers firmly into place in the openings at the base of the lower stem.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Slide the searchcoil onto the stem and insert the threaded bolt through the holes on the lower stem and searchcoil. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Hand-tighten the searchcoil assembly with the wing nut.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Loosen and remove the upper camlock collar.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Slide it over the S-stem’s spring clips. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Next, depress the spring clip in the S-stem and insert the control housing’s S-stem through the upper camlock into the upper stem. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It is important to engage the spring clip into the FIRST stem opening in order to maintain battery compartment access. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Hand-tighten the camlock collar, being careful not to overtighten.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Depress the spring clip in the lower stem and adjust to the most comfortable operating length. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then, hand-tighten the lower stem camlock collar. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Wrap the cable snugly around the stem with the first turn of the cable going over the stem.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Insert the searchcoil connector into the 4-pin connector on the LEFT side of the control housing. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Notice the pin orientation of the connector before attempting to insert it. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It’s important to fully insert the connector to ensure proper connecting and sealing. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Then, thread the collar into place until it is hand-tight. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(If the O-ring is properly seated, the connector’s collar can be easily tightened; 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
if this collar is difficult to turn, the O-ring has not seated properly.)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The AT Gold’s headphones connect on the RIGHT side of the control housing. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Notice that this is a 2-pin connector which also must be aligned properly. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Again, push the connector fully into place before tightening the collar. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Secure the headphone cable under the arm cuff by pressing it into the headphone cable clip.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
POWERING ON

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
To power on the AT Gold, press the Power button in the bottom left corner. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
To turn off the detector, press and hold this button for one second....until the detector makes a second beep.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
When you have changed detector settings and wish to restore the AT Gold to its factory settings, 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
press and hold the power button for 5 seconds...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
waiting until the detector produces a fast double beep).

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
TARGET ID AND DEPTH INDICATION

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
All metal items encountered by the AT Gold are referred to as targets. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Garrett’s exclusive Target ID technology provides two indicator scales to help identify targets. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The Lower Scale is the AT Gold’s discrimination pattern setting. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
These dark segments on the lower scale indicate what targets your detector will sound on.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And, when it sounds, a single segment will appear on this Upper Scale to show what you have found.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The Target ID legend just above will then help you to identify the target.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Ferrous, or iron, targets will indicate on the left side.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Non-ferrous targets that are thin or that have low conductivity will indicate in the middle.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Thick or high conductivity targets, such as thick silver, will indicate toward the right.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
There are 20 upper scale graphic segments for Target ID. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
When the AT Gold is switched into its Discrim 2 Mode, notice that some of the lower scale segments disappear.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The AT Gold will now only sound on targets represented by the remaining segments.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But, you will still see a Target ID cursor for every metallic target you find—

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
including your discriminated targets.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The AT Gold’s Digital Target ID system also provides a specific target value 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to help identify targets more precisely. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Targets are identified on the LCD by number, with items with lower numbers being the most ferrous.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The most conductive targets (such as thick silver) register toward the high end of the scale.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The Digital Target ID is a more precise version of the Target ID Cursor seen in the Upper Scale.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Notice as I pass this gold nugget in front of the searchcoil. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The Digital Target ID for this nugget reads between 51 and 53.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Each Target ID Cursor above it has a width of 5 digital points, 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so you notice that the Target ID Cursor is under the number “50” 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
when the Digital Target ID reads 51 or 53. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This system, used in conjunction with the audio target signals, provides you with more information.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It is important to understand that the AT Gold’s detection depth can exceed Target ID depth.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
In other words, you will sometimes hear faint, deeper targets that do not provide any Target ID.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Target values can vary based upon the orientation of the target in the ground, 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the amount of ground mineralization and other factors.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It is important to practice in the field to learn how these factors affect Target ID.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This depth scale will indicate how deeply you’ll have to dig to recover any coin-sized target that you find.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
SENSITIVITY

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Your AT Gold has eight settings for sensitivity. 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
User higher sensitivity settings for very small or very deep targets.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Use lower sensitivity levels in locations where the detector is behaving erratically. 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Several factors can cause your detector to appear to behave erratically: 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
outside electrical interference, 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
highly mineralized soil, 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
excessive metallic trash, or the presence of other metal detectors. 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Often these interferences can be resolved with proper ground balance, discrimination, or by changing frequencies

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
—without having to reduce sensitivity.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
FREQUENCY ADJUSTMENT

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The AT Gold is capable of operating at four slightly different frequencies 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in order to minimize the interference from electrical sources, 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
such as power lines, or from other metal detectors.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Sometimes if you’re hunting in a gold patch, you may want to get in real close proximity to one of your other hunting buddies. 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
With some machines, you’re not able to do that real well because of electrical interference or interference from another machine.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
But with the AT Gold, you can overcome that with the frequency adjust. 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
In this case, we’re getting a lot of feedback from each other. 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I simply hit the Frequency button and find a frequency where it calms down. 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
There’s four adjustable frequencies to select from. 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.266
And now we’re able to hunt in close proximity.
