00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:02.477
[ No audible dialogue ]

00:00:02.477 --> 00:00:03.753
 

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:07.699
My passion is designing things,
and designing spaces.

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:11.745
My workday starts the night before
when I'm thinking about my designs,

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.665
when I'm trying to figure out
the little details of my design in my head.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:21.754
The next morning, first thing I want to do
is ride my bike up here and just be in the space

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.839
early morning, sketching;

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.389
putting those ideas I had the night before down on paper.

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.651
I feel so inspired just being in here

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:34.236
seeing the early morning sunlight
coming through the windows.

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:36.203
It's not so much about walls,

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:38.492
it's not so much about confinement,

00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:41.317
it's about openness and inspiration.

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:46.900
 

00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:52.500
In the 20th century much work 
was defined by building islands of specialization.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.537
The 21st century is defined by
building bridges between those islands.

00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:04.010
The Mountaintop Experience really exemplifies
how these bridges are being built

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.181
and how we might see solutions developed in the future.

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.305
 

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.593
The classic problems that we have
these days of the 21st century

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:16.147
really demand perspectives from different groups;

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:18.942
from engineers, from physicists, from chemists.

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:19.995
 

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:24.449
When I came here I thought, as a mechanical engineer, 
I would be taught from start to finish

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.852
why different things function.

00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:33.725
Lehigh, up to this point, has done a very good job
at giving me the tools to learn those things,

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:38.596
but the Mountaintop Project 
has given me a chance to apply what I learned.

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.341
 

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:44.889
As a product designer, my passions lie 
in combining art, science, and technology

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:48.803
to create products that are innovative and ergonomic.

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:51.471
Having that background and that discipline,

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:54.759
I look to apply that to the things 
I was really passionate about,

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.992
which was fashion.

00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:58.844
This program allows you to 
take what you learn in the classroom

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:03.552
and apply it in a way that you're able
to really fall in love with your project.

00:02:05.336 --> 00:02:07.612
There wasn't someone telling you
you had to be here at a certain time

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:09.864
or that class is from this time to this time.

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:11.405
You learn how to be a leader,

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.938
you learn how to get things from people
without telling them what to do

00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:15.916
and making sure they feel
just as much a part of the process

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:18.261
as you would like to feel a part of the process.

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.443
You're basically learning how to
do things on your own and be independent.

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:27.500
I think sometimes being in the traditional classroom
you're not necessarily given those opportunities.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.092
I think programs like The Mountaintop Program

00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:32.284
are really the next step.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.912
I see Lehigh seems to really be pursuing that

00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:37.216
with the Technical Entrepreneurship Masters program,

00:02:37.216 --> 00:02:41.843
with programs that really focus
on this element of explorative learning.

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:42.910
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.797
When I first heard of it I was really nervous 
because I wasn't sure about the expectations.

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:51.933
At the same time it was exciting 
because it's like our options are limitless;

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:54.843
you're like the master of your own fate,

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:55.759
 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.005
Lehigh students are brilliant.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:01.945
What we may or could be developing at Mountaintop, open the door and really force the door open

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:04.671
for students at Lehigh to take more responsibility

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:05.907
and be more creative.

00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:06.544
 

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:10.045
Being guided through some 
open ended problems before you graduate,

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:18.229
I think, is an essential part of 
what we consider a University education.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:21.020
It was freeing after a while

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.561
because we could use our advisers for support,

00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:26.692
we could use them to give us resources, 
give us suggestions and hear our ideas,

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:30.068
but we were the ones that were guiding
our own project and our own education really.

00:03:30.068 --> 00:03:32.025
 

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:34.400
In many ways it's an entrepreneurial experience.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.287
You're striking out on your own
with new ideas and projects.

00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:43.540
You really do have to feel out a lot of options for yourself
to realize that maybe what you originally set out for

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.290
is not obtainable,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.599
but there is something much better on the other side.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.976
They have the impetus to work on their own project,

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:56.127
create their own ideas, 
and take that where it's going to go.

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:58.555
It's research, and it's ongoing research.

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:03.081
If we knew where we're going to end
then it wouldn't be quite so interesting.

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:04.794
They have time to think.

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:06.672
They work problems out,

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:09.078
or if it doesn't work you can test new ideas.

00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:09.925
 

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:15.265
There is a sort of intimacy that you gain with the
project and a perspective that you get from the project

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:19.950
when you are always continuously focusing on it.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.065
It's always on your mind.

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:22.974
 

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:26.808
Prior to the Mountaintop Project 
I realized that I had a passion for design

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:33.837
but I wasn't sure how I could 
incorporate that to my curricular activities.

00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:36.250
Once I had participated in the Mountaintop Project

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.506
I found that missing link.

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:41.714
This project taught me how to 
look at it from another perspective.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.517
 

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:46.042
It's really wonderful to have the freedom
that I've had with the Mountaintop Project.

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.363
I can come in here anytime I want,

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:50.120
anytime I feel inspired.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.132
 

00:04:51.132 --> 00:04:54.407
We're creating something 
that's totally new to any university.

00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:55.878
 

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.990
In the world that we live in today,
you have to have room to be able to explore.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.085
You're giving students like myself opportunities to 
tap into things that they probably could not have before

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:07.119
or they didn't have the resources to before,

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:11.736
and just pushing the envelope when it comes to
what the traditional educational process looks like.

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:12.517
 

00:05:12.517 --> 00:05:17.351
This type of project just changed
the way I looked at education and schooling

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.571
and what it means to have a project.

00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:21.643
It wasn't something we were doing for a grade,

00:05:21.643 --> 00:05:24.304
it was something we were doing because
we thought we could make a difference

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:27.684
and we knew we had the skills to make it happen.

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:29.557
 

00:05:29.557 --> 00:05:31.651
I'm doing the things that I would want to do.

00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:35.298
I know that this experience
brings me closer to my life goals.

00:05:35.298 --> 00:05:36.832
 

00:05:36.832 --> 00:05:38.623
I definitely feel a lot more secure.

00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:42.191
Now I feel a lot more focused 
in what I actually want to do.

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.643
I can tell people I want to work in documentary film.

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:45.606
 

00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:47.725
Being part of the Mountaintop Program at Lehigh

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:52.368
allowed me to be in an environment
where I can be innovative,

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:55.448
be in an environment where I can think differently,

00:05:55.448 --> 00:06:01.104
and where I can apply different disciplines
to something that I am passionate about.

00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:04.034
The Mountaintop Project has given me that entrepreneurial spirit.

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:05.114
 

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:09.674
I can tell you right at the top of my resume 
it's going to say "Xiphias Project - Mountaintop."

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:13.879
That's what I believe is the number one 
differentiator between students from other schools.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.547
It's because they don't have
opportunities presented like this

00:06:16.547 --> 00:06:19.707
forcing you to be resourceful,
forcing you to be innovative.

00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:24.164
Those are definitely core qualities 
of the Mountaintop experience.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:31.230
