00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:15.770
[GUITAR MELODY]

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.014
JASON CHARLES MILLER:
[SINGING]

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:20.750
Well, I was driving home with my
brand new TV sitting in the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.622
back of my F-150, when
a driver waved me to

00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:30.068
the side of the road.

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.690
Armed with pistols and an angry
gleam, she was the girl

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.984
of my dreams.

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:37.353
FELICIA DAY: [SINGING]

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:41.904
On my way to a con, wearing Lara
Croft cosplay, broke down

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:47.295
ride causing lame-sauce delay,
needing help when a cowboy

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:54.470
pulled over for me, with a ten
gallon hat and a 60-inch

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.068
screen, he was the
boy of my dreams.

00:00:59.068 --> 00:00:59.396
BOTH: [SINGING]

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:05.490
Gamer Girl, Country Boy, hoping
our love survives.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.936
Couldn't let you go,
even though we come

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.406
from different lives.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.358
So when you're looking for
love, open your eyes.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.816
It might be out of
regular sight.

00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:24.756
Remember, Gamer Girls and
Country Boys are all right.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.064
FELICIA DAY: [SINGING]

00:01:31.064 --> 00:01:34.820
Never thought a dude who doesn't
own a console, no

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.923
Twitter account and talks with
a slow drawl, could turn my

00:01:38.923 --> 00:01:41.869
head, never ever been
attracted to newbs.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:51.954
His password's "abc123" but
he's the one I need.

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:52.150
JASON CHARLES MILLER:
[SINGING]

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.606
Well, I don't care why she
likes to wear elf ears,

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:59.312
M-M-O-R-G-P, that don't
mean a thing to me.

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:01.610
Loves to watch sci-fi.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.810
Me?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.370
I'm an Eastwood guy.

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:11.187
The sound of a honky-tonk makes
her scream, but she's

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.682
the one I need.

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:14.014
BOTH: [SINGING]

00:02:14.014 --> 00:02:20.169
Gamer Girl, Country Boy, hoping
our love survives.

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:25.159
Couldn't let you go,
even though we come

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.155
from different lives.

00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:31.147
So when you're looking for
love, open your eyes.

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:34.640
It might be out of
regular sight.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.626
Remember Gamer Girls and Country
Boys are all right.

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:42.022
JASON CHARLES MILLER:
[SINGING]

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:45.360
My mama's brisket
can't be beat.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.729
FELICIA DAY: [SINGING]

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.818
That's cool, all I know
is how to reheat.

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:49.210
JASON CHARLES MILLER:
[SINGING]

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.770
I never miss an Ole Miss game.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.139
FELICIA DAY: [SINGING]

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.228
That's OK, I'll just
hit the arcade.

00:02:56.228 --> 00:02:56.392
BOTH: [SINGING]

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:59.192
To some, it might
seem strange.

00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:02.650
But there's nothing about
you I'd change.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.330
One thing we both wanna arrange:
getting married on

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.730
the shooting range!

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.630
Gamer Girl, Country Boy,
plenty ask us why.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.930
Two of us, meant to be, wouldn't
think it'd fly.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.130
So when you're looking for
love, open your eyes.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.130
It might be out of
regular sight.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.530
Remember, Gamer Girls and
Country Boys, Gamer Girls and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.330
those Country Boys.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.430
Remember Gamer Girls and Country
Boys are all right.
