00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.790
What I'm finding in the lateral surface of
the gastrocnemius muscle over here, which

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.360
is the large muscle of the calf, is a taught
band of muscle. In fact you can almost see

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:31.060
that muscle spring away from my hand. I'm
going to seek a trigger point. Sometimes you

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.329
might hit it initially and it's very sharp.
To reposition your hands so you're very secure

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.999
on the spot you'll have to come back around
and find it again. Sometimes it's not as sharp.

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:55.890
Now frequently you won?t get as strong a response
as that, but if you do it's okay. Reassure

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.530
your client that you're doing what you need
to and reposition your hand and find the spot

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.280
and apply the pressure.
You can ask them what level of discomfort

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.850
using a scale from one to ten. So client what
are we experiencing here? It's actually comfortable

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:33.140
say a six. Okay. Alright. Sometimes trigger
points are mildly sensitive and sometimes

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:44.230
they are very sensitive. Once again I might
repeat that two or three times. I'm applying

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:53.070
a little more pressure. What this does is
it releases the fibers that are right there

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:04.770
under your thumb. It puts the muscle into
a stretch and it communicates to the muscle

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020
that it can relax.
