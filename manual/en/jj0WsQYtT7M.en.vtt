00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980
[Narrator] Weather forecasters use them to create the nightly weather report. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.980
Airline pilots use them to learn how to fly planes. Experts use them in virtually every

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.980
industry and discipline. They are computer models. At NASA, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.980
scientists use computer models to enhance their understanding of the earth, the solar system

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.980
and the universe. NASA satellites orbiting the earth

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.980
relay immense amounts of data to scientists on the ground, who then enter that data

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.980
into computer model simulations. [Cynthia Rosenzweig] We have then, equations and then

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.980
computer code which solves those equations on a day-to-day basis.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.980
[Narrator] NASA is the source for most of the research satellite observations of the atmosphere,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.980
land and oceans. [Phil Webster] So the NASA scientists will look at the observational data and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.980
make theoretical projections about what a model might look like and they will build a numerical model

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.980
based on the data and then run that on our computers and compare that to reality.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.980
[Narrator] With rapid increases in computer technology, models are becoming 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.980
evermore powerful and sophisticated, allowing us to simulate our complex environment in greater detail.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.980
NASA uses a variety of weather models such as the Goddard Earth Observing System model.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.980
It creates an extraordinarily high resolution, realistic-looking 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.980
image of our atmosphere. These GEOS-5 simulations showcase the model's 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.980
ability to capture fine-scale cloud features worldwide, like the swirling clouds in the Atlantic

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.980
Ocean off the coast of North America. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.980
The goal of weather models is to give the most accurate prediction of weather in the next week to ten days.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.990
In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina formed over the Atlantic Ocean, scientists

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.990
wanted to understand the storm. How intense was it, what was its size and structure and what 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.990
would be its final path? NASA satellites continuously monitored many aspects of the storm

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.990
from windspeed, rainfall and sea surface temperature to the storm's three-dimensional structure.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.990
To get a more complete picture of the storm and predict its evolution, scientists entered

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.990
the data into a computer model. Then, high-powered supercomputers capable of trillions of calculations

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.990
per second crunched the numbers. This process is called data assimilation.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.990
Data assimilation is a two-step cycle that repeats itself whenever new data becomes available. 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.990
In the first step, the model runs forward in time to provide an estimate of the atmosphere. In the second

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.990
step, this estimate gets corrected using observations. The cycle begins again, each step

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.990
building upon the last and accumulating the information from satellite and ground observations.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.990
Weather models are updated every six hours to include the most current observations for the next forecast.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.990
This approach prevents the model from straying too far from reality and acts as a checks-and-balance system

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.990
to acheive the most accurate forecast. While weather models predict

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.990
conditions for up to ten days, climate models predict trends over much longer periods of time.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.990
[Phil Webster] The climate models that are run at the NCCS are numerical expressions of the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.990
various processes that make up climate. This includes things like land surface, 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.990
water in the ocean and the movement of air in the atmosphere. [Narrator] Just as in weather prediction, 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.990
data assimilation is a way of bringing all the observations of the earth together to provide an analysis of our climate

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.990
. One example of this technique is MERRA - the Modern Era Retrospective Analaysis for Research

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.990
and Applications. MERRA incorporates data from the entire satellite record.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.990
Over 30 years of data. Its results are a data encyclopedia that can be used for research and

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.990
analysis. MERRA can help meteorologists understand the variations associated with specific 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.990
weather events in the past. While MERRA gives us a climate picture across decades, the Goddard Institutde

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.990
for Space Studies, or GISS, can extend that view across centuries. GISS models 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.990
have already unraveled average temperature trends over 200 years. New GISS simulations will cover the last

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.990
1,000 years to verify model accuracy. They'll also look forward, projecting climate

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.990
trends to the end of the 21st century. With each satellite launched, we gain billions of measurements

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.990
that tell us more about our planet. Having so much more data will require increases in

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.990
computing power to synthesize this information into meaningful representations of the climate system as a whole.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.990
[Phil Webster] At Goddard Space Flight Center, we have a tremendous amount of observational data,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.990
captured by our satellites. We have probably the largest collection of earth scientists

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.990
in the world. And we have this new state-of-the-art computing center. So the combination of

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.990
the scientists, data and computing puts us in a unique position to enable

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:41.980
advances in weather and climate research.
