00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.660
Right now, in the last

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.950
5-6 years of this program,
basically a hundred percent of my students over

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.469
the first five years are working

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.679
or could be working. The unions right now know

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.770
people left on their list, they're trying
to get students

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.890
encouraged to finish and join the union and go to work. Whether it's Chevron coming up or Long Harbor right now.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.300
And there's a lot of companies in St. John's right now who got a waiting list out on my wall, wanting

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.940
students as soon as they finish program.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.739
Actually the Sheet Metal Worker Program is only one spot in the province that it's offered,

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.299
in this campus right here, is the only place set up to

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.760
even do the blocks. Unique to this area and I guess that's the reason why a lot of the students

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.110
are getting work. Opportunities are there because not a lot of numbers coming

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.579
out right now but a lot of people
waiting for them.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.760
The Sheet Metal Program here, it's a 9 month program,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.879
starts in September each year. 9 months and you go out and

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.149
get a job after you complete the program.
It's got block training after you get your hours

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.289
and become an apprentice. You come back, do your block 2 and eventually red seal. Is what everyone is striving for, right?

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.360
Anybody that's got a high school diploma can do a Sheet Metal Program.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.820
It's all, if you like hands on, it's hands on. There's still book work involved, there's

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.020
a combination of both but it's not something that's cut out

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.740
just for females, just for males, certainly
there's no

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.180
nothing there that discriminates against anybody. It's work that any

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
student can do or older person. We're after a lot of people that are older enter the program even, right?

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.520
There wasn't many females in the course and they are starting to get their

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.930
foot in the door as far as trades.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200
So it's a great opportunity right now
basically, especially for a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.009
female. As soon as you start, it's a job, it's just about guaranteed.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.040
The nicest point is probably going to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.429
be able to work in town. There's lots of jobs that's available and I'll be able to work where I'm from, in my hometown.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.720
There is opportunities for me to leave but

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
it's nice to know that I already have a job if I wanted to stay in my hometown.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.880
Burin is the only campus in Newfoundland that hosts

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.509
the Sheet Metal course. Definitely take a chance and try it out.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.819
It's something I went in, you know, without having

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.319
a clue about but I come out, learning
fairly quickly and fairly educated in it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.940
and you'll find that there's something for everybody, in interest to be able to do it.
