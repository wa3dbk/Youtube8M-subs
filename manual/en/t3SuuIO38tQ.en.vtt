Hi, I’m Helen from eSpares.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.620
In this video I’m going to show you how
to replace the mains power cable on this Vax

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.710
6131.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
Now you may have damaged the cable if you
have yanked too hard, of if you wrap it round

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.270
the machine to store it, this can also damage
the cable.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.890
You can use any flex but we do recommend that
you use the genuine Vax replacement.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.050
Now, safety first.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.760
Always make sure you are switched off from
the mains before you start any work.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.060
I’m going to firstly remove the top of the
machine, as this is the part I need to work

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.060
on.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.920
I’m going to start by removing the old cable.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.780
To do this, I need to remove this cover, which
is held in place by one screw.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.620
Now with the cover off, you can see that the
cable is held in place by this cable guard,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.140
which is held in place by two screws.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.140
So I’m just going to remove them.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.479
So the cable guard just pulls out and up.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.020
And comes away.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.439
And all that remains is to undo these two
wires from the terminal block.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.530
Now it’s very simple wiring, but here at
eSpares we have a rule that we take a picture

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.440
of any wiring, so that we can always re-wire
it exactly as we found it.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:41.520
Right, so now, I just need to remove the cable
collar from the old cable and put it onto

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.790
the new cable.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:56.509
And then, I just need to re-wire it and put
everything back together.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.509
There we go.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.970
That’s just how easy it is to replace the
power cable on a Vax 6131.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.700
Power cables for all makes and model of vacuum
cleaner are available at the eSpares website.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.760
Thanks for watching.
