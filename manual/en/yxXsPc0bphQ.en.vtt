00:00:01.516 --> 00:00:14.896
[MUSIC]

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:17.496
Alright, why statistics?

00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:20.376
Statistics: the practice
of science of collecting

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:22.546
and analyzing numerical
data in large quantities.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.096
Why study statistics at all?

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.396
Why do we have a federal
statistical system?

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:28.516
Why a Census Bureau?

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:29.976
What, what good is statistics?

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:31.096
[HMMM]

00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:34.336
To answer this question, let's
first talk about something else.

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.976
Why a microscope?

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:37.566
[BOING]

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.816
Well, a microscope is used
for studying things that are -

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.736
as the name may imply
- microscopic.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:44.476
Microscopic: so small or
fine as to be invisible

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:46.706
or indistinguishable without
the use of a microscope.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:48.656
You need to look at something
that's really, really tiny,

00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:49.986
too small for your eye to see.

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.436
And you blow it up to
a screen about yea big.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.206
This turns out to be
really, really handy.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:58.086
If you want to study cells,
for example, like bacteria.

00:00:58.086 --> 00:00:59.486
You want to understand
food poisoning?

00:00:59.486 --> 00:01:00.506
You want to understand disease?

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.446
You want to understand
how viruses spread?

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:04.426
You've got to actually be able
to look at them, to see them.

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:07.086
If you can understand how big
they are, how small they are,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.016
what their shapes are,
what their form is;

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:11.716
if you can get the form
you can get the function

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.236
and you can get some
understanding.

00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:15.976
You want to build a microchip,
you need a microscope.

00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:17.166
[TRUMPETING SUCCESS]

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.316
Now, that means that a
microscope is really,

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.266
really useful for looking at
things that are too small.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.756
Now, let's consider
the kinds of questions

00:01:25.756 --> 00:01:27.716
that we answer with statistics.

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:32.756
We talk about things like the
population of the United States.

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:34.006
The population of
the United States.

00:01:34.106 --> 00:01:38.836
In 2010, there were 308 million
people in the United States.

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:42.506
You can't possibly
know everyone.

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:45.076
You can't talk to, you
can't, you as a person,

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:46.696
you don't have enough
time in your life to sit

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:48.036
down with everybody
and learn their story.

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.786
But, you know, every 10 years
or so, we at the Census Bureau,

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:57.156
ask a few questions of
everybody: age, sex,

00:01:57.846 --> 00:01:59.556
birth, where you live.

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:01.906
These are important
things to know.

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:04.536
And with just those few
questions we can learn an

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:05.756
enormous amount.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.336
You want to know where
the hospitals go?

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:11.336
You need to know what cities
have a large aging population.

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:13.846
You want to know
where the schools go?

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:15.966
You need to know
where the cities

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.116
and what neighborhoods have
a lot of really young people.

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:21.036
These kinds of questions,
there's all kinds of things:

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.446
birth rates, death rates.

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:23.896
Want to understand
the labor force,

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:25.136
that's a statistical question.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:26.436
You understand employment.

00:02:26.436 --> 00:02:27.576
You want to understand earnings.

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:28.986
You understand national
earnings.

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.616
You want to understand
these questions.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:32.526
Accidents rates,
all kinds of things

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:34.276
that we publish statistics on.

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:35.686
That we measure statistics.

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:41.316
They're all things that are
too big to see at one time,

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.376
they're too big for
your eye to see.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:46.856
308 million people,
all of different ages,

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:50.356
all different sexes; we've
got accidents happening spread

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:51.356
out across the country

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:53.386
of literally millions
of square miles.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.826
It's too big to take in.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:56.916
But ah ha!

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:58.216
[TRUMPETING SUCCESS]

00:02:58.216 --> 00:02:59.606
A federal statistical system,

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:02.976
statistics we can take
a slice of that country.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.046
[DELICIOUS!]

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:07.026
We can take a slice of the
United States of America,

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:10.736
and we can shrink it down
to a screen about yea big.

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:11.976
You know I've got a
bunch of them back here.

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:16.916
When you can take a big thing
and shrink it down small enough

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:20.806
to study, to understand, or at
least part of it, that's useful.

00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:22.926
That's statistics.

00:03:22.926 --> 00:03:26.266
So you want to understand that
something that's too small

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:28.506
like a cell or a microchip,
you need to blow it

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:29.866
up you use a microscope.

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:32.936
Statistics is a macroscope.

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:34.886
That's why statistics.
