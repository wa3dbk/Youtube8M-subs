00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.779
In search of the right full-size sedan
that is large enough to carry your family

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:05.830
and friends comfortably?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.910
There are many choices so we compare
three of the big contenders including the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.179
2014 Ford Taurus limited

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.259
2014 Chevrolet Impala LTZ

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.270
and the 2013 Toyota Avalon XLT

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.350
the 2014 Avalon is not yet available.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.320
These cars battle it out in the
categories of Fuel Economy,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.900
Interior, Technology and Safety. Leading
the pack out of the gate

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.390
is the Ford Taurus with the 2.0 liter
EcoBoost I-4 engine

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.050
the packs the power of a v6 with the
efficiency of a four-cylinder.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.129
The Taurus touts the best in class fuel economy,

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.590
offering 22 City 32 highway for a combined
26 miles per gallon.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.000
The Toyota Avalon falls short with a 25
combined miles per gallon

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.280
and rolling in last place is the
Chevrolet Impala

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.850
with only 22 combined miles per gallon.
when you're looking for a new car

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.480
having the latest and greatest
technology is typically at the top of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.180
your list.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.549
Once again the Ford Taurus is an
industry leader they offer bliss with

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.570
cross traffic alert,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.640
push button start and SYNC with MyFord
Touch that includes an 8 inch LCD

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.920
touchscreen. The Avalon provides Entune
with the 6.1 inch touchscreen

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.970
and an 8 speaker sound system and then
there's the Impala

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.159
with Chevrolet MyLink an optional
navigation system. Some reviewers say

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.159
the backup camera resolution is poor. Once
inside these full-size cars you'll

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.299
appreciate the ample interior features

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.420
the Ford Taurus limited has standard
heated and cooled seats

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.240
optional rear heated seats and provides
more front and rear hiproom:

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.869
in addition it has class exclusive
active motion front seats that feature a

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.570
six-way

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.009
lumbar support system. Reviewers
compliment the Avalon's cabin for its

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.040
attractive design

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.750
and the redesigned interior of the Chevy
Impala has gained positive reviews

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.659
but critics have noted shortcomings such as the flimsy plastic

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.229
on the center console which distracts from a
premium feel. All three sedans are solid

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.689
in safety

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.210
each one was crash tested and received a
five-star safety rating from the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.710
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.899
The Toyota Avalon and Chevrolet Impala put
up a good fight

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.910
but the Ford Taurus truly shines in multiple
categories.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.650
Now that you have the facts drive compare
and decide for yourself.
