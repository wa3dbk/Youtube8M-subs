00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.700
I think it is a little irrational to mix 3 songs.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Then, give me the proper direction.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.320
Rearrange and tell me again.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.820
- an awkward atmosphere -

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.383
SY: Something between the parts...

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:22.195
There should be some beat...

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.140
I see until now.. when you say strongly,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.480
the reaction is not good.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, if you are a member who has been with us for 3 years,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.835
it can be fine.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.800
You are... in other words, a new member.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.854
Therefore, when you point out our dance... or some works we have done,

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:52.794
it can draw our opposition.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.200
- SY is getting out of their room -

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.880
PD: Where are you going?

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.960
SY: I'm going to convenience store.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.900
PD: Convenience store?

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:17.542
SY: I am hungry...
PD: Why are you alone?

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:19.922
SY: I just want to go out.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.600
PD: Where is Taehyun?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.980
SY: He is sleeping.
PD: Is he?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.840
- unexpected Seungyoon's lying -

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.640
PD: See you.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.560
He has difficulty about lowering his head to other people.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.920
Ah, no no, I can lower my head.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.300
I can do that very well!

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.100
Yes you are well, well.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:45.467
Fan: He broke it!

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:46.967
I didn't!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.520
Fan: You did!

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.500
TH: It's okay, okay...

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.640
Kangnam Jjang!
