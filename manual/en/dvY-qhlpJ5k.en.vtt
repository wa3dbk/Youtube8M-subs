00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.919
I was seven when I first started Gymnastics.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:05.900
I was a very hyperactive child.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.639
I tried a lot of different sports including
swimming, ballet, horse-riding and hockey.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.000
I enjoyed doing them but nothing really clicked.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.320
It was only when my dad's friend said 'why
don't you come along to Gymnastics?' that

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.720
I did my first competition and I thought,
'that's the stage I want to be on'.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.160
I first started training with Amanda when
I was twelve.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.480
I was not scared of her, but she was master
and I obeyed every command.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.760
As I've got older, it has become more of a
two-way relationship.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.149
If we are discussing a new routine, she will
ask me what I think about it, whereas when

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.990
I was younger she would say, 'these are the
skills you need to learn ready for competition'.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.390
Amanda Reddin: She came through the door already
in regional competitions and had nearly got

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.760
on the national scene but wasn't quite there.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
But as soon as she walked through the door
after about a week or so you just knew all

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.000
she wanted to do was to please.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
Just want to please you, 'give me more' - it's
all in the eye's really as in 'give me, give

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.700
me, give me' and so you do.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.430
That's what's helped us get as far as we've
got really.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.590
Beth Tweddle: I get a lot of support both
from UK Sport my home club my parents.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.960
After Beijing a lot of people said, 'are you
going to carry on?' and my immediate reaction

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.220
was 'no it's far too long away, four years,
I'm not going be able to continue training'.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.940
I'm just lucky that I've got a good relationship
with Amanda that's enabled me to do that.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.329
But there is still one dream I'm chasing and
I'd love to finish my career with an Olympic

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:33.329
medal.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.450
Amanda Reddin: It is just another completion
and that's how we have got to deal with it.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.780
We are lucky enough that it is just another
Olympics, it will be Beth's third, Hannah's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.690
second and Jenni's, hopefully, first.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.380
The deal is to get them all there.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.930
Hannah Whelan: I'm constantly in the gym at
the moment to be honest.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.110
I kind of live here.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.560
There are four pieces of apparatus; normally
we would do all four in the morning and then

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.450
we will come back and do another second session
on bars and beam because they are more technical

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.780
pieces.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.759
And then anything else that Amanda wants us
to do like conditioning and stretching and

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.320
things like that.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.110
Jenni Pinches: This is like my second home
really.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.530
I think I'm here more than I am at home really
because I training over thirty hours a week

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.410
as do a lot of the other girls who are training
for the Olympic Games.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.641
Amanda is a bit like our second mum as well.

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:30.230
I think we see more of her than our mums,
so we have got to be close to get along.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.010
We support each other though when we have
bad days or good days.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.910
Beth Tweddle: Everyone wants one of those
five places in the team, but we are very supportive

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.910
of each other.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.640
We spend a lot of time with together, we're
like sisters, everyone knows each other inside

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.640
out.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.460
If someone is having a bad day you can cheer
them up or if someone is too giddy you can

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.710
bring them down.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.900
I'd say that we've got a very good team spirit.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.870
Jenni Pinches: We would be crazy if we weren't
excited to have the chance to compete in the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.610
Olympic Games in our home country.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.720
The build up to that is like a slow progression,
but every step of the way is important and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.460
we're getting really excited now.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.530
Hannah Whelan: I'm really excited.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.410
I think you are going to see a lot more of
it around.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm quite nervous, but I'm excited.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.630
Amanda Reddin: All you want them to do is
deliver what they deliver day in, day out.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.120
At the end of the day, if they can do that,
that's all you can ask of them.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.200
They have done as you have asked and you can
be the proudest person at that moment in time

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.740
in world.
