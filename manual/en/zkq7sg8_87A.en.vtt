00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:03.533
Eggplant comes in many
different colors, shapes, and sizes

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.733
from small and round
to long and thin.

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.733
But for this recipe,
we recommend this variety:

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.533
the traditional large
purple eggplant

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.500
just because it's readily
available year round.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.533
But feel free to substitute
other varieties when you find them.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.500
I'm in the Asian section where
you can find all the sauces

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
that we use to create
this authentic

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.600
inspired flavored sauce
for you for this recipe.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.433
It combines some black
bean sauce with some

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.733
sesame oil and some
chili garlic sauce

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.667
for a little kick and spice.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.500
Now, before you get started
make sure that everything

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.167
is prepped ahead.

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:42.167
That's one of the most
important steps of a stir fry,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.000
all your mise en place
are ready to go.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It means just everything
is chopped, ready to cook,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.400
because you're not gonna
have time to stop and do it later.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.367
First thing I did was cut
my eggplant up for this dish

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:55.100
and this dish calls for about
two good sized eggplant

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.700
and then cut them in discs like this.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.567
And then the disc then again
into sticks

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.167
that are about a half
an inch wide, like that.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:07.200
All right, now, in the pot
we have water boiling,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.233
in the steamer pot.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:11.767
There's about an inch
at the bottom of the pot.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:16.400
And we're going to add
the eggplant to the steamer

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.600
and let them cook for about
seven minutes.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.500
Now, the reason that we want
to steam them

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.833
rather than boiling them
is that eggplant--

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.600
Here, let's just put
the rest of this in.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.067
Eggplant has a lot of moisture
in it already.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:34.067
It also acts like a sponge
when, um, when it, um,

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:36.067
comes in contact with
other liquids.

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.700
So, we don't want it to
absorb more liquid,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.833
we want it to just cook
and soften up a little bit.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.333
While that's happening,
about seven minutes,

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.167
let's make our sauce.

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:50.600
So we have here some
sesame seeds

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.600
and a little bit
of chili garlic sauce.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.833
That's gonna add a little
bit of kick to the sauce here.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:03.433
Some chili oil,
a little bit more.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:05.833
This is a very flavorful
combination.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:09.267
You can use as little
or as much as you want

00:02:09.267 --> 00:02:12.000
depending on your taste--
and some black bean sauce.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.100
So we'll get that all
in there.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.733
And then just stir
this together

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.233
and then we can
set it aside

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:19.733
until we're ready
to finish the dish.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.000
It's been about seven minutes
so let's check this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.333
Be very, very careful
when you remove the lid

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:26.000
because it's going
to be hot.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.667
I can tell that those
are tender,

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.733
and those are ready
to move off to the side.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:33.067
So what we're gonna simply
do is move this

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:35.400
steamer basket right
off to the side,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.067
and set it aside until
we're ready to use the eggplant.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:40.067
Now, the heat's still on high,
so that's good.

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:42.367
Let's take our wok
and add that,

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.500
put that right here
on the burner.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.533
Give that just a few seconds
to heat up.

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:52.833
And then we are adding
to that hot wok

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:56.267
a little bit of vegetable oil.

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:57.400
There we go.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.067
And to that with the garlic,
chopped garlic.

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:03.567
You'll hear that begin
to sizzle pretty quickly

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.067
once you add that.

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.733
We have some shallots
as well.

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:10.733
Now, again, because this
is on like medium high,

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:13.767
this will begin to, um,
to sizzle rather quickly

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:15.000
and to cook quickly.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.600
We don't want it to burn.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.500
We just want it to release
its aroma and flavors.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.267
So after we've had
that in there for about 10 seconds,

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:29.100
we've coated all of the garlic
and the shallots with the oil,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.433
then we can go ahead
and add in our celery and onions.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.433
And this is a combination
of both of those things.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:38.167
So we're adding in
the celery and onions.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.200
And now we're going
to stir fry that

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.433
leaving the temperature
a little higher,

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:43.833
like a medium high.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.567
Stir fry that for about
a minute.

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:48.433
After about a minute,
the veggies should be

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.267
slightly wilted but not brown,
and that's how you want them.

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:55.733
So now it's time to add
the red pepper to the wok.

00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:57.767
So add that in
and we'll continue

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:01.233
to stir fry that for about
another minute.

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:03.200
Okay, it's been
about a minute,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.833
and now it's time
to add the eggplant into this dish.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:07.567
So, it's cooled off
a little bit here,

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:10.233
you'll be okay to handle it now
at this point.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:14.533
And just toss that right
in there with the other veggies.

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:16.700
And along with that,
with the eggplant,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.233
we're adding our oyster sauce,
which we have right here.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.000
We're starting now to give
this some color

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and finish the dish.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.833
A little bit of salt
to taste as well.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.333
There we go.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.400
And you can adjust
that to your taste as well.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.400
And we have the spicy sauce
to add to that.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:45.333
So let's get that
all in there.

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.000
Then with the heat still
on medium high,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.833
we wanna toss that
all together

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:52.833
so that the sauce evenly
coats all of the vegetables.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.500
Okay, this doesn't
take very long.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.700
Really, all you wanna do
is to evenly coat the veggies.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.600
So I'm gonna turn that
right off--

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.267
and then platter this.

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:06.233
So let's take this and move it
right over here into this plate.

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:12.000
This is a great colorful
vegetarian dish

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.833
that you can serve like this,
or it also is a wonderful dish

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:19.000
to compliment, um,
any protein that you have.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Just remember to get
everything done in advance

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.600
so that once you, um,
you hit the wok,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.400
you're ready to roll.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400
You can cut up all
the veggies yourself,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.200
or let us do the work for you.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.500
Look for these meal kits,
like this,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.233
at the Fresh Cut Veggies
station in selected stores.
