00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.550
Today I'd like to talk about a course I taught two years ago titled "Art and Life:

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.830
Where They Intersect"

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.780
and in many ways that course was seminal to actually becoming the Laureate this year.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.480
The course really dealt with 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.400
people's lives and the lives
that we live and how they actually

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.819
influence what we create or make as artists

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:22.629
and then I also looked at the way Art
actually might influence the way people

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.179
live their lives

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:26.660
The second

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.480
class I give a lecture on the psychoanalysis of creativity

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.079
and basically that deals with how
people's backgrounds in their 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.920
childhoods have influenced what they create and I talk about six artists.  All 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.960
the way from Janine Antoni to Alberto Giacometti

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.260
and it's quite

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.080
remarkable in these lectures to hear
about their backgrounds.  Giacometti

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.510
really stands out in the fact that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.060
there was two separate occasions in his
lifetime where

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.530
he went to bed at night with someone
else in the room and woke up the next

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.740
morning and that person was dead

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.370
and uh...

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.310
If you look at his sculptures you can
sense that they deal with

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.009
mortality and the fragility of life.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.680
And even - he had this obsession, this foot
fetish, and he would actually put his shoes

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.859
in a very special alignment before
he would go to bed with his socks

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.460
and if you look at his sculptures all his

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.610
,the figurative sculptures, the feet are oversized.
So you can draw any conclusions you want

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.130
about that relationship to his feet in these sculptures but it is compelling.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.620
I just recently saw a remarkable
documentary titled

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.940
"The Finland Phenomenon"

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.409
And Finland the country is ranked number
one in the world by

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.080
on virtually any criteria you use in
terms of 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.090
its success educationally.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.660
One of the things that really stayed with
me - they said that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.200
in the average class in the United
States the teacher will speak eighty five

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.940
percent of the class time.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.100
In Finland

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.260
the teacher will speak on average
only

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.600
forty percent of the class time.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.829
And the rest of the time the students
are talking and interacting and they're

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.070
really concerned with not so much
what they memorize but teaching

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.590
students how to learn.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.979
And I think that's sort of in many ways 
the way I tried to approach this Art and Life

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.919
class.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.529
The third class I ask all the students to come

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.029
prepared having written a two to three page

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:19.200
autobiography and come to
that class

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.639
prepared to read it

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.899
to their fellow students.  It was one of
the most amazing experiences I've ever

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.200
had as a teacher

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.749
in terms of how

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.309
idiosyncratic, personal, diverse

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:34.339
our students lives are and them having
the opportunity to share that

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.169
with their fellow students.  And it seemed
to establish immediately in this class a

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.879
real sense of trust

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.150
and respect

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.900
and a safe environment that was really a
launching pad for the rest of the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.510
semester where we cover a myriad of topics
in terms of 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.119
ways that we engage know the world
creatively

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.609
everything from new media and technology

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.239
to the experience of silence and
reflection

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.920
and how rare that's becoming

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.479
to the senses and multisensory learning in terms of how touch

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.619
and sound

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:11.229
and experiencing our senses at the same
time leaves a sort of an indelible

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.439
impression.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.239
And those are just a few of the things
that we cover in this

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.949
course called "Art and Life."

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.709
and I hope to share some more things
in the future with you.  Thank you.
