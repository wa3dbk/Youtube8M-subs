00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.800
what I am going to be showing you in this video is called the super

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.369
stretchy bind-off

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.710
i've not seen any videos done for this yet (oops -- Graciela Worth has one -- Sorry Grac!)

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.520
hopefully this will help if it's been at all confusing to you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.260
so the first thing you need to do is after you cut your working yarn

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380
you need to measure it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.380
I mean - before you cut your working yarn you 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.630
need to measure it to you the length of your last row

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.440
three times the length

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.190
of the number of pegs on your loom

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.980
and I always like to add a little bit extra too

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.980
just in case

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.300
and then you'll need to thread your yarn on a needle

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.220
i really like these metal bent tip needles i think they're smoother and

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.300
they go through

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.960
your yarn and your project easily

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.760
so the first thing that you want to do 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.540
is -- i'm using a Kiss Loom

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.620
and for the Kiss Loom what makes it special is that it has this 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.380
set of pins in the back

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.510
which you actually will not be using for the super stretchy bind-off

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.340
if you do add extra length

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.170
in between each stitch and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.379
you'll end up having to kind of tighten that up 

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:41.409
and it's kind of a pain to do

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.479
everything that you do will be done in

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.740
front of the pegs

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.550
and you will not go behind the pins for this

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.760
so the first thing that you need to do is you need to go

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.370
here's your first peg

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.000
you need to go up

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.120
under the loop on the second peg

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.020
and pull back through

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.830
this will leave a strand of yarn

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.849
to the front of your first peg

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.209
and that's the way it's supposed to be

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.319
you will go down through your first peg

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.729
behind both

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.129
loops the one that was already there and the one you just created

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.669
go down through it

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.689
and pull that snug

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.079
then you will stay in front

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.099
you'll skip

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.249
your second peg

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.269
you'll go up 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.269
through the third peg

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.199
like that

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.519
it'll sort of

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.539
form two 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.980
strands in front of that peg

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.859
your second peg

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.029
go down

00:02:55.029 --> 00:03:02.029
through your second peg

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:08.009
again pulling that snug across

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.049
you're going to go up

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:18.049
through your fourth peg

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:25.179
down through the third peg

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:31.609
again you'll see it's kind of forming these little v's on this end

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.319
you'll go up the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.319
next peg, down through this peg

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.359
you can always tell which one that is your next one, you don't want to

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.939
put it back through this

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.099
because you're pulling from here so you're always going to 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.620
skip that next

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.759
that next peg right here

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:08.759
and go to the next one over, again you're going to go up and then down through both loops

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.629
this one got behind the pegs

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.330
so I just need to move it to the front

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.919
and again pull snug

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.810
you're going to do this

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.870
all the way to the end

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.870
of your project

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.020
ok now we're down here to the end

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.699
we're going to go

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.789
up

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:52.259
through the last peg

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:59.259
down second to last

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.819
then we're actually going to go up

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.519
through this last peg one more

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.929
time

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:09.379
to lock it in place

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.229
and pull snug

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.639
now the scary part that comes next is actually that we are just going to

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.419
pull it off of the loom

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.300
and it's very nervewracking for the first time because you're not sure if it has

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.009
worked or not but i promised you that it
has

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.580
so just literally

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.119
pull it off of the loom

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:37.300
pull the project through the center

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.159
and you can see

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.889
the bind-off here

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.900
makes a very nice clean bind-off and as you can see it's very stretchy.  It's great

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.539
for cuffs

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.650
for neck lines

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.479
anything where you need that extra

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.639
ability to stretch a little bit, as far as your stitches will actually

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.589
stretch 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.959
and you can see it's not real loopy or anything like that either it just 

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:15.069
allows that stretch to be there and there's not a firm line of yarn causing it to

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:24.240
I don't know if you can see both of them together but, there's my cast on edge of double e-wrap

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.159
it looks pretty similar to that actually so they are a good

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.129
pairing

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.020
bind off and cast on

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.599
and again it's got the stretch there as well

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.289
i hope that helps you be able to work this bind off on your own
