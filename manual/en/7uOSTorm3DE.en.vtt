00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
hello everyone
today I`ll introduce the contents in my ã€€cosme bag

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this is my bag

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I bought it 3 years ago in a sample sale

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
above this pouch there`s another vanity pouch

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and then another bigger plastic toto bag

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
these 3 pouches in one set only cost 3000 yen

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
such a good bargain

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the contents in my bag are all here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the most important thing in my bag is this concealer by IPSA

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
there are 3 colors of concealer inside

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you know we can redo our makeup just padding on fundation

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but it`s gonna be so pale
it maybe too much to show people I`ve redone my makeup

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I bring this concealer instead
if I have dark circles I can easily point to cover it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or saying pimples I can still use it to cover
with this concealer I can make very natural makeup

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
next one is the highlight by YSL

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it not only can use for concealer
click it up you can see the color is pinky with pearl luster

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you can use it directly and spread it with your hand
it`s like highlight by pearl luster, makes you so feminine

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I`ll definitely bring it with me, if I have a date at night

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I also carry this pink blush

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:30.000
usually blush has its own brush inside, but the cheap one sometimes hardly to put on color
no matter how good the blush it is, if with wrong brush it can easily cause failure

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
my favorite brush is by MAC, I use it for 2 or 3 years

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000
use brush to get some powder, get rid of some on your hand, and then sweep on your cheeks

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
use this way you can do very awsome cheek

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I take this cheek brush with me no matter when

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I also carry on this small brush by BOBBI
it is very soft, and I love to brush my face like this way

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:35.000
use it just like redo the fundation, I don`t use puff but this brush
it can take away some oil and then redo the fundation very naturally

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the second final one is Aroma oil. the flavor is so amazing
I probably recommend it to more than 100 people

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
it is called Night Meditation aroma oil by AYURA 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it is supposed to add for the humidifier or air cleaner

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I just love this flavor too much
right now this studio is also full with this smell

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I put it on my clothes, bag, and on my hands

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
although the manufacturer says don`t put on your skin, it actually don`t cause any skin irritation

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
put it on instead of perfume, this Aroma oil smells more fresh and natural 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I felt like being healed, so I really really recommend this Night Meditation aroma oil by AYURA

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the final one is eye drops
I take it with me since in senior high school 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I got dry eye at any time, forgot to blink myself
so I put some eye drops 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it makes me refreshed, so the eye drops is so important to me

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
eyes become very moist and looks cuter
so this is my necessity

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
above is all about the contents in my bag
