Hi, I'm Heather.
I work for Virgin Media.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.320
Today I'm going to show you

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.960
how to make the most of F-Secure Safe
on your Windows PC.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.120
For help getting this onto your PC,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.840
just watch our video, How To
Install F-Secure Safe On A Windows PC.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.040
We will now take you through
some of F-Secure Safe's features.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.160
Once you've installed Safe,
you should see a desktop icon.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.640
If you click on it,
you'll see four options.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.520
F-Secure Safe
automatically updates itself

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.960
with the latest virus protection,
so you will always be protected.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360
But if you do want to check this,
just click on Computer Security,...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.440
..Tools, and then Check for updates.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.200
When that's done, if you click Close
and then click on Status.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.600
And then Settings.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.080
If a box pops up, click Yes.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.000
You'll now see a list of features.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.600
In the top right-hand corner, it will
say whether or not they are turned on.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520
We recommend
leaving them on at all times.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.240
On the left, the top one
is Virus and spyware scanning.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.720
This protects your computer
from programs

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.040
that may steal personal information,
damage your computer,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.920
or use it for illegal purposes.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.640
We recommend that you leave this
turned on at all times.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.480
DeepGuard makes sure
you can only use safe applications

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.280
that won't harm your computer.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.240
Firewall helps prevent
malicious users and software

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.480
from accessing
your computer via the internet.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.440
And Spam filtering stops advertisements
and potentially harmful emails.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.400
The two other tabs on the home screen
are called Tools and Statistics.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.840
You can use these
to tailor your protection

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.840
and review any harmful files
that have been found.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.680
Every now and then, it's good to run
a manual scan of your computer.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.000
To do this, just go to the main page
and then click Scan.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.120
If you come out of that and go to
Settings. If a box comes up, click Yes.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.280
You can set your computer
to run schedule scans

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.080
either daily, weekly or monthly
at specific times.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.160
Safe will also scan your hard drives
or any other removable storage

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.480
and your downloads to make sure
that they won't cause any harm.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.720
If a harmful file is found,
you will be presented with four options.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.840
The first option is to clean the file.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.600
This will attempt
to disinfect the infected file.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.120
Option two is to quarantine the files,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.640
and this will remove the files
to a protected area,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.520
so they will not harm your computer.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.320
Option three is to delete the files,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.000
which will completely remove them
from your computer.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.320
And option four
is to simply report the files,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.160
and they will be logged
in the scan report.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.880
Finally, we will look at
the online safety section,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.040
which can be found if you click on
the F-Secure logo from your desktop.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.360
Here, you can turn on
browsing protection

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.760
to block access to harmful sites
and, where appropriate,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.880
to limit the access
to unsuitable web content.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.200
You can block access to harmful websites
for specific users

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.520
by doing the following.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.800
Select the user.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.320
And then click on Settings.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.240
If a box comes up, say Yes.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.520
To limit access
to certain types of content,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.480
click on Content blocker
and make sure it's turned on

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.720
in the top right-hand corner.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.760
You can choose to allow only selected
websites, or limit web browsing,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.280
depending on how far
you want your restrictions to go.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.920
You can also limit the amount
of browsing time a user has.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.240
This is found in Browsing time limits.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.240
Select the browsing time allowed
and click OK to finish.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.800
So, this covers
the most widely used functions

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.400
of F-Secure Safe's
internet security on your PC.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.960
To find out more information,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.760
just look at the handy user guides
on F-Secure's website.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.560
We've just covered PCs here,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.200
but check out our other videos on how
F-Secure Safe works on other devices.
