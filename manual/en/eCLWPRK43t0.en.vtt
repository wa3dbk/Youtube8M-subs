Hi this is David back with Expert Village.
Next I'm going to demonstrate for you how

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.890
to fix a loose headset. You know your headsets
loose if when you have both hands on the handlebars

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.070
and you have the hands on the brakes. You
tighten the brakes and you try to move the

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.820
bike forward and backward. You can feel it
right in the headset that there's just a little

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.100
movement. So I'm going to go ahead and fix
that. This is something you need special tools

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.510
for. You can buy them online or at a bike
store. I'm using a 32mm Park HCW 5 wrench

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.519
and also a 32mm HCW 6 wrench. These are special
tools made specifically by the Park Tool Company.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:04.540
Now, the headset involves two big nuts, and
they work against each other and they're tight.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.730
That's what keeps the headset together. So,
in order to adjust this you simply put one

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.340
of the 32mm wrenches around the bottom part
of the headset and you take the other 32mm

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.659
wrench and you stick it on the top. It's real
easy once you get the hang of it and I'm going

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:33.040
to simply just loosen this like that. It's
a little bit tight but that's how it supposed

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.960
to be, because without a tight headset you're
going to take some tumbles. So, what I'm going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.880
to do is I'm going to adjust this bottom nut
right here and I'm going to tighten a little

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.259
bit and what that's going to do is compress
the ball bearings that are down here and here

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.390
closer together so that there wont' be any
movement. So now that the headset is loose

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.170
I can go ahead and adjust that. Just really
gently like that, just a tine bit of a hair

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.099
Then what I'm going to do is, you can't simply
just tighten it down that would mash all the

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.900
ball bearings together, so I need to use this
bottom wrench and just hold that in place.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.150
And then I'm going to tighten the top wrench
against the bottom wrench. And what that will

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.280
do is that will tighten them together and
the headset will be tight. And then we can

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:48.930
go riding. So it's really a simple operation.
There so now those two are tightened against

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:57.070
each other and what I can do next I can test
to see if the headset is tight as I want it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.269
to be by simply putting my hands back on the
brakes, squeezing them together, try to move

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:10.860
the bike back and forth. Hey, no movement
now, this is what we like. So that's how you

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.840
go ahead and tighten a headset on one of these
bikes. Next, I'm going to demonstrate for

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.130
you how to remove a crank arm This is David
