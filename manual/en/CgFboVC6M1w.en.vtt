00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.940
Hi it's Vincent
and you're watching the Insider series

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.800
Today we'll bring you to Payerne where the

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.920
assembly of Solar Impulse 2

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.500
is reaching an
end.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.389
The team from Decision, a Switzerland based company,

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.719
is leaving today after seven months working

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:15.339
with us.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.800
Every week it's getting harder and harder

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.380
not to show you the whole plane.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.300
This is why today we are adding blurred lines

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.679
We know you want it, so be there on April 9th

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.230
for the official presentation of Solar Impulse 2!

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.970
Hello

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.970
So you are Decision's
team
16
00:00:41,970--&gt; 00:00:45,000
a part of Decision's team that worked on Solar Impulse 2 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.500
could you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.340
introduce yourselves?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.840
So I'm Wilfried

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.000
I am Mickaël

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.560
Jonathan

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.120
This is your last
day on solar impulse 2. How do you feel about it?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.290
Well this is kind of

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.090
the end of a chapter,
we've been working on it since august.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.660
A whole Decision's
team, sixteen people
27
00:01:02,660--&gt; 00:01:08,340
who came to work in Dübendorf and also

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.610
four people in Payerne.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.000
And we're proud
enough of what we've done.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.360
Yes, before there
were only parts

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.920
and now we've put everything together, and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.610
it's wonderful.
A truly great experience

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.280
and we're looking forward to seeing it fly!

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.930
What we know here
is that you guys from Decision usually make

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.000
boats and this is an airplane...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.260
It's true it's
not exactly the same

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.330
orders of magnitude,
it's a bit lighter. Well we're glad we

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.900
made use of this
material, carbon,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390
on an airplane
as well

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.000
it allowed us to diversify and to acquire

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
experience in aeronautics.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.040
And that's great!

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.690
We'll be very happy
when it flies on the first try!

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.210
We'll be

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.000
overwhelmed with
feelings I think.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.649
Thanks a lot and
I wish you well.
