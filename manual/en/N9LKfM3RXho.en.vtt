LANA MCKISSACK: YouTube!

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:03.644
Hi.

00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:06.400
For those of you who don't know
me, which is almost all

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.340
of you, my name is Lana
McKissack, and I'm a YouTuber

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.210
slash singer slash
actress slash--

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.390
I started out on YouTube singing
covers of a lot of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.807
musical theater songs
and some pop songs--

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:26.550
[SINGING]

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.540
--and sort of have branched out
into doing comedy sketches

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.230
and light vlogging.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.460
Vlog.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.720
That sounds dirty.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.650
Speaking of dirty--

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.840
I want to be on "Dance Showdown
on YouTube" because I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.140
would love to try something
new and scary and fun.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.030
And I heard the choreographers
are really sexy.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.500
As a dancer, I have limited
experience.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.400
I do have a degree in musical
theater from UCLA.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
Go Bruins.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.992
That was some preview of
my dancing abilities.

00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:03.040
I don't want to pull
a hamstring or

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.180
anything, you know?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.050
It's gonna take three things
to win this competition.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.540
One, gumption.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.700
Two, fortitude.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.960
Three, exuberance.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.070
I have one of those things.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.520
My favorite type of dancing
is probably shimmying.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.770
I shimmy like a beast.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.070
Oh, I also like marching.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.060
I am confident about
this competition.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.480
I'm not going to say I'm the
best dancer in the world, but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.307
I will say I am a dancer
in this world.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:49.161
I'm the underdog.

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.720
I think I have the least
subscribers out of anybody

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.706
else who's playing,
who's dancing.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:58.420
And isn't it more fun to
see the underdog win?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.660
I mean, when you watch these
movies like Rocky or The

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.360
Wrestler or Glitter, you want to
root for the person who you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.150
don't think is going to win.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.890
Watch everybody else's videos,
make an informed decision.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.110
But if you vote for me, I
will show you a boob.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.760
It may or may not be mine.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790
It's not gonna be mine.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.110
But it will be a female
or male boob.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.670
It's not gonna be
a female boob.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.460
But to my fellow competitors,
the showdown has begun.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.200
The gauntlet has been thrown.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.870
You have been warned.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.316
Did I scare you?

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:59.090
So, if you think you can
beat me, bring it.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.510
VICTOR: Word on the street is,
is you trying to battle.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.510
LANA MCKISSACK: Oh, hi, Victor
from Quest Crew.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.930
Let's see what you got.

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:12.614
Oh yeah?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.080
What?

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.550
VICTOR: OK.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.800
OK.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.940
LANA MCKISSACK: Shane
Warren Jones from

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.410
Mortal Kombat Legacy?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.050
You call that dancing?

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.533
What?

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:52.497
SHANE WARREN JONES: Nothing.

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:53.970
You ready.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.860
LANA MCKISSACK: Now if you'll
excuse me, I have to go break

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.110
the legs of my competitors.
