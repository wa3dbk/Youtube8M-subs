00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.690
Hi guys, I'm Jackie M and I am at this beautiful
Golden Sands Resort, Shangri-la over in Penang

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.050
and I am with my good friend, Adrian Lim.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.510
Chef Adrian who is the executive chef of this
resort here.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.599
And Adrian, we are going to cook Ayam Pongteh
Nyonya style.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.750
I have never tried it.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.090
Okay, you can try it after this.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.090
Yeah, good.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.090
Okay, let's get started.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.890
Can you tell me a little bit about what sort
of ingredients we're using here?

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.989
Today, we are using the garlic and shallots
here, this is the preserved soya bean like

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.370
tauco, and we have sugar here, and dark soy
sauce --this is like what we usually call

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.960
thick soya sauce, thick soya sauce, yeah,
so it's quite thick...

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.980
So this is light soy sauce, okay, cooking
oil and the free-range chicken and the potato.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.270
Now, with the free-range chicken, we are here
to kind of like bring attention to the fact

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.450
that the Shangri-la group has actually implemented
this program called Rooted in Nature and what

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.500
we do here essentially is we try and locally
source the ingredients that are used in our

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.579
cooking, so the chicken is locally-sourced,
from a local farm and so is the fish.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.579
Is that right?

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.579
Yeah.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.579
Yeah, okay.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.579
Do you wanna show me what you wanna do?

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.579
Can I help you with anything?

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.009
Chop some garlic, chop some garlic, yeah,
no problem.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560
I heat some oil here.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
Okay, sure.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.259
I had a look online for ayam pongteh and I
noticed some of them actually put mushrooms

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.259
in it.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.250
Are they like a lot of different styles of
cooking this dish?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.259
Yeah, as long as you must have the soya bean.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.100
Okay, so it's the soya bean sauce that makes
the difference, okay.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.450
So this is sometimes called ground bean sauce
as well in some brands here.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.090
So we've got -these are shallots and you can
use onions or shallots, whatever you can get

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.090
your hands on.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.380
If you like to add some ginger, it's possible
too.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.380
Oh, is that right?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.380
Yeah.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.380
Okay, and some ginger too.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.380
I like ginger actually.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.900
And you just gotta saute it til it's a little
bit brown, til brown yeah, a few aroma, until

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900
aromatic, yeah.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.410
Okay, so now you put the bean paste in.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.740
Continue stirring it.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.860
Once you put this, you have to be fast, sometimes
it will stick, sometimes it burns.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.860
Okay.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.070
Some people like to put at the end of their
cooking, okay, but for me I prefer it to be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.070
sautÃ©ed a little while.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.070
Is that right?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.070
Okay.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.100
That's the thick caramel sauce and the reason
why it burns is because it's got quite a bit

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.100
of sugar in it.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.100
Yes.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.130
Yeah, that's right, and it's quite thick as
well so you gotta like be careful when you're

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.130
using it.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.470
Yeah, it burns fast, yeah, y'know.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.470
Okay.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.680
So you put some water to -let's say it's too
hot.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.680
Sure.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.140
And now you add in the chicken?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.140
Yeah.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.980
You add in the chicken.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.440
If the water is not enough, you can add more
for the sauce.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.480
If you want it to be a little bit watery,
just add water as the consistency you like.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.520
Then you simmer it.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.540
Okay, sure.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.610
You put a bit of soy sauce in it as well?

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.610
Yeah.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.230
And let's say it's not enough, you can add
in the sugar and soy sauce.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.280
Add in potato, the potato are pre-cooked just
now.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.930
Yeah, we pre-blanched the potato so it doesn't
take us long to cook.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.800
But usually if you are using bigger chicken
pieces, you can actually just use raw potato

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.290
and then cook at the same time.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.150
There you go, guys.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.730
Doesn't this look incredible?

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.680
Adrian, I'm gonna try this and see what it
taste like.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
Okay.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.140
And look at the beautiful garnish as well.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.300
When you're doing it at home, you don't need
the garnish, okay.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.300
Wow!

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.140
This tastes fantastic, yeah, very nice.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.570
This would go great with like just plain rice,
right?

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.570
Yeah.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.570
Fabulous!

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.570
There you go.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.200
Ayam pongteh, try it at home and like I said,
just cook it on a weekend.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200
So fast, right?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.940
We did it in like 5 minutes or something like
that, and then you can just heat it up during

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.280
the week and it will taste a lot nicer as
well.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280
Okay.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.510
Thanks guys, I'll catch you next time.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.510
Thank you Adrian.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.510
Thank you.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520
Good to see you again.
