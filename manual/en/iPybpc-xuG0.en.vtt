"The Lion and the Mouse"

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.779
An Aesop's fable with a focus on vocabulary.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.200
One day, a mighty lion, tired from hunting all morning,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.250
laid down to take a nap under a large,
shady tree.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.679
Some mice that lived at the foot of the
tree

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.029
scrambled over the sleeping lion to
return to their home.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.099
But just as the last mouse was crawling
over him,

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.319
the lion woke up.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.860
The lion laid his big paw on the little mouse, trapping him.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.390
The mouse was very afraid. He apologized
to the lion for disturbing him

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.340
and begged him to spare his life and let
him go.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.400
The lion pitied the little mouse, so he lifted his paw and set the mouse free.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.880
Some time later, the lion was walking near
the mouse's home.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.240
The lion accidentally stepped on a trap set by a hunter,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.700
and a net made of thick ropes captured the lion and pulled him up into a tree.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.729
The lion struggled to free himself but
could not.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.060
His angry roars rumbled through the
forest as he became upset and afraid.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.140
The mouse heard the lion's cries.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.420
Remembering the lion's kindness, the mouse ran to the tree and climbed up to the trap.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.020
He used his sharp little mouse teeth

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.600
to gnaw through the thick ropes and set the lion free.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.420
The lion and the mouse were friends forever after. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.720
Both of them had learned that it is good to help someone who has helped you.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.100
Moral of the Story:

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.980
Good deeds are rewarded.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.460
The End
