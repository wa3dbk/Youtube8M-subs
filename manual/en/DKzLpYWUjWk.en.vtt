00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.030
Don't try and play that devious game and saddle me with all the blame.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.040
You've obviously made up your mind... The award that I won was

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.090
the Irene Ryan Award for acting. 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
It's a scholarship presented by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.140
It's an award for all college actors. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200
We go to competition in Massachusetts and we all

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240
audition with three pieces and they choose two people from each region. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.280
There are eight regions. If you win your region, you then proceed to the next

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.320
national festival at the Kennedy Center, which is incredibly exciting.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.330
In the past, we've been fortunate enough to have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.360
a young woman win the stage management award 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.380
at our regional competition. We had a young man who won

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.400
scenic design. But we had never been able to break through 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.420
the Irene Ryan acting competition. That's the toughest one 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.440
in terms of numbers who participate. There were

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.490
250 actors competing at just our region, and there are eight regions 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.520
across the country. For Andrew, they always pick two,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.530
for him to win one of those top two spots

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.560
is a testament to his talent, a testament 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.570
to his luck, a testament to our training,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.620
and it's nothing but great, good fortune. Well the best part about the whole week was that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.650
four groups from U.R.I. made it to the final round. So out of 240

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.670
actors, four out of the top sixteen

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.700
were from U.R.I., which is kind of unheard of. And that just goes

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
to show how great of a training program U.R.I. has

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.760
and how great they prepare you for the professional world, or step to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
the professional world, including this competition. We made a big deal of it

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.820
because it is a big deal. Alot of times the big deals come in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.840
athletics, but this is our athletics, our

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.860
NCAA, if you will. I'm a sports nut, and I know

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.900
the value of going to a world series. This is our world series

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.940
in college theatre, that's what the K.C.A.C.G.F. is.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.970
And for him to get to this level where now he performs 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.020
on that same stage where all of the Kennedy Center

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.040
honorees meet every year, it just blows my mind. It's just amazing.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.040
"Muah, Muah, thank you, thank you..."

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.070
My family has always supported me with my love of the arts

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.090
to the point where my number one fan is my grandmother, Molly Burnap.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.120
The first time she ever saw me do anything was in my grandfathers

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.150
top hat and cane on her coffee table and I would perform for them.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.170
So they kind of knew "oh, he's one of those".

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.210
He's a very, very good actor.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.240
Twenty one years old, and right where he needs to be, and ready.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.250
You know, when he graduates, he'll be in the best possible place, I think,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.280
to move forward. I expect great things of him. I've told him

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.290
I expect when he gets his walk of fame down there at the Oscars

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.320
or the Tony's, give me a call. When they called my name,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.340
saying that I won, the first thing that they said was

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.390
"from the University of Rhode Island", and we all kind of jumped up.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.420
And then they said "and the winner is [mumbles]", and so I didn't really hear

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.440
my name, and I kind of looked around and everybody was looking at me.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.450
and my best friend Josh Andrews who plays Cosmo in "Singing in the Rain"

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.480
gave me a big hug, he was a fellow finalist, and I realised it was me.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.520
I couldn't be happier. And to represent a school like U.R.I. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.560
is kind of a blessing. 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.570
They have been so good to me, and the only thing I can do is repay them by

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.980
showing them just how good they've trained me.
