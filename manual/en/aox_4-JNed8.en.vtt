00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.160
00:08
COMM: Harpreet Devi has found a new way of

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.440
making his driving stand out.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.730
He travels everywhere in reverse.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.310
00:18
HARPREET: I wanted to do something so that's

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
why I thought of doing something new.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.450
Then I thought of doing something which nobody
had seen before so I started reverse driving.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.090
00:31
COMM: Harpeet's unusual style behind the wheel,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.980
has been regular sight on the roads of Bhatinda
in the Indian state of Punjab since 2003.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.750
He's modified his car, a Fiat Padmini so that
it now has four gears for reverse and only

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.630
one gear going forwards, allowing him to drive
backwards at speeds of up to fifty miles per

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.630
hour.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.739
However the reason he started driving in reverse
in the the first place was out of necessity

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.739
rather than choice.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.529
01:00
HARPREET: One day I had trouble when I my

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.460
car wasn't working properly.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.440
It got stuck in reverse gear.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.370
I was outside the city, I had no money, so
I thought of driving the car backwards until

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.370
Bathinda.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.820
Then I drive backwards and later on I gained
confidence.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.180
01:24
COMM: After years of reversing he now feels

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.930
he's a safer driver going backwards than he
is going forwards and has been granted special

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.390
permission by the state government to continue
with his unusual style.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.690
To ensure safety, he's fitted an ambulance
siren to alert other drivers and pedestrians

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.360
to the fact that he's reversing.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.400
Crucially he's also added headlights to the
rear of his car.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.900
And while driving like this has bought him
fame, it's also had an adverse affect on his

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.460
health as he now suffers from back and neck
problems.
