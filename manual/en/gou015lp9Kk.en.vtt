Hi, my name is Karl James owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, TX. On behalf

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.849
of Expert Village, I'm here to show you my
gumbo supreme. Now we're going to sweat down

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.250
our trinity so we got our trinity here which
is our green peppers, red peppers, celery,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.500
onion plus we're going to put that garlic
that we chopped in there also. So we are going

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:46.160
to add this all and sweat it down. We just
want to sweat it down for about 5-10 minutes

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.780
just so they will soften. You want to keep
moving it around because that garlic that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.160
we have in there we don't want that to burn.
When you burn your garlic, it gives it a bitter

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:11.779
taste and by putting it in with the rest of
the trinity those bell peppers, onions and

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:20.119
celery are releasing quite a bit of liquid.
So that will also help keep the garlic from

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:36.959
burning.
Nice colors; the red and the green, white.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:58.809
By doing this, we're releasing a lot of the
sugars that are in each of these items.

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:08.649
So we'll continue to sweat down our veggies
our trinity we're about another 5 minutes

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.300
and I'll see you back at the next step.
