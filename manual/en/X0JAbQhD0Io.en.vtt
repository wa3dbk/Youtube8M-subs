00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.730
This Ron Shelton action comedy was an unfortunate
commercial disappointment when it was released

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.779
in June of 2003, only earning back two-thirds
of its $75 million dollar budget.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.109
The film's inventive title sequence, a quickly-cut
montage of Hollywood signs around California

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.190
is a particularly cool way to open the picture.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.480
Based on writer Robert Souza's true experiences
as a LAPD officer, this PG-13 rated film follows

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.890
two homicide detectives who investigate a
quadruple murder while moonlighting in other

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.890
fields.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.210
Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett star in the
buddy-cop adventure, the former doing real-estate

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.329
work on the side, and the latter doubles as
a yoga instructor.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.359
Simultaneously working two jobs is an amusing
enough concept, but it's also a bit concerning

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.859
that Los Angeles' finest wouldn't have the
financial means to support themselves on a

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:46.920
detective's salary.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
That said, Ford and Hartnett make an excellent
pair, and it's their laid back banter and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.159
carefree attitudes that really make this picture
work.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.579
When Hartnett confesses his desire to quit
the force to become an actor, Ford shrugs

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.579
and replies, "You're gay.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:59.579
I can deal with that."

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.239
The supporting cast meanwhile surprisingly
stacked, including appearances by Bruce Greenwood,

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.770
Lena Olin, Isaiah Washington, Keith David,
Dwight Yoakam, Gladys Knight, and Martin Landau

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.740
- who may not all be at their best, but they
seem to be enjoying themselves.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.740
Cameo appearances by Eric Idle as a rowdy
celebrity, Lou Diamond Phillips as an undercover

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.740
prostitute, and Smokey Robison as a cab driver
are also pretty fantastic.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.390
While the main investigation story is rather
pedestrian, it's the juxtaposition of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:02:01.320
hard-ass Ford in ridiculous situations that
makes for excellent comedy.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.740
It's impossible not to laugh when he begins
dry-humping the one-way glass during an internal-affairs

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.740
interview.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.479
Amusingly, Ford keeps taking real-estate phone
calls throughout the movie, even in the middle

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.940
of an exciting high-speed car chase through
the surface streets of Beverly Hills, which

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.989
ends in a huge crash right out front of Mann's
Chinese Theater here.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.050
The absurdity reaches its zenith when Hartnett
commandeers a minivan with the family still

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.599
inside, and an aggravated Ford borrows a pink
bike from a little girl.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.120
The 116-minute movie really drags during the
middle act however, especially as the narrative

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.549
is juggling so many moving parts and characters.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.049
But it thankfully all focuses together during
the action-oriented climax.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.391
There's nothing particularly noteworthy about
the music, editing, or cinematography, but

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.900
they service the production well enough.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.700
A wonderful send-up of Los Angles culture
that makes great use of its Hollywood locations

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.800
- this is a quirky and fun adventure with
great actors.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.200
And fans of Harrison should have no problem
watching this one at least once or twice.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.939
"Hollywood Homicide" is an underrated procedural
with silly situations - I thought it was a

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.630
pretty GOOD film.
