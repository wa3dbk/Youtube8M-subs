Hello ladies and gentlemen

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:06.426
I'm going to show you how to remote debug web pages on your mobile phone

00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:09.426
using Opera Dragonfly on your desktop.

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:14.426
You will need a copy of Opera 10 on the desktop

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:17.426
and a mobile phone running Opera 10 Mobile 

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:20.480
for example I've got a Nokia here which is S60.

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:23.067
They also both need to be on the same local network 

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:24.347
and in advance

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:28.439
you should get the local IP address of the desktop

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:32.419
that's 192.xxx or maybe 10.xxx or something like that

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.439
You can get that by ifconfig or ipconfig from the terminal window.

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:42.407
So first of all we want to fire up Opera Dragonfly,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:49.427
which we do from the Opera menu Tools &gt; Advanced &gt; Developer Tools.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.707
And that loads up at the bottom of the page.

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:59.426
As it is, that's perfect for debugging local pages or any page that is visible in a desktop browser

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:02.467
but in this case we want to debug on this little chappie.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.426
So we go to Settings

00:01:05.427 --> 00:01:09.425
and we've got a 'Remote Debug' option there which we enable

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:13.946
and that's port 7001 by default.

00:01:13.947 --> 00:01:18.233
And it says it's waiting for a connection on that port. OK, no problem.

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:20.426
We'll go to Opera 10 Mobile

00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:26.425
and go to the URL opera:debug

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:35.426
And that brings up this page here. Can we see that?

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.179
And we go down and we enter the local IP address of the desktop.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.426
192.168.0.3 in this case.

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:46.426
The port number I've kept a 7001 and click connect.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:51.426
And in the background, you may have seen, a little message pops up:

00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:56.426
"The protocol version of Opera does not match the one which Opera Dragonfly is using". 

00:01:56.427 --> 00:02:02.426
At the moment we are between protocol versions so we need to download this compatible version.

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:05.426
It does it in a couple of seconds.

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:08.426
And another message comes up again:

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:10.426
"Waiting for a connection on port 7001".

00:02:10.426 --> 00:02:14.426
So again we just go to connect on the mobile phone.

00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:19.426
This is just until we get both protocols up to the same version.

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:23.426
Connected, so we click OK again and there we go. 

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:27.039
The connection is complete so now what we do

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:32.426
is fire up the page we want to debug on the mobile browser.

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:34.426
Now with Opera Mobile 10 we've got tabs,

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:39.424
so I have open in another tab a CSS showcase,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:42.367
a very simple page I made earlier.

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:43.367
Back to the desktop

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.426
we now want to specify that page in Opera Dragonfly.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.426
So at the right-hand side,

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:51.426
we click the little page menu, the window menu

00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:54.426
and we select the page that is open on the mobile.

00:02:54.427 --> 00:02:59.427
"CSS3 showcase" demonstrating background-color and background-origin. 

00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:01.426
Now when we've selected that

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.426
we can choose something from the body -

00:03:05.427 --> 00:03:08.400
for example if I select the header and then the &lt;h1&gt; tag,

00:03:08.401 --> 00:03:16.426
it then shows it in blue on the mobile screen indicating that's the active area.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:21.426
And I can now change that text in the desktop.

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:25.426
So I can change 'Demonstrating to 'Shmemonstrating'!

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:28.426
But maybe that's too small for you, maybe you can't see it...

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:30.426
So on the right-hand side we have styles -

00:03:30.427 --> 00:03:34.426
CSS is shown there and I can edit any of these.

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:37.047
So the font size for &lt;h1&gt; is 1.4

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:40.426
but I'm gonna push that up to 2.4

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.426
Oh yeah!

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:43.426
But that's not it, oh no...

00:03:43.426 --> 00:03:45.426
I can make it to 3.4!

00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:46.426
I'm on fire!

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:47.426
So you can do anything

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:51.426
and change any styles down here or add new styles

00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:52.426
so I could add a new one making it red.

00:03:52.426 --> 00:03:54.426
In fact I might just do that.

00:03:54.426 --> 00:04:00.746
Let's just change the color to red...

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:02.426
...and it's red!

00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:06.426
And using the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard on the desktop,

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:11.426
I can cycle through a lot of the default colors.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:12.586
Let's just see what looks coolest

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:16.426
And I think lime is definitely cool.

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:18.426
So there you go:

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:23.426
remote debugging Opera 10 for the desktop. Opera Mobile 10 for mobile.

00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:27.426
Both available for free, from Opera.com
