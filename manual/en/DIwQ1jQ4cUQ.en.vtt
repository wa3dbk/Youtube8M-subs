00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:24.030
Travelling in a fried-out combie
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.930
I met a strange lady, she made me
nervous

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.620
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.490
"Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.740
Can't you hear, can't you hear the
thunder?

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.380
You better run, you better take cover."

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.540
Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six foot four and full of muscle

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.050
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.750
And he said,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:27.570
"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.820
Can't you hear, can't you hear the
thunder?

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.600
You better run, you better take cover."
(Yeahhh!)

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.320
Dying in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and nothin' much to say

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.970
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt
me

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.020
Because I come from the land of plenty?"
And he said, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.310
"Oh, you come from a land down under?
(oh yeah yeah)

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.580
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.430
You better run, you better take cover."

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.230
We are..

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:50.230
Livin' in a land down under,
Where women glow and men plunder,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.370
(yeahhhhhhhhhh)
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.820
You better run, you better take cover.
