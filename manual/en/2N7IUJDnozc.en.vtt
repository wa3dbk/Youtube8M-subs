00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:03.370
- Today's the first day the
cameras are gonna be rolling

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.107 align:start position:0%
but right now I just feel
really excited and I've another

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.476 align:start size:88% position:13%
hour to sleep but I
can't, I'm too excited.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.878
(rock music)

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.114 align:start size:84% position:16%
There are just moments
where you're like

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:16.049
we're actually filming this?

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.384
- Wow!

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.386
A real Carrie Bradshaw
wig, I didn't know they

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:23.156
made those anymore but,
why so many cactuses?

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.225 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Just the progression
from when we first

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.826
thought of that, the seed of it

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.361 align:start size:84% position:16%
every scene's a
real collaboration.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.464
People all work together and
it becomes this other thing.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Director] Later,
Amy's in comfy clothes

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
pacing nervously
waiting for Danny P.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:38.772
There's a knock on her
door and she answers it.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.973
- Hi, come on in.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.274
- Hi, thank you.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.742
- Thank you so much
for squeezing me in

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
can I offer you--
- Extra storage in your

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.012
kitchen, offer me what?

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.680
Half a coconut water and
the dirt from your Britta

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.082
I think I'm actually
good, lonely bones.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.216
And kind of in a rush.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.317
Let's get started.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.186
(laughs)

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.856
(old timey music)

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:59.125
- Out of my way you poor girl!

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.627
- We shot a sketch called

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:05.165 line:0%
a porn star is born about
like a 1930's porn star.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.633
- It was arousing for a minute

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.335 align:start size:94% position:6%
but then I was like, gotta
keep it professional.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.072
- What's the version
of, who got the job?

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.907
Like, you're hired!

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.108 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Or like
- Well because she doesn't

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
know--
- So she's doing the thing

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he needs to
stop her like stop.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.514 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, those hands don't
need to open mail anymore.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like something--
- We're gonna make those

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:26.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
hands famous,
something like that?

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.554 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Yeah.
- We're gonna make

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.989
those hands a star.
- We're gonna make

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.357
those hands a star.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.126
(laughs)

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.427
- Stop.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.429
We're gonna make
those hands a star.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.565
(laughs)

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start size:88% position:13%
- There are just moments
where you're like,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.469
oh my God, we wrote this,
it's really happening now.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.070
- [Director] That's your cue.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.940
- (laughing)

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.975
- And then after, and then after

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.743
- It's super fun to
write these things

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.046
that seem really crazy.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:56.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just write what you would like
to have appear around you.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.384
We wanted puppies around us.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.719
And we got them.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:01.821
- It's day 25.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
Day 26 or 27th, 27th?
- I think it's the 27th.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like, who's not
gonna be a cunt today?

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.195 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm drinking at
lunch, no question.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.029
(laughs)

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.298
(cheering)

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:27.180 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I, thank you, everybody,
for being so good at your jobs

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.749
and for laughing and for
helping me make my dreams

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.485 align:start size:97% position:3%
come true and I really
appreciate all of you guys.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.754
(clapping)

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.260
(rock music)

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.461
- Well we tried to have sex

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.962
it did not happen at all.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.266
My heart was in it,
this lady was not.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.700
(laughs)

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.935 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- It's just been absolutely
incredible how much

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.537 line:0%
new material she's
been able to generate

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.106
in A, a short amount of
time and B, probably one

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:56.009 align:start size:84% position:16%
of the busiest
periods of her life.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:02.148 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Announcer] Put your hands
together for Amy Schumer!

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.185
(audience cheers)

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.087
(heavy rock music)

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.659
(whistling)
