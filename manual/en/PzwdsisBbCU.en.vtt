00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.870
- Hey, this Donnie Smith,
and, workin' on the Mustang.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.520
Gonna talk about something
that we're doin' different.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.670
We're doin' the other side,
the other quarter panel.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.140
I just don't wanna repeat all the steps

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.240
that we did on the other side, but there

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.810
is something we're doin' different.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.300
First of all, I wanna say
that, to all your DIYers

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.830
out there that I really
respect what you do.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.090
You know, I'm used to all the tools.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.980
Having the air compressor,
the inside environment

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.690
to work in, and all the
tools needed, however

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.800
with this job, I don't have
a garage to put this in.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.540
I did end up getting a little garage,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.140
but it's mainly just
used for storing parts,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.660
and tools, and things like that,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.920
and it's really already
getting cram packed.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.140
You know I've done this one basically

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.940
outside with basic hand tools.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.771
Quite a bit harder that
way, you know and I respect

00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:48.530
you guys out there doin'
this, and makin' it happen

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.840
if you don't have all
the things like this.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.180
You know it can be done, but
it is a little bit harder,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.920
so kudos to you guys out
there that are determined

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.210
to get a project and restore it,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.900
even if you don't have all
the stuff to do it with.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.010
Now what we're doin' on
this one, well reason

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340
I want to go ahead and make
a video on this, because

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820
on the other side we replaced
the entire wheel well.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.570
It was really bad, but this one, it was

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810
mainly just really bad on the edges here,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.140
it wasn't that bad, so we're gonna section

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.473
this one in, rather than go up,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.140
and with those spot welds there back

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.040
behind this part here, 'cause that part

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.813
was the difficult part
to get behind all that.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.700
We're just sectioning it off right here.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.500
Now I've gotta trim some of the sub-steel.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.100
I'm just kinda doin' a test fit.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.180
We're doin' a trim, we cut it here.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.850
We put this up and it's lap under it,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.010
and both pieces I've gotta
trim up a little bit,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.900
and do a little modification to it,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.760
and this is just a line where I sprayed

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.810
when it was on to kinda let me know

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.110
what the alignment is, and there was

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.680
some tape on this outside
edge where I made the cut,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.210
reason it's out a little
bit, but rather than doin'

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240
the whole wheel well, we're
just goin' to section it.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.230
So it's just this part
here and down into here.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.760
I'm still gonna have to take it back off

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.130
and do all the rust treatment,
and grind this to metal,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.380
and put the weld through primer, and then

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.907
before I weld it back on sirs, you know

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:13.200
it'd take me awhile to get that done.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.580
And this part right here, again I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.000
had to fabricate this piece here.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.750
Just like the other side it was rusted out

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.100
so I had to make a new one, and whenever I

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.840
start welding, you know
I'll weld all this together.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.630
So, this quarter panel's
the exact same thing.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.203
It's gonna be replacing
all the factory seams.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400
Sometimes they section
in the quarter panels,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.070
but both sides was too
bad, there was damage

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.910
in the areas that coulda been saved,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.040
like they do on some
of them so, just had to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.623
do complete replacement on both of these.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.550
But that's about the only changes

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.450
other than the other
side is this wheel well,

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.420
and like I said, I just don't want to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.110
repeat all the step,
make a duplicate video,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.570
you know from one side from the other,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.860
but just kinda keep you updated on that.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.269
And again, you know I really
do appreciate you guys,

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.910
and admire the guys out there that do this

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.920
without all the tools, without a garage.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.640
You know it's hard doing things in stages

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.900
to prevent weather from
attacking the metal,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.340
so you have to kinda do
things in stages, and you know

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.230
it's kind of a pain, but it can be done.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.230
That's it for this video, thanks

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.330
for watching, we'll talk to you next time.
