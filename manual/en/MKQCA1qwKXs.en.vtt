DAVID CLEMEN: Hi, I'm David Clemen on behalf
of Expert Village. And today we're going to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.820
do an abstract painting on a larger scale
on a piece of birch wood. Okay, now we've

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:20.460
got most of our paint on here. I like it.
And I think I want to add just little bit

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.840
more red and I'm going to spread some more
paint out and see what comes out of it because

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.031
I wanted it more red and white. So I'm going
to add more red and I'm going to spread this--spread

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.430
the red. And you can actually just squeeze
it like I was saying before into really thin

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.690
lines and if you like the line, you can just
leave it 'cause the height of the paint also

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.930
gives a texture. So just keep that in mind,
I might actually leave that red line there

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.239
and just spread this red over top of the black
and now it's getting really--it's got some

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.880
heat to it with all this red. Now I'm going
to drag this really hard right there. And

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.780
I'm going to drag it really hard right there
and I'm going to drag it really hard right

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.439
here. Now I'm going to come in here and spread
this red paint--ooh, I got a little bark.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:30.159
Spread this, spread this, spread this--ooh,
I messed up my wave that I was trying to keep

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:58.659
from earlier but it happens when you're spreading
paint. Put three big drops right here on my

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.170
flag symbols or whatever they are. And I'm
going to go really slow on these. I'm actually

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:23.730
going to use the other side. And then just
do, one, two, three. There. Alright, that's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.319
spreading the paint.
