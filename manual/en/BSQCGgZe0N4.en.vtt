Rocky Brown did it again.

Come on, Rocky, let's go up
there to the Winner's Board.

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:05.819
[audience applauding]

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:08.555
I just heard that Boise was
the capital of Idaho yesterday

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.291
and I couldn't get the buzzer.

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:13.060 align:start position:0%
Couldn't get the buzzer
when you needed it.

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:14.495 align:start position:0%
I was wondering
why you laughed on that.

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:16.463 align:end position:100%
It was when you asked me
what was the capital of Idaho.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.266 size:88% position:44%
Rocky, you can get yourself,
as we saw on the last show,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.334 align:start position:0%
a very unusual
pocket watch.

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.637 align:start position:0%
There is $10,000 in cash
up there,

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.539
a wonderful luxury automobile.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.176
We haven't had a good look at
this very unusual crystal, Jay?

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:31.645
(Jay Stewart)
<i> Raise a toast to the host</i>

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.082
<i> with this beautiful
 crystal bar ware.</i>

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.652
<i> From France, a delicately cut
 decanter</i>

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:41.821
<i> with matching double
 old-fashioned glasses</i>

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:44.291
<i> topped with a golden
 thistle pattern.</i>

00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:48.962
<i> Yours with a gift certificate
 from Geary's Beverly Hills!</i>

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:52.399
<i>And this prize is worth $2,000!</i>

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.668
Very nice.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.136 size:81% position:41%
That could sit on the bar.

00:00:56.203 --> 00:00:58.772
That's right, you got the bar on
the last show, you're all set.

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:03.310
Well, that's up here and so too
is $10,000 in cash and that car.

00:01:03.377 --> 00:01:05.412
If you make a match,
that prize is yours.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.114
Good luck, Rocky,
start picking.

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:08.215 align:start position:0%
Number three.

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:11.085
He likes to start with three.
Fur coat.

00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.519 align:start position:0%
Number 10.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.656
Number 10, and pocket watch.
We've seen that, it's beautiful.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:17.724 align:start position:0%
Number five.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.493
Number five.
Do we have a match now?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.727
$10,000 in cash, but no match.

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:22.096 align:start position:0%
19.

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:25.065
19, "win" card. The next thing
is an automatic match.

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:27.634
There are six number up there.
That car is there someplace.

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:29.369
Rocky, good luck,
what are you going to win?

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:32.038
I decided to go last time with
number six for the "win" card.

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:33.173 size:75% position:38%
I'm going to do it, six.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.410
Come on, number six,
and he gets the car!

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:37.744 align:start position:0%
Yes!

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.279
The car! Come on over here!

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:40.780
Way to go!

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:43.950
Yes indeed! Isn't that lovely?

00:01:44.017 --> 00:01:45.752
Congratulations!

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.255
Sit down, it's yours.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.126
Rocky Brown has got himself
a beautiful automobile.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.728 align:start position:0%
How do you feel?
Super!

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:57.164
That's lovely.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.037 align:end position:100%
Rocky, we are happy for you.
Congratulations!

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:07.073
A fine champion gets himself
a beautiful, beautiful prize,

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.210 align:start size:66% position:34%
and he's got himself
a sensational total.

00:02:10.277 --> 00:02:14.981 size:88% position:56%
We will be back with Rocky
right after this time out.

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.217
Congratulations, that's lovely.
