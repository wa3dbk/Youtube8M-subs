In Mutevazi Lezzetler we are sharing an economic recipe again

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.720
at this episode, we are sharing an honoring recipe

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.200
a dessert recipe; "Yeast Fritters with Prunes"

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.840
let’s see the ingredients list at first, then we will see how to cook it

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.720
1 cup of milk

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.920
1 cup of warm water

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600
1 tsp granulated sugar

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.640
2 eggs

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.200
1 pack of instant yeast

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.240
10 - 12 beaten prunes

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.760
1 pack of vanilla

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.880
1 tsp salt

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
1 tbsp vegetable oil

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640
and flour

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.480
for the syrup; 1.10 pounds fresh red plum

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.360
2 + 1/2 cups of water

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
1/2 cup of plum marmalade

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
and 2 cups of granulated sugar

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.080
to fry; 2 cups of vegetable oil

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.960
I’m starting by preparing the dough

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.280
I’m pouring the 1 cup of water into the bowl…

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.000
adding 1 tsp of granulated sugar…

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
I’m mixing the instant yeast with…

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.680
some flour

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640
and adding this mixture into the bowl also

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.300
and mixing for a while

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.840
I’m adding 1 cup of warm water also

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.480
I’m breaking the washed eggs into the mixture

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.920
I’m mixing it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.120
after mixing it…

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040
I’m adding about 1 tbsp of vegetable oil

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.920
2 tsp of salt

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.280
to give a different taste; 1 pack of vanilla

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.800
I’m adding the sifted flour into the mixture little by little

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.440
you may use a mixer also

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
I think that 2 + 1/2 cups of flour is enough…

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.800
I’ll mix it, until it smoothens

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.080
that is enough for mixing

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.600
as you may notice, I did not add the prunes already

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.840
after resting the mixture half an hour, I’ll add the prunes

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080
I’ve removed the seeds of the prunes...

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.280
but I’ve added the seeds into the pot of the prunes again

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.600
now, I’m adding 1 cup of granulated sugar and…

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.320
1 cup of water

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.200
I’ll boil this mixture, until the prunes give their color to the boiling water

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.840
I’m mixing it just for a while

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.480
if you have an illness about your stomach, plums may make you feel worse

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.360
the mixture has reached the boiling temperature, I may remove it from the stove about 1 -2 minutes later

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.440
I’m draining this mixture

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.720
it becomes different type of syrup

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.000
we are getting all the benefits of plum by this way

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.720
I’m forcing over the plums by the back of the spoon to get their juice

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.440
after draining the prunes…

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.000
I’m adding 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of plum marmalade

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600
as you may notice we are using all products of plum

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.520
it is a plum fiesta

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.840
I’m adding 1 cup of water

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.680
we may need half more cup

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.560
by this way we make the syrup reach the right consistency

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.400
I’ll make the mixture reach boiling temperature over medium heat

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.320
the syrup is ready, now I’m removing it from the stove and I’ll let it cool down

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
the dough has rested for about half an hour

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.760
I’m adding the finely diced plums and mixing

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.160
the dough is ready and the oil is hot right now also

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.360
I may start to fry them

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.560
after dipping the spoon into the oil, I’m pouring the dough by this way

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.920
they take the shape as you may notice

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.280
after frying, I’ll place them over paper

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.760
I’m removing the fried pieces

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.960
they have golden color

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.840
they are fried very well

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.840
now, I’m placing them into the cooled down syrup

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.200
at this episode, we had a plum fiesta

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.920
it is very healthy…

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.560
includes B1, B2, B5 and C vitamins

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.760
also includes calcium, magnesium and other minerals

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.880
it is especially very beneficial for children

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
if you have a bowel problem…

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.640
it also catalyze the bowel activities

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.880
after resting the fritters in the syrup for about 15 minutes…

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.120
now I may place them into the service plate

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.160
at this episode, we have shared a delicious and beneficial recipe

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720
"Yeast Fritters with Prunes"

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.440
