00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is famous for looking deep into the past of the Universe. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But it can also predict the future.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Pictures made by Hubble over the years show us the fate of the Solar System:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
a troubling but beautiful preview of what will happen 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when the Sun runs out of fuel more than five billion years from now.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Episode 52: The Death of Stars

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Presented by Dr J, aka Dr Joe Liske

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Don’t panic just yet! The Sun is about 4 1⁄2 billion years old — that’s old by most standards, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but less than half way through its expected lifespan.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
However by observing countless stars similar to the Sun, scientists now have a good idea

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
of what will happen to the Solar System in the very distant future.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Stars are balls of matter that produce energy mainly by fusing atomic nuclei of hydrogen, forming helium.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, when two nuclei fuse together, their combined mass is slightly less than the sum of the two original nuclei,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the difference is released as energy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That’s where sunlight comes from.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it’s also the process that powers thermonuclear bombs.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But while thermonuclear bombs use up their fuel in just a fraction of a second,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
stars are big enough to sustain nuclear fusion for millions or indeed billions of years

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
before they too eventually run out of fuel.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
What happens next depends on the size of the star.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Really big stars explode as supernovae after only a few million years...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
...while the smallest stars burn slowly enough to be virtually immortal:

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
their expected lifespan is much longer than the present age of the Universe,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
meaning we’ve never seen one die.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But for stars like the Sun,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which have a lifespan measured in billions of years,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
astronomers have made many observations of what happens when the fuel supply runs out.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
They end with a whimper, not a bang.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here’s how it goes –

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as revealed by Hubble observations of dozens of stars at different stages of evolution.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
First, the star swells up and cools down a little,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
becoming a so-called red giant.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
When the Sun does this, it will destroy

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the inner planets of the Solar System.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Next, the outer layers are puffed out, forming a dense cloud of gas and dust

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that totally obscures the visible light from the star.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This stage, called a pre-planetary, or protoplanetary nebula,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is tough to observe as it’s so faint.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
only dim infrared emissions from the dust cloud and reflected starlight let astronomers see anything at all.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It’s also a short period in stellar evolution,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
just a few thousand years long, so these objects are quite scarce.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Hubble’s images of pre-planetary nebulae show a wide variety of shapes,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
hinting at complex dynamics going on inside.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The spiral structure of this nebula is particularly unusual,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and is likely due to a binary star system shaping the cloud of gas and dust.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
As the star ejects its outer layers to form the cold pre-planetary nebula,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the core of the star is left behind, leaving a small but very hot remnant.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Over a period of a few thousand years,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
radiation from this hot leftover excites the gas in the pre-planetary nebula,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
eventually making it light up like a fluorescent sign.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
At this point, the faint pre-planetary nebula becomes a bright planetary nebula.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 In fact, these are bright enough that astronomers have long been able to see them, 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
which explains their confusing name.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Because they appear roughly spherical and have a greenish tinge when observed visually,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
astronomers using early telescopes 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
found their appearance reminiscent of the planets of the Solar System.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
High resolution observations from modern telescopes including Hubble

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
show that their shapes are often far from spherical,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and the planet-like appearance is pretty dubious

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but the name has stuck.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Eventually, planetary nebulae fade to nothing as the gas and dust is diffused into space.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
All that remains is a tiny, dense and dim white dwarf —

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the ultimate destination of the Sun, billions of years from now.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But for stars there is life after death.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The matter puffed into space by planetary nebulae

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
forms the building blocks for new generations of stars and planets.
