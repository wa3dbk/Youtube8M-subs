Ok, hi youtube to the.. yeah, this is just 
 a video of a 8 way beyblade battle.

00:00:10.774 --> 00:00:14.774
And, as you can see, this is not a proper beyblade 
 stadium as a proper beyblade stadium would be too small.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:28.625
Well, If you want to see 1vs1 or 1vs1vs1    beyblade battles, 
 you can just paste it in the comments and I'll use this beystadium

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:44.234
Alright, now to put the camera down. Fail, Fail! Sorry, I don't have 
 a proper camera stand so you're gonna have to wait awhile.

00:00:46.928 --> 00:01:06.928
( Launching beyblades )

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.805
Ok, 8 way beyblade battle!

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:23.124
( Beyblades clashing )

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:23.124
( Beyblades clashing )

00:01:23.873 --> 00:01:40.870
None of these beys have high attack power as if I used beys 
 with high attack power, beys would stop spinning before I launch the

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:46.210
last beyblade.

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:51.840
And, I don't want anyone complaining about the voice, I added captions.

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:32.350
Burn fireblaze wins it! Suscribe, rate, and comment!
