00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.080
Trick or treat!

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.480
Good evening boys and girls!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900
It's Halloween! And you know what that means

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.199
Candy! Costumes! Trick or treats!

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.390
Right. But what else?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.809
Ghosts! Goblins! Witches! AH!

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.849
It's the night we can change the world!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.399
Right you are!

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.079
Change the world? How?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.390
By collecting change! That's how.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990
By Trick or Treating for UNICEF!

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.250
Come with me. I'll show you.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.160
Halloween is really neat,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.680
You can scurry with your feet,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.160
And you go door to door,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.900
Get some candy, but there's more!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.000
Because as our parents always did

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Back in the days when they were kids,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Trick-or-Treat is not enough, so Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF!

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.000
And be the change

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.280
To change the world

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.720
You can help us with your change,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660
And help the world's boys and girls.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.600
And be the change

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.240
To change the world

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.360
You can help us with your change,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.880
And be the change, change the world

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.920
It's such a little task,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.760
Get your costume,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.069
Grab your mask,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.040
Let's be kids helping kids,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.800
So grab your friends and have a blast,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.240
Cause it's a simple fact,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.810
That you can have a BIG IMPACT!

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.390
Cause what's right's what we have left

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.000
Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF!

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.940
And change the world

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760
With some change

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.320
Get dressed up in your costume

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.120
Be silly, be extreme

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.160
And make the world,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.480
A better place.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.600
Just a little bit of change,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.280
Will put a smile on somebody's face!

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.719
Trick or Treat for UNICEF

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.459
Wow! Happy Halloween!

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.119
What's this all about?

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.140
We're collecting change to help kids in need around the world

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140
With food and education, clean water and so much more!

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.409
Trick or Treat for UNICEF!

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.479
Don't you remember?

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.850
We did this as kids too!

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.400
Thank you! Happy Halloween!

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760
Happy Halloween! That was really generous of you.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.710
Think nothing of it, that was your piggy bank.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.220
[Laughter]

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.800
Don't you wanna take a stand,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.640
Lend a hand,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.240
Give some help,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.160
Don't you wanna impact the world in which
we live!

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.520
Don't you wanna give some time,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.000
Give a nickel,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.600
Give a dime!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.320
Well, do it the way our parents always did

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.560
Don't you want to help educate,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.200
Provide relief

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.800
Alleviate

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.920
The struggles in which other children live?

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Don't you wanna give a quarter,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.960
Help provide some drinking water,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.960
Don't you wanna take what's wrong and put
it right.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.520
Don't you know that just a penny,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.880
Helps provide toys to many.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.760
Don't you know that Halloween's the perfect night!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.240
Don't you know that Halloween's the perfect
night

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.480
For every child everywhere,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.970
Will be helped out if you dare.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.090
So many will be happy in the end

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.100
Candy sack held in your right hand,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.010
Your change box in your left.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.120
It's not just Trick-or-Treat,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.560
It's Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.600
It's time for change

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.000
You're helping change

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.960
It's amazing just how far it goes,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.040
To take away some pain.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.670
So be the change

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Cause it's what right

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.640
It's amazing all the good to do on Trick-or-Treating night.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.920
Some children have it tough,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.560
Yes, their lives are really ruff!

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.360
Children all across the globe in which we
live,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.640
And so on the scary night,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.520
Give a scare,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.560
Give a fright,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.080
Give your time,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.040
Give some change,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.480
