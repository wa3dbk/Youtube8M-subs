00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.530
It’s been an hour, how do you feel?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.810
It’s been an hour… Yay!

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.680
Was it long?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.130
Nah, it went by pretty quickly.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.140
Oh really?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.900
Yup.
Oh really?

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140
Weren’t you bored?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.962
Hmm… not yet. Not really.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.930
Oh, it’s 7!

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.510
Yay it’s been an hour! Yaaay!

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.860
I get ¥1000 right?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.610
That’s right.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.200
Yaaay!
That’s right.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.300
So now…

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.050
We’re on to the morning roulette.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.110
Yup, that’s the one.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.661
Radio exercise.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.790
Facial paper “Mr. Glisten".

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.090
Cure for drowsiness beverage.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.230
Cool your body.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.380
Eye mask.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.610
Intense exercise.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.420
Read a difficult book.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.870
Red wine!

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520
Red wine’s would be tough…

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.860
Here's the first morning roll...

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.696
Go!

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.610
Number 5!

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.017
Eye mask!

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:00.386
Yup, that's it.

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.025
So with this eye mask...

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:23.642
Ta-dah!

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:28.681
I have to microwave the pocket and put it in the mask.

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.467
Then it'll warm up my eyes and relax me!

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:33.235
Let's try it out!

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:35.204
Okay, it's heated up.

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:36.839
It's so warm!

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:39.792
Cherry seeds...

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:41.444
What does it smell like?

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.451
Sorry, wait...

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:51.687
What is this smell?!

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.807
It's nice!

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:56.759
It's really nice.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.177
Niiice!

00:01:58.177 --> 00:01:59.395
I think you're gonna get sleepy.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:01.680
Yeah, this is bad.
I think you're gonna get sleepy.

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:03.415
That was quick!

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:04.100
Yeah.
That was quick!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.468
This is not good.

00:02:05.468 --> 00:02:07.536
What should I do.

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:11.290
I guess I just keep talking and moving.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.076
What's with this hand movement of yours?

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:16.645
I'm showing I'm awake!
