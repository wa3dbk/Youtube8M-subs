00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:09.229
Philo Farnsworth was born in 1906 in Utah,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.140
and he soon became very interested in electronic,

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:16.200
for which he was particularly gifted.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.410
In 1920 for example, he invented a secured automobile starter,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.729
for which he sketched a plan during his chemistry class, and thanks to that,

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:28.421
he was able to demonstrate the anteriority of his invention

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.265
when other people wanted to patent it before him.

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:33.542
At only 14!

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:37.593
But Philo Farnsworth is mostly known as the inventor of television.

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:39.507
And how did the idea come to him?

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:45.192
Well, in 1920, when he was still 14, he was at his parents' farm,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.938
in Rigby, Idaho, and he was looking at the fields.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.705
And he saw something which is quite common in fields,

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:56.533
he saw the parallel furrows of the plowed fields.

00:00:56.584 --> 00:01:01.922
"Hey, if we aline horizontal lines, some dark and some clear,

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:07.332
couldn't we reproduce an image using cathode rays?"

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:10.261
Of course he didn't perfect that at only 14,

00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:11.938
it took him some years.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.316
He perfected it at the age of 21.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:20.944
And it's only in 1927 that his "Image Dissector" transmitted its first image,

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:25.995
which was a straight line. It may look like nothing but it was revolutionary.

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:32.113
So, of course, he didn't stop there, he improved the device which, on September 19, 1929,

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:36.409
transmitted its first real image, an image of Farnsworth's wife. 

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.406
[1st image on TV in History].

00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:41.623
Just so you know, before Farnsworth invented the cathode-ray TV,

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:44.282
televisions existed, only they were mechanical.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.163
Television was mechanical.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:50.271
And, just so you can see how badass Farnsworth was,

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:55.071
he also invented the first fusion reactor:

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.483
the Fusor.

00:01:56.534 --> 00:02:01.022
But you'll see that today, it's not really Philo Farnsworth I'm interested in,

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:05.852
but rather his brother-in-law:

00:02:06.102 --> 00:02:07.477
Cliff Gardner.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.262
Cliff Gardner was Farnsworth's brother-in-law.

00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:16.718
He worked in Oregon where he folded boxes on an assembly line.

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:21.662
But when he heard that Farnsworth was working on his television project, he thought:

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:25.147
"I have to help him, the poor guy is working all alone", etc. and so,

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:29.427
when he took a look at Farnsworth's project, even though he couldn't understand a thing,

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:33.117
he thought: "he'll need glass tubes at one point".

00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:37.570
So Cliff Gardner told Farnsworth "If you want, I'll learn how to blow glass,

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:38.912
and I'll make your tubes".

00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:42.878
Naturally, Cliff Gardner hadn't blown a single glass tube in his life, 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.374
he didn't know anything about glassblowing,

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:48.066
he didn't understand anything but he did as if he understood.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:51.293
And particularly, when Farnsworth went looking for investors,

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:56.294
Cliff Gardner presented himself as an expert, as if he had done that all his life.

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.119
And everyone went for it. What Cliff Gardner did there was just awesome.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:01.643
But of course, jokes aside,

00:03:01.694 --> 00:03:05.659
he spent months learning how to blow glass, and he succeeded.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.518
And so the first glass tubes of The Image Dissector were blown by Cliff Gardner.

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:13.840
Why did I choose to talk about Cliff Gardner? It's simple.

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.258
Indeed, Philo Farnsworth did all the work,

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.343
but without his brother-in-law he wouldn't have done all the work.

00:03:19.394 --> 00:03:23.023
And even if there aren't a lot of Philo Farnsworths in the world,

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:26.704
I'm convinced that anyone can be a Cliff Gardner.

00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:29.189
You, me, everyone.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.721
Take some time to e-penser (e-think).

00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:33.170
And that's cool.
