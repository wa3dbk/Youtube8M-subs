00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.540
Do you have an LCD panel display that doesn't have a tuner built into it?

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.550
Maybe you have a cramped space  and you'd like to be able to use

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.900
one display for your computer and  your television but maybe you don't 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.850
have a tuner built in to your computer  or you don't want to buy a tuner card.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.370
This is a device that is actually going to be  able to make your life a heck of a lot easier.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.200
It is the external ATSC QAM  TV Box from KWorld.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.610
Now, if you don't what  QAM or ATSC are,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.340
QAM and ATSC are the digital  television signals that you can receive.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.850
ATSC is over the air. That's the  one that you get with an antenna. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.950
And this box does come  with an antenna in the box.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.690
And QAM are the unencrypted digital signals that you get from your cable provider.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.230
And those will allow you to get high  definition television without paying for it.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.770
Like, you don't have to pay for  the cable system's HD package or 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.700
for the satellite HD package. You get free over the air,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.260
your local channels, and also over your digital cable your local channels as well.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.980
And this will make it really, really easy to  use your computer in conjunction with 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.650
your television. Let me show you around this thing and show you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.950
what we have going on.  Take a look at this.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
We have two different versions of this,  okay? One of them, and that's this one, 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.600
is the DVI version. And the DVI version is going  to be for computers that have DVI outputs

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.440
and TVs that have DVI inputs.  Of course, you can, with adaptors, 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.430
make this work  more to your liking. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
It also includes, right here  you're going to see your audio IO,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.720
Your antenna input is right here.  And your power input is right here.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.310
This is where you plug in the  antenna or your cable box.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.990
On the side are your outputs. It does  have component outputs on the side,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.990
in case you have component  inputs on your television set.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.400
And audio outputs here to run to either your stereo system or to your TV.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.930
On the front it has a USB port, which can be  hooked up to your computer so you can actually

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.770
turn your TV into  a digital photo frame.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.770
You'll be able to push all of your pictures  to this device for display on your television,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.270
if you like. And then, on the top  you're gonna find a few more controls.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.380
These are all the controls  for navigating the channels. 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.550
You can channel up, volume up, down and  navigating the menu system in this device.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
So, this is going to make  it easy. One touch access

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.600
between your TV and  your computer now.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.900
So, if you don't have a  digital tuner this is perfect

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.230
because it's going to make sure you  can receive those QAM and those ATSC

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.870
television programming signals without having to get a separate box.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.210
Without a separate converter box, and  especially if you're one of those people

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.540
that bought a television that  didn't have a tuner built in. 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.820
One of those high definition  displays that didn't have a tuner.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.590
This is perfect because it's got  a great digital tuner built right in.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.120
This one right here,  this is the VGA version.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.830
That's the only difference  between the two. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.870
One is VGA, one is HDMI so if  you have a system with only VGA,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.600
this is going to be perfect. And then you  have literally one touch access between it.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.600
So, if you're watching... if you're  watching TV with this remote control

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.320
right here you can very, very quickly switch  between TV and your computer right there

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.500
on your display without having  to go through any fuss at all.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.620
And it's going to take care  of it for you automatically.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.390
So, you can go from watching TV to using your computer, back to 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.860
watching TV just by using this little box right here.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.400
And it does have a very,  very high quality tuner built in. 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.600
If you haven't... If you haven't sort  of been turned on to the world of 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.670
digital programming, like, your local  channels actually have more stations now 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.390
than you can get over the air, and a lot  of times even through your cable system.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.800
So you can check...  out those new channels,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.710
local weather channels,  local news channels, 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.970
they all have them. And it's gonna make it  really, really easy for you to use one display

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.350
for, sort of, multiple  uses in your home.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.490
So, if your cramped for space or you  just want to keep everything in one spot,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.250
this is perfect and it's  gonna help you out.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.250
It's the KWorld  ATSC QAM TV Box.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.220
