00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.060
(ringing)

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.360
Hello?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.940
Do you like scary movies?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.420
No, I'm more of a
romantic comedy type person

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.200
Goodbye forever.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.400
How Scream Should Have Ended

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.640
There are certain rules

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.109
that one must abide by in order to
successfully survive a horror movie

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.089
Rule #1: Have parents that care
about you.

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:37.239
Mom, Dad, can I go to a party- uh I mean, spend the night at a friends house tonight?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.920
Ha! Stupid child, you're not leaving this house.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.120
There's a masked murderer on the loose.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.320
You never let me do anything!

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.060
Rule #2: Don't date crazy a-holes.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.480
Come on, Sid.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.400
I know someone just tried to kill you and all

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.400
but why won't you do it with me?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.180
Because, Billy.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.060
I'm not a slut that just puts out
all the time

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.160
So....

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.560
you're saying you're not like your
mom?

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.310
What?!?

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.640
Nothing. Stabs, stubby stab.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.300
Rule #3:

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.340
If you are being attacked inside a house that is filled

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.380
with people, who are your friends..

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.260
you should call out for their help.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.380
AHhhhhhhh! Help me! I'm trapped in the garage with the killer!

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.700
Hey you! Get him man!! Ahh!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.100
Help me! I'm trapped upstairs with the killer!

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.460
What? Let's get him!

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.260
Hey.. someone help me.. I'm trapped at school with the killer.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.600
Aw man.. Ahhhhh!!

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.679
Rule #4:

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.459
If friends aren't available, do more than
just run.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.660
If you know the killer off his feet because he's wearing a ridiculous costume

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.040
with terrible visibility,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.620
You have the upper hand.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.240
Don't keep running away.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760
Take that sucker out!

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.300
Kick him in the throat! Do something!

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.380
The dude is going to kill you.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.900
Rule #5:

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.880
Don't live where the police and investigative reporters are terrible at their jobs.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.210
Let's never ever, ever, ever, ever break up.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.780
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.900
Which brings me to rule #6:

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.040
911 and star 69.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.200
I have a question

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.700
Yea, you in the hat..

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.980
What do you do if the killer attacks you inside your dreams?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
Well that's something entirely different. If
that happens you j-- OH NO!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.880
Oh yes! Hahaha

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.960
Run everybody run! Forget the rules all you can do is run!

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.200
You're mine now!

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.260
Hahahahaha
