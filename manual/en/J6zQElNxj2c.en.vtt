00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:10.300
Matey, welcome aboard, cutlass, daggers, and swords, on Guard!  On Guard!

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.140
We’ll go on a trip, and we’ll travel by ship, not car.  Not Car.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.420
If you want to be a pirate,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.180
then go ahead and try it!  Say “YAARGH!”

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.640
YAARGH!

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.700
If you believe you’re a pirate, then you can’t deny it, you are!

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.360
We’ve accordion and flute, a drum and a lute and guitar.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.780
Guitar

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.360
So let's dance a jig, with a pot-bellied pig, bizarre!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.560
Bizarre!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.720
It’s all up for grabs, lobsters, oysters and crabs, caviar.  Caviar.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.260
So go ahead and try it, and be the pirate you are.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:10.720
Just say “AARGH!”   AARGH!  Pirates say “AARGH!”  AARGH! A Pirate you are!  “AARGH!”

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.520
Voyages are cold, damp, and soggy, wet, windy, and foggy so far.  So Far.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.360
We scream angry remarks: “Feed ‘em to the Sharks!” It’s not hard.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.020
Hang ‘em from the gallows!  Overboard to the shallows! AARGH!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.880
Aye, we do as we please, because we rule the high seas!  We’re in charge!

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:50.020
Just say “AARGH!”  AARGH!  Pirates say “AARGH!”  AARGH! A Pirate you are!  “AARGH!”

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.860
Treasure and jewels, sword fights and duels.  Laughing and chuckling, we’re always swashbuckling.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.340
Adventures and fun, in the tropical sun,
Pirates we are so “hardy-harr-harr!”

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.000
We’re staying up late because we navigate by the stars.  By the Stars

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.180
Taking great pleasure by searching for treasure, gold bars!  Gold Bars.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.220
Well, we’re off to Jamaica and willing to take you, we are!

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.740
So say sayonara, goodbye, farewell and aurevoir!

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:42.100
Or, Just say “AARGH!” AARGH!  Pirates say “AARGH!” AARGH!  A Pirate you are!  “AARGH!””

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:05.900
(Humming the tune.)
