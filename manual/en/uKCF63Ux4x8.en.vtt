00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.309
HONEST TRAILER: IRON MAN 2

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.459
VOICE
From the poor man's Joss Whedon,

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.860
comes the forgettable follow-up to
Iron Man, that's essentially just

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.320
killing time until The Avengers.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.160
VOICE (CONT'D)
Iron Man II.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.399
VOICE (CONT'D)
The completely dissappointing

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.700
sequel you fooled yourself into
liking just because it had Iron Man

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.110
in it.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.840
VOICE (CONT'D)
Suit up for a feature-length

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.390
version of the Nick Fury bonus scene from the
end of the first Iron Man.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.770
VOICE (CONT'D)
Which will still be unresolved by

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.320
the end of this movie.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.090
VOICE (CONT'D)
We've witnessed Tony Stark battle

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.050
global terrorism and his inner
demons, now prepare to see him take

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.930
on his biggest challenges yet...

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.590
VOICE (CONT'D)
Tedious government committees!

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.260
VOICE (CONT'D)
Corporate manuvering!

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.590
VOICE (CONT'D)
Low batteries!

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.880
VOICE (CONT'D)
Alcoholism?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.120
VOICE (CONT'D)
And some guy with a bird.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320
VOICE (CONT'D)
A sequel so inferior it will

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.670
replace an awesome origin story

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.330
with countless subplots you won't

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.010
remember as soon as you walk out of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.360
the theater

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.750
VOICE (CONT'D)
A story that ditches technology

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.610
grounded in reality for laughably

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.580
unrealistic magic holograms.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.990
VOICE (CONT'D)
And substitutes Jeff Bridges

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.670
with...Gary Shandling?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
VOICE (CONT'D)
Witness a superhero movie with just

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.390
enough Iron Man action to fill a 3

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.060
minute trailer...

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.049
VOICE (CONT'D)
...But not a feature length film.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.680
Trust us. We counted.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.490
VOICE (CONT'D)
Instead, sit back and watch Iron

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.740
Man...

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.229
VOICE (CONT'D)
Attend corporate events

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.400

Eat doughnuts

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.470
VOICE (CONT'D)
DJ birthday parties

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.729
VOICE (CONT'D)
And pee his pants

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.880
VOICE (CONT'D)
Experience the epic face off

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.770
between Iron Man and one of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.619
Marvel's least known villains:

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.759
Whiplash...

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.390
VOICE (CONT'D)
...Who's harnessed the most

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.889
dangerous modern technology ever.
Only to waste it...on a whip.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.529
VOICE (CONT'D)
A foe with no known super powers

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:26.529
who somehow survives being crushed
by a car, not once, not twice, but

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.329
four f**king times...

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.739
VOICE (CONT'D)
To defeat this madman, Iron Man's

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.840
bringing in backup, and they're all
just as boring as the rest of the movie:

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.870
VOICE (CONT'D)
Pepper Potts, an inconsistent nag

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.730
who totally cool with her boyfriend
being Iron Man...

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.849
But freaks out when he drives a
car...

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.349
VOICE (CONT'D)
Black Widow: A sexy spy shoehorned

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.650
into the movie, just to establish
her boobs for the Avengers.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.659
VOICE (CONT'D)
And Lieutenant Colonel James

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.029
Rhodes.

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.629
VOICE (CONT'D)
Nope, not that one.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.669
VOICE (CONT'D)
Yeah that's the one.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.809
VOICE (CONT'D)
Who has the skills to perfectly fit

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.069
in and pilot an Iron Man suit,
without any previous experience.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.519
VOICE (CONT'D)
Wait, didn't Tony need like half a

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.840
movie to learn how to work that thing?

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.059
VOICE (CONT'D)
A new chapter so thin, the key to

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.269
the entire plot is resolved by a 40

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.609
year-old easter egg from Tony's

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:17.449
dad...

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:22.840
VOICE (CONT'D)
...Who decades earlier somehow knew

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.040
his grown son would keep his old

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.680
diorama, put it in an impossible-to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.989
predict holographic computer

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.419
display, that can magnify

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.599
impossible amounts of detail, and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.559
reveal the chemical makeup of an

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:38.480
impossible to create element, which

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.159
Tony immediately synthesizes in

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.480
order to wrap up all loose ends.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.079
Ugh, someone got paid to write

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:47.389
this?
