00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
Oh, it's that time already.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.180
Oh, it's that time already!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.920
OH, IT'S THAT T- *beeeeep*

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.380
How's it goin' guys, I am Matthias, and today, Tipsy Elves sent me over some ugly Christmas sweaters for the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.100
holidays to see what I could come up with.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.000
Tttthey didn't know what they were getting into!!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Hope you like iiiiiit!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.980
Amanda: Okay, you ready to head out?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.280
Matthias: Honey, I was born ready.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.060
- Are you serious?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.520
- What? 'Cause we're matching?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.420
- We are NOT matching.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.540
What is that?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.700
- Honey, if I have to explain what this is, clearly this marriage isn't gonna work out, am I right? (laughs)

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.980
Nope. Nope, clearly I'm not- I'm not right. Ever.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.500
- That is the ugliest sweater I have ever seen.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.820
- Hence why I'm wearing it to the ugly Christmas sweater party.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.160
- You know I really hate it when you say the word "hence".

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.060
- Fine, I'll stop saying that.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.160
- An ugly sweater is supposed to be so over-the-top cutesy, that it crosses the border into ugly.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.440
- Then, how do you explain puppies and kittens?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.980
Because if that's not a cuteness overload, I don't know what is.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.920
- This is going to offend my family.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.240
- What are you, Mafia? (Mafia impression) "You offend my family. I'll cut off your thumbs."

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.160
- This is not the time to joke.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.240
- You know, I sensed that a couple jokes ago, when you weren't laughing.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.940
I'll stop.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.340
- You can't wear that. You have to take it off.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.840
- Uh-that's what she said.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.160
- Even if I was in a good mood, I wouldn't've laughed at that.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.360
- You really don't think your family will laugh about it?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.460
- Nope.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.400
- Well, not if they have your sense of humor.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.580
- Take it off.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.240
- You... always trying to get me to take off my clothes.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.520
- Is that... Grandma?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.680
Getting trampled by a-

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.520
- A reindeer, yep.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.220
- Put the other one back on.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.180
- But you just-

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.120
But you said-

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.640
- (whispers) Just do it.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.400
- Alright.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.280
Thanks for watching, guys. Hope you enjoyed that. I wanna give a shoutout to Tipsy Elves for sponsoring

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.220
this video. Tipsy Elves is famous for making the ugliest Christmas sweaters around.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.740
These are one-of-a-kind sweaters, and I guarantee you, they will turn heads.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.860
They got hilarious stuff, normal stuff, sweaters for men, ladies, kids...

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.580
One of my favorites is actually the "Santa Claws" Grumpy Cat.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.120
