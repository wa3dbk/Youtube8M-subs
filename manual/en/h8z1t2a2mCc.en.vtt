00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:07.474
- In 2007, Congress enacted
legislation that allowed VA

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.777
to fund limited programming to
support caregivers of veterans.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.912
From these pilot projects,
it became clear

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.614
that supporting caregivers

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.583
actually helps veterans,
as well.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.586
So from that came a much larger
piece of legislation

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.555
which has allowed VA to provide
unprecedented benefits

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.858
directly to these caregivers.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.731
- Hey, Matt.
- Hello.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.135
- Good to see you. Come on in.
- Thank you.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.703
How's everyone doing?

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.706
- Oh, everything is doing good.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.343
I was riding in the back seat
of a Humvee.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.879
We ran over an IED.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:51.284
I was ejected from the vehicle,
and I was instantly paralyzed.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.387
- When Josh returned
to us injured,

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.556
it was definitely life-changing

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.592
not only for me,
but for my entire family.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:03.830
No one is ever prepared
or expects

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:07.233
something like this
is going to happen to them.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.937
- The Elizabeth Dole Foundation
funded the Rand Corporation

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.674
to do a large study
on military caregivers,

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.210
and its findings are impressive.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.780
They estimate 5.5 million
caregivers of veterans,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.682
and 1.1 million of those

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:25.051
are taking care
of post-9/11 veterans.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.154
It's so important for VA
to develop programming

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.223
and provide supports
and services

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.325
to caregivers of veterans.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.628
- For the specific Family
Caregiver Program,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:39.332
the initial eligibility is that
you have to have been released

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:43.203
on or after September 11, 2001,

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.406
and have a service connected
related injury or illness

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.575
that happened
in the line of duty,

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.210
and after that,
we have to determine

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:51.878
if you're clinically eligible,

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.647
and what we're looking for
is the kinds of needs

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.783
the veteran has in the home.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:59.085
- Ms. Himan, how are things
going with you?

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.320
How's your stress level been?

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:03.523
- I can share many different
stories about caregivers

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.293
who were so thrilled
the first time a nurse came out

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.763
to their home to do a home visit
and couldn't believe

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.499
that the nurse was asking them
how they were doing

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.335
and how they felt
and how they were being impacted

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.670
by what was going on.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.506
Caregiver support coordinators
hear from caregivers

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.777
about how much the program
has changed their lives.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.680
- The service that
I am most blessed with

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.015
is the caregivers stipend.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.352
That has enabled me
to continue to support

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:35.689
and contribute to the family
financially

00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.324
because there's no way
that I could have a job

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.961
outside of my full-time
caregiving responsibilities.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.097
Another thing
that the stipend does is,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.832
I feel like it validates me.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.003
It validates my job,
the importance of what I do.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.838
- One of the biggest issues
that I hear

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:55.809
is the need for respite care
for the caregiver.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.345
The stress that they incur
while having to take care

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:01.014
of a loved one can be
pretty daunting,

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:05.185
and it's constant, and they need
some kind of break,

00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.354
for someone to come in and help
them take care of the veteran

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.690
while they step away
from the situation temporarily.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.793
- We imagined that
that support line would exist

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:17.063
for maybe a year or so,
and we imagined that most

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:20.367
of the questions would be
about the stipend program

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.603
for those who are caring
for post-9/11 veterans.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.473
Most of the caregivers who call
are caring for veterans

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.576
of the Korean era,
the Vietnam era,

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.378
the World War II era.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:34.447
We have just celebrated
the third anniversary

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.451
of the Caregiver Support Line,
and the support line

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:42.188
has received more
than 125,000 calls.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.958
- The OEF/OIF/OND era veterans,
these veterans

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.761
are very, very young,
and they have come back

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:50.697
with a complexity
of injuries and illnesses.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.066
- I think it's important
that veterans are taken care of

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.369
in their own home
from a psychological standpoint

00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.538
instead of going
to a nursing home.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.007
They can receive their care
from someone that they love

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.909
and that they trust.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.744
- My first initial rollout was,

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:08.314
19 caregivers were identified
initially in May of 2011,

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.651
and I'm up to 176 caregivers
and still counting,

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.386
and over the nation,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.556
I think we probably tripled
the expectation at this point.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.861
So we haven't looked back,
and we are just blazing ahead

00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:24.030
at lightning speed
with this program.

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:26.800
- We've been very excited
that military caregiving

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.135
has been a focus
of Joining Forces

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.172
for Michelle Obama
and Dr. Jill Biden.

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.975
It's really, I think, raised
the profile and allowed us

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.312
to put more focus and attention
on caregivers of veterans.

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.114
- Family members
are going to be caring

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.949
for our veterans
for a long time.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.418
We've seen that evidenced
by previous eras.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.454
We believe when we take care
of the family members

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.023
who care for our veterans,
our veterans do better.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:53.927
- I really have to spend a lot
of time and energy

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.663
devoted to daily care

00:04:56.696 --> 00:05:00.467
that I once took for granted,
and it's so awesome that VA

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.170
is providing for me to be
back in my home

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.906
and to have the best people
who love me unconditionally

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.508
take care of me.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.511
- No one can take better care
of him than I can,

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.314
and it's my privilege
and my honor

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:16.549
to care for him in my home.
