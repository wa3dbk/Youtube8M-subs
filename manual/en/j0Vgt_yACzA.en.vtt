00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.610
It happened Sixty-eight years ago that something crashed near Roswell, New Mexico. The first

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.310
press release was that the army had found a flying saucer. A day later the military

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.169
said that there was a mistake and that it was a weather balloon. Later, the army said

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.859
that it had been no weather balloon, but a plane that was part of the secret Project

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.230
Mogul.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.230
Since 1947, the Roswell UFO incident is surrounded with a lot of mystery. The man who played

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.570
a key role in the aftermath of the crash was Major Jesse Marcel who was working as an intelligence

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.190
officer of RAAF or Roswell Army Air Field.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.100
He was sent to the crash site to salvage the wreckage. He could not describe what he found.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.440
He found wreckage with a sort of hieroglyphics on them that nobody could decipher. The material

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.049
was flexible, but you could not break or burn. He also found a piece of metal that was as thick

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.920
as the layer of foil in a packet of cigarettes. When you hit it with a sledgehammer, it stays

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.369
undamaged. Major Marcel was convinced that the material did not originate from Earth.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:29.710
However, Several questions about the Roswell crash in 1947 remains unanswered:

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.689
What has crashed just outside Roswell in 1947? Was it a weather balloon, a spying device

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
or an alien ship? Did the military swapped the material that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.859
Major Marcel had salvaged and did journalists took pictures of a damaged weather balloon?

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.509
When the wreckage was not a weather balloon, where is the real wreckage?

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.029
Why should the army decide to make a press release about a flying saucer?

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:09.149
and go on. A poll was conducted by CNN-Time in 1997 and shows that 80 percent of Americans

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.930
think the government withholds information about the existence of extraterrestrial life

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.340
forms.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.120
If you could ask them one question, what question would it be? I want to read your thoughts

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.989
in the comment section. I also strongly recommend you to watch my latest video "German Parliament

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.459
