00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800 position:97%
[Sarah Harding] The Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, which is a modern dance company

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100 position:86%
located near Washington, DC, created this amazing dance

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:37.667 position:63%
performance related to the human genome.

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:43.367 position:94%
[Liz Lerman] You take a form like contemporary modern dance,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:44.933 position:58%
which is a little hard to understand;

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:46.633 position:73%
you take genetics, a little hard to understand.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:48.567 position:70%
You say, let's put them together and everyone

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:50.633
will understand.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700 position:63%
And it's like, how's that going to work?

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:53.833
But, actually, it does.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:56.867
[music playing]

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300 position:83%
[Sarah Harding] After seeing Ferocious Beauty Genome,

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:01.733 position:88%
members of the Dance Exchange and the NHGRI got together

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.040 position:86%
and created this idea for a workshop that would explore

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.040 position:72%
genomic science through dance specifically for

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
high school students.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.640 position:97%
[Carla Easter] The NIH team, composed of educators and researchers

00:01:11.507 --> 00:01:16.507 position:83%
along with the Liz Lerman dancers and choreographers,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:19.107 position:77%
decided to pull together, and create choreography

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:22.273 position:91%
or activities around subject matter that the students were

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:24.873
already familiar with.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.140 position:92%
The idea was to make it unique and something different from

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:29.107 position:80%
the way they were normally taught in their classes.

00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:31.273 position:97%
[Sarah Harding] The main goal is to teach the science through dance,

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:35.707 position:81%
and through the arts and really have that connection

00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:37.873
can be made.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.640 position:66%
About a month later, 70 students arrive at

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:43.673 position:56%
the Atlas theater in Washington, DC.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.540 position:64%
The students will have to choreograph one

00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:48.173 position:77%
of four topics in the groups they get split into,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.040
one of which is mitosis.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:53.707 position:97%
[Carla Easter] We've talked about mitosis as the dance of the chromosomes,

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:56.473 position:81%
because, again, it is just like a production, right?

00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:02.007 position:69%
We gave the students an overview of mitosis,

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:04.573 position:61%
taking them through the various phases,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.680 position:81%
and then we asked them to choreograph movements that

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:08.847
depicted each of those phases.

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:11.913 position:75%
[Elizabeth Johnson] I like the coilof the shape.

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:13.347
I like that idea of the mirroring.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.180
[Cynthia Delgado] Love the drag.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.280
[Elizabeth Johnson] The drag.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:18.113 position:86%
[Cynthia Delgado] Can't go wrong with the coil to drag.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.180 position:98%
[Elizabeth Johnson] I started to just implant places about speed.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.580 position:97%
[Carla Easter] We gave the students a few parameters to work within.

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:24.047 position:78%
The idea was for them to create something that was

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.880
totally their own.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.480 position:88%
Hopefully, the students will create something that their

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:29.647 position:81%
peers will enjoy but that also their peers will gain

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:32.113
a new understanding of the science,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.680
and in this case, it was mitosis.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.680 position:78%
[Elizabeth Johnson] Break and down, you guys stay.

00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:38.947 position:83%
Let's start, break, break -- nope, no, no, you break;

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.080
you guys will be dragging.

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:45.447
Okay, I was wrong.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.480
Break and drag.

00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:50.847 position:97%
[Sarah Harding] The students have about two hours to learn the

00:02:48.847 --> 00:02:53.847 position:77%
major concepts of mitosis, explore those concepts

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:57.047 position:83%
through dance and movement, and then create brand new

00:02:55.647 --> 00:03:00.647 position:86%
choreography that essentially will teach other students

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.180
those major concepts in mitosis.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:07.087 position:73%
After they're done creating their choreography,

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:09.153 position:94%
they'll have the opportunity to perform it for their friends

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:12.553 position:75%
and other students who are part of the workshop.

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:15.287 position:98%
[Elizabeth Johnson] There we go, now we have two identical chromosomes,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.420
sister chromosomes.

00:03:14.887 --> 00:03:19.887
Give yourself a round.

00:03:16.253 --> 00:03:21.253
Let's do it from the top.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.220 position:75%
[Carla Easter] Our students are dancing mitosis,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320
if you can believe that.

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:28.753
[music playing]

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:36.187 position:97%
[Carla Easter] They are dancing what happens when mitosis happens right,

00:03:34.353 --> 00:03:39.353
and when it goes awry.

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:41.153
[music playing]

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360 position:64%
[Student] I died because I'm the protein.

00:04:06.393 --> 00:04:11.393 position:61%
I'm the protein that died in the cells,

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:13.593 position:72%
and then afterwards, they become corrupted and

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:16.093 position:89%
they become cancer cells and they die eventually as well.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:19.593
[Elizabeth Johnson] Excellent work.

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:21.293 position:89%
In 15 minutes you have two very different representations

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:24.793
of mitosis.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
You worked as a team.

00:04:22.627 --> 00:04:27.627 position:98%
You know, it's not exactly easy to collaborate with seven other

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:30.827 position:72%
people to make something, especially in such a

00:04:28.027 --> 00:04:33.027 position:56%
short amount of time, so -- awesome.

00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:36.893 position:66%
[Sarah Harding] Now it's performance time.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.760 position:92%
You can tell the students are excited and probably a little

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:41.327 position:59%
bit nervous to show what they've done,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.860 position:67%
what they've created for the other students

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:46.293
and for their friends.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.060 position:81%
[Carla Easter] I am really excited for the students.

00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:49.627 position:77%
They've put together two very creative and unique

00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:51.793
performances that depict mitosis.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.560
[music playing]

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:57.827 position:98%
[Monique Scott] I wanted them to see biology in terms of how it relates

00:04:57.927 --> 00:05:02.927 position:89%
to them, not just what they're reading from the textbook,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.500 position:98%
but -- and how other people are actually interested in science.

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:09.167 position:88%
It is not just the geeks and the nerds who like science.

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:11.733 position:83%
You have dancers, now, who are interested in science.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.300
[music playing]

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.100 position:97%
[Emily Young] One of the comments that one of my students said

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.700 position:77%
was that she said it was much freer than being in

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:25.967 position:73%
the classroom, like you got to actually explore

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:28.067 position:92%
something, an explanation and different means of explaining

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:31.933 position:86%
a concept they knew already about and just learned from

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:34.433
a book or from a microscope.

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:36.467
[music playing]

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200 position:97%
[Cynthia Delgado] We want them to have a new way to learn science,

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:45.867 position:73%
and something they can have fun with and maybe,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.900 position:94%
you know, learn something new about science that they didn't

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:51.133 position:92%
know before or take something they learned in the classroom

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:53.767
and expand on it.

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:55.533
[music, laughter, and applause]

00:05:55.267 --> 00:06:00.267 position:95%
[Carla Easter] I think what surprised me was that, initially,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.900 position:78%
the students were very tentative about doing this,

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:04.267 position:72%
and by the end of it, they really got into it.

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:06.773 position:80%
I mean, they really -- they really were visualizing

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.840 position:61%
what mitosis looked like through dance.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:10.707 position:92%
And I am so impressed with them because all the inhibitions

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:13.107
were gone.

00:06:09.807 --> 00:06:14.807
[cheering and applause]

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:23.607
[music playing]

00:07:13.213 --> 00:07:18.213
[music playing]
