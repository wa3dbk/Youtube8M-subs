00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.320
First i'm going to take out the water block
Take the cap off

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.070
Un-peel the double-sided tape
and stick it roughly in the middle of the decorations

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Next i'm going to pipette water into the reservoir at the front

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.460
This is what keeps the nest hydrated

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.300
Now i'm going to put some food in the feeding
bowl

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.300
You need to make sure you only put a small amount in the bowl

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:46.100
Place the bowl underneath the water block

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.140
Now i'm going to block up one of the access ports with cotton wool

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.700
Now i'm going to connect the pipe to the nest. To do this you take a piece of cotton wool,
wrap it around the end of the tube

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.400
and secure it with a piece of tape

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.780
Now connect the other end to the port that is not blocked by cotton wool

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:43.660
Next take the cotton wool bung out of the test tube
and connect it onto the pipe

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.260
Just to make sure the test tube doesn't become
detached i'm just going to put a small piece

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.220
of tape over the test tube and pipe to keep
it secure

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.040
Finally I am going to cover the nest with
a cloth, this will encourage the ants to move

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.080
into their new home.
