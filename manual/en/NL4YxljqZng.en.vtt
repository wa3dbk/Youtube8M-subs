00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.139
The next step in the acrylic application,
is we're going to apply a gel resin. The reason

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.659
we're doing that is because Sara has a French
tip. If she had just the natural tip, then

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:21.750
we would apply either a gel resin. Just to
make it shinny or polish of the color of her

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.390
choice. I dust it off the natural nails. I'm
going to pull out my UV light. Because the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:37.780
gel is a UV gel. And the light is what cures
it to a hard finish. We're just going to start

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.350
by putting it on all four fingers. On both
hands first. And stick them in the light for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:01:02.510
three to five minutes. Then we're going to
put it on her thumbs.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:25.619
And cure this for three to five minutes in
the light, as well.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.380
They do make UV lights, big enough to put
both hands in. Go ahead and stick this one.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.180
At once. But the reason I like waiting to
do the thumbs last. Is so that the gel doesn't

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:49.600
run down to one side of the nail. While it's
turned on its side.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.799
Some gels, you have to wipe off after they're
cured. Just to get a last little bit of tackiness

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:15.900
off. And some should cure to a high shine,
tack free finish. Can't stick this further.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:30.870
Once the fingers have cured. We can go ahead
and pull them out. And do the thumb nails.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:43.420
And stick them in.
Again, look at the bottle of the resin you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:53.629
have to see. How long you need to do it for
almost or three to five minutes.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:01.069
After they've cured for the full time. You're
going to see that you have a high shine to

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.800
the nails. And that is how you apply the resin
to the acrylic.
