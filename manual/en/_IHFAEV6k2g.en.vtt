00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.200
Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.090
and today I wanna show you a product
spotlight on a new finding kit that we've

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.859
produced. This is a head pin and an eye pin 
assortment

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.240
and it comes in a silver plate and a 22 karat gold plate

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.570
I'll flip it over and show you what's included in these. They're identical

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.860
except for the finish

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.960
you're gonna get 6

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.850
different types of jewelry findings in here.
You'll get 3 head pins

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.629
and they come in three different lengths. One inch, two inch, and 3 inch

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.720
Those are the more common ones and you'll three different types of eye

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.640
pins

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.460
a one-inch, a 1.5 inch and a 2-inch. Again some really common lengths and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.000
they're all in 22 gauge

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.309
you'll get a total of 90 pieces

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.630
and what's nice is when you're often doing a jewelry project you don't always need a lot of

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.329
one particular size but you do sometimes need a bunch of different sizes

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.090
so that's what we've done. We've put these all together so that they're

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.280
convenient for you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.600
I'll open up a pack real quick and show
you what they look like

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.600
you get quite a few in here

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.110
again you're gonna get ninety pieces and that
consists of three different

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.890
sizes of head pins and three different sizes of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.020
eye pins

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.310
this will make quite

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.520
a few jewelry projects. Some really nice long
ones

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.810
and then you've got some really great shorter ones too. If you're just new to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.790
jewelry making

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.210
this here is an eye pin. It has an eye on the
end

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.290
and then a head pin looks like this

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.590
It's got a little head on the end. What you
can do with these and I'm going to show you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.560
real quick

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.460
you could take a bead. I'm going to show you quickly

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.100
how to just make a simple loop. Now of course if you're just going to have a bead like

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.509
this, actually this is a prime example why it's
good to have an assortment pack

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.470
you would not use a three-inch head pin. You'd wanna find

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.739
a smaller one which is great that this pack

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.489
has a smaller one. So I'm gonna show you
how to make a

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.400
simple wire loop with a pair wire looping pliers

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.760
just compress and that makes half of your loop for you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.489
rotate and then you snip

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.029
and now instead of having a ton of extra
waste

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.159
you just have a little bit/ Straighten up that loop

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.489
so again this is a great assortment. It'll allow you to do a lot of different

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.749
jewelry projects yet not have to buy a
lot of different products

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.620
you'll be able to get everything in this
one kit and this is the head pin

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.049
and eye pin assortment. Again on the back it'll show you exactly what you get

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.639
and we'll have that in the product description as well on the website.
