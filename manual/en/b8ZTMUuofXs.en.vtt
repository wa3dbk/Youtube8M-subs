One of the most important things when choosing
out the glasses, if not the most important

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.540
thing is picking out glasses that fit your
personality. What do you want your glasses

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.730
to be, how are they going to describe you?
You are going to be wearing them; most people

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
are going to be wearing them all the time.
Do you prefer things that are going to have

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.030
color and be very bold or do you prefer the
inconspicuous drill mount look to the glasses?

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.590
There are lots of different options for you
to choose and you need to determine what are

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.879
your glasses going to do for you. So as women
you have lots of different choices, lots of

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.920
different colors, lots of different patterns
to choose from. We have all these different

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.859
colors of zyle frames, these plastic frames;
we have blue, brown, orange, very thick, you

00:00:51.859 --> 00:01:01.649
know the thicker style frames. We have the
less conspicuous but not totally rimless kind

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.300
of a, I guess what I’m going to again call
a more mature look, okay, so these frames

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.330
are going to be a little bit bigger on you,
so you also want to make sure that they are

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.161
not going to be obtrusive okay. You want them
to fit, you know, your personality, if you

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.730
like bright red, you should go with the bright
red, you know, try the bright red frames,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.270
so people are very surprised with how bold
colors actually turn out looking on them.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.750
So pick something that fits you, if you’re,
you know ambitious, maybe you know for lack

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.830
of a better word, maybe a little bit more
funky, a little bit more trendy. Try something

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.140
that kind of demonstrates that with your glasses
and go with something that’s a little bit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.060
more bold. If you don’t want them to be
noticed, if you want them to be a little less

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.500
conspicuous try a rimless, you know try, try
to go with something a little, a rimless or

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.820
semi-rimless so that they will kind of blend
in a little bit better, so your glasses describe

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.000
you so make sure that you pick out something
that is representative.
