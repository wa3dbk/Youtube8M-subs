00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.750
Today, on this 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 8-foot
bed, were going to install part number c15607

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.140
from Curt.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.930
One thing known about this hitch is that its
designed to go underneath the factory hitch.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.980
All right, the first thing we need to do is
go ahead and install the hardware inside the

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
frame.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.029
There are two large round holes thatll have
blocks installed on top of them.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.070
All right, to slide our block in place we
use a long piece of wire, well route it through

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.370
the frame, through the hole were going to
use.Then, well slide the block on and then

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.370
push into the frame.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:41.160
Well also put a kink in the wire to help pull
the block through the frame and out the hole.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:52.510
Then, well take our bolt leader that comes
with the kit; well push it through the block

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.289
and out the access hole on the side of the
frame.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.780
Then, pull our hardware through.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.979
Now, at the very end of the frame all we got
to do is just place the block in the opening

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:18.890
by hand and we will take our bolt leader and
run it straight up and through the cross tube

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.520
of the bumper structure and then out the side.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:40.909
Then, we can thread on our bolt.Were done
with the passenger side.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:02:00.359
Well go ahead 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:38.680
and repeat the same steps on 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:03:29.019
the 
driver side.
