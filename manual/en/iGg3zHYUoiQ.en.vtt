00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:13.430
That's right. We are the guards of this world. Verdarduke.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.930
Our world is not going to end like this!

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.650
Huh? It is Ni no Kuni.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.910
The world in another reality [Ni no Kuni].

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.560
A world with no limits.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.250
Train the warriors coming from your heart.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.390
Complete the spells collection "Magic Master".

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.760
Create objects with the "Alchemic pot".

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.840
I... must go... I must go back with them!

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270
I thank you again, Oliver.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.770
Go, Oliver. It is because of this that you have been traveling, don't it?

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.780
Mi-Miaw, is that true?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.790
You haven't forgotten, right? I am also a member of your team.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.990
Good luck, Oliver. Take care!

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.590
Having gotten this far... you can't turn the tides!

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.730
I gave everyone a present

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.770
I did it very clumsily.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.570
I said shut up!

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.770
There it goes!

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.380
I think it is my turn to put you up to the test.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.480
Powerful enemies await Oliver and his friends.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.180
A marvelous story and a great fantasy adventure!
