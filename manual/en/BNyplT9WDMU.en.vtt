00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.269
Today on Chuck Knows Church we are talking about King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.990
['gesundheit' behind camera] Ok.. sounds pretty tough doesn't he, this King Nebuchadnezzar ['gesundheit' behind camera] 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.150
Alright, sounds biblical even this king

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.970
whatever his name may be. But do you
really know who he is?

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.990
Now, in Sunday School I was a little bit
confused

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.600
of course that might have been Cynthia
Burlingame's fault. Maybe be her that

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.500
confused me.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.020
Too much information? Too much
information... ah, that being said we are

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.980
talking about

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.789
King Nebuchadnezzar ['gesundheit' behind camera] on this
episode

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.469
of Chuck Knows Church.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.440
[Intro music begins]

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.980
While King Nebuchadnezzar ['gesundheit' behind camera] 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.700
Ugh... is known by most students of the
Bible for destroying Solomon's temple

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.160
and not for some semi-autonomous
convulsive expulsion of

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.470
air from the lungs through the nose and
mouth more commonly known as the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.070
sneeze. Okay? Thank you..

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.570
Can we move on? Thank you for your
permission I didn't need.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.530
King... 'Neby'

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.450
defeated the southern kingdom of
Judah and destroyed Solomon's temple.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
Now in doing so he captured the Jews and
carried them away to Babylon

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.330
which became known as the 'Babylonian
Exile'. You can find this in the Bible

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.090
and 2 Kings chapter 25, but remember
this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.619
as powerful as 'Neby' was

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.890
he did not come, conquer, and destroy the
people and Judah by himself.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.649
It was not something that God just
allowed to happen,

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.500
right, more importantly, God actually
brought it about

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.820
as it says in 2 Chronicles chapter
36.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.490
The people were corrupt and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990
they refuse to repent. They trusted in
themselves

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.580
in the city of Jerusalem, even in the
physical temple so

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.840
God, through Nebuchadnezzar, punished them all.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.860
Now, can you guess who was among the Jews deported from Judah to Babylon?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.920
Certain young man responsible for some
of the most

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.280
incredible biblical prophecies perhaps?..
That prophets name anyone?..

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.579
Yes! Daniel ['gesundheit' behind camera] Okay that's not even--

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.670
that's not even close. So that doesn't even
sound like a sneeze, you're just--

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.110
Don't... don't be bitte, alright?Just...

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.940
[sigh]

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.030
Anyway yes, hi, yes, Daniel was there,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.790
but thats another story for another day
episode 95 perhaps.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.630
Interestingly, King 'Neby' was also
the king who had Shadrach, Meshach and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.959
Abednego thrown into a fiery furnace when
they did not worship the golden statue

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.629
that he had set up. Now, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.660
were the Jews appointed over the affairs
of the province

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.810
of Babylon by Kind 'Neby'. Now when they
were thrown into the furnace

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.840
a blazing fire, along with a fourth
person

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.660
seen in the blaze, they did not die. See
once

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.700
again God used 'Neby' to deliver a
message to his chosen people.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.599
Now he was also the one who submitted Daniel to the lions den then saw him walk free,

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.440
which is another message from God. You see King Nebuchadnezzar

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.720
is integral to the message God had
for his people exiled in Babylon.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.810
And hopefully we now better understand
the role that he had

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.450
in the Old Testament Scriptures. And
that's nothing to sneeze at

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.000
Right? [seems amused with himself]

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.080
Now you don't like sneeze jokes? Now you're too

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.010
too good for sneeze jokes now? If
you would like to know more be sure to

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.000
ask your pastor.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.500
Tell them Chuck sent you. ['gesundheit'] haha! Jinx, you owe me...

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.600
Really?
