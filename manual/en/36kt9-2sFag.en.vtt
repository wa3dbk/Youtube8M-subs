The Fleur De Lys Knit Stitch Pattern

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.960
Hi, Guys, I’m Kristen and Welcome to Studio
Knit!

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:17.650
It’s Knitting Lesson Monday and today we
are knitting the Fleur de Lys vintage pattern.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.650
Fleur de Lys are a stylized French Lily.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are going to knit with two colors using
stranded color work.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:40.219
We begin by Casting on in multiples of six
plus three. So, I cast on six, then another

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
six, and I'm ending my cast on with three
more stitches.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.800
So, we begin by knitting in the blue for three
stitches. And then you'll see that within

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.989
the aestericks, we are going to repeat that
pattern for the length that you have stitches

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:12.149
on your needle. So, we begin with one white
knit stitch, and then five blue knit stitches.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.720
And we continue within those aestericks the
W1 and the B5, the one White and the five

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.720
Blue, until you reach the end of your needle.
In stranded colorwork, we always work our

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.840
accent color, so this is, like the white yarn
that we're using. We are going to keep that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.340
on top of the blue yarn. And you'll see a
little bit more of that demonstrated as we

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.340
go along. And now we are going to Purl one
with our white yarn and we always keep that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:08.220
on top of the blue. And then, within the aestericks,
we are going to do three blue purl stitches

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.140
and three white purl stitches. Until we reach
our last two stitches on our needle. And those

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:45.620
will be two blue purl stitches. 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.620
Next on row
three, we begin with knitting three blue stitches,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:10.920
and again, just like row one, within the aestericks,
we are going to do one white stitch 
and five blue stitches and keep repeating

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.450
that until you get to the end of your needle.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.450

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.090
Here on row four, it's a purl row and we begin
with two blue stitches. And again, we are

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.060
keeping our white accent color on the top
of our stranded colorwork and we will do one

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.340
white stitch and five blue purl stitches all
the way down our needle. And here's how our

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.790
stranded colorwork is shaping up so far. Pretty
cool! Okay, row five! We are going to knit

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.160
two white stitches and then within the aestericks
there, we are going to repeat, we are going

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.160
to go three blue stitches and three white
stitches and we will keep repeating the blue

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.940
three and the white three until we get to
our final stitch, which will be one blue stitch.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.160
Okay, row six! It's our very last row of the
series. And so we are going to do purling

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.449
beginning with purl blue two times and then
within the aestericks, we'll do one white

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.449
purl and five blue purls and we will repeat
what's within the aestericks there the one

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:12.540
white and the five blue until we get to our
very final stitch and that will be one white

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.650
purl stitch.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.650
So, here’s how our wrong side looks with
our stranded colorwork, and the gorgeous FLEUR

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.650
DE LYS pattern on the right side.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.360
Repeat these six rows and continue your knitting
for the length you desire in the FLEUR DE

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.500
LYS pattern!
