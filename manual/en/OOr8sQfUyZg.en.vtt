The Contract board is a brand new board for
Forum this year. This is what we are calling

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.039
our urban board. Basically the whole idea
with urban, a lot of snowboarding has gone

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.300
to the streets, not specifically just on the
mountain. This one is kind of developed with

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.270
that in mind. It is designed for concrete
ledges, hand rails, and things like that.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.280
The thing with the Contract, it has what is
called the Bad Ass package. Since this is

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.640
going to be ridden in the urban environments
-- concrete, rails, and things like that -- we

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.550
beefed up the fiberglass, and beefed up the
core. The side rail and the edges, all of

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.050
this stuff, is 20% stronger than what we use
on the rest of the line. The profile of this

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.469
is what is called top camber. It is a camber
board but the camber doesn't go all the way

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.699
out to the contact points. You have a little
pop zone here which is going to give you more

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.280
power for higher ollies and additional benefit
for that is being able to press and lock on

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.179
to a ledge or a rail and things like that.
It is really rad. You are going to get a lot

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:21.479
more energy out of this than say a reverse
camber or a rocket board. Another cool thing

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.909
here is the zero to sixty base. Zero to sixty
base is designed to get you up to speed quickly.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.799
It is not a real high-end speed but it is
meant for quick drop-ins. You have 20 feet

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.659
to get up to speed to get an ollie onto the
rail. The way they do that is the difference

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.890
in the molecular makeup of the base. It is
nothing more than just rearranging some molecules

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.149
in the base. It does not have as much top
end speed but it will get you up to speed

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:05.520
faster than other boards. It is a full twin
tip board. Graphically, it definitely stands

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.550
out. A couple of the other sizes have some
other sayings on there. You can check them

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.469
out on the website. This particular one is
the 148. It says Rock. You can kind of figure

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:20.560
out what the rest of them say. That is about
it on the Contract.
