00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.180
The Concept Department is the department that produces

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.958
concept art in the form of illustration.

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.895
The main goal of the Concept Department is to deliver a visual

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.517
presentation in terms of design, moods, and ideas.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:31.137
Which will be used in our animation production.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:37.075
The Concept Department is among one of the

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:39.170
most important aspects of the production.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.908
All pre-production plans and decisions are made and executed here.

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.782
By doing so we are able to facilitate other departments

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:48.811
such as the modeling department so that

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.305
they can produce their work more smoothly.

00:00:53.177 --> 00:00:57.538
Ok, what is the difference between a concept artist and an illustrator?

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:01.646
The difference is that concept artists do not just illustrate anything

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:04.590
Usually our job involves visual problem solving.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.100
For example, the size of the characters, characteristics,

00:01:10.377 --> 00:01:16.463
background moods, coloring, lighting, and many other effects.

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.804
For anyone who is interested to become a member of

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:24.893
the Concept Art Department,

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:30.742
the quali..quali..quali..quali..qualification!

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.606
