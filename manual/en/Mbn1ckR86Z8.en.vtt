00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.850
Good day ladies and gentlemen I'm Tom and
today I want to talk about printer calibration

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.530
and especially about the way that you can
screw thing up now first of all let me take

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.719
a step back the RepRap project and therefore
pretty much the entire hobby grade 3D printing

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.000
market started out as a dive into the unknown
nobody had done it before it was basically

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.230
the idea hey this is something that is absolutley
doable now when the patents are gone without

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.539
anybody really being afraid of the complexity
of the entire project so people started building

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.630
these monstrosity of 3D printers that were
the RepRap Darwin and later the Sells and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.760
the first Prusa Mendel and as they ran into
problems they came up with impromptu solutions

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.230
to them many of these solutions are still
being passed around today even though there

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.820
were only really intended as clutches to get
your print quality and your parts from unusable

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.340
to really bad compared to todays standards
but they still work for that one case so they

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.640
must be good right? well not so much one of
these clutches that I would finally put to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.740
rest today is the process of calibrating your
steps per mm setting for any axis other than

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.330
the extruder now the usual
process for that involves printing a 10mm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.360
test cube and then adjusting the firmwares
X Y and often also Z steps per mm values

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.270
until that cube measures exactly 10.00mm
of course depending on how hard you press

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.480
your calipers together now if that doesn't
already sound wrong to you well let me bring

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.430
in a car analogy I know some people hate
those but you know haters gotta hate say you

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.670
drive a car most of us do and you noticed
that it always seems to pull to the left so

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.680
obviously you adjust the steering because
that makes you car drive in a straight line

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.060
and that all fine and dandy until you also
noticed that your car now tends to spin out

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.880
in corners and completely misbehaves when
it´s raining well turns out adjusting the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.040
steering isn´t all that smart when your drive
around with a flat tire and that´s exactly what

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.270
your doing when trying to calibrate a 10mm
cube to exact right size not only is getting

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.840
the filament diameter and extrusion multiplier
right much more straight forward option but

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.520
your also forgetting that our 3D printers
aren´t really precision instruments that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.580
can even print that accurately just the mechanical
parts ripple, slop, backlash can easily throw

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.620
you off by a tenth of a millimeter and if you
compensate for that one tenth of a millimeter

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.920
that the 10mm cube is off well guess what
the next time you print something that is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.920
larger say 100mm aka. 4 inches you will have
overcompensated the entire thing and instead

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.709
of a tenth of a millimeter you will end up
with an entire millimeter off the dimensions

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.620
that you where going for so what i´m saying
here is basically use the ideal calculator

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.410
steps per millimeter timing belts and threaded
rods witch are things that usually drive X

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.879
Y and Z axis of our printers are made to pretty
tight tolerances they need to work with

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.810
every other bit of the equipment that uses
the same profile witch means that the worst

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.150
case scenario for the ideal steps per millimeter
setting is it being of by much less than half

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.390
a percent to figure out the settings that you should
ideally use head over to Prusas calculator

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.040
witch I have linked to in the description
it´s awesome I have linked to it before bit

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.970
it´s just so so good of course if you are
not using belts or using an extremely large

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.540
printer it might actually be a valid idea
to calibrate the steps per millimeter for X

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.140
and Y since like I said half a % is going
to make noticeable difference in larger parts

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.540
I have uploaded some files to Youmagine witch
you can use to properly calibrate those setting

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.319
without the results being skewed by for example
the extrusion multiplier being off by a bit

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.950
so now that we have that out of the way what
are the things about your printer that you

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.150
actually need to empirically calibrate? well
it´s not much actually there is of course the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.910
extruder steps per millimeter setting and the
extrusion multiplier witch I show you here

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.290
how to get those right then there is the entire
topic of print speed, jerk, acceleration setting

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.750
those usually boil down to how much of your
print quality your willing to give up for

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.769
faster speeds pro tip if you just can´t seem
to get a print right slow it down like print

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.780
at half the speed and you will usually end
up with a much better print and even if not

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.840
you get a better look at what else is going
wrong for the basic speed setup thing I made

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.790
a long version witch you can watch here other
than that there really isn´t much you need

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.080
to calibrate per say of course for many slicer
setting there is only a certain range of values

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.889
that makes sense but I would not consider
that printer calibration rather it´s you

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.850
who is learning how far you can go with those
settings given experience 3D printer operator

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.630
any machine that´s mechanically sound and
well build and they will make it print extremely

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.060
well also most slicers now a days will give
you pretty darn nice prints without any tweaking

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.020
or calibrating beyond simply mashing in the
basic data about your printer and deciding

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.940
how your part should be printed there are
of course concerning about print temperature

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.650
retracts and so on but most of those either
work pretty well with the default settings

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.680
or you need to be set depending on what filament
you are using so also not really something

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.220
that you need to calibrate your printer for
since it´s rather a property of the filament

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.050
so to sum things up don´t try to hard to
calibrate every last bit of precision out

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.490
of your printer the technology especially
the software aka. slicers is still under heavy

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.960
development it´s continuously being improved
for example the new experimental build of

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.580
slicer the one with 3 in it´s name so sly 3 r added a feature to compensate for fitting

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.280
errors without messing everything else up
basically exactly what the cube calibration

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.550
is trying to do just with a difference that
that is how it´s should actually be done right

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.360
now that feature is still in beta but by the
time you are watching this video it might

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.080
already be in a stable build so that´s it
for today I hope you learned something if

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.480
you did please leave a like that really helps
me out mostly because then it means I see people

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.410
are actually enjoying my videos also please
leave a comment if you have any questions

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.060
left I usually don´t reply to private messages
because those really only help out a single

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.479
person if you have an issue you need help
with please at least post publicly in the

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.380
comments or preferably in a forum or in the
google plus 3D printing community that way

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.780
that knowledge gets publicly documented and
other people who run into the same problem

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.650
can at least google for it I´m probably also
going to do another Q&amp;A soon so any question

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.020
might get answered there as well one more thing
I´m going to be at hackaday Munich on november

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.880
13th so you´re there to come say hello I will
probably be building and hacking stuff maybe

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.980
not entirely 3D printing related but close
so as always thanks for watching see you next week
