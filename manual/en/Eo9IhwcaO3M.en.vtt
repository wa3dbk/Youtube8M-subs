Welcome to this episode of Help Desk TV.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.950
My name is Rudy Stebih.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.320
Today we will provide a quick overview of
the new Windows 8 Consumer Preview release.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
There are a lot of new things to explore in
Windows 8 Consumer Preview.

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300
So here’s a quick overview.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.310
The first screen you see when you log in to
Windows 8 is the new Start screen.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:39.170
Here you Pin apps, contacts, and websites
to easily access what you use most.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.760
Tiles and notifications show what’s new
so you can get important info and updates

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520
at a glance.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.270
You can get to the Start screen anytime by
pointing your mouse to the lower-right corner

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.260
of the screen, and when the charms menu appears,
click the Start Windows logo.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.420
You can also use the Windows logo key on your
keyboard to get to Start screen.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.850
Windows 8 comes with a new app store.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.840
You can browse, search, see staff picks, or
view lists of the most popular apps to find

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.540
exactly what you want.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.600
Click on the Windows Store tile on the Start
screen to get started.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.010
When you sign in with a Microsoft account,
your PC is connected to the cloud and:

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.450
Your friends’ contact info and status automatically
stay up to date from places like Hotmail,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.920
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.890
You can get to and share your photos, docs,
and other files from places like SkyDrive,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.729
Facebook, and Flickr.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.590
Your personal settings are synced to any PC
running Windows 8 Consumer Preview that you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.619
sign in to, including your themes, language
preferences, browser favorites, and apps.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.009
You can get apps in the Windows Store and
use them on any PC running Windows 8 Consumer

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.810
Preview that you sign in to.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.220
The charms menu provide new and better ways
to do things you’ve always done.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.650
Here’s a glimpse of what each charm does—but
they can do a lot more, so explore what they

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.540
can do for you.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.130
The Search charm is a powerful new way to
find what you’re looking for.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.590
When you enter a search term, you can check
results from your PC, the web, or within different

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.320
apps—all from the same place.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.840
The Share charm lets you send links, photos,
and more to your friends and social networks

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.930
without leaving the app you’re in.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.140
The Start charm takes you to Start screen
or, if you’re on the Start screen, back

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.370
to your last app.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.060
The Devices charm is a handy way to do things
like sending files and streaming movies to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.989
printers, TVs, and more.

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.210
The Settings charm is how you do basic tasks
like shutting down your PC and changing the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.210
volume.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.810
It’s also used by apps to configure things
like account and privacy settings.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.400
As you can see, the charms appear on the right
side of your screen.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.970
Just move your mouse to the lower-right corner
to see them, and then choose the one you want.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.670
We’ll be diving into these individual charm
items in later videos.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.489
