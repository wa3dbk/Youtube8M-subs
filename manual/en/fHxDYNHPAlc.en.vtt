00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You wouldn't do this, I mean
it would be so destroying -

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
to sort of schlep your arse around the world
on long tours unless -

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you'd really believe in what you do,
and we still believe it.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
We'll keep banging away
until we stop ourselves.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My attitude is that anyone who doesn't
like U2 just isn't trying hard enough.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Although we haven't made announcements yet
there may be extensions to this tour.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Songs that we thought were unplayable
are now beginning to sound quite good.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
They're beginning to sound like songs
we've been playing for 30 or 40 years.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
People tell me, even if they
don't like our band that -

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
- if you go to a U2 show
and the band walks out on stage,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.000
through an involountary action the hairs
in the back of your neck might just go up.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
People who don't like the band
say it even happened to them.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What they don't know,
is that that happens to us.
