Alright, at this point what we want to do
is write an introduction. All interps have

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.700
an introduction. Now, don't think in terms
of they have an introduction, a body and a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.390
conclusion like a structured speech, because
they don't have any of that. The body is actually

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.640
the dialog that you've cut. But you need to
have an introduction that introduces the piece,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.179
which kind of just gives a little brief breakdown
of the whole piece that you've cut, as well

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.520
as giving the title and the author. I always
write it at this point in the beginning, and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.090
you want to write it based on what you're
cutting is. You're going to make three or

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.710
four sentences stating what the piece is about.
You might talk about the characters; you might

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.850
talk about the conflict. There's really no
rules for it, the only rule is that you state

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.331
the title and the author and that you keep
it brief, like a minute, or maybe a minute

00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:09.721
and a half, so when you're cutting your material
you need to allow a minute or a minute and

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:16.909
a half for this introduction to happen. Now,
introductions can take place at the very beginning,

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.930
like the first thing you talk about, the first
thing that comes out of your mouth is the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.360
introduction, and then you go into dialog,
or you can start the piece with a little bit

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.640
of dialog and then go into the introduction
and then go back into the dialog. I'm going

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.850
to give you an example; I'm going to show
you an example of dialog, introduction, back

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.560
into dialog. I'm only going to do the dialog
beforehand and then the introduction, but

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.560
you'll get the idea. The important thing is
that the introduction happens somewhere within

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.040
the first 10 to 15 lines. You don't want the
introduction to happen 5 or 6 minutes into

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.030
the piece, okay?
