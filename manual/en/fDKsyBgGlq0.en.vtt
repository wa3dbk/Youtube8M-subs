00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
It is a traditional practice,

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.120
but Te Karere asks
if nudity is acceptable

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.170
at the secondary school
national haka competitions.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.020
Yesterday, one team
took to the stage

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.160
with the boys in the team
wearing no underwear.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.050
During the performance
some of the boys

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.090
revealed their private
parts to the crowd.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.050
Rapaera Tawhai spoke
with the team,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230
the judges and the spectators

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.030
and asked if this was
acceptable in today's society

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.170
and in the context of competition.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.020
Te Kura Kaupapa Maori a Rohe o
Mangere are resting today

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.150
as they finished their
performance on stage yesterday.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.070
But the crowd is still shocked
by what they did yesterday.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.090
The image has been blurred,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.100
as we are unable to show it
due to broadcasting standards.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.040
But the boys are wearing no
underwear beneath their costumes.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.090
In the time of our ancestors,
they did not wear underwear.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.240
It shows who they are and their
anger towards certain issues.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.240
Even though its a thing of the past,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.150
the question is whether it's
fine for youth to be doing this

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.040
at a secondary school
haka competition.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.190
I told the tutors that they should
not be doing what the older ones do.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.120
This is a time of development,
and that team showed great strength.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.170
But not just yet.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.130
But the grandmother of the boy, who
was shown, supports this act of his.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.200
He is just like his grandfather Moai
Tihi. He did that all the time.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.020
so its showing his
maturity and nobility.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.090
The tutor of the group told
the boys not to wear underwear

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.240
in accordance with
his Tuhoe traditions

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.100
and most of the
performers are Tuhoe.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.020
This issue caused a lot of
confusion in the audience.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.080
Here are some of the comments
made on our Facebook page.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.060
Here are the thoughts
of those there.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.090
We don't do that in Waikato.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.170
Each iwi and each group
has its own style of haka.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.230
We requested to speak to the
organisers of the event

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.170
but was not available to
discuss their thoughts

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.120
on whether it is right for
youth to be doing this.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.100
Rapaera Tawhai, Te Karere.
