00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.180
At certain times it may appear that your rat
is sick or not feeling well.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.770
And some of the common more clinical sign
you may notice may be vague such as loss of

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.600
appetite, changes in normal routine and normal
behavior, you may notice that they are spending

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.230
more time sleeping, that they don't want to
be disturbed, they don't wake up or come to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.759
you for certain treats, or there's just some
obvious change in how they look and how they

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.759
feel.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.860
And these are certainly different than other
more specific symptoms.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.770
In those cases you're dealing with your rat
just not feeling right, just not being themselves,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.450
just telling you that something is wrong but
they're not showing you something obvious,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.930
and this unfortunately is a common scenario
with some rats.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.450
The flip side to that maybe your rat shows
obvious signs of an illness.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.190
One of the most common problems that effect
pet rats is respiratory diseases in forms

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.100
of pneumonia, bronchopneumonias that are caused
by different bacteria, different viruses,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.290
and other groups of infectious agents.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.790
And in these cases your rat is going to show
symptoms of sneezing, difficulty breathing,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.470
you may notice that they actually open their
mouth to breath which indicates that there

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.020
is a problem.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.290
Also, rats will often produce a red color
pigment from their eyes and their nose.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
This is something that should not be confused
with blood, it's actually a glandular secretion

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840
that's normal in rats.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.550
Normal for them to produce at times where
they are sick, at times where their body is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.140
under stress.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.280
It is generally not something that they would
normally produce so when people notice the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.510
red serection from the eyes or the nose or
they notice their rat is wiping the secretion

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.740
that is on their forelimbs it is also an indication
that the rats body is under stress from some

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.030
type of illness.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.380
Another large category of illnesses that rats
will sometimes show symptoms for are growths,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.909
or tumors, or masses.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.119
In this case you're going to be looking for
lumps, or bumps, or swellings, or any type

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.610
of obvious mass anywhere over your rats body
and this is an important thing to notice because

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.720
some of these may require surgery.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.030
So, there are basically two categories.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.260
There are non specific symptoms like the rat
is just not looking well and feeling well

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.310
and maybe loosing their appetite.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.620
And there are specific symptoms.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.780
It's important to remember that rats cannot
vomit, they are not physically able to vomit.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.410
They can passively spit up food, but vomiting
is not a common problem.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.060
But if you notice that your rat has lost their
appetite, their sleeping too much, their showing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.840
symptoms of having diarrhea, or they're exhibiting
this red color pigment produced from their

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.530
eyes or their nose, or having trouble breathing
it's important that you take them to a veterinarian.
