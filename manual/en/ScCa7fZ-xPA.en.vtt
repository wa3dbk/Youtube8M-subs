[GOATS BRAYING]

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.570
A really fun thing to do
is watch them run.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.180
This is the family farm
in Massachusetts.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.210
Been here for about 20 years.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.830
These goats, they're
three brothers.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.330
They're Nigerian pygmy goats.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.370
They are African.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.950
They're used to really hot
climates, so they do really

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.830
well in the summertime.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.620
Right now, at about six, seven
months, their guts, their

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.460
stomachs get a little rounder
on the sides.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.295
But for the most part,
they stay that size.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.790
So this is Morning, this is
Noon, and this is Night.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.330
Night is sort of the ringleader
of the gang here.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660
They have back teeth, and most
of the time they just kind of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.640
grab the food with their lips,
so you don't really ever get

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.895
bit unless you really stick
your finger in there.

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:23.560
And they're very, very gentle.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.740
They're bred off dairy goats,
but these guys don't produce

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.940
milk or anything.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.540
They're completely just
for show and for fun.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.450
We have blueberry bushes,
raspberry

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.270
bushes, and this grapevine.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.650
They really like these leaves.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.580
They're very bitter.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.380
They don't eat the grapes, it's
too sour for them, but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.640
the leaves are bitter enough.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.680
And they like the texture.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
They also like, too, if you rake
up in the fall a lot of

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.990
dead leaves and put
them in bags.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.695
They like crunchy.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:52.360
They like the texture.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.930
He's sneezing.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.180
[GOAT SNEEZES]

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.420
Cy usually follows these guys
around and kind of herds them

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.950
a little bit.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.760
But as he is right behind them,
they drop out their

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.220
little pachinko chips out of
their butts, he definitely

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.300
will eat them.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540
We have about 30 chickens.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.580
We've got our dog.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.500
We have a big fish pond where
we do koi and catfish.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.040
We've got a big rooster,
and about 25 hens.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.660
So we've got about--

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.440
looking at 18 eggs every
30 hours or so.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.370
What's really cool about living
in a farming community

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.010
is that you can barter and
trade, and sort of connect

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.520
with your community by
giving your eggs

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.770
away and trading them.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.120
