00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.080
Hey! welcome back to Cookingaround's Kitchen. 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.120
And welcome back.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.559
Boy, do I have a surprise for you today. 

00:00:06.784 --> 00:00:08.064
Today we are making 

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:09.973
Creamy Chicken Broccoli 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.360
in penne, a perfect pasta Dish. 

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.898
So let's not waste anymore time 

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.848
Let's get going with this awesome recipe. 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.080
Ok ! Let's see what goodies we have here 

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:24.813
we have chicken breast. 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.960
We have here also some fresh broccoli 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.880
We have cream cheese with garlic.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960
and we have olive oil, salt and pepper. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.320
and we have penne and it is absolutely  perfect

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.460
for this dish. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.454
Now to spice this up, I will be using this chicken seasoning.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.720
Or if you want, you can use any type of seasoning

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.441
even including this soup mix.

00:00:47.441 --> 00:00:50.694
But, you know this is what I want, the grill stuff. 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860
So, let's get going. 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.280
Ok, here I have some breasts 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.200
they are farmers chickens 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.500
natural chickens

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.345
Now you know something, this is too much for the recipe,  

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:01.374
I will be doing, So

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.780
Grab you knife and cut right down the middle 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.420
in half, just like that. 

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:09.494
I will be using the other half for another recipe, 

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:09.994
That I will be showing you.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.880
So, just put that on the side.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.960
Like that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.100
Now grab the peace like this 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.320
and just slice it 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.455
do not worry about it being perfectly 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.720
cut, because there is no  such thing as a perfect chicken.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960
Just slice it down like that.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.106
Now if you look here, you will see some fat here 

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:30.266
now you can keep it on, but you know something 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.800
I will take it off 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.780
because I kind off like to watch my weight.

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:36.537
But it would give you more flavour if you leave it on, 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.200
Now 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.360
Now I want you to cube it. 

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:42.677
Like I said, do not worry how it turns out 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.920
you will get one bigger or smaller, who cares. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580
And basically, this is what we want. 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800
And I shall be back.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:58.334
Now here I have about 1 pound of chicken breast.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.120
And I want you to take 

00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:04.013
your chicken seasoning, basically any type of chicken seasoning. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.340
Now I want you to add 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.740
2 tablespoons to it 

00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:10.387
Yes 2 tablespoons to it. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.880
A little bit more if you are brave, and now 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.780
I want you to stir that around very well.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.020
And then I want you to take it 

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.986
and put it in your refrigerator for 1 hour.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.680
and I shall be back. 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.100
Ok, here we have about a medium size broccoli 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.960
and what I am going to do is cut it right 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.000
about here.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.260
get that stem off, because we are not going to use that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600
so we chop it right here 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.480
Like this. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.960
And we take this part, but do not throw it away, we can make some stock.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.640
Now take it and slice it right down the middle 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.680
now here you can see some stock still attached to the flower.

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:52.113
Just cut that off, just like that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.220
Make my life simple, more stuff for the stock.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.620
Now, I will just pull it apart 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.200
now you can see that this is too big for anyone's mouth

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.534
So we are going to have to slice it down   

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.780
so it can be easy to eat.

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:09.684
so here we go, slice it right down the middle like this.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.680
Now I will cut the rest, and this is what I want 

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:16.253
and again, again, I shall be back. 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.160
Grab yourself a heavy skillet or pot

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.460
add 2 tablespoons of olive oil

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:26.986
On medium heat, add all the meat, and keep on stirring until it becomes golden brown. 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.980
Ok, here it is, it has been about 8 minutes,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.420
Take a look at that, absolutely  awesome. 

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:35.234
Does that not look great.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.560
So, now, I want you to is add about 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.500
1/2 Cup of milk

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:44.367
The heat should be at medium right now

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.260
And let that go for about a couple of minutes. 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.320
And again I shall be back. 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.780
Now here we are, now look at that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.384
Now we are going to add cream cheese 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.040
and this cheese is about 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.100
1 stick or about 150 Grams. 

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.251
Now stir that all around until it is all melted, just like that.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.000
And...

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.880
Now comes the broccoli  

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.994
here I have abot 4 cups of broccoli, that is about 1 head. 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.940
Now put that in and then

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.960
stir that all around and intermingle it. 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.380
Add 1/4 cup of water.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.060
Stir it all around to get that broccoli mixed in well.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.840
Now we are going to add 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.220
Some fresh ground pepper

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.069
here add as much as you want

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.640
For me it will be about 1/2 tablespoon.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.360
So

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:39.821
Now keeping it on medium heat

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.100
I now want you to cover it 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.780
and let it go for 25 to 30 minutes 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.576
Give it a little stir every now and then

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.340
And I shall be back.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.260
Here we are, let's see how it looks. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.040
Oh, does that ever look good. 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.000
The cheese is all melted. 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.160
The broccoli is cooked.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.060
The chicken smells absolutely awesome.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.880
Look at this sauce,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.780
Take a look

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.685
I know it is a little watery, but it will thicken later on. 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.540
So now.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.280
What are we going to do here.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.140
We now have the water boiling here

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.140
ah

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.220
And now we are going to add about 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.480
300 to 350 grams of penne 

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:22.403
you can add spaghetti  if you want 

00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:23.695
and just follow the directions 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.940
And again 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.720
once again 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.320
I shall be back when the penne is ready. 

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:34.615
Grab yourself a large bowl

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.740
and put all the drained pasta 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.360
into this bowl.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.440
Add you're  delicious  sauce 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.280
Now you can see that it did thicken up here

00:05:43.454 --> 00:05:45.134
See, just like I told you.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.060
It's absolutely awesome, now pour 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.260
All that in, and now 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.020
Now start mixing it 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.460
I do not want you to stir it very hard

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.776
Just from the bottom and flip over.

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:03.063
From the bottom and flip over

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:06.383
this way you are not going to break up the delicate broccoli. 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.480
Now

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.040
Now,  All I can say now is, I hope you enjoy this recipe, 

00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:13.834
For you, your Friends

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.120

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.160
