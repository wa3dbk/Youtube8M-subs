00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.320
00:05
COMM: King of the road Irvin Gordon has been

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.610
driving his 1966 Volvo p1800 for 46 years

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:25.270
00:21
COMM: With a staggering 2,994,000 miles on

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.610
the clock he is set to break the 3 million
mile barrier

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.550
00:35
IRVIN: My friends used to think I was slightly

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.720
nuts but now they're very impressed that the
car is getting the attention that its getting

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.730
um they're waiting to see it get the 3 million
miles also they're very enthusiastic about

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.730
it.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.269
00:48
COMM: Irvin from Long Island, New York began

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.590
his love affair with the volvo 1966 when he
laid eyes on the car for the first time.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.180
00:56
IRVIN: Uh i payed $4,150 which was a whole

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.250
year salary for me I put 1500 miles on the
car the first week and I earned it, I just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.260
couldn't get out the car, I was having such
a good time, I just spent all Friday night,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.590
all Saturday, all day Sunday then came back
Monday for its 1500 mile checkup.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.519
01:14
COMM: Driving an average of 60,000 miles a

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:23.620
year the 70 year olds travels have taken him
all over America and even around the world.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.490
in 2009 the car received a Guinness World
Record for the highest vehicle milage clocking

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.960
an access of 2,721,000 miles.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.350
01:31
IRVIN: I've always liked driving everyone

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.520
has to have a hobby, some people drink, some
people take drugs, driving is my drug of choice.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.920
01:39
COMM: As you might expect all those miles

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.880
required a lot of maintenance and work, today
Irv has payed for 157 oil changes, 120 lots

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.940
of transmission fluid, 30 drive belts and
150 points and plugs, not to mention the thousands

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.340
of dollars he's spent on petrol

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.700
01:57
IRVIN: I like to drive so I could be spending

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.950
it on I don't know golf, bowling, I could
be doing whatever um I choose to spend my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.950
time at a gas station filling the car up

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.389
02:07
COMM: In just a few months time the car is

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:18.190
expected to reach 3 million miles but after
46 years, Irv is finally ready to say goodbye

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.369
so if you have a spare 3 million dollars in
the bank then this classic could be yours

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.460
02:20
IRVIN: Its for sale I'm entertaining offers

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.330
at a dollar a mile, I like driving a new car
they have air conditioning and power and everything,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.539
power seats and heated seats, nice stereos
and all kinds off nifty equipment and all

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:36.950
the things that my car doesn't have.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.490
02:34
COMM: But until he finds a buyer, Irv will

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.199
continue hitting the highway and clocking
up more miles

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.330
02:40
IRVIN: A lot of those miles just add up and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.479
after 46 years of driving and driving and
driving, I've never gotten tired of this one

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:56.160
and I still enjoy driving it.
