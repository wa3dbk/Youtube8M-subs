00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.690
This video shows you how to remove and replace a CD DVD drive.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.539
Your replacement drive may not look exactly like your original drive.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.999
That's OK. If you received it from HP it will still work with your computer.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:25.909
If you purchased it on your own make certain that the drive meets the

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.960
specifications. Go to HP.com/Support to find the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.880
specifications for your computer.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.960
It should take you about 10 to 15 minutes to perform this task.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.530
You'll need a flat-head screw driver and a phillips number one screwdriver.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.620
A few words of caution before we start.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.210
Never open the cover when the computer is on or plugged in.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.090
Make certain it's turned off and unplugged.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.970
Static electricity can damage the computer's electronic components. Be sure

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.200
to touch the metal cage before touching any internal parts or components.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.670
Avoid touching sharp edges inside the computer.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.420
And finally the appearance and features of your HP Pavilion All-in-One PC

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.750
may vary slightly from those shown here.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.810
OK let's get started.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.720
First remove any media such as a DVD or memory card from the computer.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.259
Next,

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.660
turn off the computer and unplug the power cord.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.159
Disconnect any attached devices such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.770
Lay the computer down on a flat surface covered with a soft cloth to protect the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.860
screen from scratches and other damage.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.160
Insert a flat-head screw driver into the back cover slot

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.870
to gently pry it off.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.870
Slide off the cover on the left side in the direction indicated by the arrow.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.970
Next, locate the CD DVD drive and remove the screw that holds it in place.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.240
Insert a finger or screwdriver into the slot and push the CD DVD drive out so

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.849
the front edge is exposed enough to grab it with your fingers.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.959
Pull the CD DVD drive out the rest of the way.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.079
Position the notched edge of your replacement drive toward the top of the

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.979
computer and slide the drive into place.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.089
Push it in until the front edge is even with the front panel of your

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.389
computer.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.819
Replace the screw on the new CD DVD drive.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.539
Replace the side cover.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.650
Then, the back cover,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.269
Stand the computer upright.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.929
Plug in the power cord, and reconnect the other cables and devices.

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.529
Your HP Pavilion All-in-One PC is now ready for use.
