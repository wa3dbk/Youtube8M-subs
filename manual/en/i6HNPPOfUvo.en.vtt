00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.890
Well unfortunately we see this almost 
everyday--people arrested for D.W.I.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.849
or worse, a wreck involving a drunk driver. 
FEMALE ANCHOR: What if there was an

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.469
inexpensive device you could buy which 
would tell you if you over the

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.159
legal limit to drive?

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.730
There is, and Eyewitness wants to know: does it work? 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.720
"When police test you, it's already too late."

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.520
Keith Nothacker is the president of
 BACtrack, makers of a personalized

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.190
hand-held breathalyzer. 
KEITH: For $100, you can have your own breathalyzer

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.909
just to make sure that you're safe.

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.580
BACtrack uses a fuel cell sensor, just 
like law enforcement breathalyzers.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.300
No law enforcement agency we asked would 
talk with us about the product.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.000
They don't want anyone drinking and driving, which is exactly 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.449
what Nothacker says the product could prevent.
KEITH: People should use this product to make

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.930
sure that all the alcohol is out of their system

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.690
and that they are a zero and not intoxicated before they get behind the wheel.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.090
But when people drink

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.850
they don't always make the best decisions.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.650
REPORTER: Three is your limit?
PATRON: Yes, sir. 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.170
We went to Highlanders 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.710
a popular watering hole on Fredericksburg Rd. 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.220
and surprisingly...
REPORTER: "...as it gets to one, take a deep breath

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.120
"...and blow into this thing for five seconds." 
VOICE OVER: Not many people turned us

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.400
down on the chance to try out a 
personal breathalyzer.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.680
REPORTER: "How many beers did you have?"
PATRON: "Two and a half." 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.710
Danny Rivera had been at the bar for about two 
hours.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010
He also said he was on his last beer.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.740
You can see where the device might come
 in handy for a bar

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.920
in case someone had too much.
BARKEEP: "If you can get them to blow it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.870
they might agree, "oh yeah, you're right, I'll take a ride

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.030
home in a cab." or something.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.930
Mike Specia owns Highlanders

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.700
he says he actually had a similar 
machine at another bar but had to take it out. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.799
"It was a vending machine

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.670
that you put a dollar in and they'd give you a straw and 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970
you'd get to blow whatever your blood alcohol content was. 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.780
But it backfired on me. The patrons started doing drinking games

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.250
like who can get the highest number." 
VOICE OVER: Specia says his bartenders are specially trained 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.340
to recognize the early signs

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.570
of "too much" but

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.800
it could be a tool.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.009
"I mean... saving a life, 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.799
or not causing an accident somewhere

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.709
it would mean calling a cab, and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.530
bein' on the safe route."

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.419
Some say they would buy it, others say they would just count on past experiences.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:20.859
By the way, all three people

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.769
who agreed to check out BACtrack

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.219
blew a 0.04 or less and said they were on their last drink. 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.900
We truly believe that everybody should have a 
personal breathalyzer

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.010
because probably everybody either drinks 
alcohol or knows somebody who does.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.409
And sadly

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.129
we all know somebody

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.119
he's been affected by D.W.I.

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.590
