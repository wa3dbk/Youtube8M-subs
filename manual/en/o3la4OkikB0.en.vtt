00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:06.047
Take a bit out of your chocolate
Play Station controller

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.937
and loosen your Assassin's Creed 3 belt.

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:12.507
I'm Jake, and this is episode number 7
of Game LÜT.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.797
If that belt was too revolutionary,

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:19.007
try this $1000 Assassin's Creed 2 suit.

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.337
After scaling Rome, stay hydrated
with some Nuka Cola.

00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:25.287
The Nuka Cola Company
makes the post-apocalyptic soda

00:00:25.287 --> 00:00:28.997
in flavors like Classic, Victory, and Quantum.

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:31.017
Once you've down an irradiated beverage,

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:35.525
use your extra actions points
to create some DIY Call of Duty Perk Colas

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.525
in the event of zombies.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.855
After all that caffeine,
you should check your Pulse,

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:47.985
and incredibly cool and free game
available for Mac or PC.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.325
Pulse is a first person
survivor horror game

00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:52.418
where you play a blind protagonist.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.928
You have to toss cute little critters
against objects

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:57.238
in order to get a sonar view of the world

00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:59.958
and escape the grasp of unseen monsters.

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:09.588
If you play too long,
your gaming wrist might get tired,

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:12.988
so rest it on this Katana 3D mousepad

00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:16.268
or relax on your Space Invader couch
with some Tetris pillows.

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:19.296
Take a sip out of your pixel heart mug
from ThinkGeek.com

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:21.946
that regains its health
when you fill it with hot liquid

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.426
and check out these awesome
Pokémon Evolution posters

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:27.582
illustrated by artist Kari Fry.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:42.503
If you're going out,
put on this handmade felt Skyrim hat,

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.173
a dead pixel T-shirt from Society Six,

00:01:45.173 --> 00:01:48.083
Legend of Zelda shoes,
some 8-Bit sunglasses

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:51.413
and ask your crush
"Will you boo my valentine?"

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:54.993
But seriously girl,
I dig you.

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:57.253
Minecraft Valentines cards.

00:01:57.253 --> 00:02:01.133
If she says "no," remind yourself to return
those Bubble Bobble leggings you bought her

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.893
with these NES sticky notes,
and hide your embarrassment

00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:06.613
with this Rorschach moving ink blot mask.

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:19.543
It used heat-activated ink
that changes shape with every breath.

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:23.493
It's pretty cool, but not as cool
as the Sub Zero Macbook decal.

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:27.563
Let's get mathematical
with the Adventure Time Mod for Minecraft.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:37.333
It adds character models for Finn,
Jake, Marceline, and more.

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:41.343
Instead of using your keyboard,
create your own with Makey Makey,

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:44.713
an incredibly cool piece of hardware
that turns anything that can conduct

00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:47.883
even the smallest amount
of electrical current into a controller.

00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:06.670
You can use a banana or even pencil drawings
as your control surface

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.060
and decorate your room surface
with these amazing Team Fortress 2 prints

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.320
by artist Patrick King.

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:24.690
Ten decorate yourself with a DotA 2 keychain

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.050
and a Zombie Mushroom Kingdom shirt.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.280
Pop in a Legend of Zelda mint,
and subscribe to Vsauce 3

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.040
for more Game LÜT.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.230
