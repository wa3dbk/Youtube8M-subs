00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.370
Specifically in this segment we are going
to talk about socializing with your birds

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.840
and teaching them to get along with one another.
I have a number of birds, a couple of dozen

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.340
and they all do get along although I do have
to be watchful that we don't have any squabbles

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.150
that they can't handle themselves. In trying
to have birds get along I am often asked can

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.349
parakeets and larger birds be housed together
or can they be kept together? The answer is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.720
yes and no. I have seen little budgies get
along with Molakin cockatoos. I have seen

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.970
smaller birds get along with birds much larger
than they are. I have got a hawk head parrot

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.020
who enjoys being with my red tails that are
probably five or six times her size but as

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.090
with everything you have to exercise some
common sense. I have developed a program for

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.520
my own birds to teach them to get along. Basically
we have a spa day and I wet all the birds

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.950
down and because they feel vulnerable during
that period everybody pretty much minds their

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.300
p's and q's. But you have to watch such things
as range of motion, the actual physicality

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.369
of the bird, the timidity of the bird, and
just whether they an really hold up to being

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.100
threatened by another bird. If your birds
are flighted it is much easier because birds

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.229
go on an operative basis of fight and flight
and if they see something unpleasant they

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
will leave. If your bird is not flighted it
won't be able to escape as readily and you

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.280
have to be extra watchful in that sort of
situation. Cockatiels especially and budgies

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.659
are pretty much unsuited to be in flocks of
larger birds because of a couple of things.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.429
Number one they are much more delicate in
their physical build than a lot of birds.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.819
A budgie's foot could be snapped off in an
instant and you would probably not even have

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.630
the time to do anything about it. The same
with a cockatiel. However, you also have to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.359
watch range of motion. If you have got a budgie
that is flighted and he flies over a Molakin,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.479
the Molakin is probably going to wig out and
that is not good for either bird because the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.640
Molakin could do something that the budgie
would regret and the budgie is probably already

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.160
doing something that the Molakin regrets.
So when you are trying to have your birds

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.439
get along do exercise common sense and watchfulness
and stay alert to the possibilities of somebody

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.310
getting injured. It doesn't mean they can't
get along but it is a long process rather

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.360
than an instantaneous love affair when you
have more than one bird.
