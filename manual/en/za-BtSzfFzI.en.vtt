Hi, my name is Katie Uhlmann and I'm here
to talk to you about how to work with your

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.840
condo board to green your condo. Today, we're
here at the historic Merchandise Building

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.039
in downtown Toronto. There are a vast number
of reasons to ensure that your unit and building

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.500
are energy efficient. In addition to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions you can expect lower

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.590
utility bills, increased resale value and
improved air quality in your building.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
There are currently over 2,000 green condo
units in Toronto and it's easy to get started

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.800
if you want to add your unit to this growing
list. I think it's important to educate yourself

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.019
and others about the possibilities in the
building because this is the best way to get

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.359
people on board. People have to understand
why they should be interested in making changes

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.239
in the building, and if they do they are more
likely to commit and be part of the green

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.909
committee.
The best way to get started to jot down a

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.110
list of goals you have for your own unit,
but as well as the building. And once you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.600
have that list, you can then talk to other
people in your building about it. You can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.930
send a survey out by email or you can post
a survey at concierge if you have one or just

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.660
get people to answer directly to you.
After you have received the feedback, it's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.190
time to plan a meeting. You can let other
people know by posting notices in high traffic

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.860
areas around the building I think it's also
important when you start a green committee,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.900
if there are other committees in the building
you need to work with them to address their

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.160
concerns as well. Getting together to talk
about issues in your building will make your

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.680
goals seem more feasible because of the number
of people involved. It's also a great way

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.390
to get to know other members in your condo
community. At the meeting, you really talk

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.040
about key areas such as water efficiency,
electricity, waste management, maintenance,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.020
repairs and if you want, a rooftop garden.
We just had our organic bins implemented.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.770
We felt like there was a definite need for
some sort of education and awareness built

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.030
for the tenants. Really the idea is to engage
with residents and the board and to bring

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.210
everyone together and talk about issues they
are actually passionate about. What might

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.860
be important to me might not be as important
to someone else, but when your coming together

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.340
as a whole everyone can then do research on
topics they are most interested in. So the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.490
topic I'm most passionate would be energy
conservation. I've been an over consumer

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.540
in the past and as I've been educated I've
learned that I can make a difference. Going

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.660
out and doing the research was an easy part.
There are other opportunities such as bulk

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.980
purchasing for individual units or special
deals you can get on building wide initiatives

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.000
by talking to other people in your building,
and coming up with a green committee your

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.110
better able to address those concerns. Every
condo building has a condo board. The condo

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.850
board is made up of elected members and it
is their job to consider the best interests

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.709
of building tenants and the building as a
whole.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.709
Condo buildings especially haven't made substantial
strides yet. It's really reducing water consumption,

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.140
it's sort of the next frontier. Is it because
it's so much individual unit work that would

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.849
need to be done?
Yeah it's really a behavioral thing right,

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.630
it's really sort of education people on how
to conserve the resource You will need to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.680
approach the board once your green committee
has made a list of proposed changes. Remember

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.890
that the board's primary concern is the financial
feasibility of all new projects.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.590
We just put in the energy efficient boilers
and that was quite a significant financial

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.940
investment for this year, so some of the ideas
we come up here during our meeting we may

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.989
not be able to implement them this year. The
board will also have a set of established

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.680
rules and guidelines that you must adhere
to when making any major changes to the building.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.840
Once you have the guidelines from the board
and their approval, you can start to set your

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.500
plan into action. Whether you're starting
with activities for individual condo units

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.650
or building-wide initiatives, there are a
number of support programs to help you on

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.200
your journey. One such initiative offered
by the City of Toronto is the Better Buildings

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.889
Partnership, or BBP. In addition to helping
building owners and managers understand which

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.180
retrofits would be most advantageous for their
building, BBP also helps with incentives.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.500
Take the time to research these incentives
as you work with your green committee and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.500
condo board to improve the environmental sustainability
of your building.
