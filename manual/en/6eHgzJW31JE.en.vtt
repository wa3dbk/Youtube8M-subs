NATHAN MCCULLOUGH: Hi, my name is Nathan McCullough
on behalf of Expert Village. In these clips,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.210
we're going to talk about some of the tips
and tricks in order to properly winterize

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.910
your vehicle. In this clip, we're going to
talk about how to properly deice your windshield

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.530
and wiper blades. What I have here is a can
of De-Icer as you can see. What it's used

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:30.760
for, it has an alcohol-based solvent in it.
The alcohol will decrease the freezing temperature

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.079
of water as they mix together. What that'll
do is liquify it and make it so. Your windshield

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.050
will be clear and your wiper blades will begin
functioning properly. Your wiper blades are

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.770
actually a pretty complex mechanism. They
have a whole bunch of moving parts and springs

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.250
inside of them that hold them tight to your
windshield. In the winter, snow and various

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.680
other stuff will build up on them; frost,
ice, sleet--things of that nature. Instead

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.110
of just cranking your wipers on and having
a mount work, if you suspect that they might

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.381
be frozen, have a can of this stuff in your
garage. If you're a business traveler and

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.380
happen to park your vehicle at an airport
for an extended period of time in the winter,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
it's going to get a significant amount of
buildup. Most business travelers will be in

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.760
a hurry. It's going to be a good idea to have
a can of this ready and waiting for you. You

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.840
can keep it in the passenger compartment and
you pretty much just shake the can and it

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.810
applies like any other spray. You going to
want to use it very lightly all over the windshield

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.170
and it comes with a straw right here that
you can insert into the orifice and spray

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
a light film inside the wiper blades. Now,
you're not going to want to use the actual

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.409
propellant force to blast the ice out of the
way. What you're going to want to do is just

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.299
apply a light film to it and you use this
very sparingly and let the chemical action

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.360
take effect. That's the proper way to deice
your wiper blades and your windshield. If

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.930
you notice that there's significant ice buildup
on the blade itself which is making it adhere

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.341
to the windshield, spray some of your De-Icer
on it and take the palm of the flat on your

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:21.629
hand, put it right on top of the wiper arm
elbow here and just wiggle it just like so.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:28.309
What that'll do is avoid tearing the wiper
blade, blade portion. If you are to just grab

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:33.329
it by the side and peel it up on or if it's
frozen significantly, the blade itself is

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.560
going to stay and here to the windshield and
you just pull away the base. That's the proper

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.989
way to deice your windshield and wiper blades.
