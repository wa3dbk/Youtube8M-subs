00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.300
Hi guys. Thanks for tuning into another video episode on ForgottenWeapons.com.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.420
We're here at the Rock Island auction September 2013, the premier auction,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.340
taking a look at some of their cool guns including this very

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.240
interesting, unique historical piece. This is a Walther VG-1 rifle.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.500
However, it is a presentation model of the VG-1,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.200
which is incredibly ironic I think.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.600
A little bit of background for you. In 1944 obviously the war was starting to look pretty bleak.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.760
German industry was starting to have some issues and so a series of simplified

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.880
rifle designs were submitted by the various German industrial companies, including Walther.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.080
These rifles were meant to arm the Volkssturm, a kind of a German people's militia,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.320
and so they were subsequently named the VG-1, the VG-2, VG-3 etc. The VG-1 was Walther's design.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.140
It's a very much simplified ... basically a Mauser bolt-action.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.680
We'll take a closer look at the operation here in a moment. But a very simple stock,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.920
extremely simple sights, you can see there's basically nothing to it, just a little plate with a notch, ... and a front post there.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.640
The barrels were generally machine gun barrels, MG 15 or 17 or 81 barrels

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.480
that had been salvaged or not ever used in aerial machine gun production.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.880
The safety here is kind of interesting, also very, very simple. This bit just pivots,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.980
so when it's in the center like that, the trigger can move. When you push it down it physically blocks the trigger.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.240
That's all there is to the safety on this. Now the magazine isn't in this rifle at the moment, but these used

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.180
Gewehr 43 mags, so 10-round magazines. They were chambered in 8mm Mauser.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.740
They have a little magazine catch right here at the front of the trigger guard.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.120
See that operating inside there.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.480
You can see the crudity of the work here,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.440
hacked out in as little time as possible, just to work.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.640
The front sling swivel is another good example of the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.460
level of desperation that was being put into the manufacture of these. So it's basically a bent piece of wire,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.120
a hole drilled in the stock, and just

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.800
bent open on the other side to hold it in place.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.360
Being a German type of sling, the back just has a slot cut in the stock that you'd run the sling through.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.800
Now the ironic part of this rifle is that this plaque basically

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.940
commemorates this rifle being presented to the economic district

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.760
leader in this area in Poland where the rifle was made.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.540
And frankly if a rifle like this had been presented as the product of German industry in '40 or '41 or '42

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.720
the guys presenting it would have been pretty much executed on the spot for

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.180
simply having the gall to suggest that this is what Germany ought to be producing.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.620
But by '44 and '45 this is what they really needed to be putting out.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.260
So, a kind of a thumb in the eye presenting one of these to a political official,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.620
"Hey, you guys got us into this and now we're totally screwed.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.640
So here, see how well you can pretend to be happy about this rifle."

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.400
Alright, let's take a closer look at the bolt here. It does open just like a normal Mauser,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.280
pull the trigger, bring the bolt out.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.580
The striker is this, just a very simple flat piece of metal with two pins.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.880
There are two grooves in the back of the receiver that hold on to this.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.400
... Very simple components here holding the striker in place for disassembly.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.209
The front two rotating locking lugs and spring-loaded ejector.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.480
Trigger just drops that down.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.940
There we go. That's all there is to it. That's the Walther VG-1, this one made by DWM.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.740
So, thanks for watching guys. Hope you enjoyed it,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.720
