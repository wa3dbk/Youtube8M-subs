00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.615
Voiceover: The Florida grasshopper sparrow is
a bird that's resident to Florida.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.518
Right now we are conducting a three-year
research project ...

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:22.518
... to try and figure out what some of the causes of decline are.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:27.121
So...there are a lot of hypothesis about why the
sparrow population might be declining.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.113
Voiceover: One of the predominant things is loss of habitat.

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:32.698
Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area currently has ...

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:34.325
... the largest population.
Erin: Ready?

00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:36.376
When we're trying to capture an unbanded bird ...

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.371
... we usually arrive at the site before dawn.

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:42.375
Voiceover: We locate the bird if it is singing.
Erin: There he is!

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:45.836
We approach the bird ... usually within 50 meters.

00:00:46.073 --> 00:00:47.838
We set up a mist nest ...

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:50.550
... that's set into the ground with poles.

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:56.221
And then we use floridanus or pratensis long song recording ...

00:00:56.305 --> 00:00:58.391
... to draw the bird closer to the net.

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.020
Erin: Is he in?

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:03.771
Man: Yeah!

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.691
We remove the bird from the net carefully ...

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:10.278
... and take it a little ways away where we have
all of our banding supplies.

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:11.690
It's a beauty.

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.740
Voiceover: We mark the birds with color bands ...

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.410
... so that we will be able to identify them
as individuals later.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:22.498
We measure the bill, the depth, the length of the bill,
the tarsis, the wing length ...

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:25.085
We check the bird for ectoparasites.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.671
We also collect blood samples for DNA analyses.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.925
We try to process the birds as quickly as possible ...

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:33.968
... to reduce the amount of handling stress.

00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.636
As soon as we're done taking all these measurements ...

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:38.723
... we release the bird at the original site.

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.610
Florida grasshopper sparrows have very low
nest success.

00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:54.113
Voiceover: It may be only one in three nests are successful.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.616
OK, when we're looking for nests, what we try
to do is ...

00:01:57.678 --> 00:02:01.161
... find the female that's associated
with the territory.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.081
Voiceover: Unfortunately, we haven't been able to find
very many females.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:07.943
We don't know if that's because there aren't very
many females left in the population ...

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:10.630
... or if it just has to do with how cryptic they are.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.298
Voiceover: Another method that we use for nest searching is ...

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:15.760
... just systematic walking through a bird's territory.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.348
Where we carefully walk, scanning the ground for
signs of a nest.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.683
Their nests are very hard to find.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:25.478
They're constructed out of dead grass.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.688
And they're built with a dome.

00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:29.940
So even if you're looking down on the nest ...

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:33.298
... you can't actually see any eggs
or any indication that it is a nest.

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:37.490
If this was an active nest I would not
be bringing anyone here to see it ...

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:39.366
... because it's a very sensitive thing.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.910
If and when we do find nests ...

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.918
... we are careful to stay in the area
only for a very short time.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:48.125
Voiceover: We usually mark the nest location with a
GPS unit...

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:50.378
... and place a few flags near the nest.

00:02:50.543 --> 00:02:52.588
Not right on the nest, but just near it.

00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:55.638
And then we back away as soon as possible to
let the birds return ...

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.968
... and also avoid leaving our scent ...

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.846
... in the area that could attract mammal predators.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.980
Voiceover: The reason that this bird is
on the brink of extinction ...

00:03:04.035 --> 00:03:07.686
... primarily has to do with the fact that so little
Florida dry prairie exists.

00:03:07.845 --> 00:03:10.815
The whole prairie ecosystem is maintained by fire.

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.195
And historically this fire would have been created
after lightning strikes.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.990
So the wildlife managers here, Steve Glass and Tina Hannon, burn the prairie ...

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:24.658
... in two year rotations to keep the habitat appropriate
for grasshopper sparrows.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.498
Controlled burning is really important for the sparrow.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.626
It's probably one of the most important things that can be done ...

00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:34.965
... to preserve the bird is to maintain regular burning cycles in the prairie.
