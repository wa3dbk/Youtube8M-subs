00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:04.176
&gt;&gt; The Dragon cargo
ship which arrived

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:07.226
at the station late
last month carried opals

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:08.986
and another large payload

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:11.716
and its unpressurized
section, its trunk.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:17.476
It also carried many, many other
science payloads inside the

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:20.366
freight carrier a number of
new experiments that have come

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.666
to space designed
to take advantage

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.976
of the low earth
orbit environment.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:28.786
One of these new experiments
is called Bio Tube MICRO

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:33.456
and it's focused on how plants
sense and respond to gravity.

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:37.356
The principal investigator Dr.
Karl Hasenstein joins us this

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.286
morning from his
office at the University

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:40.826
of Louisiana at Lafayette.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.556
Dr. Hasenstein people have
been looking at how plants do

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:45.836
in space for a long time.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:47.556
Generally, how do they do?

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:54.436
&gt;&gt; Well, generally they do quite
well especially once they get

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:56.336
exposed to the proper
environment.

00:00:56.336 --> 00:01:00.956
Initially, we did not know
what it means to grow plants

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:04.646
in the absence of gravity but
it turns out it wasn't gravity

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:10.016
that was the culprit in not
succeeding with plant growth.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:13.876
It was the lack of convection
and as a result the distribution

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:17.426
of gases and so forth that
prevented proper development.

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:21.286
But we have come a long way
and learned how to do it

00:01:21.376 --> 00:01:24.626
in the meantime, so we can
grow plants quite well.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.296
&gt;&gt; The gravity is
still a factor right?

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:30.356
What caused you to be
focused on that aspect?

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:35.046
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a conundrum
more than 100 years to find

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:41.526
out why every tree grows upright
and anchors itself in the soil

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:46.146
and this basic question
as to how tiny cells

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:51.386
that don't have specialized
features such as we have

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:55.746
in our vestibular apparatus
are able to sense and respond

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:59.916
to gravity it's just puzzling
and one of the aspects

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:05.786
of detecting how these
things work, ideally requires

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.326
to remove gravity as a factor

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:13.176
and this way we can gradually
test our individual components

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:17.646
of this system that makes plants
sense and respond to all kinds

00:02:17.646 --> 00:02:21.516
of stimuli, respond to gravity

00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:23.866
and that's what this
experiment is about.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.096
&gt;&gt; Okay, take us
through your plan then.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.326
What are you going to be--
what have you sent to space

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:32.136
and what are you going to be
doing in that hardware on orbit?

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:38.476
&gt;&gt; Well, the Bio Tube
MICRO is an external shell

00:02:38.476 --> 00:02:40.666
that contains the
actual experiment

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:44.286
and the actual experiment
consists

00:02:44.286 --> 00:02:48.606
of so-called magnetic chambers

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.816
and within these
chambers we have a series

00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:56.676
of exactly 10 magnets
that are aligned

00:02:56.676 --> 00:03:00.626
so that they generate a
very strong magnetic field.

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:07.386
Inside this field we distort
this uniform magnetic field by,

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:10.796
you could call it magnet lenses

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:16.796
that in reality [inaudible]
magnetic wedges and what does

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:19.556
that have to do with how
plants respond to gravity?

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:24.226
These magnetic radians that
result by inserting these wedges

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:29.146
into the uniform magnetic
field exert what we call a

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:34.626
magnetophoretic force and
that force is specific

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:39.486
for diamagnetic compounds
such as the middle class

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:42.416
that are the suspected
gravity sensors.

00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:46.116
&gt;&gt; It sounds like you're
manipulating the gravity pull

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.556
on parts of the plant.

00:03:49.386 --> 00:03:52.166
&gt;&gt; That's correct but
we don't exert a pull.

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.736
We exert a push.

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:58.436
These high-graded magnetic
fields repel these starch-filled

00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:05.346
middle class and by doing so
they produce the same effect

00:04:05.386 --> 00:04:08.166
that we see under the
influence of gravity

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:14.476
without having any other study
the component exposed to gravity

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:18.556
so we can pinpoint whether the
middle class is actually doing

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:25.196
the initiation of the sensing
and response to gravity

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:28.316
by virtue of moving them

00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:33.376
around in their respective
cells we call them statocytes.

00:04:33.546 --> 00:04:34.276
&gt;&gt; Very interesting.

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:38.366
Do the crew members
participate in this in some way?

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:39.656
&gt;&gt; Not really.

00:04:39.656 --> 00:04:45.676
They were helpful in stowing the
hardware into the express rack

00:04:45.676 --> 00:04:51.586
on ISS but the actual experiment
is entirely controlled from KFC.

00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:56.986
&gt;&gt; Okay. I assume then
you flown this on Dragon.

00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:58.266
You're going to get
these sample back.

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:00.536
What do you do with
them when you get them?

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:05.596
&gt;&gt; Well, we will analyze
different things one is the

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:07.526
distribution of these
middle class

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:11.256
after we have seen
downlinked video

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:16.156
to indicate whether we observe
actually curvature in the roots

00:05:16.206 --> 00:05:20.736
so we have the video
equipment that takes pictures

00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:24.676
in the infrared region
of this spectrum.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.636
As you can see it finds
if the roots curve.

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:33.096
When we come back we will
correlate distribution

00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:37.846
of the middle class
within these statocytes

00:05:38.386 --> 00:05:43.316
to the observed curvature
and we will also do a series

00:05:43.316 --> 00:05:47.416
of genetic tests to see if
gene expression has changed

00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:52.116
in the close conditions
that we had in space.

00:05:52.806 --> 00:05:57.176
At the same time we do
so-called immunocytolocalization

00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:00.136
of relevant proteins
that are responsible

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:03.676
for the growth response of
cells or roots in general.

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:04.986
&gt;&gt; So there's still
plenty of study

00:06:04.986 --> 00:06:06.906
to be done once you
get the samples back?

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:08.116
&gt;&gt; Yes indeed.

00:06:08.176 --> 00:06:10.926
&gt;&gt; Now, I found it very
interesting that I saw

00:06:10.926 --> 00:06:14.886
that you ran this experiment
on the last flight of Columbia

00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:16.856
and we're still able to
get some results back

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:18.186
from downlinked images, right?

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:19.606
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's correct.

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:23.706
It was unfortunate that we
could not get biological

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:24.616
material back.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:29.726
But the down link suggested
strongly that we had curvature

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:33.526
as we had expected but we're
not able to confirm this

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:37.216
because we never received
the actual plant material.

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:40.896
&gt;&gt; Is your goal to simply
improve the way plants grow

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:43.276
in space or does this have
applicability on earth?

00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:48.596
&gt;&gt; Well, anytime you have
better or deeper understanding

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:54.566
as to how plants perform and
respond to environmental cues

00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:56.816
or problems you are bound

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.816
to benefit processes
on earth as well.

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:05.776
So while we clearly want
to establish a means

00:07:05.776 --> 00:07:09.836
of directionally controlling
plant growth in space,

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:14.136
we also want to use
that gained knowledge

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:17.696
for improvement of
plants on earth.

00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:21.296
&gt;&gt; Dr. Hasenstein, thank
you for taking a few minutes

00:07:21.296 --> 00:07:23.366
for us this morning and good
luck with the experiment.

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:24.596
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:27.226
&gt;&gt; Karl Hasenstein is the
principle investigator

00:07:27.226 --> 00:07:28.716
of Bio Tube MICRO.
