00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.266
Did a chicken roll that?

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.110
Congratulations !

00:00:56.426 --> 00:00:58.816
Congratulations to...

00:00:58.916 --> 00:01:01.695
the weapon expert whose weapons were blocked,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.959
the thief that triggered all the alarms,

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.546
the cop that tried to shoot, but it was all for nought…

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:11.146
Four fumbles…

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:14.495
And the accountant who arrived just in time

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:16.629
to be chased with the others.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.253
Why did you take those stairs?

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:20.789
here was no elevator.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.789
Ah!

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.861
There is the new element!

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.077
Can he play a priest?

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:26.570
The group needs a priest…

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.298
It’s in the first player handbook!

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:31.263
Let’s hope he plays a priest!

00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:33.098
Let’s hope he plays a magician!
19
00:01:33,198 --&gt; 00:01:34,712
Wait, we already have a magician,

00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:35.912
it’s me!

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.480
Sorry. Let’s hope he plays a useful magician!

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:43.061
The class isn't important.

00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:45.429
Let’s hope he plays a character that he likes,

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.498
and most importantly that he develops a good backstory!

00:01:47.598 --> 00:01:48.543
And that he brings food!

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:52.959
Friends, allow me to introduce Natasha.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.959
Hi !

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:55.968
Natacha, here are Thy-Lan...

00:01:56.068 --> 00:01:57.205
Hi !

00:01:58.314 --> 00:01:58.975
Grégoire...

00:01:59.075 --> 00:01:59.975
Greg.

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:01.514
Caro...

00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:02.218
Hi !

00:02:02.318 --> 00:02:02.858
And Léna.

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.906
Hey, that’s not in game.

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.040
That’s IRL.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.765
Hi !

00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:12.757
If Madam would allow me…

00:02:12.857 --> 00:02:14.656
You’d rather sit here.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:16.789
Thanks.

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:23.274
You can put away your World of Darkness characters,

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:26.389
and get out the ones from D&amp;D!

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.608
Hey, what kind of character will you play?

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:29.909
Man or woman?

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.509
Who cares?

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.383
What class?

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:33.216
What level?

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:33.898
But, in fact…

00:02:33.998 --> 00:02:35.221
I don’t have any character…

00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:40.789
Ah yes…

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.989
We could give her a pregenerated character…

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:45.759
You never did that before.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.536
I prefer that you make your character yourself…

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:50.837
You’ll like it more!

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:54.549
That’s right, you said that on the 5th of june, 2001.

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.087
It will be quick.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:03.146
OK, are we gonna eat?

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:03.893
Yeah.

00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:06.175
You finally accept my invitation?

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:08.778
No, we are going to all eat together.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:09.909
It comes at the right time, I’m hungry!

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:16.757
No, but… Come back!

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:19.829
Well, they left us.

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:23.754
Isn't it a guy thing, rôle-playing games?

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:25.503
Will other guys come?

00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:32.991
I feel guilty that we left them…

00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:35.722
Like when we made Leo believe that Caro’s character

00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:36.504
had a saving throw against poison of 8

00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:37.792
when she was only level 4!

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:41.226
No, but we could have helped her make her backstory…

00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:44.661
No, but we could have helped her make her background…

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:46.240
like we meet in the inn

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.266
"Hello, I am the new character…"

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.104
Don’t worry,

00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:52.512
it has been three hours,

00:03:52.612 --> 00:03:54.090
hey should be done.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.906
And Leo makes pretty good introductions.

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.810
Only if she knows what she wants.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.391
I should have insisted on priest,

00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.479
I feel bad…

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.898
So you see, the magician

00:04:09.998 --> 00:04:11.626
has very powerfull spells,

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:13.056
but a very low armor class.

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:14.681
Well, in the fourth edition, it is a bit better,

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.681
but anyway…

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.258
Now that I've explained everything,

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:18.837
what would you like to do?

00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:20.970
I don’t know yet…

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.765
Do you want to fight,

00:04:23.865 --> 00:04:26.581
steal from people,

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:28.010
heal them,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.037
be sneaky?

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:31.037
I don’t know,

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:33.514
what's youradvice?

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:37.098
At first, before your explanations,

00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:40.704
I thought I could play some kind of leprechaun that could disapear… 

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:41.704
A leprechaun?

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:43.050
Like Dobby,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.330
but with wings!

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.697
Tinkerbell?

00:04:46.797 --> 00:04:48.725
Tinkerbell is not a leprechaun!

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:51.370
I don’t know if I have the handbook…

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:56.061
You came back!

00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:09.822
If I understood correctly,

00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:11.381
I can do what I want?

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:13.600
Yes, you can do what you want.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.902
But what’s the point of all these rules

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:17.525
if I can do what I want?

00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:21.216
So I can make the leprechaun?

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:22.986
that disapears ?

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.613
Is Dobby spelled with one or two B's?

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:32.458
D… A… U…
