Euphorbia milii&nbsp;also known as crown of thorns,&nbsp;Christ plant,&nbsp;Christ thorn is a&nbsp;species&nbsp;of&nbsp;flowering plants&nbsp;native to Madagascar.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.560
The species name commemorates&nbsp;Baron Milius, once Governor of RÃ©union, who introduced the species to France in 1821.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.560
It is a&nbsp;succulent&nbsp;climbing&nbsp;shrub&nbsp;growing to 1.8&nbsp;m tall, with densely spiny stems.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.840
The straight, slender spines, up to 3&nbsp;cm long, help it scramble over other plants

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.720
The&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;are found mainly on new growth,&nbsp;and are obovate, up to 3.5&nbsp;cm long and 1.5&nbsp;cm broad

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.760
The&nbsp;flowers&nbsp;are small, subtended by a pair of conspicuous petal-like&nbsp;bracts, variably red, pink or white, up to 12&nbsp;mm broad

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.760
The sap is moderately poisonous.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.880
This plant has gained the&nbsp;Royal Horticultural Society's&nbsp;Award of Garden Merit

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:52.240
As with other euphorbs, Euphorbia milii produces abundant quantities of poisonous milky sap that causes skin irritation

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.760
The legend says that the crown of thorns worn by Christ at the time of his crucifixion was made from the stems of this plant

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.240
Interestingly, the stems of this plant are pliable and can be intertwined into a circle

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.760
...and there are substantial evidence that the species had been brought to the Middle East before the time of Christ

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:36.000
A thorny, succulent plant that's both salt- and drought-tolerant, crown-of-thorns is a valuable addition to tropical gardens.
