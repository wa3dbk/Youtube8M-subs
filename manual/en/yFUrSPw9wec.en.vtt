00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.350
It is true today and I think that it is increasingly
going to be true tomorrow that all great universities

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.630
need to be internationally natured.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.440
The lessons that at least I have learned from
successful organizations is that there are

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.710
two dimensions that stand out from these organizations
more than any other thing innovation and internationalization.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.059
Innovation in a sense that they are always
a few steps ahead of their competitors and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.030
international, not just in terms of the market
but in terms of seeking the human capital

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.890
and human talent that is really needed to
make them innovative in the first place.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.170
So we have a number of student groups that
are very active and provide service at the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.320
international level.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.350
The International Veterinary Studentsâ€™ Association
has been very active for the past many years

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.739
in providing services for animal care in Nicaragua.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.451
Another group that has been active is Engineers
without Borders, in particular they have been

00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:08.640
focused on providing purification systems
where they are not available in El Salvador

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120
and in Kenya.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.830
Our student athletes formed Beavers without
Borders with the intention of helping communities

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.370
that are not as advantaged as we are in the
Unites States.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.670
They spent some time in Guatemala to help
the local community build a house for impoverished

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
families.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.500
When they came back it was a profound experience
in terms of how they view what we have in

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.020
the States and how does it compare with communities
elsewhere who are really struggling.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.490
I really believe that the direction that we
are pursuing here at Oregon State University

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.290
is absolutely the right direction to go, in
terms of increasing that international footprint.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.110
In terms of developing focused programs with
international institutions where there are

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.270
common interest s and in terms of increasing
opportunities for our students and increasing

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.650
international students at OSU.
