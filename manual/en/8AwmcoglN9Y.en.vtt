00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.790
Things like surprising humans, if you leave it to m-

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.700
You surely are an idiot.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.350
geeeeeeeeeeeeez!

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.710
karakasa youkai! (fai!) Tatara Kogasa! (fai!) it's a monster!

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.780
Today I'll announce my longtime studies about how to surprise humans!

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.470
bake bake ba! (fai!) beru beru ba! (fai!) urameshiya!

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.310
Approaching quietly, throwing monsters from behind

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.770
If I do that everyone should be surprised!

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.020
what? what? why? No one is surprised!

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.510
I'm a youkai, but don't know how to surprise someone!

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.870
Teach me great person!

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.700
After hearing it, appeared a tiny tiny clever commander

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.300
The only thing I can't do anything is about my master's clumsiness

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.860
Master probably will do this again, so let's ignore it for now

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.510
About master's problem, I'm sure Hijiri will be able to do something.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.930
While I was walking, I heard karakasa's problem

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.710
For your problem I'll give you some of my smartness, the smartness of lactoferrin!

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.290
As the Vaisravana's servant, to help someone is my duty.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100
Don't matter how big is the problem, if it comes to me, I'll give the solution!

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200
For the great person, there's nothing unknown

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.660
Well, no matter what I tell you, it'll be useless...

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:31.050
aah! how cruel! I wanna cry!

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.120
I'm a karakasa who cries before surprising someone

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.050
The mouse youkai taught me a lot

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.220
so now I'll try again, this time it'll be ok.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.730
I won't let call me a â‘¨

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.960
If I do it like she taught me, everyone should be surprised, but

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.260
it was impossible after all.
