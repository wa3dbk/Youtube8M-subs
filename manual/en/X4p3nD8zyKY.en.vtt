Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and I'm going to show you

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.929
how to make a simple wire loop

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.349
you would use this

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.160
when you are putting a bead

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.390
on a head pin or a eye pin

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.100
if you need to have a way to hang a bead from

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.550
your piece of jewelry. So the first thing
you're going to do is place your bead on

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.080
your head pin or your eye pin

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.539
Then you going to take

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.850
a pair of chain nose pliers

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.220
grab

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.260
the wire right above the bead

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.090
give yourself a little bit of room to bend and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.450
bend

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.920
at about forty five degree angle

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.070
you want that bend to be pretty much
right above the bead.You don't need

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.780
much of a space there

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.140
then take round nose pliers

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.620
grab on

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.620
to the wire just above the bend

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.400
pull the wire

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.049
over the top of the round nose pliers

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.360
adjust

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.480
rotate the pliers around and complete

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.440
the loop by pulling the rest of the
wire tail down

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.640
then you're going to flip that over

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.080
take your flush cutters

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.440
and trim the excess

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.240
then you can just take your chain nose
pliers

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.430
and straighten out your loop

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.060
you would open and close this just like a jump ring just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.759
take the open end and

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.220
pull it away

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.700
hang it on something and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.490
push it back

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.890
closed. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
