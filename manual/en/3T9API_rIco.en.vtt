00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.840
Welcome BC 2019! You're in baby.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.880
Congratulations.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.560
Welcome.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.720
Welcome to BC.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.480
You have no idea what's in store for you for the
next four years.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920
This place is beautiful, and it's such a great opportunity in such a great environment,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920
and you look around, it's incredible.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.240
I can honestly say that this is the place where I feel the most comfortable.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.600
My favorite part about BC is how much everybody wants to be here.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.379
Like you're walking through the
quad and you can just tell that you're

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.349
with 9,800 other people who are dying to
be at Chestnut Hill.

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:48.220
The fact that we have, you know, it's a research university, but we also have Division 1 athletics.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.480
This is about broadening experiences, doing different things that you wouldn't normally do.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.440
And BC is this place where I can just think and be reflective and just be myself.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.520
I just feel like people are so invested in who I am and who I want to be

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.280
and really
want to know so much more about me, and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.060
it's just been so transformative in that
it's such a loving and nurturing environment.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.500
Prepare to have some of the most intellectual conversations you'll ever have. BC you will test you.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Be active, and by active I mean don't go run the Res every day

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.880
or go run a marathon, but be active in trying different things.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.380
I mean there's over 200 different
organizations. We have over 30 different

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.020
clubs sports and Division 1 sports.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.240
I've become a certified personal trainer. I've worked on a student film production.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.220
So, I'm at BC TV, WOM, BC Chats, a bunch of acronyms that mean nothing to you, but they will.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.200
You can sign up for any type of club or organization. I don't dance. I can't dance, and yet,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.140
I still tried out for one of the dance teams here my freshman year.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.580
You're lucky. You got the wiffle ball co-ed intramural champion in your presence.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.360
It was one of the hip-hop ones. It was Synergy.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.720
There are so many different service immersion opportunities at Boston College,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.200
and I had the great privilege of going to an Arrupe trip to El Salvador and Guatemala.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170
I think this is a great place to grow, and you're

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.020
gonna be tired, it's gonna be a lot of
work, but it's definitely worth it.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.220
At the same time that BC students are doing so
many things and they're so involved,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.320
every part of their involvement has such
a huge social aspect to it.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.800
We have the city of Boston with all of these great students just everywhere,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.620
museums, concerts, Red Sox games are so much fun.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040
And football season, there's no way to prepare for that.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.600
You might feel overwhelmed, but don't be. BC, it just kind of happens.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.360
Everything that you expect this to be, it's gonna be ten times more than that.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.960
Come to BC for the people.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.760
The faculty. There are so many mentors on this campus that you just have to get to know.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.260
These people will get to know your names. They'll get to know who you are.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.360
They're from all over the world. They're worth knowing.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.540
I am from Newbury, Massachusetts.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.840
I'm from Washington DC.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.160
Oakland, California.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.960
Sarasota, Florida.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.020
Baltimore, Maryland.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.420
I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.820
Corpus Christi, Texas.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.140
I'm from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.520
And I currently live in Doylestown,
Pennsylvania.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.880
Welcome to BC class of 2019.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.060
Get excited. Get off your computer.
Tell the world you're coming to BC baby.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.460
I'll see you on campus.
