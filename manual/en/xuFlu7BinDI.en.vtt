00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.349
I hate flying.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.362
The lines, the crowds, the delays.

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:13.989
I always kind of liked it.

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:16.825
Six hours, one seat,
nobody can get to you.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.619
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.246
welcome aboard nonstop service
from New York to London.

00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:22.956
You fly much?

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.107
All the time, actually.

00:00:54.468 --> 00:00:57.407
Someone on this flight is threatening
to kill someone every 20 minutes

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:01.411
unless 150 million dollars
is transferred to this account number.

00:01:02.642 --> 00:01:04.248
We're midway across the Atlantic.

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.917
How do you kill someone
in a crowded plane and get away with it?

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.134
---

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.638
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need everyone

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:22.391
to raise their hands above their head.

00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:23.622
This is a bad idea.

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:26.562
Marshal, we have the right
to know what the hell is...

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:29.982
Agent Marks, the account number
you gave us is in your name.

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:31.024
What?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.985
That doesn't make any sense.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.654
This is a setup.
Something else is going on.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.793
The FBI, the White House and Interpol
are confirming reports

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.754
that an international flight
has been hijacked by an air marshal.

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:56.758
Agent Marks, our fighters escort
has you in their sights, do you hear me?

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:58.969
We're running out of time.
Do you hear me?

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.977
I'm not hijacking this plane.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:12.441
I'm trying to save it!
