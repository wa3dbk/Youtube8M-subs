00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:08.210
Let’s take a quick look at the TSM 32702
5-shelf stainless steel food dehydrator.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.180
The TSM 32702 food dehydrator is a medium
capacity food dehydrator with a stainless

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.019
steel housing and stainless steel shelves.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.900
It’s a shelf-type unit with a detachable
louvered door, and shelves that slide into

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.140
the unit from the front.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.329
The TSM has a rear-mounted fan that blows
heated air horizontally across the trays from

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.160
the back to the front.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.190
This design promotes even airflow across all
trays so that they don’t need to be rotated

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.620
during drying.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.010
Each tray measures 16.25 x 14.5 inches and
provides 1.6 sq. ft. of drying area.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.360
The TSM 32702 ships with 5 trays and provides
8 sq. ft. of base drying area.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.850
The stainless steel trays have 3/8” holes
and sit on special freestanding brackets,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.750
which can also removed from the machine for
easy cleaning.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.299
The TSM 32702 has a fan and a heating element
that provide 800 watts of drying power.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.479
Controls are mounted on the top rear of the
machine.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.350
The TSM has an adjustable thermostat with
a range of 90 to 165 degrees F, a 12-hour

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.770
shut down timer, and a dedicated power switch.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.189
The door and housing of the TSM 32702 are
22 gauge, food grade stainless steel.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.479
Printed next to the temperature control knob
is a guide that shows recommended drying times

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.450
and temperature settings for a variety of
foods.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.590
The TSM is made in the United States.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.100
With 5 trays, the TSM 32702 dehydrator is
16.5” wide, 18.75” deep, and 9” tall.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:08.319
It weights 32 lbs.
