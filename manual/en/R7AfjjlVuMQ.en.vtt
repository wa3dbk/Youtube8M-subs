00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.120
9, 8, 7, 6,…

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.240
The rocket signs 1, 2 and 3 have to be ready, ok?!

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.160
Unit operations, stay focused!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.320
Thank God!  

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.800
Today, we’ll see what this generation has accomplished.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
We’ll see how every little contribution can make a difference  

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.480
and affect people’s lives.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.680
So what, if this time, our efforts led to us landing on the moon?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.360
How many people have dreamed of this day?! 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.720
And now, it’s not a dream anymore. It’s reality.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.080
 In few minutes, we’ll be landing on the moon. 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.880
This achievement will soon become global.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.240
And we have the honor to witness this day 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.880
and the tremendous work that is undertaken to reach the planets and stars.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.960
May God be with you!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.520
We’re now seeing Khaled who is walking on the moon.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.800
Go Khaled!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.480
Realize our dreams and those of our children. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.600
May God bless you!

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.240
Hi! What’s up man?? 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.000
H….Hi! 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.680
What’s wrong? 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.360
Where did you come from?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.280
I came from earth. Just like you.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.440
How did you get here?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.920
Dude, didn’t you see the hashtag 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.000
#first_man_on_the_moon? 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.640
It’s me!

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.680
Man, there are no towers here!

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.600
Who’s that guy? 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.640
Ahm excuse me, I’m the first one who came here. 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.880
No, I came first.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.040
What’s with the tank over there?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.760
Hey! Why are you making fun of my ride, the Bazuka?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.840
There’s no oxygen here on the moon! 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.240
It’s no problem man. I tried it 2 days ago and it worked!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.600
Look at this bottle at your back?!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.680
It seems like there’s an error. 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.120
Look at the plastic you’re wearing.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.240
Take your stuff and leave!

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.000
Find out who that guy is!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.760
Listen, I named this street the Street of Love.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.440
Listen, I named this street the Street of Love.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.880
Don’t make me say something I might regret! 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.680
Oh God…!

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.320
Please, take your washing machine and leave!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.840
Wait, I’ll call my friends on earth.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.360
Dude, there are no towers here. Are you crazy?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.120
Wait a sec! 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.800
Please go back to earth!

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.560
Just a sec!

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.120
Hello?!

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.080
Man! There are no towers here!! 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.160
Hamoda! 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.440
Man! There are no towers here!!

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.920
Hamoda! 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.040
How come you don’t you know?? How?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.960
Do you understand me or…?!

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.760
What’s wrong with you man???!

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.880
We can guarantee you a wide coverage on earth. 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.840
But on the moon? Well, we’re working on it!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.040
Better network. Wider coverage. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.040
Nothing stands in your way with Internet from STC.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.560
Two!
