Okay, we're going to start our bead placement
by making a border around our picture and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:14.509
you just take the craft glue and as evenly
as possible you want to draw with the glue

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:24.630
around the picture. You want to try to get
as even a stream of glue as possible and if

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.320
it gets thick in a spot, you can just take
a toothpick or a pin and kind of stretch it

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.160
out or move it around if it's too thick. You
want it to be a nice even ring all around

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:49.350
the picture and then we're just going to,
one by one, place our beads on their side

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.660
all the way around the picture. Okay. Now
when the glue is partially dry, as it begins

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.830
to dry, you can move and manipulate the beads
a little bit, so don't worry about it when

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.040
it's wet and you first do it, and then go
back around after to straighten out anything

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.890
that may not be sticking in the right place.
These are pretty beads. They have kind of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.420
a look of fresh water pearls when they're
all together like this. They're just nice

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:36.760
white glass beads. Okay, we're almost finished
with our pretty pearl beads and then we'll,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.450
okay when you get all your beads around the
photo like this, then you can take a minute

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.530
to just check, check to see if they're even,
give them a little push wherever they might

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.049
need to be straightened out. Then we'll let
that dry. Next we're going to put the beads

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.660
on the outside of the heart.
