00:00:15.556 --> 00:00:21.721
Welcome to this new recording. Today, Japanese Black Pine from seed.

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:28.972
Breed and grow pine trees is a special task and hard work

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:34.443
... and very constant. It takes several years to get good results.

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:42.402
... and at least fifteen to twenty years for a tree like this that I have in my hand.

00:00:43.518 --> 00:00:47.817
... It was propagated by seed in year 90 ...

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:49.275
...So, I hope enjoy it...

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.101
Are seeing the first phase of planting of the seeds, after two months after germination.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:50.611
Maybe after the growing season will be transplanted to a pot of 10 cm.

00:01:52.174 --> 00:02:04.927
... but it is important to know that during this stage of seedling, are fertilized ...

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:12.174
... and well controlled during fertilization.

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:24.109
It is important to know that sun exposure should be gradual ...

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:37.855
... until, reaching the four hours of full sun during the morning or afternoon ...

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:45.853
About after a year or two, depending on the development of the seedling

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:52.824
... you can begin the training of pine, starting the wiring, to form the trunk ...

00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:59.770
... because it is very important to do at this point, for further training.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.466
It is convenient wire with a wire protected by a cover.

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:12.600
...this helps protect the tree bark.

00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:22.412
Wire, creating a twisted way, yet natural conditions ... and attractive to the trunk.

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:28.388
The same species of tree planted on the same day given as a result, different seedlings of different sizes ...

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:39.255
... Like this one we saw recently, the two have been planted at the same time ... and both have

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:43.545
are heavy enough, as for wiring.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:53.108
Especially in this case and this too ... but this must wait another year ...

00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.733
... although some prefer to discard this material.

00:03:55.733 --> 00:04:00.463
Then the initial wiring must be done from the first year or second...

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:05.338
depending on the development of the seedling.

00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:26.726
Well .. here we are in the presence of a tree about seven or eight years.

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:33.148
Begin to work its lower branches and nebari, cleaning foliage...

00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:38.928
it can be used to choose a form of tree with low branches

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.574
Maybe for a Shohin, or a bonsai tree medium size.

00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.951
This tree has been conducted to evaluate this possibility.

00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:52.555
In the case of black pine, it is important to consider techniques of growth ...

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:58.867
branches or trunks of escape, which used to grow the tree faster.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:06.019
is very important to cultivate in this way, so that the base of the trunk ...

00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:14.346
grow vigorous and stronger, as well as its branches

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.414
... and gives the tree grow faster. It is very important ...

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:30.620
... to form trees in a short time, relatively ... of seven to ten years.
