00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.520
Chandler elementary school has banned a
nine-year-old

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.010
from wearing a My Little Pony backpack
now this little kid Grayson Bruce was

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.330
severely bullied

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.950
after he wore his my porn My Little Pony
backpack to school

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.270
I'm and since it triggered bullying
according to the school administrators

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.990
they decided it wouldn't dealing with
the actual bullies what we just tell

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.189
them hey you know what don't wear that
black cock

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.449
and everything will be fine well his
mother is upset about this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.960
understandably so so she's pulled him
out at the school and is currently home

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.880
schooling him

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.710
%uh until they find another school to
put him in but I think this is so

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.840
symbolic

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440
the way that our country handles bowling
right now and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.020
a lot of other issues including sexual
assault and rape bright don't blame

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.460
the the people that are doing the bad
thing blame the victims it is their

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.100
fault

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.289
they said that the big races the school
put out a statement saying the graces

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.850
bag

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.370
created a disruption in the classroom
build the structure wasn't when they try

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.690
to keep the poor kid that's

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.440
all my god that was my son all I'd be so
mad

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560
but I don't know how you folks handle it
and I don't know how I'm going to handle

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.060
it

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.430
but you know these other kids in the
rough up by kid blue backpack

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
oh my God my anger could be so I did

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.759
like but you gotta stay at over the I
mean you gotta have the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
authorities the principles the school
staff make sure they jewed kate is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.400
properly

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.009
and then when they screw you it's a oh
yea it will your kids backpack

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.020
herded for the boys that the boys what's
your kids ball

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.720
all my then I'd be seeing red I don't
understand why

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.460
in the agent zero-tolerance policies
administrators are unwilling to deal

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.860
with bullies another theme that I see

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
over and over again when it comes to the
issue bullying and it's really

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.110
frustrating

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.000
because in this case you know you want
to celebrate the kid is doing something

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.390
different he likes my little pony: good
I'm glad you like my little pony: you

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.640
tell him that hey it's your fault

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.899
that people are blowing you because
essentially that's telling him he your

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.740
identity and what you like

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.689
is a weird and we agree with the police
so take that shit off before you come

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.399
the class

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.039
by the way now the boys have been
punished it's unbelievable and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.010
Greece's mom marine said seeing a lunch
by is a trigger for bowling is like

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.120
seeing a short skirt

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.959
is a trigger for rape it's flawed logic
doesn't make any sense

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.650
so absolutely right about that and now
in the missed the story we also find out

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.170
about a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.670
phenomenon that I had no idea about
bronze yet family these are

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.560
hip boys and men who were into my little
pony:

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.590
right now look I actually grew up unto
the ages 8 in Turkey

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.170
and so I missed all these Childress I
don't even know what my little pony:

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.720
years

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.150
rate it's a small pony I get yeah I
guess so I

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.170
okay is %uh like to me I'm I'm confused
by the brawny concept to remain

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.260
but teaches all who cares who cares who
cares right

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.239
and so a poor kid 11-year-old boy after
he will had the same kinda

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.470
harassment a in in a different town in
February

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.000
tried to commit suicide because me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.890
bullied him for having a My Little Pony
paraphernalia

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.420
and now I as potentially lifelong
brain-damaged no on on on on on how you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.860
deal with the bullies

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.110
then you don't blame the victim that's
crazy

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.659
there needs to be more education about
the issue because it's

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.920
its really more prevalent than we
previously thought. rate we're seeing

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.599
more more cases the teenagers committing
suicide and

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.650
it's not always for cases involving my
little pony: of course it has to do with

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.319
a teenager sexuality

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.239
or you know ethnic background whatever
it is and you have to educate people and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.799
and make it on call to believe because
right now you're considered one of the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.610
cool kids

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.599
if you're going around bossing people
around or ridiculing people

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.599
if you could change the culture around
that you're not gonna have as many

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.629
instances

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.040
as we see in in this case in Chandler
elementary school

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.730
so I don't know and also if I were a
school administrator or you're gonna

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.849
give this kid a hard time because the
backpack is wearing alright while

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:00.620
they're gonna be

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.510
serious issues including suspension if
it's gonna continue on expelling you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.870
whatever it takes

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.569
you gotta send a message that it's not
acceptable behavior

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.720
I i feel like we've kinda said it
without knowing it um

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.280
I don't think their intention with the
same this kid is the problem

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.479
it's lazy and they going this is easier
does have a fabulous top one kid ink and

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.360
a backpack cuz

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.250
their dogs and I thinking up for the big
deal is stuck in a backpack

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.210
you have a problem instead of going
after all the kids were doing cuz that's

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.040
more kid that's bigger numbers

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.470
that's probably taken to a Batmobile I
could not believe in the corner about

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.160
them you know

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.430
it's hard to catch every time so I think
I have too hard with complete to start

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.449
bringing a backpack

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.550
it'll be over so I thinking that easier
route in really

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.690
they don't realize that they blame in
the making I think I'm gonna and I

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.130
I think you're both right I think good
yeah it's generally

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.979
Hawkins razor is the simplest answer is
usually true

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.979
and with unfortunately the symbols
answers often

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.630
that people are lazy and so I got Bahama

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.470
find eleven different believes that
stuff just a stop when that bike and

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.039
backpack and everything will be fine

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.560
says I'll get with the house a Braun
guaranteed us with the bristles think

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.370
both those things
