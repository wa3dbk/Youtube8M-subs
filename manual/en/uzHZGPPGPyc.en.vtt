00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello everyone!

00:00:02.027 --> 00:00:10.044
In this video, I'll focus on removing the red-eye effect
from pictures in RealWorld Photos.

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:12.784
Let's start with something simple.

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:17.772
Some rabbits actually have red eyes, but not this one.

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:19.301
It is an artifact.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.270
Zoom in and switch to the Red-eye remover tool.

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:33.180
Click in the center of the eye and drag with left button down
to set the region for red color removal.

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:40.425
If the picture quality is high enough,
removing of the red-eye effect is very easy.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.013
Let's try it on another picture.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.885
Zoom in with your mouse wheel.

00:00:52.374 --> 00:01:00.135
Press the mouse wheel, the middle button or
the mouse back button and drag to pan the picture.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:11.791
If you fail to hit the center, just undo the last action
with a mouse gesture or keyboard shortcut and try again.

00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:14.767
Easy, isn't it?

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:20.285
You can remove red eyes in your .jpg files with RealWorld Photos

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.065
without degrading the picture quality caused by .jpg re-compression.

00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:32.268
The red eye effect on the next picture is much more intense.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.835
It is actually larger than the eye and blurred.

00:01:39.313 --> 00:01:45.344
If I try to remove it like before, the results are not satisfactory.

00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:48.736
We'll have to remove it manually.

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:53.334
Switch to the Retouch tool.

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:57.933
Set the retouch effect to Desaturate.

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.731
Make sure the brush size is appropriate.

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:07.647
Desatureate the red region.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.914
The effect strenght is set to 50% and that does not seem to be enough.

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:24.207
I'll set it to 100% and try again.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:35.683
No, not good. Let's try it once more.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.765
It is not ideal, but it is a beginning.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:03:03.251
The red eye effect on this picture has actually
destroyed the eye and we'll have to re-create it.

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:09.682
Lower the intensity and desaturate the edges.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.861
Switch to darken effect and draw a pupil.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.665
On both eyes.

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:41.623
This is better, but the eyes should actually be blue and not grey.

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:48.077
Switch to a blue color and change the retouch effect to Colorize.

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:52.514
Lower the effect strenght.

00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:58.791
Wow, this blue is too intense, use a brigher one.

00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:03.809
Colorize the iris on both eyes.

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:12.042
Now, let's have a closer look at the eyes.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:18.516
There are still traces of the red color above and below the eyes.

00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:25.502
Use the Clone tool to remove it.

00:04:26.143 --> 00:04:34.086
Watch my tutorial on object removing to learn how to use the Cloning tool.

00:04:54.358 --> 00:04:57.918
This looks better. Do the same for the other eye.

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:15.429
The blue color seems to be too intense.

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:21.476
Let's do what we have already done today - desaturate it a bit.

00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:47.809
This photo is blurred and the eyes are too sharp.

00:05:48.158 --> 00:05:57.234
Although, it actually lowers the eye quality,
it will look more natural if I blur the eyes.

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:03.164
Let's switch to the Soften retouch effect and blur the eyes a bit.

00:06:06.648 --> 00:06:10.880
Pictures with red eyes are quite often blurry.

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:15.420
This is due to the poor lighting conditions.

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:21.612
Hence this trick might get handy in your case too.

00:06:22.728 --> 00:06:27.842
Thanks for your attention and thanks for watching.
