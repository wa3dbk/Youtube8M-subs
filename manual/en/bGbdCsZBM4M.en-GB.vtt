00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
Hydroponic Gardening Experiment.

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:04.300
So I've decided to do another hydroponics experiment.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
This one is NFT (Nutrient Film Technique)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
I'll show you around.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This only cost me Â£30 in total.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.620
Thought why not let's have a blast.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.120
Let's have a look in here and see what its made of, see how it works.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.540
This is where the nutrients come in or where they are stored in the reservoir. 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.120
They get pumped down this tube. Down the back there and comes back up here.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.180
 Goes in there.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.040
Then it flows back through this tube.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.580
Back into the reservoir.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.060
So, I have got two types of plants in here,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.380
I've got peppers...

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.960
and tomatoes.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.760
I have done them like this because,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.820
the experiment is really to see...

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.440
If the plants grow better in deep water or

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
shallow water.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.840
As you can see it's on an angle.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.880
 So the water collects here, 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.920
at this end, it flow straight past until about here.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.500
where it starts collecting, so it's deeper.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.720
That's why plants are set out like that.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.380
Got two tomatoes...

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.560
 and two peppers.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.120
(cough) :)

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.620
Show you what's going on underneath.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.420
There's the roots.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.140
I have done this a different way...

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.460
I haven't grown the plants in rock wool straight away...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.720
I've taken them  from soil.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.460
then cleaned the roots.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.540
This is what they started of as.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.120
These really need replanting.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.260
They where started in soil.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.880
Just standard compost.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.020
Cleaned the roots, then...

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.580
put them in these net pots.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.080
I dangled the roots through, as you can see.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.760
They have been in for about a week.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
Pretty good new roots.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.100
Crap camera.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.120
You can see the big white new roots sticking out.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.480
They are getting a bit of an algae problem,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.060
Which I believe, is down to the reservoir.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.700
The problem may be down to the white bucket.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.760
I doubt it's anything to do with that gap cos it's too small.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.740
All that is new roots at the bottom...

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.600
the brown stuff at the top is the old roots.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.940
This one is growing roots right at the end.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.580
The water is running dtraight past this one.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.840
The water is flowing down here.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.000
So the roots are trying to go towards the deeper end.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.040
Not sure if you can see,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.020
there is alot more water at this end.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.160
It's an inch or two deep.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.120
After a week you can alreay see...

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.240
that the two in the shallow end

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.040
they are a lot smaller

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.940
than these ones.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.240
These ones are doing really well,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.520
these ones are smaller.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.100
We will see how this hydroponics experiment goes.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.800
Thank you for watching.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.340
Hydroponic Gardening.
