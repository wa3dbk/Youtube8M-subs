00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.240
Hunter's newest addition to the micro
irrigation family is our Point Source

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.840
Emitters.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.699
These emitters are designed and assembled
in our headquarters and manufacturing

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:21.140
facility in San Marcos, California.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.610
Drip irrigation continues to be an
important part of efficient irrigation

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.990
practices,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.210
particularly in arid climates where
water is scarcer and is subject to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.110
higher levels of evaporation.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.360
Point source emitters are great for
delivering water right to the plant.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
This efficient delivery method ensures
the minimal amount of water is used to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.860
keep plants thriving.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.080
All Hunter point source models are
pressure compensating from 10 to 50 PSI

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.580
or 1 to 3.5 bar. The emitters are available
in 1 of 3 popular connection options:

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.160
the Self-Piercing Barb, 10/32
threaded

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.280
and 1/2 inch female. With flow rates
ranging from .5 gallons per hour

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.940
or 2 liters per hour all the way up
to 6 gallons per hour

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.789
or 23 liters per hour, you can
make sure the plants get the right amount

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.750
of water they need from a single
emitter.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.399
There is a wide range of flow rates to
choose from. The traditionally popular

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.509
ones are:

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.800
.5 gallons per hour or 2
liters per hour, 1 gallon or 4

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.220
liters per hour

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270
and 2 gallons per hour or 8 liters
per hour.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.030
Expanded rates allow for more output
from a single emitter.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.590
These are 4 gallons per hour or 15
liters per hour

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.110
and 6 gallons per hour or 23
liters per hour.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
A diffuser cap is also available and
should be used to apply the water more

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.909
gently with these higher flow emitters

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.390
or anytime additional outlet protection
is required

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.400
due to bugs or debris. Hunter point source
emitters have an easy to use yet

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.500
rugged design.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.240
The coined edges are designed for easy
installation.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.750
The self-piercing barb emitters can be
inserted into any supply tubing without

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.729
tools for a fast installation.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.689
They're available in quantities of 25
or 100 per bag.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.230
Emitters are also available in
10/32 threaded models for use

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.720
with poly-flex risers.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.209
All have the coined edges for easy
handling.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.250
They're available in quantities of 25 per
bag.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.570
The units are labeled by flow in both
Imperial and Metric units.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.440
They are color-coded to identify their
flow rates. Blue -

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.080
0.5 gallons per hour or 2
liters per hour. Black - 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.950
1 gallon per hour or 4 liters
per hour. Red - 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.110
2 gallons per hour or 8 liters per
hour.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.230
Tan - 4 gallons per hour or

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.030
15 liters per hour. And orange at 6
gallons per hour

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.610
or 23 liters per hour.
