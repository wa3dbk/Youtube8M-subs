00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.015
Hi, I'm Jeff Wilson.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.370
You know, it's fun to deck out
your backyard deck or patio.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.100
Once all the cleaning's complete
on your outdoor

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.350
surfaces, it's time to apply
a protective finish.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.830
Just as with your indoor wall
color, the color of finish

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.690
that you choose plays a big
part of the finished look.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.610
You might be amazed at
the possibilities.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.540
Take this deck.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.660
It's coated in Thompson's
WaterSeal Deck &amp; House solid

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.980
latex stain in cedar tone.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060
Underneath this stain, some of
the wood was new and some old.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.210
The solid stain covers the
difference in wood color, but

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.990
it still allows you to
see the wood texture.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.590
Unlike paint, stain and other
types of exterior

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
waterproofers are absorbed by
the wood and don't form a film

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.690
on its surface.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.100
So they'll stand up
to foot traffic.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.910
But that's just one
possible look.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.650
Now if you don't want to change
the deck's color, go

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.200
with a clear waterproofer.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.080
For example, these cedar posts
have been protected with

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.090
Thompson's WaterSeal
Waterproofer

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.260
Plus Clear Wood Protector.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110
Our furniture shows you
other options of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.380
coating outdoor wood.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.800
This table is stained with
Thompson's WaterSeal

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
Waterproofer Plus Tinted Wood
Protector in cedar.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.650
This waterproofing coating
resists mildew and UV damage,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.100
and it adds color without hiding
the natural wood grain.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.860
And for even more variety in our
deck, the chairs have been

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.640
protected using Thompson's
WaterSeal Deck &amp; House

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.800
semi-transparent latex stain.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.820
It adds more coverage than the
tinted wood protector, but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.740
still lets you see
the wood grain.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.800
So, to recap, your options
from Thompson's WaterSeal

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.230
include a clear wood protector
or a tinted wood protector.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.360
There's also a semi-transparent
stain or a

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.950
solid stain that come in
a total of 117 colors.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.640
Each of these products is
available in an oil-based or

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.240
water-based version.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.790
The tough coatings will protect
from water damage,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.140
resist mildew, and fading.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.300
Check out our Thompson's
WaterSeal Advanced

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.090
waterproofer line for the
ultimate combination of the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.220
most powerful waterproofing
protection and great

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.460
convenience features, like
application just hours after

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.720
cleaning the wood.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.510
You'll be happy to know that
application is easy once the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.410
surface is properly cleaned.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.729
Check the label on your
Thompson's WaterSeal product

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.130
for the recommended
applicator.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.080
A brush or paint pad
will always work.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.190
A pump-up garden sprayer also
works with clear or tinted

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.390
products, but you should go back
over the surfaces with a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.600
brush or paint pad to smooth
in the coating.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.250
Creating an outdoor living
space adds beauty and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.380
value to your home.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.070
And it could be a fun project.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.040
Thompson's WaterSeal products
can help to create an outdoor

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.500
area that fits your lifestyle
and tastes--

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350
and that you'll be proud
to show off.
