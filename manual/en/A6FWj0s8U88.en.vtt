00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.205
My name is Franklin.

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.113
I haven't always lived here.

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:15.532
Not so long ago,
my life was very different.

00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:20.286
That was when I used to live
with my brother Bernard.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.706
Now?
I live alone.

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.003
Maybe I should leave this place.
What do you think, Mr. Olivetti?

00:00:29.678 --> 00:00:31.382
Have you talked
to Mr. Olivetti, today?

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:33.508
I killed him.
He's lying dead on the floor.

00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:37.205
Wait till it gets dark.
Then make it look like a suicide.

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:43.852
To whom it may concern...

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:49.346
Suicide?

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:52.152
That's what the physical evidence
wants to suggest.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:54.613
- Your landlord died in a fire.
- Is he okay?

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:56.114
No!
He's dead.

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:58.325
He's packing.

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.550
He said he's moving to Switzerland.

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:03.872
Wherever they take a giant elephant
tusker for a musical instrument.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.173
With my proven methods

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.635
you vastly reduce your chance
of a brain attack.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:17.969
Where is he?

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.263
I'm in the middle of a 40 day cleanse.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.891
Ridding myself of all my herpes.

00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:24.393
Can I borrow 20 bucks?

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.829
It'd be a lot easier
to stick in this fork in your throat.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.570
Whatever.

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:33.026
Franklin, sanity is wasted on the sain.

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.405
You only get one shot a this life.
There are no do-over.

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:39.199
Time wasted is time lost.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.910
It doesn't matter
if you live in a small apartment.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.595
or some big mansion on a hill.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:45.622
It's all in your mind.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.001
Because happiness is a state of mind.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:52.838
You're a cute little guy.

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:55.632
You want some?
Come on. Don't make me drink alone.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:01.842
