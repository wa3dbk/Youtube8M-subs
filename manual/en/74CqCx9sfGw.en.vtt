Hi I'm Chef Jordan and I'm going to show you
how to make some easy and nutritious dinners.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.410
In this clip I'm going to show you how to
make a simple breaded and saut?ed chicken

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.330
breast with a pan sauce. The tools you need
for this dish are a cutting board and knife,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:29.990
saut? pan, and a pair of tongs. The ingredients
for this dish are skinless chicken breasts,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.250
Italian bread crumbs, tomatoes, onions, green
beans, chopped parsley and a little touch

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.950
of butter. So the first thing I am going to
do is take my saut? pan and get it preheating

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.360
on a medium high heat. It is really important
to have the pan very hot. First I am going

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.210
to get my chicken breaded while the pan is
preheating. Take the chicken breast and put

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.420
one side down on the bread crumbs, flatten
it down, turn it over and really press it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.039
down against the bread crumbs on the other
side and then I'm going to transfer it to

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:17.439
a clean dish. Do the same thing with the other
chicken breast. Place it in the bread crumbs,

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:25.250
pat it down and then on the other side really
making sure to get a nice even coating of

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.990
bread crumbs around the whole chicken breast.
Now for the sauce of this dish I am just going

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.729
to chop a few vegetables to throw on there
to give it a little flavor and a little body.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.659
First I am going to cut the green beans and
I am going to take the ends and just kind

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:52.829
of snap them off. I am just going to cut these
as thin as I can into small rounds like so.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.419
Great, now that I have my green beans cut
I'm going to set them in the dish and put

00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:03.189
them aside. I want to cut the end off this
tomato first because it has this woody core

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:20.101
that is not very good and just cut it into
a small dice. Great, now I can hear that my

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.909
pan is getting hot and is starting to sizzle
so I'm going to cook my chicken breasts. I

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.349
am just going to drizzle about a tablespoon
of olive oil enough to coat the bottom of

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:37.800
the pan and then add my chicken breast. When
you are adding the breast put it in and drop

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:46.079
it away from you so it doesn't splash back
at you and then the other one. Now in a couple

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.810
minutes I am going to turn this chicken over,
see it has got a nice golden crust and then

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.099
put it in a 350 degree oven for about ten
minutes to finish cooking. Now I am just going

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:09.920
to chop my onions and I only need about a
quarter of this onion and cut it into real

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.849
small pieces and I am going to toss my onions
in with my onions and beans. Alright now the

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:24.100
chicken is done being cooked and I take it
out of the oven and put these beautiful chicken

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.249
breasts on to a late and there is all these
beautiful drippings in my pan that I'm going

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:37.599
my sauce from. First I'm just going to take
any kind of cooking wine. For this I'm using

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.630
a little Chablis. You can use any kind of
wine you would drink, red or white, pour it

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.269
in and I'm just going to scrape off the bits
on the bottom, you get a lot of flavor form

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.939
the chicken on the breading and once that
is reduced a little bit I am going to add

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:02.279
all my veggies and cook those for a minute
until they start to get a little softer and

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:21.060
tender add some butter to the pan and let
that melt. The butter has almost melted so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:32.500
let it go for another minute and now I'm going
to pour it over my chicken and I want to just

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.720
rip a couple fresh parsley sprigs on top and
it gives it a great color and fresh flavor

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.710
and it is a nice contrast with the rich butter
and that's how easy it is to make my breaded

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.080
pan seared chicken breast with pan sauce using
fresh green beans, tomatoes and onions. Enjoy.
