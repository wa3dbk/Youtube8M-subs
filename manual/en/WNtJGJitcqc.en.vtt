hey kids welcome to PDRsan's rubbish bin

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:10.734
today i'm going to be mucking around with the Iron Man Jarvis app

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:16.044
let's open this baby

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.925
this is jarivs

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:31.318
good morning it's Monday 10/14 and the weather is cloudy

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.405
and if we press this

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.618
we can post something to facebook

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
i've heard that you can post to twitter as well on the english version

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:59.676
this is the time, date, a compass and where 
 my thumb is  is where you live

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:02.553
you can also set an alarm here

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:09.064
we press here and you can see the iron man armor

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.681
you're supposed to scan something from the iron 
 man 3 blu ray to see this

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.359
but i just found it on the internet and scanned it

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:24.092
and i think that's all there is to show

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.370
it's free but compared to the english version i think it's pretty crap

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.859
i've heard that on the english version you can talk to Jarvis like Siri

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.724
but all you can do on this one is tap jarvis and

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:40.800
good morning it's monday 10/14 you might be needing an umbrella

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:44.390
you just said a minute ago that is was gonna be cloudy

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.130
he pretty much always says it's gonna be rain (even though it's super sunny)

00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:52.760
you need to check everyday

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.650
i hope you're not trying to piss me off

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.070
let me know if there's anything i can help you with

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:03.740
give me money

00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:08.520
are you messing with me? yes

00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:10.700
i'm trying my best so that you stick to your schedule

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.570
if you have anything you want me to do let me know

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.240
give me money

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:15.860
i'm starting to get tired of this

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:16.620
me too

00:02:19.687 --> 00:02:22.690
i'm the best computer system in the world and 
 this is what you use me for

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.330
i'm busy but if you insist i'm going 
 to have to activate the security protocol

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.660
security protocol self destruct

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830
the data on this device will be wiped clean

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:46.440
wait what...

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:53.990
just kidding
