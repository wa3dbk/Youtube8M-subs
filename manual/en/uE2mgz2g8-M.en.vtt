Hi guys, this is Georgia here from the YouTube
channel, The Vintage Vision.

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:04.440
Welcome back to Haul Rox.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.400
So in this video I'm going to be doing a kind
of comparison and review of my three favorite

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.080
drugstore foundations and my three favorite
high street foundations.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.670
So, let's go.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.170
[music]
So the first drugstore foundation I'm going

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.690
to be talking about is the Bourjois Healthy
Mix Foundation.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.410
This raved about a lot of YouTube and in the
whole broker world.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.790
And this is a really light foundation.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.410
If you have good skin, then I would recommend
this for you just because it's a really light

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
coverage.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.700
If you have more problematic skin, I probably
wouldn't advice it just because it's not really

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.890
going to cover anything up.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.600
It's just kind of going to give you a nice
finish on the skin.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200
It's great for summer time, if you just want
something light.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
So it's got like a gel serum in with the foundation.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.950
So it just glides really nicely onto the skin.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.829
So it says that it's a radiant boost in foundation
and anti-fatigue.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.479
So it's just going to give you that really
radiant glow on your skin.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.070
I am in the shade light beige and this foundation
retails for nine ninety nine.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.860
Which is pretty good for a drugstore foundation.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.440
So I really do recommend this foundation if
you're going for more of a healthy glow.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.240
And this foundation smells really fruity as
well.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.750
So a higher end foundation is Illamasqua's
Light Liquid foundation.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.150
This is actually fairly similar to the Bourjois
Healthy Mix.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.690
In the same sense that it's a really light
coverage foundation.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.350
Again, I'd recommend this if you've got kind
of good ski.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.860
So this foundation balances and evens out
any skin tone.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.450
It also glides on really nicely to the skin.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.090
And because of its light coverage, it leaves
more of a satin finish.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.610
And this is a foundation that I also on a
majority of my clients when I have makeup

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.610
jobs.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.290
So I think it does really suit any skin tone.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.240
As long as you powder over the top, if you
do have more oily skin.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.500
And so, I am in the shade LF140.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.509
Next is another drugstore foundation, which
is one of my favorites.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.090
And it's Revlon Nearly Naked Foundation.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.470
This is an amazing foundation if you don't
want to look like you're wearing any makeup.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.159
It is light coverage but it is really buildable.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.030
But you just really can't tell that you've
got makeup on your face at all.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.719
I'm in the shade 150 Nude.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.230
And overall this foundation just leaves your
skin looking flawless and natural.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.379
It blends in really well into the skin as
well and just gives you a seamless finish.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.420
So I have dry to normal skin and this works
amazing on my skin.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.959
But I also know people that have oily skin
and they rave about the foundation just as

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:44.959
much as I do.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.379
So, I really think it's great for all different
skin types.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.129
Okay, so a really similar foundation is MAC
Face And Body Foundation.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.620
I've just got this in the smaller 50 ml.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.819
I've got this in four different shades just
because I have it in my makeup kit and I use

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.249
it on literally every job I have.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.930
It works well on all different skin tones.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.370
It's also really buildable.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.019
It's a light coverage, but as I said, it is
buildable.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.099
So, you can build it up to a higher coverage.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.400
It's got quite a dewy finish on its own.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.790
So if you just want to matte it out, I recommend
going over it with some powder.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.920
But if you really love that dewy look, it
looks amazing with MAC Strobe Cream underneath.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.589
Or if you just have a kind of dewy moisturizer,
it'll give you that really dewy fresh look.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.870
It's also water resistant and it just has
that real sheer natural look.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.329
And it retails at 21.50 for the 50 ml.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.439
And I am in the shade C3.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.779
So my favorite drugstore foundation I own
at the moment and I'm using everyday is my

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.010
Rimmel Wake Me Up Foundation.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.430
This was raved about again in the YouTube
and Broker world and I had to give it a go.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.329
And I'm just in love with it.

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.310
If you wake in the morning and you really
do want to look you know, fresh and glowing.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.879
Then this really will wake up your skin.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.489
It really does illuminate your skin and makes
you look radiant and just gives you that all

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.439
round flawless glow.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.209
This is anti-fatigue with peptides, which
I'm awful.

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.100
Because in the morning, if you're looking
tired, you just want to wake yourself up and

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.870
just look like you're ready for the day.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.450
So, overall I just think this foundation is
so worth it.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.990
It really does do what it says on the bottle.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.680
And this retail at 8.99 which is great for
a foundation that's going to make you feel

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.940
alive.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.240
It's really affordable as an everyday foundation,
if you don't want to spend too much money

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240
on one.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.060
And I just really recommend that you try it.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.090
So, I'm in the shade Classic Beige 201.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.591
This is slightly dark for me at the moment.

00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:44.150
Just because I bought this in summer time.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.950
So, I tend to mix this with a lighter foundation.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.690
Or I'll wait till summer when I can just use
it on its own.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.930
So, the last high end foundation I have is
NARS Sheer Glow.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.431
This is really popular in the makeup world.

00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.700
But I kind of have a love-hate relationship
with it.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.801
I'm in the shade Deauville.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:06.480
And this coverage is amazing.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.660
If you want a good coverage, this is the foundation
to pick up.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.200
It really just evens out your skin tone completely
and just gives a gorgeous finish.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.010
The only thing is that, although it's called
sheer glow, I find it quite matte on my skin,

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.350
and I'm not sure why.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.480
I do have dry to medium skin.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.341
So maybe I just need to moisturize a bit more
before.

00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:31.300
But I don't feel like it really gives me a
glowing finish.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.170
Although I do know people that have got it
and their skin is left amazing and glowy.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.230
So, I'm not too sure why it doesn't agree
with my skin.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.690
But if you're looking for coverage, this is
amazing.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.060
This foundation is buildable and it is just
really illuminating on the skin.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.150
Well, not on my skin, but on other people
I know, skin.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.710
And it just leaves a glowing finish.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.200
And this retails at thirty pounds fifty, which
is a lot more in the prices side.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.590
But if you want to invest in a great coverage
foundation with a gorgeous finish.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.160
Then I would definitely give NARS Sheer Glow
a go.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.020
Okay, so they are my favorite foundations
from drugstore and from high street.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.690
I'd love to know what yours are from both
ends.
