00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
cars.com auto review

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.059
hi I'm Kelsey mays for cars.com the 2009
Infiniti M might seem old hat for some

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.089
it's been on the market for a few years
now and there's flash your newer

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.680
competitors from both Europe and Asia
still the M is a perennial cars.com

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.789
favorite

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.989
why is that well let's check it out some
call the rear end a little bit too

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.910
blocky but we still think it looks okay
there's kind of a nice short deck lid if

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.090
you think it's too conservative think
about what a real extroverted design

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.020
like BMW 5-series looks like a few years
after it comes on the market may be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.720
conservative is a good thing

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.560
captain quality is pretty much what
you'd expect for a fifty-thousand-dollar

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.060
car dashboard materials are soft to the
touch they have a nice low gloss finish

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.650
to them this is real wood and metal trim
up and down the dash car does have the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.270
optional 14 speaker bose stereo system
it puts little speakers up here next

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.970
year headrests in fact that sounds
pretty good

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.620
unfortunately they also put a giant DVD
audio player that takes up half the

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
center console there is an ipod
connector frankly that's the only thing

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.319
i use this just takes up a lot of space
center controls great example of the

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.729
cars practicality this screen here
doesn't look terrific the graphics are a

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.539
few years behind the times but the
functionality is hard to argue with you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.179
can program the same six stations here
in your preset list to have am/fm and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.329
satellite radio stations you don't have
to dance around three different menus to

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.780
get your six favorites if you get the
navigation system you go to the map here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.380
there's plenty of shortcut keys it's got
a touch screen if you want to use that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.969
there is convenient back buttons here
there's physical zoom in and zoom out

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.009
buttons so that you can go in and out as
you see fit without having to access

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.979
another map menu being m35 this year
gets a horsepower increase to 303

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.429
horsepower up a bit over last year's i'm
35 which had about 275 horsepower and it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.590
should be plenty of power for most
people

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.569
there's plenty of acceleration highway
passing power is excellent the 5-speed

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.460
automatic transmission in our test car
has

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.390
really good response it never kind of
leaves you coming out of the corner

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.290
wondering whether you need a downshift
there's a sport mode this year which is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.819
even more responsive i don't really
think it's necessary but see what you

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.569
like with it

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.010
there's a seven-speed automatic now in
the rear-wheel-drive m35 all the others

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.670
get the five-speed unit if you want more
power you can always get the m45 driven

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840
it before it's got significantly more
torque which is what you really feel

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.739
when you're going from the stoplight gas
mileage in that car course not very good

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.780
interior quality and driving dynamics
are certainly solid p.m. is also a very

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950
practical choice safety and reliability
ratings have been exemplary that's not

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.180
something we can say for every car in
this league in fact the M might just be

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.989
the luxury car for these difficult
economic times because even when you're

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.760
shopping $50,000 sedan you still need to
be very careful about where you spend

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.480
your money

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.480
the M might just be the best choice out
there today
