00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.430
Apple’s new iPhone 6 is the slipperiest
ever made, it’s also extremely thin which

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.679
makes it prone to drops, and to add on, the
protruding camera is always at risk to getting

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.059
scratched.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.820
All of the above are reasons why a case or
some type of protection truly is necessary

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.269
for this generation’s iPhone.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.929
The only problem is that if you have an iPhone
you’ll want to show off the logo, you don’t

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.899
want covered in some ugly old bulky case,
but that’s where Rearth’s Ringke Fusion

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.429
comes into play.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.329
It has a rather unique build to it that combines
a hard shell backing on the rear with a firm

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.489
tpu that goes around the edge of the iPhone.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.379
It makes getting the iPhone 6 in and out of
the device a bit of a pain, but it will ensure

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.050
there’s a zero percentage chance of the
phone ever sliding out.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.379
One thing the ringke fusion has that many
others don’t is that there are covers going

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.320
over the lightning port and also the headphone
jack, this ensures that no debris or dust

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.660
somehow slides in there when the phone is
in your pocket or just throughout the day.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.900
I’m not sure how useful this is in a real
life scenario, but it’s a nice touch nonetheless.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.400
In regards to buttons and ports, the Ringke
Fusion will give you complete access to everything

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.920
like the camera, lightning port, and the volume
rockers and power buttons are extra clicky

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.530
which is always nice.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.120
Like I mentioned earlier this case is a hybrid
between a tpu and hardshell, and it feels

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.550
nice in the hand.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.930
It certainly adds some much needed grip to
the slippery iPhone 6 while not feeling to

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.400
sticky.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.649
One thing I have noticed is that my model
actually did come with some scratches on it,

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.630
to me it’s not a big deal, but they do have
a 90 day warranty so if yours gets scuffed

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.979
up, you can get it replaced.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.220
Believe it or not this case is currently under
10 dollars which is a great value for the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.220
money.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.759
It comes in four different color accents,
with the backing being clear on all models.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.630
The color is actually changed around the tpu
material ring, it’s a bit tough to explain

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.740
the color options without actually showing
you the product page, so I’ll have it linked

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.930
in the description for you to check out.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.030
Anyway, the Rearth Ringke Fusion could be
the best iPhone 6 case on the market right

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.330
now.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.670
If you’re interested in my written review
of the case or where to buy it, you can find

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.660
