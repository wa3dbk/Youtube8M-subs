00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.950
Now we're going to look at the two sides of
footwear in the 60's. The main appearance

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.360
that was new was the appearance of boots.
Especially boots as wear for women. Previously

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.019
boots had only been worn by men, maybe in
the working environment. Women really didn't

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.849
wear them. They wore evening shoes. And so
the mods popularized a mid-calf or knee-high

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:28.619
boot. I'm wearing an example right now. Now,
these you can see a few things, one, there's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
a very high heel. You either wanted the heel
to be really high or you wanted it to be flat.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.670
There wasn't really too much in between that.
It's suede, which was a very popular fabric

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.250
and these are off-white, but it's a neutral.
There was virtually no color in mod dressing,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.070
it was white, it was black, occasionally you
would have a splash of red in there, but in

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.350
general it was just white or black. And so
these boots really go along with that. I have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.070
another pair of boots for the mod look that
I can show you. And these would actually have

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.510
been worn mostly by women but maybe even by
men. Some men were wearing heels at the times

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.110
on their boots. And these are a very small
heel. They're practically flat. And they're

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.850
mid-calf length which means they're lower
than the boots I'm wearing right now. And

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.750
that was actually a new length as far as boots
or any shoes, really, that emerged in the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.230
60's. These are also leather you can see.
The shoes, really, not much synthetic fabric

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.540
as far as that goes. Leather was really the
way to go. And these were especially popularized

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.470
in England. You'll see old pictures of the
Beatles and they're in boots similar to this.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.350
It was really just the mainstay of mod fashion.
Now, once again, as a counterpoint to those

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.760
shoes, you have what the hippies wore. And
we see similarly to the way we saw in jewelry

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.420
a really great love of natural fabrics and
natural colors. So I'm going to show you some

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.840
hippie shoes. Now these might not look so
dissimilar to something we might wear today

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.209
but I want to point out a few things. One,
they are actually genuine leather which means

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.310
it's a natural material and they're handmade,
once again, which would be really important

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.720
to hippie culture. They're also a neutral
color; brown and bronze or tan were really

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.359
popular. And they're completely flat. Alot
of hippies didn't wear shoes at all, they

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.260
went completely barefoot. But where that wasn't
allowed or where it wasn't practical, like

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.939
in a city, they would often wear shoes like
this. Just look at how completely different

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.230
these are than a mod shoe. These really show
you the feet whereas a boot covers it up as

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.080
much as possible.
