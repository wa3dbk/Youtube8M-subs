00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.690
We are testing the BMW 435i Convertible today

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.150
to relive one of our favorite days so far

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.797
last year, we were here with a previous generation M3 Convertible

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.494
it was a glorious day

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:47.318
great weather, like it is now

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:52.239
and today we will do it all again with the 435i Convertible

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.442
it used to be a 3-series but it's called a 4-series now as you know

00:00:57.442 --> 00:00:59.479
this is it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.682
let's start with a feature which is really helpful for us

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:06.062
normally when we film a convertible

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:08.047
the car offers too little space for all of our stuff

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.215
it has to be under a cover and you can't reach it properly

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:12.646
but BMW have a great solution

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:17.809
we have quite a lot of gear with us

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:21.091
tripods, camera bag and another bigger case

00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:26.547
when you need something it just doesn't work

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:29.391
but BMW have made this ingenious system

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:30.952
how does it work again?

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:35.010
right, this button here

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.783
when you push it the entire roof construction is raised

00:01:41.783 --> 00:01:43.967
push back this cover

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.721
and suddenly there is a lot of space and it's accessible

00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.602
very smart

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.421
close this and push the button to lower it

00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.696
extremely easy

00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:03.624
and we're ready to drive

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:06.387
inside here it's all very BMW

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:11.375
not very distinct but a very nice place to be

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.460
the beautiful BMW gear lever

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.976
and a nice screen

00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:24.567
we have the -35i today

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:28.794
you can also get a -28i and a -20d

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:32.113
I can already tell you, you should get the -35i

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:38.328
the -28i with 245HP is about â‚¬6k less expensive

00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:44.749
but believe me, the -35i is worth the price difference

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.743
it has a fantastic six-cylinder engine with turbo

00:02:48.743 --> 00:02:51.076
this engine has been around for a while

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:53.949
since the previous generation 3-series

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.011
and it has just evolved so much since then

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.349
it is really very refined

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:04.145
it still has 306 hp and 400Nm

00:03:04.145 --> 00:03:06.983
it does 0-100km/h in 5.5 seconds and a topspeed of 250km/h

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:14.573
the sound of a six-cylinder is just delicious

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:20.658
so we have established that the -35i is the one to have

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:25.500
the next choice is between a manual or automatic gearbox

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.891
we have the automatic gearbox

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:31.105
and keeping up with Porsches

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:36.279
is no problem at all

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:47.085
it shifts insanely fast

00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:49.824
and it's just an ordinary automatic gearbox

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:53.264
it's less nervous than a double clutch equivalent

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:56.443
but it does have the speed of one

00:03:56.443 --> 00:04:02.602
I can safely say that this is the best gearbox available

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.635
it's fantastic

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:05.616
10 out of 10

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.280
very impressive

00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:19.300
the one we're driving today is fitted with the "M" package

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.552
which makes it just a tad more firm and direct

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:29.564
it is a delight to drive

00:04:29.753 --> 00:04:31.615
it's not a real "M"

00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:34.025
so It's not razor sharp

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:36.820
so not suited for driving on the track

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.218
but it just feels good

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:04.343
as usual you can have practically any optional extra you want

00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:08.556
one of which is this great Harman/Kardon sound system

00:05:08.556 --> 00:05:11.269
you might think it's not necessary

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.866
and that you can't really tell the difference

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.075
at least that is what I always think

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:19.866
until you crank the volume in this car

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:24.935
you can really hear that it's something special

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:26.943
the sound quality is extremely good

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:47.595
so it handles pretty good

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:49.160
if you want a super sharp 4-series

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.175
you have to wait for the M4

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:56.450
but this engine makes up for it

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.468
because it has been around for a while

00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:02.802
the tuners know their way around it

00:06:02.802 --> 00:06:05.758
I think that is one of the cool things about a -35i engine

00:06:05.758 --> 00:06:12.030
you can get "M-perfomance" figueres from this block

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.830
some quite basic tuning will get it up to 400+ hp

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.195
so, like with the Audi S4 Avant Max tested

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:24.021
this car can evolve alongside you

00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.603
if you want more power

00:06:26.603 --> 00:06:29.450
or a better sound through a new exhaust system

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.719
it can be done by one of the many BMW tuners there are

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:39.220
especially an exhaust will do great things on this car

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.995
it also does sound great right now

00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:44.977
you get some great crackles when you release the gas pedal

00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:47.553
or with a downshift

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:49.376
it's not overdone

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:52.212
it sounds quite civilized

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:55.476
as a -35i should sound

00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:08.815
we have had a great day today

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:10.707
like we had with the M3

00:07:10.707 --> 00:07:12.011
beautiful weather

00:07:12.115 --> 00:07:13.966
great amount of power

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.195
gorgeous car which handles nicely

00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:18.319
and the top down

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.972
these are the days for which we live

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:25.061
I especially want to thank BMW Van Laarhoven in Eindhoven (NL)

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:27.698
for lending us the car

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:31.472
please pay them a visit if you are interested in this car

00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:38.303
they are very enthusiastic and very helpful over there

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:40.387
the only thing you have to decide

00:07:40.387 --> 00:07:42.845
do you want a coupe or a convertible?

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:45.706
I know I would want to have the top down

00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:49.610
but let us know what you would have!
