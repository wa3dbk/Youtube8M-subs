island geographically!

It’s way down in the south, sharing a coastline
with the Andaman Sea.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.970
That explains why there are over 30 beaches
on the island to choose from, and the choices

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.739
are not only endless, they’re fantastic.

show you three of the most popular.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.360
Karon beach is the second largest beach in
Phuket.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.199
It’s a good mix of resort complexes and
undeveloped beach as well.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.430
These clear waters are fantastic for diving
and snorkeling.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.630
Its totally laid back, you can parasail and
it’s home to Phuket’s largest beach side

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.600
park, Nong Harn Lake.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.330
This is Kata Beach, around 20 kilometers from
the island’s center Phuket Town, is definitely

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.920
one of the island’s most beautiful beaches.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.430
The waters are clean and pristine, perfect
for surfing, diving and it’s really safe

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.430
to swim.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.819
Kata is actually split into beaches, Kata
Yai and Kata Noi.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:49.789
Kata Yai is more developed, with more hotels
and restaurants, while Kata Yai is smaller,

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.189
more quiet and relaxed.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.200
Patong Beach is our last stop, and it’s
the busiest beach in all of Phuket.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.709
Here you can find world-class restaurants
and some of the best nightlife in all of Asia.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.710
Bangla Road is where the action happens, especially
at the night bazaar.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.680
There are all kinds of authentic, local, and
the best deals go to those who know how to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680

or even just sun tanning, this is an island
