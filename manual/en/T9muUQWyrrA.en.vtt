00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Drishta will sound the war conch today. Our 
 infantry will attack in the crane formation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yuyutsu, you take our vimanas and try to flank...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You have to put him down!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Bhima! You have to kill the old man!!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
- Urk!!
- You have to kill Bheeshma!!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You saw how many men he killed yesterday! 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He almost killed your son! He almost killed me!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Only you can kill him and yet you don’t!! Why?! Why?!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
- Let… go of me, Bhima.
- Or what?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Peace, brother Bhima. Save your energy for your enemy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The fate of all things hangs in the balance. Stand alongside your brothers. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Only united will you...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I know the score, Lord Krishna. . 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And the good news for all of you is my rage knows no bounds.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I can rue my brothers’ weakness even as 
 I plot the slaughter of my cousins.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Remember, Arjuna - dear brother, the ocean of 
 death Bheeshma wroughts is on your head.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Kill him quickly, or you will find yourself drowning in all that blood.
