Hi, I'm Tim Gipson. I'm going to talk to you
about how to hang a heavy wall mirror. Now,

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.610
the first thing we've got to consider is the
attach points in the wall. And what we want

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.580
to do is we want to use a device that has
a higher rated, as far as the amount of weight

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.410
it will hold. And usually these are rated
in pounds and you can find something that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.860
is probably rated around the seventy five,
hundred to hundred pound range would be really

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.180
good to use. These type of hooks that we have
up here in the wall are very good to use.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.719
These actually self tap and screw directly
into the drywall. And they give you a very

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.910
solid secure attach point that will not pull
out. And they're a lot easier to use than

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.539
having to use toggles. Then the next thing
we need to do on our heavy mirror is we need

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.999
to install on the back side of it, a couple
of these loops. And then between the loops

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:06.350
we'll install this picture wire. And it's
special wire that has a lot of tensile strength.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.590
So, it means you can pull on it and it's very
tough. It will not break. So, once we have

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.190
this in place and you want to make sure when
you loop this around that you loop this wire

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.549
around to terminate at least four or five
times. So, with that wire on there, then we

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:30.360
can support the picture and with our hand
just guide it up over these two hooks. And

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.140
of course one thing that's nice about the
wire on the two hooks is it's easy to make

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.689
sure you match your mirror and make sure it's
straight up and down. And you can be assured

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.719
that using those heavy weight attach points
and hooks for your wall, and then using the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.920
picture wire on the back. You don't have to
worry about hanging very heavy mirrors such

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.940
as this. So, I'm Tim Gipson and that's how
to hang a heavy mirror.
