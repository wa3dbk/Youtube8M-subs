00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.980
We are in Brooklyn

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.140
We are in Chicago, the windy city

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.580
which we have been told is the best pizza the New York city has to offer

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.200
and we are about to try deep dish Chicago style pizza

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.560
amm hmm amm hmm

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.620
so this here is Soppressata supposedly This is what pepperoni wants to be when it grows up

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.220
it's better pepperoni it has got black garlic and four cheeses

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.000
This is Panchetto and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.020
look at the sweating of the meats, I like it when my meat sweats

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.300
that sounds like a good T-shirt right there

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.440
Look at the pile of juice right there

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.036
Pure meat juice 100% meat juice never pass the gloves it's like a       free meat juice right there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.360
Oh my God!  Oh Yeaaah..........

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.740
we are now ready to try the best pizza in New York

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.420
we are in Brooklyn, lets see if it's worth it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.560
that's one of the best pizzas I have ever had in my entire life.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.300
Holy smokes

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.120
the crust is perfectly thin

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.440
what's great about the crust also is that it doesn't have the like soft dough on top

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.900
it's all just like thin but it's not too crunchy at the same time

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.523
what i really like about it is I personally don't like when my pizza sauce taste like tomatoes

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:55.363
you know when it's like straight up, it just that tastes like crushed tomatoes

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:56.803
that adds really nice seasoning to it

00:01:56.803 --> 00:01:58.820
it tastes like a bacon pizza

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.620
I wouldn't say about it more

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.940
Leigh, trivia question for your meal. What is the 26th decimal of pi?

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.860
Sad moan

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.020
This game is rigged

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.680
Oh man

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.760
*Simon moan*

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.040
this is actually an off menu item because we just asked the waitress and she said that there are some pizzas that they can make and this is her special edition

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.506
so if you come here and don't find it,  That's why

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.600
that's great that is great  we should have this pizza like this all the time

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.640
this is white pizza sauce i normally don't like white pizzas WoW that is amazing

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.741
i was actually concerned that this is going to be tough pizza

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:53.781
because whenever you cook meat in the oven that isn't pepperoni and you try to bite through it like a salami then you are like arrrrrrrrrrrrrr

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:54.661
it's actually quite

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.760
some of us are barbarians

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.560
Okay so you ordered a half and half style deep dish pizza

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.600
it has spinach and tomato and mushroom on it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.780
it is a classic combo of butter crust and has sausage, pepperoni, extra cheese Okay

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.960
you can't pick it up with your hand this is my first time having this

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.280
Okay here we go

00:03:43.953 --> 00:03:45.453
let me see how this compares

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:46.259
okay are you ready

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.100
Oh wOw

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.520
Oh my God

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.660
this is so good, but is this really pizza?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.120
look at this

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.400
that is a great piece of pizza

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.980
this is like nothing I've ever had before

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.540
so this crust right here is definitely not as thin as what we are used to

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.520
you can see it's elevated but you can still hold this in your hand

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.600
this is what Korean pizza aspires to be

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:01.408
Korean pizza always has tons of toppings on it

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.460
one bite in and i would order this again

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.900
what is that condensed milk...yeah whatever

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:13.945
Chicago pizza tastes just like that except this is right

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.360
so we have had the best pizza in New York and the best pizza in Chicago

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.700
and the best between the two of them is..we are going to announce on the count of three

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.160
one two three

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.220
Simon: Chicago
Martina: New York

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.060
Simon: What!? 
Martina: Seriously, why?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.558
even though I really like the NewYork style, it was really wonderful

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.040
I think that the flavors in the Chicago pizza by far a lot stronger a lot more impactful

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.860
there was just so much more to it than the New York style pizza

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.120
Okay I love the Chicago pizza I thought it was great but it was by the casserole i had to cut through layers of it

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.780
yeah it was great so much cheese

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.132
and the crust on the edging was not good

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:53.906
but for the New York style pizza i really liked the toppings and the toppings were like the focus

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:57.288
and I was able to eat it and be like Oh my God the mushrooms, the cheese, the this, the that

00:05:57.288 --> 00:06:00.288
I also like the New York style pizzas better if you like talking with friends

00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:04.988
you can't really be sociable if you are like working and knifing and eating Chicago style pizza and try not to make a mess of yourself

00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:08.668
but what NewYork style pizza is you can pick it up and hold in your hand take a bite and talk on the same time

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:11.728
the best pizza overall though was neither in Chicago nor New York

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:14.268
it was in Norway

00:06:14.268 --> 00:06:18.548
they had this Thai style pizza there they actually put ranch sauce on top of it

00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:23.088
there were the cilantro and the peanuts on it and i was like what is this magic pizza

00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:25.846
by far I have had the best pizza in the entire world

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:28.826
Chicago and New York pizza wish they could be Norway pizza

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760
i tried to think i am a salutatory noise out there with wohooo norway

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.877
if you disagree with us which i am sure you probably do

00:06:39.877 --> 00:06:43.997
let us know in the comment section below where we should eat pizza next time so we could eat it right

00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:48.337
and let us know what is your favorite pizza place is if you are in New York or if you are in Chicago or if you are in California

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:52.438
where ever you are let us know where we should go the name of the actual place alright

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:53.538
I like Toronto pizza

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.720
