Alright, so I have my steps cut in now, and
it’s time to roll it. I’ve got my brush

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:15.700
just in case I need it. I have a new reusable
painter tray. I’m going to want to keep

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:24.660
my paint always in front of me so that it
doesn’t get caught behind me, and I won’t

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.560
be able to get it because the stairs are wet.
All of my tools need to go up with me. It’s

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.289
going to take a while for these stairs to
dry. Obviously, you’re going to want to

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:45.070
start at the bottom of your stair rolling
and then move upwards so that you don’t

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.429
get caught down with wet paint. I have a brush
here, a roller brush that is for rough surfaces,

00:00:53.429 --> 00:01:00.549
since these are cement steps. I’m going
to get a lot of paint. I’m actually going

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:08.490
to paint this backwards and go up, but for
the purposes of this video, right now I’m

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.210
just going to do it like this. That’s going
on really nice; it looks good. It does look

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.119
like I'll need my brush, so it’s a good
thing I have it down here to fill in the crease.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.780
Alright, so here’s our freshly painted stairs
and here is the final shot of our product.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:55.060
The trim being cut out there. You see a bit
of the green kitchen in there and then you

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.979
go down and there are the green steps. The
camel colored walls stills have blue tape

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.579
on them. I’m very pleased and I think that
Craig did a great job of picking out colors

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.009
for that I greatly enjoy.
