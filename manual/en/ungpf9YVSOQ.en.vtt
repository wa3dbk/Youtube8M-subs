Hi, it’s me, Lucas again and I’m here
to talk about this beautiful negative edge

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.910
pool remodel. These clients, only about a
year and half ago I think, built the pool

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.970
initially. They tried to find someone to create
a natural environment and they gave up hope.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.710
So they got their one wish, they got their
negative edge pool. The only thing is the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.119
designer of the initial pool didn’t think
about matching the color of the pool with

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.220
the water that it appears to be flowing into.
So part of the redesign of this negative edge

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.200
pool was to do a dark crystal stone interior
finish so that it matches the dark water behind

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.240
it. Also, basically all they were looking
at was some concrete columns and a small negative

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.410
edge into the bay behind them and it didn’t
give them any kind of atmosphere. So what

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.540
we’ve done here is we’ve framed the view
with two beautiful waterfalls and a negative

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.020
edge where the water matches perfectly with
the water color of the bay. So now it appears

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.351
that it’s all one big body of water framed
by two beautiful mountain streams that come

00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:18.729
down into the water. And this was just a really
exciting job to see the transformation happen.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.619
Another thing that really affected the view
of the effect of the negative edge was they

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.190
had it all cut up with the screen cage. And
what we did was, we raised the one bar that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.380
has to be there up above your view so you
don’t see it, the horizontal bar. And then

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.880
the vertical we kept from there up. Whereas
before it came all the way down and split

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.289
your view in half. So before it didn’t really
look natural at all because what kind of body

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.909
of water has a piece of aluminum sticking
right up through it, right? So now you have

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.020
this perfect picture frame right here, just
framing the view and it’s just a much nicer,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.090
cleaner effect. Most people come home and
they feel stressed out and they just look

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.660
forward to that one vacation they get a year.
Well not my clients, my clients come home

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.580
every day and get that daily relaxation, and
they love coming home. In fact, they say when

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.630
they go on vacation, they can’t wait to
get home because nothing is like having a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.610
Lucas Lagoon. Because it’s custom built
to what you want and what you need for yourself,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.170
your family, your friends. So, come along
for the journey, sign up, be a VIP email and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.720
I’ll send my videos straight to you. Enjoy
watching because I know that I enjoy building.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.080
See you then.
