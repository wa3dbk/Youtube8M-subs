00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.770
I would describe Swingle as an opportunity
every day.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.419
Swingle… we’re the best.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.429
You want to work for someone, work for us
because there’s no other better company.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.300
Thank you for calling Swingle where we make
lives more enjoyable…

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.769
I love it a lot… it’s a great job.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.110
John Swingle and Vi Swingle started Swingle
Lawn Tree and Landscape Care, at the time

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.780
it was Swingle Tree Surgeons… and they started
that in 1947.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.710
We have branched out into many different areas
now… we do not only shade tree and ornamental

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.760
pruning and removals.We also do pine health
care sprays for protecting them.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.970
We do lawn care, lawn fertilization, lawn
aeration.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.320
We do weed control, both on-turf and off-turf.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.710
We do irrigation work, landscape planting
and one of our other exciting opportunities

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.830
is Christmas décor.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.090
We focus on creating beautiful outdoor spaces
year-round, which means we work from January

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.090
to December.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.720
I’ll send a representative out within five
business days…

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.500
My job is to go out and meet with folks and
make recommendations for their property.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.640
I really enjoy what I do and the interactions
between the customer and a lot of the customer

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.560
relationships that I have… that’s probably
the biggest thing that I enjoy.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.260
A lot of comments are – you guys should
be in the Cirque du Soleil.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.320
You guys are acrobats.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.630
You guys are so great.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.610
Thank you for treating my trees like you would
your own.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.120
We’re the largest privately-held tree care
company in the state of Colorado.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.310
About 70% of our work is residential.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.120
About 30% of our work is commercial, municipal
– non-residential type services.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.850
We have an incredible safety program, a great
training program and an amazing amount of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.380
great people to work for.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.740
Our safety record is one of them that I can
point out… we do celebrations with the technicians

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.560
and even when one of us individually do something
phenomenal or even outside of our box, they

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.129
recognize it with gift cards or even just
saying thank you to us.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.629
At Swingle, we have the best equipment around.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.830
We run steel chain saws.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.900
All different kinds of saddles…

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900
This is a pestel.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.529
They give us brand new stuff whenever we need
it.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.730
Best ropes, best trucks, best chippers.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.090
We only use the best here at Swingle.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.250
You just have to look around at the trucks
that we have driving down the road – that’s

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.659
your first impression is the trucks.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.939
The trucks are clean.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.560
They’re all relatively new.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.641
We’re always adding to the fleet.

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:42.279
We focus on having that professional image…
not just as tree workers, but as providing

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.049
the best customer service for our clients.

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.060
You’ve got to have a passion for serving
the customer to make it and survive on our

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.060
team.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.650
It’s a good place to work… good people
to work with.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:59.329
I’ve enjoyed it, been here almost three
years and I love the job.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.409
We certainly believe that we have to be an
employer of choice and that’s not only in

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.540
the landscape industry but also, we’re competing
with every other industry out there.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.959
So, we try very hard to place ourselves within
the top ten, top twenty percent of compensation

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.829
in the area, in the industry and in similar
jobs.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.200
We’ve got the 401K.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.680
We’ve got health insurance.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.109
We’ve got accidental insurance, supplemental
insurance, dental…

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.699
I’m pretty pleased with our benefits package.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.840
It’s a great place to work.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.090
Good hours, great pay, good benefits… learn
a trade.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.730
I started here as a plant health care technician
and quickly moved up to a plant health care

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.760
supervisor and then, I was an assistant manager
not long after that and then, I became the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760
plant health care manager.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.430
When I started here, I was in the wood shop
and I had no experience related to tree work.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.950
I was put through this training program here
at work, hands on 100% and six years later,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.950
I’m running my own crew.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.329
And I think if somebody comes on-board and
joins Swingle, they’re going to have the

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.879
opportunity to develop their career and move
forward and they’re also going to have the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.169
opportunity to have fun at work.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.780
It’s just a challenging great job to have.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.280
Every day, it’s physically and mentally
challenging and I get a good workout at the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280
same time.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.509
That’s the way I like to work, doing lots
and lots and lots of stuff… and multi-tasking

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.180
keeps me busy and on my toes, keeps me thinking.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.599
I really like it.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:41.039
I love to work at Swingle because it feels
like a small-knit community where I work and

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.990
I really enjoy the people that I work with.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.990
I would invite anyone to come work at Swingle
because they will find opportunity here I

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.669
will go until I hear the word stop
It’s a great company to work for.

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.280
It’s a great team…

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.490
I’m very proud to be a part of it.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.970
We’re not just any other company.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.970
We’re Swingle.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.389
It’s a great experience to be able to go
home at night and understand that you’ve

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.030
made somebody’s life more enjoyable through
the work that you’ve done through the day.
