[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.310
Welcome to Tekzilla Bites,
feeding your tech hunger fast.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.449
I'm Shannon Morse.

00:00:07.449 --> 00:00:09.740
One of the many things I've
been trying to learn lately

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.670
is more programming skills.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.130
I haven't delved
too much into it,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.480
so I still consider myself
fairly new at coding,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.220
but there are
multitudes of resources

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.260
available for
newbies like myself.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.760
I found a pretty
cool site that uses

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.360
a gaming foundation
to teach Python.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.510
checkio.org is a
website made to help

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.360
you learn how to
Python by giving you

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.040
a series of missions, starting
from a base beginning one

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.280
all the way to the
master missions.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.940
Each time you earn
a series of points,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.700
you can level up and gain
access to more stages.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
If you aren't a Python expert,
though, like me, don't worry.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.870
There are plenty of
resources to help

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.790
you get started on
your first mission.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.450
The checkio.org wiki
has several articles

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.710
about how to use the site and
how to use Python programming.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.490
When you create an account
you start on the home island.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.190
You also have access
to the library island,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.960
and as you score
more points you'll

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.440
eventually unlock
other islands as well.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.070
To start playing, choose
an island and a mission.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.120
So I'm starting at the very
top with the median mission.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.760
In this case, my mission is
to create a Python script that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.380
will output the median
of a list of numbers.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.600
I would copy my code into the
larger of the solve windows

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.060
and hit Run and Check.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.020
If my code is correct,
I pass and I get points.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.300
If it's incorrect, I fail.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.120
If you get stuck,
you can also ask

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.480
for help via the CheckI/O forum.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.580
If you do get stuck on
how to solve a mission,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.790
click the text at the bottom
of the screen as well,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.130
and you'll get helpful hints.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.860
Hooray!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.760
So you are now on your way to
becoming an epic code master.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.570
CheckI/O can help you brainstorm
not only how to write code,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.880
but also how to solve
problems with it.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.090
Remember, learning syntax is
only a part of the battle.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.400
Learning when and how to use
the code is the other part.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.440
That part's really hard.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.940
Trust me.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.610
I know.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.720
After all that
hard coding, it is

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.070
time to relax with some
epic anime on Crunchy Roll.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.180
Crunchy role is the
official destination

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.160
for the largest lineup of
current and classic anime.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.230
You can watch hit shows
like Naruto Shippuden,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.760
or my favorite,
Sailor Moon, for free.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.020
Or become a premium member
and watch everything ad free.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.530
Premium members also get
exclusive access to simulcast,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.520
your favorite shows
available immediately

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.990
after broadcast in Japan.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.980
You can watch on your
favorite devices, which

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.420
means you'll get the most
popular anime wherever,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.105
