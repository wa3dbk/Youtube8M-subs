Hey everybody.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.860
My name’s Chris and I’m about to give
you a sneak peek into the Vegan Cuts August

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.860
Snack Box.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.560
If you’re not already familiar with Vegan
Cuts, let me tell you a little bit about it.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880
It’s the ultimate subscription service where
we deliver between seven and ten cruelty-free

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.480
and vegan products to your door every single
month.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.259
It can be anything from chips to chocolate
to candy to organic teas and energy drinks.

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.410
It’s a wide variety of sweet treats, savory
treats, healthy treats, not so healthy treats.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.329
We try to put a little something for everybody
in each box.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.812
We also ship worldwide, so if you want snacks
delivered to your door and you live anywhere

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.460
in the world, we could probably deliver them
to you.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.420
So, that’s pretty awesome, isn’t it?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.920
Let’s jump into this August box.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.370
We have some awesome picks here for you I’m
excited to share.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.829
First up, we have these Super 4 baked bean
bites from Lesser Evil.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.940
They’re kale and roasted garlic flavor.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.750
It’s made from chia, quinoa, lentil, and
white bean.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.229
They’re gluten free, completely awesome,
completely delicious, baked not fried, and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.759
did I say delicious, because they’re delicious.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.499
This is just about the last bag I had out
of the many, I’m probably going to eat this

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.759
as soon as this video is finished.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.609
Next up, we have a treat to cool you down
when it’s super-hot out, because I know

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.810
it is right now.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.810
It’s a Smooze fruit ice.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.819
It’s a tropical pineapple and coconut flavor,
and I must say these are fantastic.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.869
You stick it in the freezer, wait a few hours,
it’ll be frozen, you snip the top off, and

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.459
then you have an awesome, healthy treat that
you can enjoy.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.310
They’re high in vitamin C, no high fructose
corn syrup or any crappy ingredients, and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.319
they’re amazing.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.840
What else do I have in here?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.160
I have these awesome lemon poppy seed cookies
from Rawxies.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.700
They’re completely raw and gluten free and
they are fantasticly raw.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.370
It says eat your heart out on the back and
that’s exactly what you should do, because

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.630
these are heart shaped and cute and awesome.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.540
They’re only 85 calories and they’re made
with fresh lemon juice and wild kept vanilla.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.760
When I say they’re good, I mean they’re
good.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.480
This is about the last one I have out of a
whole bunch, too, and I’ll probably eat

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.810
all of these snacks together.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.450
Maybe the frozen one a little later since
I have to wait for it to freeze.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.130
Do I have anything else in here for you guys?

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.130
Nope.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.470
You’re going to have to wait and get your
August Snack Box.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.140
If you haven’t already signed up, I suggest
signing up.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.970

your way this August and in the months to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.970
