Marie: Hey, it’s Marie Forleo and you are
watching MarieTV, the place to be to create

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.360
a business and life you love.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.330
I got a question for you today: do you ever
fight with your to-do list?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.620
Maybe not fight with it so much as ignore
it while it cries in the distance.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:55.409
Today, I'm going to teach you a one-word tweak
to get your to-do to-done.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.410
It does relate to crying babies.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.620
You’ve heard of Ferberizing, right?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.140
That’s the sleep training method where you
let a baby cry it out so they can self soothe

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.680
and go back to sleep.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:15.420
But when it comes to your to-do list, which
is probably crying right now, your to-do list

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.750
is not going to soothe itself or do itself.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.630
The trick to make your to-do list stop crying
is to verberize it.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.700
Verberizing it means making sure that every
item on your to-do list starts with a verb.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.620
Let’s take a look at a typical to-do list:

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.870
Cleaners, supermarket (milk, eggs), plan birthday
party, blog post topics, do website, conference

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.990
(hotel, tickets), defrost broccoli, food/dinner,
insurance.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.070
As you can see, that to-do list is crying
because it hardly has any verbs and the verbs

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.240
it does have are too big and overwhelming
like ‘do website’ and ‘plan birthday

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.310
party.’

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.080
The one winner here is ‘defrost broccoli’
and that’s because it has a specific one

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.899
step verb.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.739
Items like cleaners are missing verbs altogether.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.939
I know it seems too simple, but adding a verb
like ‘go to’ in front of ‘cleaners’

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.569
or ‘brainstorm’ in front of ‘blog post
topics’ can totally trigger you into action.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.401
One more thing before we wrap up: when you
verberize, you can't just use any verbs; you

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:34.200
got to pick small actionable, really doable
verbs, things that you're going to accomplish

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.629
in one setting or one errand.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.069
For example, ‘plan birthday party.’

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.069
That’s huge.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.209
It’s a big project that has many steps to
it, so when you first see plan, it’s totally

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.609
overwhelming and you don’t want to go near
it.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.590
What if you saw ‘buy paper plates’ or
‘make guest list’ or ‘get waxed,’

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.230
because it’s a party.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.459
Now we are getting somewhere.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:06.549
Remember, from now until the end of time,
anytime you make a list, you are going to

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.549
verberize it.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.650
You want to know what's next on my to-do list?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.010
‘Wrap up video.’

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.830
I can do that.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.830
Ready?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.830
Watch me go.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.889
Insight without action is worthless, so right
now, I would love to hear from you.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.780
What I want you to do is verberize your to-do
right in the comments below, and yes, I want

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.220
you to do it in public.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.700
This is a before and after exercise so first
I want you to pick three items from your to-do

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:40.010
list that keep not getting to-done.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.400
Then I want you to share your new verberized
list.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.120
As always, the best discussions happen after
the episode over at MarieForleo.com, so go

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.379
there and show me your new verberized list
right now.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:55.779

be ever so appreciative if you share it with

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.739

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.570
gift that only you have.
