00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.760
Assalamualaikum, saya Aiman

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.840
for dinner with kakak and Amirul

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.860
my dad cook

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.239
mee curry, as you can see right here

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.369
it is his specialty

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.810
don't you think it looks delicious?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.090
and for dessert, my mom

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.720
made Pulut Seri Muka

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.710
uh...

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.830
durian is actually inside of

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.199
this [pulut seri muka]

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.370
we're gonna cut the durian later because my siblings want to eat it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.140
for a special treat

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.760
with my family because it has been

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.399
over 2 years

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.750
since our family has been together

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.080
my dad has made satayyyyyyyy!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.080
uh...it's not actually satay yet

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.310
the meat and the chicken have been marinated

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.740
but we have to "cucuk"

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.300
the meat and the chicken now

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.689
my mom made kuah kacang

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.290
and "nasi himpit"

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.620
and..uh..

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.820
for dessert

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640
I made a special treat

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.050
it's called fruit octopuss that lives in the sea

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.430
uh..I called it

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.439
fruit octopuss because of the

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.570
uh...the Pluot

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.020
uh... the mixture of Plum and Apricot

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.790
and I cut it

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.140
and I put

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.100
another Pluot on top of it and it looks like an Octopuss

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.870
and uh..

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.980
the food around it looks like

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.160
what you would call water

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.479
so that's what basically made me

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.800
say sea

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.220
there is Pluot, there is

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.160
uh... strawberry cookies, and uh Milano

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.640
chocolate cookie

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.550
and tangerines

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.390
okay 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.060
now we're gonna "cucuk" the satay

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.289
uh...my mom says that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.019
Malaysians are very lucky

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.809
because when

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.180
they're hungy

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.069
and they want to eat something

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.540
they can just go to the "warung" or restoran to buy what they want to eat

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.669
unfortunately 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.119
for us

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:34.319
I have to ask my mom or dad to cook something, but if they're busy or working

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.289
I have to wait a few days before I get what I want to eat

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.469
I already started 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.069
doing "cucuk" 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.209
the satay

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.269
I have more

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.839
satay cucuks than my mom has

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.249
usually my brothers and sisters would

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.249
help

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.269
but since my sister Amira and 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.769
my brother

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.019
Amirul

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.709
are going away in a few days

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.709
my mom is

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.590
letting them go to the mall

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.279
uh by the way this is beef

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.549
and this is chicken

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.929
on second thought

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.089
i'd guess I'll just leave some

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.430
some cucuk

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.659
satay here

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.729
and leave the rest for my brothers and sisters because they get to go to the mall and I didn't

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:36.729
so I won't let them get away with it

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:43.969
I'm so lucky because Uncle Lan just cam back from work, and he happened to pass by my house and now he can take my spot

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.689
for 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:52.689
cucuk satay thing uh..and now I can play my video game

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.030
Aiman, I object 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.029
hehe

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.069
okay, most of satays are done

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.099
my dad is now gonna cook it but since it's cold outside

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.109
and the kids are coming home, he's gonna use the oven

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.139
I just want to mention that

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.359
my dad told me a story that when he was little

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.750
he was away 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.870
for boarding school

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.770
and when he came back, his father would cook him something special, and his mom

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.739
would catch chickens that they grew

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:28.509
but they only cut chicken

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.859
for when the children come home 

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:37.660
from somewhere

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.159
my dad taught me this Malay traditions

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:46.159
because one day I may grow up and I might teach this Malay traditions to my kids, if I have any kids, of course

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.889
[inaudible conversation] while eating

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.529

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:03.749

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:09.379

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.510
