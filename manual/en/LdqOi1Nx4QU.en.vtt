I’m Dana Roski.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:41.196
I have been living in Berlin
for about 7 years now.

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:44.196
I own a fashion shop here in Berlin

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:46.082
and I work there as a stylist.

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:53.449
At the shop we are trying to do
something new,

00:00:54.043 --> 00:01:00.448
so we’re travelling a lot to find
new undiscovered talent in Germany.

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:09.794
The first time I was in Berlin
I was 15 years old

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:14.453
and I didn’t know
when and how and why,

00:01:14.476 --> 00:01:17.063
but I was like
‘yeah, I want to move in’ and I did.

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:23.397
The most important thing for me
if someone wants to explore the city

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:26.588
is to use maybe different ways.

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:30.866
Sometimes even now
I love to go to an unfamiliar area,

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:35.494
and just have a coffee
in a really trashy café

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:39.759
it's a more interesting way to explore
the city than using a tourist book.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.192
One of my favourite places
in Berlin is the Paris Bar.

00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:00.011
It’s located in west Berlin,

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.347
which is actually
the old part of the city.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.272
Usually young people
don’t go there

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:07.708
because…
I’m always the youngest there…

00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:12.198
I love this place
because it has so much history

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:14.836
and also because it’s not trendy.

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:17.602
I really love it,
it’s anti-fashion.

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:21.652
And if you go there,
there are super-interesting people,

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:26.215
like many painters and writers...

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:30.719
The good thing in Berlin is also
that these places are still open

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.510
and they treat everyone
with the same respect,

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:36.540
even though
they’re super-famous.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.922
But they also serve me.
