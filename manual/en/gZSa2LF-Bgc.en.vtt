00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.380
Hey What's Up Guys this is Tony from Sketchflix Kitchen today

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.019
and today we are going to make some pancake art and I'll be showing you how I actually

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.210
make these pancakes

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
flower

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.870
backing soda

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.410
Coco, butter, yogurt

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.599
some sugar, milk,  an egg

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.680
Vanilla. Now that the materials
lets put it all together

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.350
usually i use a cup of butter milk but because you cant find butter milk in japan

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.400
I'm using a substitute which is three parts yogurt 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.980
one part milk

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.440
so now we will put in two scoops of baking soda

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.460
a sprinkle of salt

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.800
3 scoops of sugar

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.120
a some butter.  I forget how much

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.280
I melt the butter in the microwave for
a couple seconds in

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.030
I put it in the mix

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.299
after I have the dry mix in there I
put in the butter milk substitute. I and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.830
mix it all together

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.710
add some vanilla and I put the egg and I
try to get a consistency

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.710
something like this.  Next I put thepancake
batter into a squeeze bottle so I can

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.010
use it to draw it

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.430
now for darker colors I like

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.680
throw in a couple skip the cocoa into the
mix to give a different variation

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.100
color

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.820
mix it up a little bit

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.800
Next I add more cocoa into the mix and I
used this for

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.800
drawing all the line work.  There you go

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.340
So now i three different values.  I got my light 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
got my dark, and I got my medium.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.020
now I put the pan on the lowest setting possible

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.770
I lightly grease it, 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.770
oil it.  What ever you want but this is what i got.    

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.290
Now its time to get into drawing.  O kay so
this time

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.340
I figured do a character that everybody
knows

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.520
seems to be very popular these days
I drew Olaf

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.390
from frozen so...

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.600
alright so right now Im getting started with the basic line work.  I'm still working out my

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.360
meathod here

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.930
but I kinda have a good idea im actually
having

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.989
a lot of problems with the flow but the
pancake batter

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.660
but I think it's because one Ummmm.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.720
its new bottle in the holes is not big enough

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.950
I made it a little bit too liquidy but

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.180
you know hey you learn right. So...

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.519
right now im going the eyebrows,  Lots of drips everywhere

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.180
but that we fix later see how I'd so now
with did

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.020
the top of the head

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.150
uh fill in a little of the spaces

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.400
start to work down to the smile

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.460
he has got that k super super super crazy overbite

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.260
Um... there is a mess up and the light changed

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.460
Yup the light changed

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.460
anyway I get back into it ummm...

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.600
Let's see after the lights switched on me it kinda threw me off

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.640
you 'll see I make another mistake. Right here you can see I'm having

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.630
a lot of bottle issues but think I have it worked out now so i wont have this problem future

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.630
But hey, what are you going to do right?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.070
ok next

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.170
I draw the outside finished outside his
face

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.170
his chin

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.970
 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.400
I try to look for little spaces that might not
be covered

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.510
well that's all been printed a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.540
pick up all of my horrible horrible
mistakes

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.590
Oh God thats  so bad...

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.620
anyway I did learn a lot from this

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.230
next couple pancakes will be better hell
this is like the third one i've made

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.960
would do you expect right

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.690
ok so now I'm gonna go fill in

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.600
his mouth

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.630
So right now I'm using our medium shade

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.340
Umm, I do wanna make it super super
dark but

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.980
you get the point that and the lights
come back on so that's good

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.170
 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.630
fill bill fill fill i mean as you can see

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.910
it's not an exact process but it is
pretty simple once you get

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.900
hang of it.  I guess what I need to do is

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.030
just work out my ummm just practice trying
with

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.490
um.. with the bottles

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.300
its kinda different.  I'm not used to working like this.  I'm more use to working more precise but

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.340
hey, anyway.  So right here i just kinda speed it up a little bit.  I just basically cover

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.220
the whole face 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.479
with pancake batter

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.280
yeah im

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.520
yeah I think it's some sort of advice I can
give. I'm I would say

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.870
one check the flow the pancake batter I think that seems to be the key

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.389
in weather you succeed or fail at this

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.360
and but

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.490
Im basically just showing you how i make it  so...

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.490
the next one to try to make my draftsmanship 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.420
a lot better these panckes.  So like is that this is

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.160

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.640
