Hello, I would like to welcome you to a series
of vides by tradesparq.com ---the social network

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.389
for global trade. We are going to be going
to in-depth to China manufacturers' facilities

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.110
to see how they produce the products we see
around the world today. So remember join Tradesparq.com

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.800
to find the best China manufacturers.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.800
Michael Zhao: This is the workshop for rolling
components process. What we have seen here

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:50.799
are guide screw. The blade and Wheelhead are
put in the guide that enable the machine to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.420
cut or grind with thickness of less than human
hair when the machine rolls over.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.680
Michael Zhao: this grinder is imported from
Germany which grinds the linear guide in the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.640
guide screw
Brian: how much did you spend on machineries

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.640
to create your products?
Michael Zhao: about 5 million RMB

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.869
Brian: this is almost a million dollars
Brian: right in front of us it's actually

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.770
machine from Germany
Michael: the machine is imported from Germany

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.799
Brian: this machine is from a company in Germany,
and to import this machinery into China is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.810
actually quiet capital intensive investment.
Michael: this grinder grinds the inside of

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.670
linear guide with its Wheelhead to ensure
each diameter of linear guide is the same.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.900
Brian: we are here in the production room
and we are going to look at some workers are

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.900
turning out some of the components for the
fertilizer machineries.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.989
Michael: it grinds the inside of linear guide
Brian: they are grinding the inside of the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.590
custom-made and custom-designed parts for
the fertilizer machinery.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.400
Brian: even these machines are hundreds of
thousands of dollars were sitting here in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.400
a room with 9 or 10 of these machines.
Brian: this is a milling machine or outside

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.569
of the milling machine
Michael: for rock. The milling machine grinds

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.900
the rock into little dust.
Brian: ok, the big rocks get grinded into

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.989
very very fine dust. And this is on the end
of this is actually a large molder that will

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:57.849
continuously turn this mill.
Brian: in terms of the procedure for project,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.209
you design and manufacture the parts then
put them together into fertilizer machinery

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.209
to ensure everything is alright and then break
them down in order to ship over to the customers,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.910
right?
Michael: for these big parts, we would break

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.300
them down so that they could get loaded into
containers for shipment. Meanwhile, we could

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.050
connect those parts with screws which allow
us to put them back together later. The surfaces

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.050
have to be grinded down to make even when
they get put together.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:52.270
Brian: so, this right here actually needs
to be grinded down so it's very even and

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.130
you need a machine to be able to do that.
Michael: this is a cutting machine which cuts

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.780
the material automatically according to the
design which has been loaded into computer

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.780
so lots of cuttings can be done simultaneously
which would be much faster than people do

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.800
it manually.
Brian: this is a cutting machine, the design

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.180
for the cuts are loaded into a computer. And
those different cuts could be many different

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.370
type of cuts and then are activated so the
machine goes out to actually cut the metals

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.370
or steels.
Brian: this is sanding down the size or shaving

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.800
down the size of this particular piece to
make it smoother, it that correct?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.800
Michael: yes, to cut the inside and make both
outside and inside smooth in accordance with

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.630
its side.
Brian: how close do you need to make this

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.340
to the design? It got to be very very close
to the design, right? If you are off by 2

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:15.340
or 3 cm. is that causing problems?
Michael: the different should be kept in the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.870
measure of millimeter. We will move the big
facilities to the new factory which is currently

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.490
under construction. We can take a look.
Brian: you will have a new factory that will

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.280
come on line soon.
Michael: the construction will be done within

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.240
this year and will be used as well.
Brian: Thanks for watching today's video

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.130
of China's best manufacturers and remember
