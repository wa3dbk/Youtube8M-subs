00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.840
This one could be a long series! The Maple Leafs and St. Louis Blues open what may be-

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.219
Oh, hello!

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:10.269
Hi guys

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.780
it's Christmas time in Leaf Land. A time for sharing. A time for discussion. A time for

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.240
Shoveling your driveway out of several feet of snow

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.780
"Steven, it's time to shovel!"

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.540
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE!

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.020
Anyway, I think it's time for uber-discussion

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.900
2008. You can pretty much disregard my video from yesterday

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.579
Although you should watch it anyway

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.659
Because too much, frankly, has happened in the last 48

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.850
Minutes, not even hours, in the NHL to go without some discussion, and I've received about a bajillion

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Questions, and whatnot

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.040
On my profile

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.079
So

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.100
Let's get to them, and I want to hear your comments because

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.240
Hey, I'm not getting paid, so I'm not doing all the work

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.040
And I'm wearing my Potvin Jersey. It's my favorite the, heh...

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.980
Anyway, first, the McCabe hit last night that I somehow did not mention

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
Dirty?

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Or not dirty?

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.500
Don't know pretty much

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.919
It looked like Andrei Kostitsyn reached back and kind of pulled his arm into it but Maurice said his throat

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.720
I didn't see that, maybe I need to watch it a few more times

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.240
But I did not see it in that light. Another thing a lot of fans are gonna be happy the Brian McCain's injured

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.880
But six to eight weeks maybe more

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.280
Without

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.290
The defenseman

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
Who, since 03-04, has scored the most points

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.540
Look it up. No other defenseman has scored more points since the 03-04 season

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.740
Than Bryan McCabe. Not Scott Niedermayer

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.989
Not Souray, not Pronger

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.120
No one

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.380
And he's been producing less points lately, but

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.660
He's been better defensively

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.259
So what impact does his having team, who did they call up?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.739
Last night someone asked me I said Stralman, a lot of people are saying Kronwall. Does Wozniewski get more minutes?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.760
So on and so forth. Do the Leafs finally make a trade?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.240
And, who do they trade? Now, keep it in mind they have a limited amount of cap space to work with

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.200
And you can say trade Raycroft all you want

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.880
But the fact still remains he is a two million dollar backup goalie

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
At the moment

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.659
Breaking news

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.260
Apparently Bob Goodenow and a Russian

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.159
Tycoon

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.800
Not sure what that word means, but that's, well, what all the sites are calling him

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.060
Are thinking about putting together a

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.580
European Hockey League not like the Eliteserien League

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.820
Of Sweden

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.940
Europe. Pretty much an NHL in Europe too rival, of course, the NHL, and bring talent over there

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.440
Your thoughts on this? I think this is a big deal

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.980
And, newest addition to the jerk list, brrrrrrrrrrr

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.180
The second this video is over, Chris Simon, you putz!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.300
You are going on the jerk list! I liked you so much when you were on Calgary

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.180
You went and did the Ryan Hollweg thing

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.280
You should have been banned for life from that, and people gave you a second chance and now

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.060
You stomp on a guy with your skate?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.580
What the hell is wrong with you dude? You're getting paid all this money and your,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.870
That's assault, it's essentially assault you hit a guy with a large piece of wood you stomp on him with a blade

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.960
It's a blade. It is a sharp blade. It is metal and sharp

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.620
What else is that

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.540
McSorely him, gone for good! It's not gonna happen. Probably get like maybe 10 games for that 15, if that?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.560
Chris Simon, what the hell is wrong with you so

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.040
To recap McCabe thing, dirty or not? Do we trade? Do we call up someone?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.460
What do you think new European League uh-huh and?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.060
Chris Simon, jerk list. I saw want more additions to the jerk list so guys

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.120
What's gonna happen to Leafs in the new year? Let me know

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.680
Go Leafs go!

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.950
Now I have to shovel
