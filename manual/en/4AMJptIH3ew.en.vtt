00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:04.119
- So our game of tennis keeps changing,

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:07.416
and to my mind, it's the
players who change the game

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:09.945
and it takes the coaches
a few years to catch up

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:12.894
and then start teaching that
to the next wave of players.

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:16.740
But here's a thought about how
it used to be and how it is.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.756
In the old days they said
rackets to the back fence

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:24.471
to prepare and the front fence to hit,

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.022
and I think many still have this idea

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:30.294
of getting the racket back
very early and very low.

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:33.910
Racket back, back fence, front fence.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.187
But as you look at the modern forehand,

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:37.670
there's really two specific changes,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.005
but the third element
is the one I really want

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.567
to make reference to.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.856
In the modern forehand,
the racket's pointed

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:47.331
to the front fence when they prepare.

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.409
And this isn't me saying
it, I've noticed it.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.221
This is preparation.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:52.054
No, yes.

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:56.904
But when they hit it,
now the racket points

00:00:56.904 --> 00:00:58.906
to the back fence.

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:02.598
So really the first change
is that in this method,

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:04.421
if you want this reference point,

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:06.170
we're pointing at the front fence

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.837
and we finish at the back fence.

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.895
But here's where I think
the rubber meets the road

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:13.159
and here's what I'd like you to really get

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.228
a comfort level with and then practice.

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:19.688
The modern pros lag the
racket more than any other era

00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:23.530
in tennis, and what that means is this.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.493
Federer and Nadal,
they're waiting like this.

00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:29.660
As they start to swing, the
racket lags from the hand.

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:35.747
And you see, it's amazing
how far they can do it

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:38.400
before it pops through.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.067
Watch this again, this is a lag.

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.805
What's happening is the
head is behind the hand

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.998
as long as possible, and you get, I think,

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:49.282
two elements here.

00:01:49.282 --> 00:01:51.713
One is it lengthens the contact zone,

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:54.149
more chance to hit it,
and it stores energy

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.472
in the arm and racket
that can be released,

00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:00.198
violently, if you will.

00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:01.454
And as you look at this modern forehand

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.816
and watch it on TV, my
two takeaways for you

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:08.861
is to hesitate with the
racket, as you prepare,

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:11.218
and hesitate with the racket head

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.468
as you're swinging forward.

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.350
And I think as the game
continues to change

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.551
from the players, coaches
will pick this up,

00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.051
it takes us a while,

00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.240
but it's all about how
this game continues to,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.774
I think, get better, play
faster with more skill,

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.341
and hopefully it's
drawing more of us to want

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.008
to play more tennis.
