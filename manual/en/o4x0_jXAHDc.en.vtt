00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.260
Part 6. Trolling motor testings continue.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.380
Problem started to unravel. Simply the batteries were over from remote controller.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.020
So lets open it up and see what we can find from inside.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.460
From inside we can find different kind of components.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.660
I hardly know anything about these components inside. Main point is to change the battery.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.780
And a person with a normal motorics should be able to change.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.560
So we just get the old battery off and put a new one instead.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:40.240
Battery has a number code which makes it easy to find a correct one from a shop.

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:43.734
Most likely they cost only few euros. So you will not end up empty pocket.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.900
Now just put new battery in and cover back so we can go back testing.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.054
How it will go?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720
We got power on the motor and our spirit is high.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.600
Lamps turned there nicely on. Or should we say led lights.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.360
We'll see if it starts working.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.740
Hhhoooooo ho ho ho

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.580
Hhhhhhhhhooooooo hooooo hooo

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.100
Amazing!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.520
So, when i push to the side, to right, it basicly turns to the right.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.920
And with left button it turns left.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.060
Really great.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.954
It reacts really fast.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.000
Almost immediately when I push the button it reacts.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.920
And here at the top there is a rabbit sign and down here a turtle.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.540
If I push the rabbit sign it... Really nice.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.080
Lets push rabbit again.

00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:35.735
Accelerates, accelerates.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:37.514
And if we push the turtle..

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.500
stopping.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.540
Really nice.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.600
Is it great?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.200
Yes.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.280
My farmhand starts to take pace count.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.980
Count your steps Jarno while you walk away, so we can see how far distance it can take the signal.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.420
I already lost the count.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.560
Well then.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That is about 10 meter distance.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.560
Man faded already in the distance.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.120
That is proximitely 20 meter away.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.760
Was that good?

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.420
Great.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.860
Making the dream
