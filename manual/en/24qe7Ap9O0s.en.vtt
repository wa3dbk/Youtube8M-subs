Today, how to shoot an astrophotography timelapse, like this one.

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.189
my name is Jared, and I wanted to show you how I take my astrophotography timelapses.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.419
Shooting astrophotography timelapses is very similar to shooting daylight timelapses,

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.550
with just a few caveats

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.609
always monitor your audio!

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.699
That way you don't end up like this idiot with awful sound!

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.570
A timelapse is created by taking a series of photos at a set interval time.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.040
That is like taking a picture every second, 5 seconds, or 30, seconds, etc..

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.070
Then playing that back in video real time.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.540
the result is a time compressed video.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.540
so the way that i create time-lapse
video is by using magic lantern on my

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.750
Canon DSLR but you can use any camera that
has a built-in intervalometer.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.530
or an external that connects to your camera.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.700
By selecting intervalometer,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.909
pressing the 'Q' button,

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.450
then selecting how often

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.630
to take the photo. Every five seconds
ten seconds, or what.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.230
Now the trick to doing this at night

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.049
is each photo will be a long exposure
possibly five to thirty seconds long

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.190
the second trip up is focusing  which
can be difficult because you can just

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.120
look through the lens and see to focus at night
my solution is to use a lens which has a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.460
The lens I use for my astrophotography time-lapses is the Rokinon

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.299
fourteen millimeter f two point eight
manual lens.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.250
This lens works great for me because it
has the ability to set focused to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.940
it stops down the f2.8 and is
fairly affordable

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.220
Once its dark

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.280
i set my camera up to take a test exposure

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.970
next i set my camera's iso and
shutter speeds to something around iso

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.120
i play around with the iso and
shutter speed to get a desire to image

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.380
once I have the exposure set it's time
to set up the intervalometer.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.960
after you shoot all the photos for your
time-lapse

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.070
infinity

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.090
next i set my camera's eye so and
shutter speeds to something around i so

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.159
four hundred for eight hundred

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.199
with the six seconds shutter

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.729
i play around with the iso and
shutter speed to get a desire to image

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.329
once I have the exposure set it's time
to set up the intervalometer

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.329
one tip i've learned to maximize the
battery life is to turn off the display

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.339
on the back of the camera and turn off
the image a review

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.059
after you shoot all the photos for your
time-lapse

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.129
Stitch them together  to pay back each
picture as a video frame at whatever

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.729
frame rate you want.

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.319
i do this process of Final Cut Pro X

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.319
but there are many ways to do this.  Thank you for watching!

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.149
An ND filter stop some of the like
it's coming into your camera

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.040
which allows you to shoot with a wider aperture.
