Hello everybody, I’m Anastasiya Shpagina and today I will show you Jennifer Lawrence make up from “The Hunger Games”

00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:22.823
Let’s start

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.057
I’ve already applied foundation and now I’m making brows with brown shadows

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:38.555
Correct the shape with light concealer

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:49.311
For achieve the effect of natural brows I paint small hairs

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:54.804
With white pencil I underline lower inner lid

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:01.321
With the same brown shadow I underline lower lid

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.166
Apply a little more shadow near the lashline

00:01:16.704 --> 00:01:19.633
Next step I color the outer eye corners

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:25.701
Do it to the middle and apply the shadows the same way to inner eye corner

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:45.915
You see that without shadow the eye looks more opened, but I need it to look more deep, so brown shadow helped me with that

00:01:46.457 --> 00:01:49.178
Now do the same with another eye

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.705
Apply grey shadow to inner eye corners

00:01:59.693 --> 00:02:03.805
With brown pencil I paint horizontal lines to nose

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:06.749
and with that I change the eye shape

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:18.035
Paint the hairs for better effect

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.961
With one tone darker brown shadow I underline outer eye corners

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:39.142
and a little near the lashline

00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:48.680
Apply mascara

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:00.941
Do little touches with gray pencil

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:12.824
I correct the nose shape with beige shadow and smooth the edges with light powder

00:03:17.354 --> 00:03:19.701
and take away the skin glitter

00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:29.660
Highlight the forehead and the cheekbones with bronzer

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:42.342
Lighten the area above cheekbones to the temple,

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.891
also apply to the chin and nasolabial furrows.

00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:53.589
Take coralline lipstick and pencil

00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:00.128
At first I create the lip shape with the pencil,

00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:07.427
than apply the lipstick of the same color

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.457
With the concealer for lips I create more natural color

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:26.887
Put on a hat,a wig...

00:04:27.177 --> 00:04:31.545
This wig won’t do, I will fix it now

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:38.947
AS you can see it’s too short, so I add some hair to braid

00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:42.670
Cut the fringe, and the image is ready!

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:50.813
Thank you all so much for watching,

00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:58.238
I’m waiting for the second part of “The Hunger Games” as I adore this movie. Push the “thumbs up” button,
