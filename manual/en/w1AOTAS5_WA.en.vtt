00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's go back to Elbis, Boogie and Abu.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.740
They were surprised to see a zombie while going to the fake haunted house.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.560
this is for a reality TV show.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.020
and this is what happened next.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.420
Why is his skin green?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.000
Maybe he's a thief trying to camouflage himself to sneak in on us.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.880
Hey man, you're busted. We don't have any money if you're planning to steal from us!

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.860
hehehe

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.400
Why are they not afraid and even laughing? Oh man, I think I need to act more

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.940
Rarrrrggghhhh

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.540
I don't think he's a theif, Abu. I think he's a man with rabies.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.300
hehehe

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.140
Hey guys lets hide for cover, the thunder is too strong.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.420
we might get hit because we're just beside this trees

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.400
They're bending down? 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.300
Maybe they're too afraid by now.. YES!

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.460
RRRrrggggghhhh!!

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.480
Hey man, I'll bend down if I were you..

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.340
huh?!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.960
told you... hehehehe

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.040
hehehe

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.460
let's run for cover before it hits us !

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.480
Boss, our zombie got hit by lightning. And I don't think the contestant are afraid, what should we do?

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.080
OH NO! That's embarrassing to our viewers

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.580
This should be a horror reality TV, but its turning into a comedy

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.560
Good thing we made it, we almost got hit by lightning !

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.520
Yeah.. Finally I could eat

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760
Anybody home?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.600
Knock knock anyone here?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120
I don't think anybody's home. I thought there's food in here?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.660
And if you look closely the house looks old.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.080
Oh man, I'm so hungry! Where could I find  food?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.740
You guys go ahead and look for food. I'm going to the bathroom to pee.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.300
Okay sure.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Is there anyone here?

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.560
anyone?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.580
Anybody here?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.780
Huh, bats? What's wrong with this house? Why are there bats inside?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.320
Where is the bathroom? And why is anyone here? Is this an abandoned house?

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.060
I feel being watched

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.740
Boss, they split into two groups

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.040
The two guys went to the 2nd floor, the other is in front of us going to the bathroom

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.940
Aren't we lucky. It would be easier for us to scare them. Prepare Dracula &amp; Aswang!

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.420
This house is so big like a mansion!  But why is nobody home?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.320
I dont care if anyone's home or not, once I see food I'll eat it right away. I'm so hungry!

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.660
Okay, I think we should check each room. 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.420
I wonder how Elbis so doing?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.260
Good, I finally found the bathroom.. It looks dirty

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.800
Even though it looks dirty, it doesn't stink.. Hmm, it seems like they designed to make it look dirty, weird

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.380
Hehehe Let's see if you wont be scared when you get out.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.360
Boogie, look! At last we found someone. I think its better if we ask him where the food is.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.600
Good idea, let's go

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:34.580
Abu &amp; boogie saw someone from afar. Will they get scared if they know its Dracula?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.840
And will eblis get scared If he sees the flying aswang when he gets out?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.960
What will happen? 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.160
