00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.870
I've dropped into gorgeous
Lausanne, Switzerland,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.510
to visit EPFL to check out
the crash-happy Gimball.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.170
This robot is
inspired from insects,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.920
because we looked at how
flies collide into things,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.040
and they do not die when
they touch a window.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.910
And we wanted to replicate this
behavior in the flying robots,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.290
because we thought 500
million years of evolution can

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.810
the wrong.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.550
Gimball is another
flying robot, because it

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.840
has this rotating
protective frame.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.280
Around its in your part two
is where the actual flying

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.760
robot is actually located.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.370
And this allows this robot
to collide into things

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.410
and continue its
flight undisturbed.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.230
It is also safe just
fly close to a human,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.960
because you can
touch it in flight.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.730
You have this gauge protecting
the dangerous propellers

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.820
from hurting your hands.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.050
We believe that having this
mechanical intelligence built

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.740
into the system instead
of having complex obstacle

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.170
avoidance system
is a great solution

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.630
to this very complex problem
of flying robots indoors.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.630
Can you describe the
different components to it?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.130
Sure.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.921
When I look it, I see
a lot of quadcopters,

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.870
and this is not a quadcopter.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.860
As you said, it's
not a quadcopter.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.650
It's contra-rotative propellers.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.700
So the idea is to best use
the space inside the sphere,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.820
and that's why we use this
technology instead of a quad.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.430
We have some flaps
down there that

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.690
are used for guidance
of the robots

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.400
and for the stabilization.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.760
On board, we have
an HD camera, and we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.730
have all of the
electronics that allow

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.510
for the control of the robot.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.170
Now, the real
innovation in there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.140
lies on this Gimble system.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.330
So you can see here
two carbon fiber rings

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.104
that actually decouple the inner
frame from the outer frame.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.548
So let me just show you
the stabilization now.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.970
So we have lots of
different needs.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.090
We definitely want to do
some search-and-rescue

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.940
with this robot.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.230
This is really one
of the applications

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.880
that is driving us a lot.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.910
But as a first target, we think
industrial inspection or things

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.810
like law enforcement
application, firefighting,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.000
and also simply consumer goods.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.880
We can think of a robot
that can be a very fun

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.320
tool or a game inside houses.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.942
What struck me most
about Gimble was

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:54.410
how at ease I was with it flying
around me and even into me.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.820
I can see people being
totally comfortable and even

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.960
entertained by these types of
robots right up in their faces.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.680
Just don't forget about
that onboard camera.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.320
Gimball.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.110
It's fun.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.360
It's friendly.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.660
But how up your face
do you want a drone,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.180
even if it could save your life?
