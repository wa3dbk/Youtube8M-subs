00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Red-eyed girl

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
The room's dark, but the smell of blood...

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Oozing, an open cut

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.900
Slowly, the window opens a little more

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.000
Shred faith 'til you're...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Shred faith 'til you're...

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.300
Why she lives, she doesn't know yet

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000
Don't know why, forever waiting

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.000
So then she trapped herself deep in this castle, her home

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Dyed in the blood that flows, flows still in me

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.700
So there she sleeps, peaceful, where I can't see

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.300
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
That float upon the water's surface in a gentle stream

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.000
Basking within a lonely light

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Waiting for something took you far too long

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
These small hands bare no stain

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Walking over corpses in the rain

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Wake up, it's time

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The ticking clock announces the start

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That person from my dream comes closer

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm scared, but nowhere to run

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In a vortex of pure light

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I don't know what's right or wrong

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.400
Feel my blood is aching, throbbing again

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.500
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.000
That float upon the water's surface in a gentle stream

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.600
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
Basking within a lonely light

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.000
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Waiting for something took you far too long

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
These small hands bare no stain...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in the rain

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
As long as you're here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I don't need a thing

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You, I believed in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You were my everything

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900
But, soon the windows opened up

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.000
And what I saw won't leave me

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Perhaps, there is more out there...

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
... for me.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Please, let me go

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You're to blame for my wish

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
'Cause you taught me how to be human

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.300
See petals twirling, long lost dreams

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.300
That float upon the water's surface in a gentle stream

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.500
Childish hopes for someone there for me

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Basking within a lonely light

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Songbird, you have lost your only song

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Waiting for something took you far too long
(Far too long)

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.000
These small hands bare no stain

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.500
Walking over corpses in the rain
