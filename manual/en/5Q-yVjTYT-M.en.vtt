00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.800
Making some progress on the master bathroom
shower -- I like to see progress.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.480
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.570
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.910
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.840
The guys are in the kitchen installing the
ceramic subway tile by Dowell.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.550
And these are Dowell tiles made of porcelain.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.920
Very different -- different make up and constitution.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.300
And the one that choose is one that almost
has a linen-like look to it.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.859
The finish on it -- it's really lovely.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.260
And if you look at it against the color of
our walls over here, you can see that it's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010
gonna blend nicely with it.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.629
With this house, what we've tried to do is
take some traditional building materials,

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.870
proportions and so forth, and go in that direction.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.329
We've also done some things that are a little
more on the modern side, and this shower is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.359
an example of it.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.330
Because what I'm gonna do is I'm just having
them lay these tiles, which are 12x12.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.130
And the shower is roughly 55 inches long.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.170
And what we have here now, the finish is gonna
be about 34 inches wide.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.259
So it's not a huge shower, but its gonna be
enough.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.250
We're laying these in a really simple, straightforward
way.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.759
We're not offsetting one and another.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.080
We're not doing any sort of trim around the
edge -- we wanna keep the cost as low as we

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080
can.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.229
These tiles are being applied to the wall
using a thin set mortar, and the spacing is

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.580
really important -- so what he's done here
is shimmed up the base, and then these plastic

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.420
spacers are placed in, so it can be absolutely
perfect.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.509
Now, one of the things I really like about
this shower is we found these stones that

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.229
have been ground done flat -- just look at
how those natural colors resonate with the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.229
tile itself.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.579
I just think it's gonna be great looking.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.640
So you can see that the tile color, the floor
colors of the shower, and the walls around

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.289
are all coming together.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.600
