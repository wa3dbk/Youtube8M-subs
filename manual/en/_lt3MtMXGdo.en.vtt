00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:24.502
Where are you its twilight,

00:00:25.054 --> 00:00:28.694
where are you tonight? 

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.945
Somethin deep inside me, 

00:00:34.064 --> 00:00:38.104
follows you in the night. 

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:42.678
I cannot explain it,

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:47.433
there is no fear in me. 

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:51.375
For I would rather perish

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.029
 than live apart from thee. 

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.291
We know hate is strong,

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:02.783
and the world is wrong, 

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:06.473
and the moon and the sun can't relate

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.267
But we carry on,

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.514
this forbidden song, 

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.426
because love is much stronger than hate. 

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.445
New Moon, 

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:23.272
new life with you. 

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.274
Tell me

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:29.335
what's wrong,

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:30.238
whats right,

00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:33.927
whats true? 

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:38.087
The further you try to run away,

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.429
the closer I'm drawn to you 

00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:46.687
New day,

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.989
new me~

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:51.731
New Moon. 

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:56.896
Come with me its twilight, 

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:01.567
run away with me. 

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:05.911
Dance me into midnight,

00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:10.186
shine your love on me. 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.799
Fatal and immortal,

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.239
fascinating, free.

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:24.276
Take me on a Forks flight,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.460
high above the trees. 

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:32.553
We know hate is strong,

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:35.036
and the world is wrong, 

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:39.118
and the moon and the sun can't relate

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.173
But we carry on,

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:44.358
this forbidden song, 

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:48.208
because love is much stronger than hate. 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.409
New Moon, 

00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:56.243
new destiny. 

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.127
Tell me

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:01.034
Is this

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:05.166
â€”my tragedy?

00:03:06.897 --> 00:03:08.697
Eclipsed by your love,

00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:11.693
blinded, confused,

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:15.298
but closer I'm drawn to you 

00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.991
New day,

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:20.164
new birth~ 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.279
New Moon. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.200
It's my tragic flaw,

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:32.906
to be in your arms, 

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.906
where the force is so strong

00:03:36.062 --> 00:03:38.102
I can't breath

00:03:38.268 --> 00:03:42.388
I am Artemis,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:46.206
you're my nemesis,

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.350
You're the one thing my heart can't release. 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.869
New breath,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.340
new birth, 

00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:59.371
New death,

00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:01.861
new earth, 

00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:04.462
New day, 

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:05.176
new me,

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:09.746
new Moon.
