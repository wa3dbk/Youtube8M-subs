00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Standby. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody.
0:00:16.0,0:00;17.0
DR. ELACHI: Good morning, Mr. President.
0:00;17.0,0:00:19.0
THE PRESIDENT: Who am I speaking with?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
DR. ELACHI: This is Charles Elachi, the director of JPL.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And we have a room full of the mission operation personnel. This is 'Curiosity' Mission Operation on Mars.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
THE PRESIDENT: Well, it is great to talk to all of you.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I just want you to know that we could not be more excited about what you've been doing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Somebody asked me the other day whether you've already found Martians. (Laughter.)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I told them we have to give you a little bit of time. But we know you're all hard at work and you're getting

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
some well-deserved rest after a successful landing. And I just wanted to call and say congratulations

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to the entire Mars Science Laboratory team, and really all of JPL, on last Monday's incredible success.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Through your dedicated efforts, 'Curiosity' stuck her landing and captured the attention and imagination of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
millions of people not just across our country, but people all around the world, including Times Square.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And what you did on Mars was incredibly impressive. Those 76 pyrotechnics going off in perfect

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
succession and the 500,000 lines of code working exactly the way you guys had ordered them --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so it's really mind-boggling what you've been able to accomplish.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I especially want to congratulate Charles Elachi, the head of JPL; the entry descent and landing lead,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Adam Steltzner, who helped devise the final step of this amazing descent -- the Sky Crane System.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
What you've accomplished embodies the American spirit, and your passion and your commitment is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
making a difference. And your hard work is now paying dividends, because our expectation is that 'Curiosity'

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is going to be telling us things that we did not know before and laying the groundwork for an even more

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
audacious undertaking in the future, and that's a human mission to the Red Planet.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I understand there's a special Mohawk Guy that's working on the mission. (Laughter.)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He's been one of the many stars of the show last Sunday night.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself -- (laughter) --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but my team keeps on discouraging me. And now that he's received marriage proposals

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think that I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
DR. ELACHI: That's going to be the new fashion at JPL. (Laughter.)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THE PRESIDENT: It does sound like NASA has come a long way from the white shirt, black dark-rimmed

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:49.000
glasses and the pocket protectors.(Laughter.) You guys are a little cooler than you used to be. (Laughter.)

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
As all of you know, my administration has put a big focus on improving science and technology,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
engineering and math education. And this is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They're telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
maybe even the first person to walk on Mars. And that kind of inspiration is the by-product

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
of work of the sort that you guys have done. So not only do I want to congratulate the team,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I want to call out a few of the leaders of the group, including Adam,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but also Peter Theisinger, Richard Cook, John Grotzinger, John Grunsfeld.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And I'd like to congratulate and thank all of our international partners -- Spain, Russia, Germany, France,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Canada, Italy, Japan, Australia -- all of them contributed, I know, to the instrumentation 'Curiosity' landed

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
on Martian surface -- and all the scientists who are part of the JPL team.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So you guys have done an outstanding job. You made us all proud. You've made NASA proud.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You guys are examples of American know-how and ingenuity, and it's really an amazing accomplishment.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So we can't wait to start hearing back from 'Curiosity' and finding out what's going on.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We're fortunate to be part of a society that can reach beyond our planet and explore frontiers that were only

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
imagined by our ancestors. So it's inspiring to all of us. I'm going to give you guys

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a personal commitment to protect these critical investments in science and technology

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I thank you for devoting your lives to this cause. And if, in fact, you do make contact with Martians,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
please let me know right away. (Laughter.) I've got a lot of other things on my plate,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but I suspect that that will go to the top of the list. (Laughter.) Even if they're just microbes,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
it will be pretty exciting. (Laughter.)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
DR. ELACHI: Well, thank you, Mr. President. And on behalf of all us at NASA,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
we thank you for taking the time to give us a call. And, hopefully, we inspired some of the millions of

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
young people who were watching this landing. Thank you again.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
THE PRESIDENT: Well, you've already inspired us, but I know that the photographs that are going to start

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
coming back are going to be remarkable and amazing. And, again, you guys should be remarkably proud.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Really what makes us best as a species is this curiosity that we have and this yearning to discover and know

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:58.000
more, and push the boundaries of knowledge. And you are perfect examples of that, and we couldn't be

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
more grateful to you. So, congratulations. Keep up the great work.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
DR. ELACHI: Thank you very much. And have a good day.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Bye-bye, guys. (Applause.)
