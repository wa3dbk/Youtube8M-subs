00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.980
Today on our 2013 GMC Terrain, we&amp;#39;ll be
installing the Curt trailer hitch receiver,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.080
part number C12291.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.910
Here&amp;#39;s what the hitch looks like installed
on our vehicle.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.000
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and give you a couple
measurements in helping you choose some accessories

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.339
for your hitch, such as a ball mount, a bicycle
rack, or a cargo carrier.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.789
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outer-most edge of the bumper is approximately

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.789
3 inches.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.800
From the top of the opening in the receiver
to the ground is approximately 14 inches.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:40.370
Now let&amp;#39;s go ahead and install our hitch.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:56.890
We&amp;#39;ll need to 
remove this lower fascia door here.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:05.250
To do this, we&amp;#39;ll push in on these tabs
right here.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:02:26.390
Here&amp;#39;s the hardware that we&amp;#39;ll be
using 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:03:19.480
to 
install 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.260
our hitch.
