Hi, this is Lee with Prima,

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.689
here to show you our Chemex line

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.630
Here are all the Chemex brewers that we offer.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.990
Starting out on this end we have the three cup models,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.740
We have both the glass and the wood collar.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.289
We also have the 6 cup, which is a little bit bigger,

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.270
as well as the 8 cup models, 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.030
and here we have the 10 cup Chemex brewers.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.940
Chemex is a classic pour over coffee brewing method,
it’s bend around over 50 years now

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.940
and it has proven to be a really great,
well rounded brewing method for lots of folks.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.020
Beginners can make a great cup of coffee with the Chemex.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.710
Some folks ask about how to put in the filter,
so I just wanted to show you guys how that works.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.950
Basically the Chemex filter is a much thicker filter;
it’s purpose is really to give you a slower brewing process,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.510
that is why you want a coarser grind.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:18.750
as you see it has 1, 2 and 3 and 4 flaps here.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.920
You basically want to take 1 and 3 and divide them out,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920
I’ll show you that right there.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.320
And so your one side is going to be thicker.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.200
The thicker side you want to place 
directly right on the spout,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.390
just like that. 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.400
You don’t want to place the corner into the spout.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.260
You don’t want it reversed,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.320
you want to make sure you have it right on the spout.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.180
The reason for this is, you want proper airflow
throughout the brewing process so the gases can escape.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.619
If you don’t do that, you are going to see your coffee bubble up
and it’s going to cause a mess.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.950
With a little practice,
you could be brewing really great cups in no time.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.339
So, this is our Chemex line, thanks for watching.
