“Watermelon as Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction”

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.200
As noted in a recent article
in the Harvard Health Letter,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.790
up to three-quarter of men with
cholesterol-narrowed coronary arteries

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.730
have some degree
of erectile dysfunction as well.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.720
There’s drugs like Viagra,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920
but they’re temporary,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.800
and an expensive solution that
can cause hazardous side effects.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.210
Obviously, if your arterial
system is that damaged,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.080
a more intensive effort that involves
much more than popping a pill

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.140
can yield longer-term improvements in both
sexual function and cardiovascular health.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.050
Plant-based diets can not only
reverse both conditions,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.019
but one plant in particular may be able
to play a stopgap role in the meantime.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.559
The way drugs like Viagra work
is by inhibiting an enzyme

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.960
that inactivates something called cGMP,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.670
which would otherwise
dilate penile blood vessels.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.839
So, enzyme inhibition means more cGMP,
which means more blood flow.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.360
But there’s another way
to boost cGMP levels,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.030
by going to the other side
of the equation,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.280
and stimulating the enzyme that makes it.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210
That’s what nitric oxide does.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.720
Nitric oxide is made from arginine.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.990
Arginine can be produced by citrulline.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850
So I wonder what would happen
if you ate more citrulline.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.570
“Oral [L-]citrulline supplementation
improves erection hardness in men

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.840
with mild erectile dysfunction.”

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.049
And where is citrulline found?

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.960
Watermelon.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469
How much watermelon would you
have to eat every day to match

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.140
the dose they used in the study?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.670
Three and a half servings a day—

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.159
unless you eat yellow watermelon,

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.570
which has about four times
as much citrulline.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.420
So just one serving a day, one wedge,
one-sixteenth of a modest melon

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.960
should provide the dose they used,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.060
allowing for a 68% increase
in monthly intercourse frequency,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.500
which your heart should be able to handle,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.660
given how much lower your blood pressure
will be with watermelon supplementation.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.650
Watermelon’s got it all.
