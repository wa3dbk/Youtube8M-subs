00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.689
- EW!

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.019
- Oh my God!

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.290
No! No...it can't be!

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.980
"Welcome back, Upper East Siders!"

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.050
- What's wrong Dorota?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.900
"THIS JUST IN..."

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.900
- What?!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.400
- No...way.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.720
- You have got to be kidding me!

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.060
- Why are you doing this now?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.289
- OMG...

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.899
- You know it's just a rumor. It's not true.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:56.249
- Should I be worried?

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.110
- You wouldn't believe what he told me!

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.790
- Well, isn't there something that we can
do?

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.799
- It's Election Day.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.249
- I mean the most important thing in a relationship
is trust!

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.970
After sex &amp; hygiene...and earning potential.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.199
- What's next? You're gonna walk her down
the aisle?

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.390
- Have you ever thought about traveling?
Somewhere very far away...

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.430
- I'm in the mood for a little show tonight!

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.880
- People change, Chuck.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.140
- You think your friendship is going to take
care of itself.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.949
You're not kids anymore.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.960
- They don't care that I'm Blair Waldorf!

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.269
- Can you just...leave.
Please...I need some time.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:33.919
- I need help. I'm scared.

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:35.920
- This just is my lucky day.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.999
- I think I already know.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.119
"I see it didn't take much time for you to
dirty up the clean slates I gave you."

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.450
- No, you deserve to be alone.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.630
- This night is finally over.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.790
And as far as I'm concerned so are we.
