00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:15.895
The intervention of Lusogambler will be short, because Lusogambler has, like myself,

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:24.548
has all his work exposed on the Internet, either through video or by his articles,

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:36.562
These two users not that much, right, and thatâ€™s why some of you got to know their job today,

00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:41.468
in my case and in the case of Lusogambler, you already know what we do,

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.571
but again I tell you, Lusogambler will tell you a few words here and then

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:53.821
all us four, we'll be available for you to put any questions that you want,

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.408
this is the idea of this Meeting.

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:05.095
Good night. Taking the opening words of Paulo and the convenience of these presentations

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:11.113
be relatively brief, I'll try not to take too long.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:17.828
Hello everyone, I'm Lusogambler.

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.755
For those who were expecting to see here a Rastafarian starched, you got a bald paunchy,

00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:31.643
Trader has these surprises.

00:01:31.764 --> 00:01:37.427
As Paulo said, let me assume that most of you

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:45.913
already know minimally, or even very well, my work, what I do as a trader.

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:53.067
And in that sense, I can only add that I am at your disposal for any questions you want to make me.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:56.456
This presentation is done.
