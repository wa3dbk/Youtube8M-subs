Jon Pertwee: Once you've begun tampering with it, 
the oddest things start happening.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.660
Reporter: For four years Jon Pertwee
took on all comers in space

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.240
Reporter: including his arch enemies, the dreaded-

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.480
Jon Pertwee: Daleks!

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.320
Sylvester McCoy: He'll be very sadly missed.
He was a great man.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.480
Sylvester McCoy: And I can defintely say I was in the company of a great man.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.820
Sylvester McCoy: And he made me laugh so much.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.220
Reporter: The British actor's career began
in radio,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.740
Reporter: despite dire predictions from his 
teacher at drama school.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.900
Jon Pertwee: Kenneth Barnes told me that I had:

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.620
[Impersonation]
Absolutely no talent of any sort whatsoever in the theatre.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.220
[Impersonation] And that I - and that I -  I don't thing there's any point in you continuing.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.140
Reporter: But continue he did, in a career
that spanned 60 years, including a role that

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.049
helped launch a legend.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.900
Jim Waley (anchor): Television Time Lord 
Jon Pertwee has entered a new realm.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.760
The man who was one of the most popular manifestations of Doctor Who has died

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.690
of a heart attack at the age of 76.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Reporter: Jon Pertwee was the astronomical
aristocrat, he was the Time Lord.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.430
His unique talents made him a star long 
before he entered the TARDIS.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.360
But as the third Doctor Who he became the
most popular, and after 4 years of Time Travelling,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.829
he'd established himself as something 
of a cult figure.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.800
Jon Pertwee: A very complicated thing,
time, Jo.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.630
Once you've begun tampering with it, the oddest
things start happening.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.060
Reporter: Jon Pertwee's acclaimed version
of Doctor Who was a role in stark contrast

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.299
to the comedy for which he'd been known.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.419
In reality he was dismissive of Daleks.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.500
He said they were put together with a 
sink plunger, an egg whisk and tennis balls,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.320
and said they were just ridiculous.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.040
Jon Pertwee: Daleks!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.080
Jim Waley: In a moment, the big Telstra hold
up; Paul Lyneham
