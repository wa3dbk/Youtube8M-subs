00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.340
"Father's Days" by Bob, an 
illustrated memoir of a first-time dad.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.480
I don't remember being anxious or scared about
becoming a dad, but I think that's because

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.650
I was so sure that nothing would go wrong.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.570
[ALARM RINGING]

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.490
[FOOTSTEPS RUNNING]

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.430
You often imagine how you'd respond in an
emergency situation. We all like to think

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.609
we're cope with it like people do in films
or on television, but I really didn't have

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:39.969
a clue. I've never been good with blood. They
told me I could say hello quickly before they

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:49.980
took her away. When I said, "I'm your dad,"
it sounded like an apology.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.879
The next few hours were confusing. We didn't
understand exactly what had happened, just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.250
that she was very ill and needed to be transferred
somewhere else.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.100
[MACHINE BEEPING]

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.070
My wife had to stay behind to recover from
the surgery. I tried to ignore how fast the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:19.110
ambulance was traveling. When you see all
those machines and tubes and wires and hear

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
all the beeps and alarms, that's when I realized
it was a life or death situation.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.380
The doctor was very frank with me. He explained
my daughter's condition was incredibly serious.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.820
She'd suffered an injury to her brain.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.900
At that point, I was beginning to realize
how helpless hopelessly out of my depth I was.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.180
Once I got back to my room, all
the emotion suddenly took over, because dads

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.240
are supposed to be heroes, aren't they? I
think I was expecting to have a baby and suddenly

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.810
be transformed into this person who knew how
to deal with any situation. I had a family

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.500
now that needed me and we were all facing
a huge struggle.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.920
I just didn't feel strong  enough.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.319
When cerebral palsy was first mentioned, my
first thought was, well, I don't really know

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.989
what that is. The parent hood I'd been anticipating
was gradually fading away, and it was being

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:34.450
replaced with loads of questions. Eventually
she opened her eyes and we got to hold her

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.190
for the first time. Although she was still
connected to a lot of equipment, it felt like

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.430
she was finally connected to us as well.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.720
When you've been in an environment like that
with a new baby, with so many doctors and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.310
nurses, and then you finally get home, it's
eerily quiet. There's no alarm to tell you

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.280
if she stopped breathing. I don't think either
of us really slept.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.870
But things got easier.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:21.440
Well, we got more used to it, like all parents
do, and we were so busy.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.230
Sometimes, it's still really hard to deal
with. You have a lot of guilt and sadness

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.930
about the situation. But most the time, you're
just astounded by what she's accomplishing

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.800
and focusing on how much fun you're having
together.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
When she took those first steps

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.269
on her frame, we were all so excited. There
was always a big question mark over walking.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:59.030
But quite often you find that when one question
mark disappears, another one springs up to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.950
take it's place.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.119
The process of drawing what happened has been
really cathartic for me and helped me realize

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.680
just how far we've all come.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.840
After all the complications, the idea of having another baby was frightening

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.680
but ultimately we realized it was what we all wanted and needed

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.640
My experience
of fatherhood hasn't really been anything

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.860
like what I imagined it would be, but that's
probably true of all dads.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.220
I'm definitely a different person now.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.280
The whole thing about being a hero and knowing
how to save the day -

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.480
I wasn't supposed to be the hero in all of this.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.240
There were plenty of them-- the doctors, the nurses, the physios, the paramedics

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.990
and the little girl who showed me what it really means to be brave and determined

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.600
and strong.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.160
She taught me that just being
a dad is more than enough.
