00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:19.480
I’ve always liked the Army Men concept.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.579
Take the popular plastic toys, put them in
a slightly cartoony war zone...it’s a fun

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.579
idea.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:26.650
And this one continues the tradition.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.640
It’s an excellent game, a surprisingly tactical
game...it’s Army Men: Air Combat.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.399
Green versus tan.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.969
Choose a side.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.519
So this was one of the earliest games in the
Army Men series.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:52.000
It was released back in 1999 for the PlayStation,
Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color, which is obviously

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.020
the one we’re playing here.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.239
It’s about the same concept as the previous
games, only this time, you’re in a helicopter.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.929
Which may or may not be made of plastic.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.890
Actually, if you’re familiar with games
like Desert Strike...I mean, this is basically

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.910
the same thing.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.270
Each level gives you a mission...anything
from carry the supplies to your base to destroy

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.350
the enemy vehicles.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.700
And from there, it’s air-to-ground combat.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:25.430
The game is heavily strategy based too, so...all-out
assaults won’t get you very far.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.939
See, the game kind of forces you to play carefully...both
due to the nature of its design and the few

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.170
flaws it has.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530
The enemies overwhelm you at times.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.090
Tanks, soldiers, towers, and they all seem
to have impeccable aim.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.310
Flying into enemy territory is a dangerous
proposition unless you have a plan.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.969
Which I rarely do.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.680
So yeah, you have to be smart about your approach.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.369
But the game’s flaws have something to do
with that, too.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.960
See, its controls actually aren’t all that
different from an old Resident Evil game.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.010
You know how it works, left and right on the
d-pad just steer the chopper.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.899
Up moves forward, that kind of thing.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.300
Whether you like those controls or not...they
certainly make your movements more deliberate.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.690
They make picking things up a nightmare.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.640
But that’s the thing about Aerial Combat.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.069
This game is legitimately challenging.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.820
The characters may be toys, but...this is
hardly a kid’s game.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.819
It’s way more involved than you might expect.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.800
In fact, it can actually be a bit frustrating.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.550
The difficulty is high right from the start,
a case of trial by fire on the Game Boy Color.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.980
Trial by plastic.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.420
The game pairs that challenging gameplay with
a nice amount of content.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.410
It has six different worlds, with 16 missions
scattered across them.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.440
It’s just a matter of...can you deal with
the difficulty and the tank-like controls.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.370
If so, this is a Game Boy Color game that’s
absolutely worth tracking down.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.390
Huge thanks to our friend Micaiah from North
Carolina for sending us Army Men: Air Combat.
