by detective at that point dot com slash the

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:11.991
right to you for your prefab

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:16.971
there's a high school in illinois and uh...
known as it's in napa rebel and it's a high

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:19.581
school in apurva

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:26.581
during are two thousand six and had idea of
selling its for promotion of tolerance of

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.352
of the homosexual community okay

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:34.382
so are they were having issues with the gay
students being bullied they wanted to aren't

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:40.902
show where nancy wanted to promote tolerance
so they had that dance islands where abstinence

00:00:40.902 --> 00:00:45.872
you know it expressed you know their tolerance
towards the gay community

00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:47.061
well one students

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:51.392
i by the name of heidi decided that she would
show up that day wearing a t_-shirt that said

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:53.522
be happy not day

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:58.202
uh... and school officials were upset about
it they told her that she needed to go home

00:00:58.202 --> 00:01:00.462
and change

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:03.971
or she needs to go home and not come back
or the other option was

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.672
uh... to black out bed not gay part the first
teacher

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:13.472
so she's a final blocked out the not gay part
and she remained in class but she went off

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.642
to see the school

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:21.202
and um... the ruling from the seventy u_s_
circuit court of appeals agrees with the female

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:24.792
student who were the t-shirt they said that
if you are having a day that

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:30.082
uh... is supposed to raise awareness for the
gay community where people are practicing

00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:35.042
their first amendment rights it does not make
sense to of

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:37.661
drown out any type of criticism

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:40.752
because your basically going to be guilty
of

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:44.492
uh... abiola in first amendment right you
can't have people

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:50.402
uh... be activists on campus and then get
rid of any type of opposition

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.002
well you know my citizens

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.492
i'm always a very first minute uh... off and

00:01:55.492 --> 00:02:00.592
uh... not on our side ideologically out but
i am on the side of protecting your preston

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:01.392
rides

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:05.362
uh... you know we've done this in regard southern
churches and schools this line is he

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:06.911
well i think i should be allowed

00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.761
i don't care what you put on a trip out there
use them work

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:10.792
uh...

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:13.612
no epperson london life is the job the school

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.332
wall and the community

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:17.821
to protect the person and the nights

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.341
and uh... so that's one one what do those

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.611
got conservatives love losses

00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:28.172
they claim to be in favor of poor form but
the minute the an opportunity

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:31.042
diplomacy quicker than you can get their you
know

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:33.341
in india look at it so

00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:35.971
if this is larry there but overall

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.912
uh... i would've rule was a way that the court
said

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:43.132
yet you know when it comes to this case i
think i would rule the same way as well because

00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:48.581
like you and i are a little different when
it comes to uh... this type of

00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:54.121
you know issue for instance i had there was
a case where out one uh... right wing christian

00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:58.271
student showed up the school and randomly
decided to wear a shirt that said islamic

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:04.151
is of the devil right and you know he did
that sent agonized the muslim students and

00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.921
there was no need for it when you're on a
camp is your first amendment rights are a

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.911
little different ok the school gets to decide
whether or not you get to practice your first

00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:15.932
amendment rights because they they need to
protect the students

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:17.941
but in this particular case

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:22.211
i mean you're having people exercise their
first amendment rights uh... especially when

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:27.241
it comes to their thoughts opinions on the
gay community your allowing them to see

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:31.201
basically voiced their support for the gay
community it doesn't make sense to drown out

00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:35.621
any type of criticism right i'd think that
it's important to have that discussion on

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:40.801
campus i honestly don't agree with this girl
uh... ideologically at all but

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.251
you know maybe that discussion is something
that could be educational

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:49.701
maybe have some sort of i don't know lecture
audit have people discuss why they feel the

00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:53.352
way that they feel about it at because in
the real world this is what you deal with

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:58.642
you deal with people who'll are running their
ideal ideology so how how do you deal with

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:02.642
that the real world world so i think that
you i'd think that this is a good rolling

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:05.082
