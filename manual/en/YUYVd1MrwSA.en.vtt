00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.870
We’re proud to say that Hid’n Pines is
a special kind of campground located in Old

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.250
Orchard Beach, Maine.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.160
We’ve got all of the top amenities today’s
campers have come to expect, but we blend

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.240
those with a peaceful, natural, and quiet
surrounding to help visitors reconnect with

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.340
the best that mother nature has to offer.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.880
At Hid’n Pines Family Campground our amenities
are vast in that we have playgrounds and swimming

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.129
pools, yet we are geared towards a more quiet
family camping experience so we don’t have

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.660
kids activity programs or anything that’s
necessarily planned out by the campground

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.870
- it’s more for the camper that wants to
come and have a nice, quiet, relaxing stay.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.010
And a stay at Hid’n Pines is just that – relaxing.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.680
At Hid’n Pines you can happily unwind with
a dip in the pool…

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.129
…let your kids work out some of that extra
energy on the playground…

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.479
…and let them get their electronics fix
in the game room…

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.410
….but unlike other campgrounds, peace and
quiet reigns…and no activities are forced

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.410
on our guests.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.939
At Hid’n Pines you can enjoy your surroundings
at your own quiet, leisurely pace.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.210
Add in Hid’n Pines resort-style bathhouses
and you’ll feel extra comfortable in your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.479
home away from home.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.729
And when you are ready to head out and experience
a bit more of the excitement of Old Orchard

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.560
Beach you’re a short walk or drive away
from it all.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.189
When you’re at Hid’n Pines you’re just
a short walk from 7 miles of sandy beach.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.260
Just outside our driveway, half a mile down
the road you’ll find downtown Old Orchard

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.079
Beach with an amusement park, street-side
food and 7 miles of pristine sandy beach.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.130
It’s truly a jewel of the East Coast.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.469
Stop in and stay a’while at Hid’n Pines
Campground and you’ll experience camping

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.869
the way it was meant to be.
