On behalf of Expert Village I'm Terry and
today I'm going to give you tips on smoking

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.130
a beef brisket. Okay we have brought the brisket
inside. I have trimmed a little bit off here

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.890
to show you a illustration. When you trim
a brisket you don't want to trim from the

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.510
side to where you are trimming with the grain
you want to trim against the grain. It will

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.050
trim a lot easier, it will not fall apart.
People usually trim into sandwich slices maybe

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.190
about a 1/8 of a inch thick. You can cook
it longer if you want to the longer you cook

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.680
it the drier it would get. If you want to
make a brim juice you can take and trim the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.070
fat off which is a pretty piece of fat. Put
that in the pan and boil it and just make

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.559
you like a sauce that you can take and pour
over the meat. Let me talk a little bit about

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:10.130
how you know it is done. If you see this meat
right here how it is pink right along here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.390
and it goes back to done looking color. Which
is light brown and pink again the smoke actually

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.540
preserves that meat around there. That is
cooked if it was pink in here and pink out

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.159
here it is not done it will be pink on the
outside and brown in the middle. Just the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:35.890
opposite of what a undone steak or brisket
that has not been cooked long enough. This

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.240
brisket has the fat on the top this is the
fat that you can trim off and boil that in

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:51.979
to a brim sauce or a sauce. You can trim your
brisket up that would be going with the grain

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:00.690
on that side this would be trimming it against
the grain so you can get it off into sandwich

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.760
slices. You see that texture right there if
you went this way it would be like you are

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.809
almost peeling it off of there. This way you
are getting good sandwich slices against the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.909
grain.
