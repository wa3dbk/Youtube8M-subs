00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.233
This is a small fan painting by the painter Liang Kai

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:19.800
done in the first half of the thirteenth century. Now it’s mounted as an album leaf

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.266
and depicts a poet strolling on the marshy land,

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:29.000
across the river is a little embankment,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.667
and a few sketched lines of a distant peak.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:42.867
It’s a very light, very airy composition. The subject matter is quite conventional,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:49.667
but the way it is treated here is very unusual. Many paintings of this time used lots of empty space,

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:56.000
but if you look at it closely, there’s a diagonal across the middle of the composition.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The unpainted part is actually solid; it’s not just mist, it’s actually a massive boulder behind it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.567
I think that there’s a metaphorical dimension to it,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.734
that reflects the psychological weight

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:14.000
of the stroller beneath it. This kind of composition

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.567
is very often associated with the poet Qu Yuan,

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:28.333
a major court minister very devoted to the nation and to the ruler, but because of some slander he was exiled

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:33.667
and he drowned himself in the river to show his loyalty.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.667
And Liang Kai used this overhanging,

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.533
massive rock

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:42.767
above him to show his emotional state. Liang Kai

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.233
may feel some affinity with the ancient poet. He was

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:53.367
briefly a court painter, and then something happened. He left his prestigious position at court

00:01:53.367 --> 00:02:00.634
and went to live in a Buddhist monastery and he painted there very much in the Buddhist idea

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:06.334
of an illusory nature of a phenomenon. He’s playing on the idea about the deceptive nature

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:12.667
of what can be seen on the surface,

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:16.500
and the reality may be behind the clouds, behind the mist.
