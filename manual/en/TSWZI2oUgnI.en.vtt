00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.130
Using archival data from NASA's decommissioned

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.180
RXTE X-ray satellite, researchers have discovered a rare

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.220
type of black hole lurking in M82, a galaxy about 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.260
12 million light-years away. Known as M82 X-1,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.290
the object is the galaxy's brightest X-ray source.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.340
It was long suspected of being an exceptional midsize black hole, too big to

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.380
be made by a dying star, yet much smaller than the monsters found in the hearts of

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.400
galaxies, but definitive evidence had never materialized.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.460
Now, through careful analysis of RXTE data, astronomers have

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.460
shown that M82 X-1 weighs in at about 400 times the mass of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.470
our sun. Measured masses for black holes formed by stars reach

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.530
about 25 solar masses, and those found in galaxy centers weigh at least

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.570
10,000 times more. Only a handful of black holes have been

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.620
discovered with inferred masses between these extremes. Astronomers

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.680
measured M82 X-1 by finding a special signature in its X-ray glow.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
Hot gas orbiting a black hole emits X-rays.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.730
Near the bring of the black hole, various physical effects create hot spots, which

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.790
produce variations as they orbit. These signals encode

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.840
important clues to the black hole's mass. One important signal comes

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.880
in the form of stable pairs with a 3-to-2 relationship, meaning that one

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.910
flashes three times for every two flashes of the other. In

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.970
searching through six years of RXTE observations of M82 X-1,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.010
astronomers recently found this key signature. One hot spot

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.050
flashes 5.1 times a second, while the other flickers 3.3 times a second--

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.110
a solid 3-to-2 relationship. These

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.160
signals, combined with other previously variations, pointed to an accurate

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.210
mass of about 400 suns. With that finding,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.250
M82 X-1 now joins the exclusive club of middle-mass

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.300
black holes. [Music]
