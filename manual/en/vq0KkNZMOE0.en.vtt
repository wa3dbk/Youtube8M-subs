00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.780
Hello and welcome!

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:18.550
I'm Viviane with foodandstyle.com.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.859
Place the red wine in a medium saucepan.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:30.759
Add the sugar, the ginger, and the spices.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:39.280
Now bring to a boil.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.449
Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat
to medium and simmer the wine until it has

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.020
thickened and becomes foamy.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.750
We want to reduce the wine to about 1/4 of
its original volume, and this will take about

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.660
30 minutes, depending on the size of pan you're
using.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.199
It's been about 25 minutes, and so far nothing
much is happening in our pan.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.490
But look at the wine -- it is starting to
foam up on the edges.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.210
We've got about 5 minutes to go.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.740
These last few minutes of the reduction are
the most important.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.360
If you overcook the wine, it will become sticky
and you will not be able to use it.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.830
If you don't cook it enough, it will be too
thin.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.380
What you want to wait for is what you see
right now in the pan -- the wine foaming on

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.020
the whole surface.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
And if you tilt the pan, it looks like a thick
syrup.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.790
We are done.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.540
So turn off the heat and strain through a
fine-meshed sieve.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.909
You should end up with about 3/4 cup of the
vincotto.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.650
Once cooled, transfer the vincotto to a jar
or squeeze bottle and refrigerate it.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.970
It will keep for several months.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.270
Enjoy!
