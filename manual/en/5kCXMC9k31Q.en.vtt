00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.760
Today well be taking a look at the Yakima
DoubleDown Ace 2 Bike Carrier for both 1-1/4-inch

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.639
and 2-inch hitches, part number Y02450.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.379
The DoubleDown Ace features an anti-wobble
knob that tightens the rack in your hitch

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.500
without the use of tool, anti-sway cradles,
as well as folding arms and a tilting mast.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.420
Here at the shank of the bike rack youll notice
the adaptor for 2-inch hitches.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.439
To remove the adaptor, using the included
Allen wrench well remove the Allen bolt here

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.890
at the bottom of the shank to remove the adaptor.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.680
Now our shank is ready for 1-1/4-inch hitch.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.860
Today well be using a 2-inch hitch so well
go ahead and reinstall the adaptor.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
Now here at our hitch, well go ahead and slide
our bike rack shank into the hitch lining

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.600
up the hitch pin hole.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.120
Youll notice that the DoubleDown Ace has an
attached hitch pin.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.260
This hitch pin has a ball at the end giving
you the confirmation when the pin is installed

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.220
that its locked into place.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.720
Now here on the back of the shank on the mast
of the bike rack, we can then turn the knob

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.610
securing our anti-wobble device to the hitch.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:02:00.330
Here on the knob youll notice Yakima used
one of their SKS lock cores to lock and unlock

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:46.629
the knob.
