A big part of the Victoria University experience
is expanding not only what you know, but how

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:11.180
you learn that.
Who of you would like to go to space?

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.860
I believe that outreach is a core component
of what a scientist should do.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.810
It's a star at the end of its life and it's
forming into this great big ball of diamond.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.560
You realise that how we learn is so much more
than just a person talking and another person

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.230
listening. It's doing and applying and thinking
and breaking stuff and getting it wrong and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.950
doing all the other stuff that humans actually
do.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.390
My experience at Victoria has fundamentally
changed my worldview. It's fundamentally changed

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.140
me as a person.
She is 150 years old.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.440
It's a very human exercise doing science,
because you've got personalities, you've got

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.490
hopes and dreams and epic failures and everything
else along the way.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.289
My experience through science at Victoria
has, at its core, been about curiosity. It's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.700
allowed me to find a way to express the curiosity
that I had ever since I was a little kid.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.170
It's easy to be curious about things but it's
really hard to find answers.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.329
You guys have all been around Carter, all
downstairs, and you've seen all of these

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.179
facts and things about stars yeah? How do
we know them?

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.190
One of the great things about doing science
at Victoria is that it's shown me how you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.540
can find answers in a world that's full of
woolly messes and squishy biological things

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.659
that are really complicated.
Look how much energy it's using up. How many

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.890
people it would take...
Curiosity is like a little flame that keeps

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.810
burning at the middle. You get huge amounts
of knowledge, you can do stuff in the lab,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.700
you get to meet amazing people from all different
walks of life. But that little flame of curiosity

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.039
is always going to start putting out questions
and it's going to keep putting them out for

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.200
the rest of your life. I am doomed to have
these interesting questions about the world

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.439
pop up in my head. And I don't think that
it will ever change. And I would've never had

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.100
had that without my experiences through sicence at Victoria.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.900
I'm Elf Eldridge and I'm doing science at Victoria University of Wellington.
