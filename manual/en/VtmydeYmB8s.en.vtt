We just reviewed a Scooby-Doo game for the
GBA, like...last week. What was it? Last...Thursday,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.230
or something? I don�t know. Freaking thing
was that forgettable.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.809
I only remember it because...oh, here�s
another one. And I was, like, �Haven�t

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.110
we already been through this? Come on, Daphne.
Let�s go to the Mystery Machine.�

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.710
�And look at all the clues.�

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.300
And we would�ve made it, too. It if weren�t
for this meddling game.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.410
Fortunately, turns out Scooby-Doo: Mystery
Machine is a hell of a lot better than Scooby-Doo

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.150
2: Monsters Unleashed. Unfortunately, turns
out a peanut butter and poop sandwich is a

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.880
hell of a lot better than poop alone. It�s
worth remembering that �better� is a relative

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080
term. And that, when it comes to Scooby-Doo
on the Game Boy Advance, a game that doesn�t

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:24.280
make you nauseous is �robably a rame worth
relebrating.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.770
So the game picks up at a library, which happens
to be overflowing with ghosts. The gang comes

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.021
to check it out, and of course, hijinks ensue.
One of the cool things about Mystery Machine

00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:43.630
is that...its allegiance is to the original
series. That�s a great place to start. The

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.380
sprites pay tribute to the cartoon, not the
terrible movies, and are a huge improvement

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.240
over a game like Monsters Unleashed.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.200
In fact, the game even has a laugh track.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.090
And that�s awesome.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.000
So at first, I was pretty excited about this
one. It seemed to have everything going its

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.200
direction. It looked good, it held to the
Scooby spirit, the platforming felt okay...but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.180
after about 45 minutes in the same godd*mn
library, with the same godd*mn graphics, and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.540
the same godd*mn doors, I literally started
to get a headache.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.310
That�s when I realized...I wouldn�t want
to play this.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.810
Not even for a Scooby Snack.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:38.920
See, the one major problem with Mystery Mayhem...is
that it has some of the most godawful level

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.820
design you�ll ever see. And it�s actually
a multi-layered problem. One issue is that...the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.600
levels are absurdly long, and overstay their
welcome. Another is that...nothing ever happens.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.600
They�re just long, boring, mundane fetch
quests.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.030
And what�s worse, everything looks the same.
And since the game has so much backtracking,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.310
you�re constantly getting lost. No map,
no icons...just headaches.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.290
And you know, it really disappointed me. Because
again, the game does a lot of things well.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.390
Eventually, you even pick up this magical
book that lets you attack the ghosts, a la

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.030
Luigi�s Mansion. The animation is nice...there�s
even a mine cart level, of all things. So

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.180
especially if you�re a fan of the old Hanna-Barbera
series, Mystery Mayhem tugs your heart strings

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.300
right away.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.680
And then it punches it.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:40.650
And punching someone in the heart? That�s
the worst.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.350
With better level design that didn�t just
involve tedious backtracking through virtually

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.520
indistinguishable rooms, this game might�ve
been onto something. But seriously, the problem�s

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.600
bad enough that Mystery Mayhem isn�t even
worth your time.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:04.270
Jinkies. Like, what a bummer.
