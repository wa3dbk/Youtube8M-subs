In this episode I'll talk about

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.760
'Selective Focus' on how you can use it to
tell stronger stories.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.919
AdoramaTV presents:

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.359
'Exploring Photography' with Mark Wallace.
Hi everybody - I'm Mark Wallace. I'm here

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.029
in a very, very busy street in Ho Chi
Minh City,

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.080
Vietnam, what we call Saigon, and this is
just one of many streets like this and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.250
you know what I could do,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.100
as a photographer, is to get my wide angle lens and
jump out to the street and take a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.630
picture

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.240
of the street. You can see this picture I
took and it really doesn't tell a story.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.110
As photographers we are visual
storytellers so instead of trying to tell

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.520
all of the story, all at once, there's a
better solution and that is to go and look

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.450
for very specific stories

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.790
along this street and I can do that using
something called 'Selective Focus'.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.560
Now we've learned all about depth of
field and really what I'm gonna do is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.760
I am going to use a longer lens.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.320
I am going to open my aperture as wide as possible and then get my depth of field

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.260
really shallow and then I was
gonna look for little stories

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.100
along the way. Maybe it's a a person sitting on a bench or

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.550
maybe some food that's interesting, I don't know, but join me as I walk this street

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.940
and I find little snippets of stories and tell them using 'Selective Focus'. So let's get going!

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.540
Well here in this very busy street, I am also
looking

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.990
not just to tell single-story but I am
looking for interesting stories to tell.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.810
I am looking for patterns and color and
so these lanterns right here have

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
a nice pattern so I can fill the frame with those, let them fall out of focus, and then we have these

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.820
nice colors. The orange and blue really
complement each other.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.490
I'm not just looking for single stories but I am looking for color and pattern and shape and texture

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.890
all of the things that you would normally shoot in a photo

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.530
and of course, I am a Portrait Photographer, so I am also looking for people to shoot.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.200
So we are going to keep zipping along and see what we find on this very busy street.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.860
'Selective Focus' is more than just
opening up your aperture to get a shallow depth of field.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.360
What you are trying to do, is to look and tell stories that are a small parts of a larger story.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.820
So looking at something, it could be as simple as a
scratch on a motorcycle or

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.220
a stool somebody is using to sit on, or a pot someone is cooking in.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.420
You can apply this to your photography - I am sure you are not shooting on a busy street in Saigon necessarily

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.450
but when you are out shooting maybe an event or a wedding or birthday party

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.410
you get the entire shot of "Hey here's all
the kids at the birthday table!".

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.540
But then get those little details - the candles on the cake,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.780
blowing out the candles, that first
present that's opening, the look on that little kid's face.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.370
All those small details that add to that
larger story.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.520
So when I say selective focus it's
more than just

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.800
opening up your aperture and getting a
shallow depth of field. It's looking for the details

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.350
tell a story better. So lets continue on
our quest

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.630
to tell a better story of the busy
streets of Saigon.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.500
Well the next time you find yourself
in a really busy

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.800
scenario, like a crazy street in a city or
maybe something that's more realistic like

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800
shooting at a wedding or birthday party
or an event.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.010
Instead of trying to shoot everything that's
happening all at once, look for specifics

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.070
smaller stories and tell those using
selective focus. Open your aperture as wide as it will go.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.800
Get close, that is getting you a really nice
shallow depth of field and making sure of those

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.980
little things that are happening in that
scene.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.680
That will make a more meaningful story
and you can put that together if you need to,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.690
with the overall story. So 'Selective
Focus' is something that you might want to try

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.260
the next time you're out shooting an
event or birthday party or

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.000
just traveling - it works really well.
