Hello balloon world, I am your balloon twister
Michael Floyd,

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.651
and today will teach you
how to make a balloon dog.

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:17.631
The balloon dog is one a basic balloon
animals.

00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:20.291
It's the first balloon animal that most
balloon twisters start with,

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.201
It was the first one that I started with.

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.291
You're gonna need a balloon 260 color of your
choice

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:30.660
Inflate it about 2/3 the way, and tie.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.921
What makes a balloon dog such a simple
balloon animal,

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.081
is that utilizes the lock twist 3 times.

00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.171
Once for the ears and twice
for each side to the legs

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:43.520
The lock twist is to equal segments that
are locked together

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.231
with an additional twist.

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.300
Let's start
with the head.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300
You make a section for the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.410
front of the head.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.581
That's going to be the front of our
dog's face.

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:56.270
Now we're going to do the ears, which is
a lock twist of two sections that are of equal

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.270
length.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.441
So twist two sections, of equal length,

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:09.781
and then we twist them together.

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.931
Straighten the ears up.

00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:14.401
And there we have a dog head.

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:16.131
Now just
like we did the ears, we're gonna do the

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.551
legs the same way.

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.041
We are going to twist a small bubble for the
neck.

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.961
Followed by two small sections of equal length.

00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:29.361
we're gonna fold those up, and we're going
to twist them together.

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:33.981
And there we have the front part of our
dog legs

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.521
Now just like we did those legs, we are
going to another set of legs for the back.

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:45.531
Twist a section, followed by 2 sections of
equal length,

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:51.061
fold it over, twist them together,

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:52.061
straighten it up.

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.461
And there we have a balloon dog.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.771
The poodle tail is one of the harder balloon
twisting abilities

00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:58.881
Because it is counter-intuitive.

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.061
What we
want to do is get there from here,

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.291
to the tip here.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.661
Now you would think that
you could just squeeze the air up.

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.421
But, what that will do is it will deformed
the shape,

00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.431
and it doesn't stay at the top.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.901
What you
actually have to do

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:19.920
is you're going to pinch the tip and
pull it up

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.001
and squeeze from the bottom,

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:26.191
but you don't want to squeeze the air
down, not up.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.561
By squeezing the air down

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:32.641
and by searching the end out, What we end
up doing is creating a localized vacuum.

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:36.221
So that when I squeeze the air, the only
place for to go

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:39.691
is the part with the lowest pressure

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.991
the end.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:46.321
Giving it a couple more squeezes.

00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:48.551
And there we have our poodle tail.

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.941
Straighten your dog up, and you now have

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.421
a beautiful balloon dog.

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.851
To dress your
dog up a little more, What we can do is put

00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.121
its ears down.

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:03.030
To do this you're gonna want to switch
the place of the head and the ears, like so.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.291
Then we're going to fold the ears down,

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.961
and open up them and insert to head into it.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.920
That gives the illusion

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.810
that the dog's ears are sitting down.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.541
Now
we draw a face on with our Sharpie.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.071
And a balloon dog is finished!
