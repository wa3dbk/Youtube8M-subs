[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.330
You might not think that art
and engineering go together,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.760
but in reality, they complement
each other very well.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.010
Many things that engineers
have put together

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.150
could be considered
art, and many things

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.560
that artists have done take
some serious engineering.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.800
But what does engineering have
to benefit from artistic skills

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.750
and thinking like an artist?

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.150
One example you might have
seen in the previous video

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.610
is sketching, an important
way of communicating ideas

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.050
that might be difficult
to do otherwise.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.600
Let's take a look at engineering
through the eyes of someone

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.370
who's trying to
design something.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.459
Let's say you're trying to
design a machine that launches

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.630
a volleyball into the air,
something that could be used

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.280
to help someone practice their
volleyball skills when no one

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.160
else is around.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.150
Now, when you first set
out to design something

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.550
that solves a problem,
a great first step

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.770
is brainstorming by thinking
of a lot of different ways

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.640
to solve that problem.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.490
I have some sketches here
from the brainstorming session

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.720
in video two of this series.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.160
Let's take a closer
look at them.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.320
These sketches better
convey the product idea way

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.460
better than words can do alone.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.100
You see how clear
they are and how

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.564
the idea is conveyed
really quickly

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:39.730
just by taking a quick look?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.350
Something like this doesn't
have to be perfect or take

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.390
a long time either.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.050
This type of
sketching is sometimes

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.015
called ideation sketching.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:52.770
There are a few
basic pointers that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.190
can help you get started
making your own sketches.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.170
So the basic motions
for sketching actually

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.650
come from your entire arm,
not just your hand alone.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.250
So the first kind
of warm up exercise

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.780
that we're going to go through,
the first basic sketching

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.759
technique, is the curved line.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.890
So to do a curved line,
what you want to do

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.620
is hold your wrist
locked, and you kind of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.990
want to pivot your whole
arm about the elbow.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.050
So by using this
pivoting motion,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.760
you can kind of
get a curve shape.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.030
So after you practice the
curved line motion, or the arc,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.650
the next important
sketch move is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.371
going to be the straight line.

00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.870
So for a straight line, you
want to take the motion that you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.660
had before, kind of
take that arc motion,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.354
but you also want to add a
little bit of lateral motion.

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:48.770
And then that way,
you can kind of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.480
get something that
comes out more straight.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.530
So that's how you
get lines like this.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.070
Some things to pay attention to.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.580
If you notice that your lines
are a little bit to wiggly,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.620
you might be going a
little bit too slow.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.710
A lot of this sketching
is really fast, and loose,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.930
and kind of bold,
so you don't want

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.320
to have too many wiggly lines.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.950
OK.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.880
Why don't you practice
straight lines for a while?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.270
The next basic shape
is to do some circles.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.670
The way to do a circle is
you kind of hold your hand

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.430
over the page.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.790
You hold your pen over the page.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.360
And without touching down, you
make a few practice circles.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.140
And then as soon
as you're ready,

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.645
you kind of touch down
and make a circle shape,

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.020
and that's how you can get
something that's pretty round.

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:45.980
Now, you can draw your
circles around a couple

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.130
times to kind of
calibrate, and that's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.305
how you can fine
tune your circles.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.230
So practice these
skills and use them

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.230
as a way to warm up when you're
ready to do some sketching.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.310
And if you practice
these basic shapes,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.110
you'll be better at
putting them together

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.150
to get more complicated
shapes and to build up

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.710
more complicated drawings.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.540
Computer software can be used to
help in different ways as well.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.730
On the technical
side of engineering,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.310
computer aided design
software, or CAD software,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.720
can be used to figure
out the exact dimensions

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.770
of your designs, and also, to
have a precise visual model.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.440
One example shown here is called
SOLIDWORKS a common engineering

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.370
design tool.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.580
This can be an extremely
effective tool for figuring out

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.230
the placement of special
features in your design,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.440
such as holes, and
making sure several parts

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.710
fit together exactly.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.340
There are also tools
that are usually

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.300
associated with art
and graphic design,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.060
such as Adobe Illustrator
and Photoshop,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.620
which are commonly used in
engineering, specifically

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.140
product design.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.860
By using these
tools, one can better

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.910
show others what the
intention of their design is.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.540
This can be useful
for communicating

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.590
to other designers
and engineers,

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.340
as well as to
potential customers

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.300
and users of your product.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.900
A special type of designer,
called an industrial designer,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.960
understands the importance
of visual communication.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.940
An industrial designer
uses knowledge

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.760
of sketching and engineering
to carefully design

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.760
how people interact with
products, how they look,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.720
and how they are used.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.900
Industrial designers specialize
in many of the techniques shown

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.531
in this video.

00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.030
Hopefully, now you're excited
about all the different things

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.040
you can do with your
hands, with a pen,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.290
and maybe with a
computer mouse too.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.090
Keep practicing your
sketching, and you'll

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.990
be a better designer in no time.
