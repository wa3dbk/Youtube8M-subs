Hi guys, it's Angela Kim from The Squishy
Monster dot com and today, I'm going to share

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.869
with you one of my favorite foods it's for
homemade pizza and I don't know what it is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.470
about homemade pizza that just calls to me
maybe it's my infatuation with dough and watching

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.119
it grow or pressing it between my palms or
that fact that if you master this dough you

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.640
can make garlic knots, strombolis, calzones,
breadsticks even or the fact that you can

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.850
customize this and eat it right away and enjoy
a great pizza or pop it into the freezer and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.379
have it whenever the craving hits, this homemade
pizza is just out of this world and I hope

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.869
you guys try it because I feel like most of
life's problems can be answered with pizza.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.559
So if you do enjoy this video, please don't
forget to give it a big thumbs up now let's

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.559
get started.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.460
So here, I just have some warm filtered water
and I'm going to combine it with my yeast.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.490
Now make sure that your yeast is fresh or
else it will not activate your dough.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.520
So just give it a stir and set aside.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.780
In my large bowl I have some unbleached flour.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.439
That just means that it's regular all purpose
but it hasn't been chemically bleached or

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.439
altered.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.219
And I'm going to add to that my sugar and
salt to balance things out and I want to give

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.979
everything a quick whisk.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.780
Now in go my water and yeast, just into that
big bowl there and some grapeseed oil and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.719
you can of course do this with a mixer, it's
much easier but I like the feel of dough in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.869
my hands so I just want to knead it together
and combine it until it collects with itself.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.429
It is almost there, just a couple more kneads.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.640
And as you can see, it is sticky but most
of it clings to itself.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.359
And don't worry, all the details you need
are listed below and at The Squishy Monster

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.619
dot com.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.440
When your dough comes together, you just want
to give your bowl a fine misting of oil and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.049
plop your dough onto the bottom and cover
and allow it to double up in size.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.390
This takes about an hour.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.140
The next part is optional.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.410
But I like to make homemade tomato sauce when
I'm making my own pizza.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.580
So to a heavy bottomed pot, I'm just going
to add in a healthy glug of olive oil, not

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.000
extra virgin.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.100
And then to that, I directly grate in some
garlic and onion.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.270
So with your garlic, make sure you don't get
down to that green sprout if it has it in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.270
there.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.130
That part is really bitter so you just want
to grate until you see that part then discard

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.850
the rest.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.580
Next, I like to rub in some dried oregano.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.560
It really stands up to the long steeping process
of this.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.360
When everything is nicely aromatic and nicely
browned, I like to add in the rest of my ingredients.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.350
So I have some tomato sauce and my pot is
now at low.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.910
It's going to simmer for an hour just until
everything gets to know each other and blends

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.910
nicely.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.250
And to counteract the acidity that tomatoes
can have, just a sprinkle of sugar.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.000
It's not going to make this so sweet, it's
really just going to balance everything.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.280
Then, I like to rub in a little bit of red
pepper flakes.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.580
You can omit this if you don't like spice
but I like the gentle warmth it creates.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.540
Then I have some sweet infused balsamic.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.350
Then tuck in some bay leaves.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.820
Success, I found some parmesan bones.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.510
I just like to tuck that in.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.840
It kind of melts into the sauce creating a
punch of flavor with a salty cheesy bite.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.340
Then a light sprinkle of salt and freshly
cracked black pepper.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.640
Then I'm going to clamp on the lid and allow
it to simmer away.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.320
Here is what your pizza dough looks like after
about an hour.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:07.300
All I'm doing now is flattening my dough onto
a board lined with either silpat or parchment

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.800
so that it doesn't stick.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.630
Now I never conquered the whole hand tossing
it over your head fancy bit so I'm just doing

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.740
what works for me.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.680
This part your don't even need a rolling pin.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.400
You're just merely punching out the extra
air and you're letting it rise a little bit

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400
longer.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.120
Here is what my dough looks like after the
second rise.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.280
It's important to do this since it will develop
the flavors so much more intricately.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.280
I'm just going to roll it out and you can
make it as thin or as thick as you'd like.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.849
It's completely up to you and your personal
preference.

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.300
Then I'm going to par-bake it before I put
on my toppings.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.660
For your pizza, you can use whatever toppings
you like or have.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.900
As for my cheese, I like to use a nice melting
cheese like fontina or mozzarella.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900
So this just par-baked.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.310
If you have a pizza stone, great.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.919
If you don't, don't worry about it.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.620
Now we can dollop on our homemade sauce.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.219
You can really customize this for what kind
of pizza experience you want to have if you

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:12.080
want to go heavy on the sauce or have extra
cheese, if you want to put your toppings under

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080
or over.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:22.940
It's really totally up to you.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.199
Last but no least, before I pop it into the
oven, I'm just brushing the edges of the crust

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:42.669
with some olive oil so it will get nice and
golden brown.
