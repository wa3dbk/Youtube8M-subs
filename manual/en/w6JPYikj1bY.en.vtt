00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.330
This video is an overview of how to operate
your Midmark autoclave.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:16.314
Always refer to the appropriate technical
documentation for the complete list of instructions,

00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:17.314
safety alerts and sequence of procedures before
conducting any service or maintenance operations.

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:18.560
Your autoclave has 4 pre-programmed cycles
and 2 programmable cycles.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.780
The programmed cycles include: Unwrapped,
Pouches, Packs and Handpieces.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.289
Cycle parameters can be found in the Installation
and Operations manual.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.440
After verifying that the autoclave has an
adequate fill of water and has been loaded

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.670
properly with sterilization items, close and
latch the door.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.350
This is done by lifting the door handle and
pushing the door closed.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.510
While pushing in on the door, slide the door
handle down to engage the latch.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.030
The display will show SELECT CYCLE and waits
for input from the operator.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.090
If the "Start" button is pressed, ADDITIONAL
HEAT is shown on the display.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.860
This allows the operator to either pre-heat
the unit or extend the drying time on the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.079
previous cycle.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.269
Pressing the Stop button will end the 'ADDITIONAL
HEAT' time.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.600
After pushing one of the standard cycle program
keys, the display will show two alternating

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.480
screens on the LCD display.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.110
The first screen shows the name of the cycle,
sterilizing temperature and the amount of

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.110
sterilizing time.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.610
After a brief pause, the second screen shows
the type of venting to be used and the amount

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.740
of drying time.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.470
Next, you'll push the Start button.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.200
The display immediately shows the message
FILLING CHAMBER, followed by CHAMBER IS FULL

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.600
when the proper water level is reached.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.180
Now, the unit will begin to heat to the appropriate
temperature for the cycle being used.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.090
The display changes as temperature and pressure
in the chamber changes.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.390
Once the appropriate sterilizing temperature
is reached, the display shows the time countdown

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.600
from the programmed time and monitors the
temperature and pressure.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.430
During sterilization mode, the heater will
cycle on and off.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:13.650
Just prior to the end of the sterilization
cycle, "Ready to Vent" is displayed for 10

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.650
seconds and the vent cycle begins.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.650
The vent valve opens and steam and water is
released back into the reservoir.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.650
The display changes as temperature and pressure
in the chamber changes.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.790
Caution
Keep clear when the M9 or M11 door is ready

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.790
to open!

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.060
Failure to do so could result in severe burns
from steam being released.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.980
An audible signal is emitted to indicate that
the door is about to open.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.319
When pressure in the chamber reaches zero,
the door actuates to a partially open position,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.319
beginning the drying cycle.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.760
The autoclave displays the amount of time
remaining for the drying cycle and counts

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.349
it down to zero.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.879
At the end of this countdown, an audible signal
is emitted for 10 seconds indicating that

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.599
the sterilization cycle is complete.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.430
After sterilization is complete, all items
must be handled in accordance with regulatory

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.620
guidelines.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.129
Caution: The processed load and inner surfaces
will be hot.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.930
Avoid contact with hot surfaces.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.049
Failure to do so could result in serious burns.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.769
Qualified personnel responsible for infection
control should prepare a protocol for handling

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.769
sterilized items.

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.879
This protocol should be followed by all personnel
responsible for handling sterilized items,

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.159
and should
include the basics:

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.890
• Unwrapped sterilization is not recommended
for critical or implantable items.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.159
• Unwrapped items should be transported
immediately and aseptically from sterilizer

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.159
to the point of use.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.649
• Allow items to dry before handling or
storage.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.689
• Wrapped items may be stored before use.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:58.140
• The storage area should be a closed or
covered space, away from environmental contaminates

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140
or wetness.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.140
Remove trays and cassettes using the Midmark
approved Tray/Cassette tool.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.140
Hold the tray level and slightly elevated
to prevent it from shifting and becoming dislodged.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.140

your Autoclave, please refer to the M9/M11

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.140
