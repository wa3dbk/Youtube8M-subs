00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:04.990
I came to El Paso in 1981 from Mexico.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.929
I came here looking at a better life
for my son and myself.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.219
My son wanted to start

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.319
a little business selling candies. 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.829
So we decided to buy an ice cream truck. 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.730
We should have a chance to make a living.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.730
I don't want to be living on food stamps 
or welfare or anything like that.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.610
Street vending has long been an entry point
to business ownership and entrepreneurship

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.820
in America,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.210
but across the country cities like El Paso
are trying to shut down the street vendors

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.700
in order to protect brick and mortar businesses
from honest competition.  --Where I vend I've got loyal

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.110
customers, I've got a good relationship with
them, also, and the only thing that's keeping

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.620
me right now from vending

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.900
is I've got the city running me off.  --El Paso is
now trying to shut down street vendors by making

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.040
it virtually impossible to sell food on city
streets.  A new law prohibits street vendors

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.850
from operating within 1,000 feet of
any restaurant or a convenience store

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.789
or even grocer.  Where in El Paso can you
find a location that isn't within one thousand

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.830
feet of a restaurant or convenient store?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.940
Virtually nowhere.  
-These laws only serve one
Purpose, and that's to protect brick and mortar

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.530
businesses from competition,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.720
but naked protectionism is not a constitutional
exercise of government power.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.380
That's why IJ has sued El Paso in federal court.
This lawsuit will have national implications.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.970
That's because from coast to coast cities
have enacted all sorts of protectionist restrictions

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.189
on vending.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.590
A victory for IJ's clients in El Paso would
be an important first step in eliminating

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.440
these kinds of laws which punish entrepreneurship and hard work.
-And we're not even on welfare or anything.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.380
We work and work and work.
Is it a crime to work,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.140
so I guess I'm a criminal,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.689
it is a crime to be working.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.069
For more on this case which marks the beginning
of IJ's nationwide initiative to vindicate

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.640
the right of street vendors to earn an honest
living
