00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.049
&gt;&gt; In Bupa quest to find a healthier you

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.529
They took head coach for the family

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.869
&gt;&gt; Head coach Melinda Kan

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:10.610
Occupation mum and schoolteacher

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.220
&gt;&gt; And her star player

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.320
&gt;&gt; Star player Denver Kan

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.010
Occupation full-time student

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.050
&gt;&gt; to the Hawthorne headquarters at the Ricoh
Center

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.130
To find out just what it takes

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.089
To support a team of champions

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.829
&gt;&gt; Head fitness coach Andrew "Jack" Russell

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.849
Club dietitian Simone Austin

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.780
Brad Sewell wears number 12 and plays the
mid field

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.540
&gt;&gt; What does a Hawk eat?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.710
&gt;&gt; A Hawk has to eat a really balanced, healthy
diet

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.210
&gt;&gt; In real life hawks eat insects mice and
smaller birds

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.899
What does a magpie taste like?

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.490
&gt;&gt; They don't taste very good at all, they
taste rotten in fact

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.310
&gt;&gt;So Denver, what food do you think a Hawk
should eat?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.050
&gt;&gt; I think they should eat lots of vegetables

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.050
and meat and a little bit of pasta

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.120
&gt;&gt; Simone you are the dietician for the Hawks

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.560
Were Denver's food choices good?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.360
&gt;&gt; Denver made really good food choices

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.570
Meats as long as we make sure that they're
lean

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.130
And then your pasta was another part

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.210
Great as long as we just don't over-eat in
the pasta department+++++

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.210
And then the vegetables

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.690
Something I am always trying to get them to
eat more of

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.160
&gt;&gt; If I want to play AFL, what food is good
for me?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.810
&gt;&gt; We eat a lot of meat for protein to build
muscles up

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.210
A lot of fruit and veggies as well

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.870
&gt;&gt; and actually when you use this app about
looking at sugar and fat

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.960
So you just hold the bare code out

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.830
Press scan

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.479
And then it comes up beautifully

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.280
With a traffic light system

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.780
With green making really good so for "go"

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.770
Orange being amber just watch a bit what you're
doing

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.650
And then if it's got red it means it's not
good in that area, stop and think about what

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.650
you're doing

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.890
&gt;&gt; do you like pizza?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.310
&gt;&gt; some players more than others may eat pizzas,
a bit too regularly

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.310
&gt;&gt; burgers?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.069
&gt;&gt; I do like burgers but again, we need to
be careful not to eat too many of them

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.290
&gt;&gt; we have these skin fold callipers so they
measure the body fat

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.520
So if a player has been having far too much
to eat or not the right food or anything

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.760
then the body fat levels would go up

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
so these don't lie

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.819
&gt;&gt; there are always options

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.310
you just need to think long and hard about
which options you want to eat

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.930
but you always will be able to find something

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.060
&gt;&gt; so take in what we have learned today along
with the Bupa Healthier You Tool Kit

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.400
You too can support your own team of champions
