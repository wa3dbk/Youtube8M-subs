take me away they put me in jail for
about six hours and then after lather

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.480
coat doing incorrectly

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.549
yes no whether we're going to life in
such circumstances instant

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.970
sonya

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.640
and let me off

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.440
corn stalks interest you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.870
precipitator

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.670
uh... since there is that i thought to
mount the all basically said

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.320
you're screwed

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.780
you have a certain time before they're
gonna

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.080
even if you're going to the courts are
going to support you because you have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.820
anything

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.170
i mean and have you know

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.930
is in the wife and kids and i think
that's a pretty much still considered

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.560
they told me that best option is to
irangate the prices as much as possible

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.489
that's really interesting so in his case
remaining in arizona for some reason

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.209
saved him from being deported which our
guest every individual case is different

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.669
but i would

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.760
think the exact opposite but when i got
from that video is we really need to jv

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.659
change the way we do things with
undocumented immigrants in this country

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.599
immigration reform is obviously a huge
issue but when it comes to

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.220
young kids who have been snuggles in
this country

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.580
and they spent years of their lives here
in the united states they went to high

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.530
school here payout works here they've
actually contribute to society here they

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.819
should have the ability to gain
citizenship and be able to go

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.250
universities git get higher education

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.939
with all the without all this drama it's
rediculous that

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.969
and the day of his high school
graduation or the day before i believe

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:50.690
is that

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.309
ice shows up at his door

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.129
we need to pass the federal dream act
there's no question about it okay he

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.909
didn't knowingly crossed the border he'd
unknowingly do something illegal

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.299
it's something that

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.059
happened unfortunately in his life when
he was extremely young

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.290
and he was in the university earlier in
that video

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.940
uh... he talks about how he studied like
crazy because you want to go to stanford

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.560
so you know isn't over achiever he
participate in all these clubs he did

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.639
really great in advanced placement
classes

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.439
hesione and avoid the stafford probably
because it costs so much money right

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:27.900
he's not gonna be able to get any
federal student aid because of the fact

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.569
that he is an undocumented immigrant

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.519
so we had to settle for com

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.260
grand canyon university of arizona which
i'm sure is a lovely institution but

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.010
it's unfair that his legal status

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.979
is gonna take take the rest of his life
and don't get me wrong i'm not in favor

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.089
of people crossing the border illegally
but in this case there are exceptions to

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:48.119
every role

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.229
he was one of those in this country when
is he was eight years old he didn't

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.919
knowingly do something illegal he went
to high school here he has contributed

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.689
to society he wants to continue
contributing to society so we need to

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.529
pass a federal jury night at least
that's my take on it and when you hear

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.559
from you guys though because we have
received a lot of

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.459
prone tree knocked videos and i one
person arguments against it so if you

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.129
have any arguments against that

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.659
by all means please send us your videos
all you do is go to upload dot the young

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.599
turks dot com

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.930
you create a username and password and
then upload a video she'll minutes or

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.759
less paid try not to go over to me that
that's a little too long we can't use it

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.610
on the show

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.570
as they try to keep it short
