00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.150
Hi everybody. It's Doctor Shawn Talbott. And 
welcome to another addition of "From the lab."

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.270
And as you can see again this week we're 
not exactly in the lab, are we?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.350
This week I have been in the rain forest in Brazil. 
And it has been an amazing few days

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.370
of going down rivers that 
were absolutely gigantic.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.370
It looked like you were in the ocean. You 
could barely see to one side or the other.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.490
It was just absolutely vast.
 And then in regular sized rivers, 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.570
 And then little 
tiny channels,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.600
through the trees. 
That aren't even there in the dry season.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.620
So, we got to see tons of different things. 
We got to see all of the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.730
flora and fauna of 
the rain forest.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.800
We got to see monkeys and birds and
 all kinds of creatures.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.820
You'll probably hear a lot of the squawking 
in the jungle here as I talk to you.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.930
But what I was here for was to look for new fruits 
and seeds and nuts and plants that we can use

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.940
in some of our MonaVie products. 
Part of my role at Monavie

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.080
is to be scouring the world. 
Looking for the exotic fruits

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.100
and the exotic natural ingredients that we 
can use in our existing products

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.130
as well as some future products. 
So, we had the good fortune of being invited in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.250
to one of the locals, 
to his house. 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.320
To actually see his family, see how they live. 
Visit their little small plantation. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.340
So, we were lucky to have 
some of their manioc root.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.450
Which we would 
know as cassava.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.500
Or tapioca. And you can use 
that grain as a flower

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.660
to make little 
tapioca pancakes.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.760
Or they make what is kind of like oatmeal. 
A little carbohydrate food

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
that you can use for lots of 
different calorie needs.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.910
They mix it with things. They make bread out of it. 
They make these little pancakes out of it.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.970
So we were able to enjoy some of that. 
We were able to drink cupuacu juice.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.000
Which is delicious. 
It's in the MonaVie product.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.020
So, you're getting a taste of that. It's a very sweet 
juice. It tastes almost like a cross between

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.080
grapefruit juice and pineapple juice. 
It's very delicious. And of course, 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.180
we got to taste some of their acai. We were 
able to climb up some of the acai trees

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.260
that this gentleman had on 
his little plantation.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300
And these are literally subsistence farmers. 
We had to travel down large rivers,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.430
small rivers, tiny little channels through the 
trees, to get to his piece of land.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.510
But it was the most beautiful, 
idyllic spot.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.530
Looking out over the water. 
Acai palms growing here.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.660
Manioc roots growing there. 
Cupuacu trees growing there.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.720
Lots of things I didn't even know 
what they were. We had to talk.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.730
And we got some ideas of some ingredients 
we can use in some future MonaVie products.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.810
But they were the most gracious hosts. 
I gave him a bottle of MonaVie Max.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.830
And presented it to him. They were so appreciative 
they insisted that we drink some of their acai.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.950
And of course, this was just pure acai 
juice right off of the trees.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.950
They went and they took 
it out of a cooler.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.970
We all shared some.
 It wasn't sweetened.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.990
It was just the most beautiful flavor right off 
of the tree. And, of course, you can get that

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.040
if you're growing the trees ten yards away from 
your home. But we can't get that when we're 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.180
shipping acai around the world. 
So what we do with this little fruit,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.270
these little plants. They actually break 
down very quickly once you pick them,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.300
once you take them off the tree. So they 
need to be processed in just the right way. 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.430
That's why, in our MonaVie products, you'll 
see that we use a version of acai

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.500
that we call acavie. Now this is 
our way of processing,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.520
as soon as these berries come 
off the tree, we process them.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.630
And we do that so that we freeze dry them. 
So we have a freeze dried version.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.650
We have a pulp version. 
We have a concentrated juice version.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.790
And we do that so we
 get the best

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.900
of each of those fractions. We want certain 
fidonutrients in each of those fractions. 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.940
We want to maintain the healthy 
fatty acids. The oleic acid,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.070
so that we get those healthy fats. We want to 
maintain as much of the goodness as we can.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.150
So that when we put this acai into our products 
and ship it around the world,

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.170
it is as potent and as 
health-promoting as possible.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.290
So, that's why, when you get 
acai from MonaVie

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.360
it's not the same acai that you see 
at the grocery store. 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.370
It's not the same acai that you can get other 
places. It's really is a very unique combination 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.460
of the best that this berry has to offer. 
And then we combine it

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.500
with those other fruits and 
those other vegetables.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.650
So that you get the entire anti-oxidants network. 
To protect your body in all of those different ways

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.740
that we've talked about before on 
other additions of "From the lab."

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.770
So, as I mentioned, we're in Brazil 
this week. Next month Malaysia,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.900
 doing exactly the same thing. Scouring the 
world for different fruits and berries

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.970
and nuts and natural products 
that we can put in our products.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.980
We were in Peru last month. We'll tell you about 
that in a future addition of "From the lab."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.080
And, of course, last week we were in Hawaii. 
Looking at how they do sustainability so well.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.130
And what we can learn from that culture 
and apply to our products.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.260
So, I'll leave it there. I'll share with you 
some images of our trip on the blog.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.350
Of our trip to Brazil. I'll share 
that on the blog site.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.380
And give you a little bit more insight. 
But tune into other additions of

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.500
"From the lab." Make sure that you are 
checking out the science tab

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.570
on MonaVie.com for updates.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.580
We have the experimental biology scientific 
conference is coming up next week. 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.680
We have a couple of presentations there that 
I'm sure you'll be interested to listen to 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.820
on future additions of "From the lab." 
This is Doctor Shawn Talbott. 
Thanks for watching. Bye bye.
