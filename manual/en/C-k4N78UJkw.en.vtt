00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.580
LUNGS

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.380
What's something that you do

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.760
all day every day

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.380
no matter where you are

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.700
or who you're with?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.820
Breathing air is necessary for

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.420
keeping humans alive.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.220
What are the two paths

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.880
that are large and in charge

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460
when it comes to breathing?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.600
If you have guessed your lungs, you're right.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.700
Our lungs make up

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.880
one of the largest

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.160
organs in our body.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.040
And they work with

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.600
our respiratory system

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.440
to allow us

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.040
to take in fresh air

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.260
and get rid of stale air.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.580
And even talk.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
Let's take a tour of the lungs.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.620
We have to breathe all the time

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.180
in order to supply our bodies with oxygen

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.220
and get rid of carbon dioxide.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.720
We use our lungs to do this.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.340
Air from our mouth and nose

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.160
enter the windpipe

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.320
which go down the throat, into the chest,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.300
when it splits into two passages,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420
one for each lung.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.580
Oxygen helps ourselves

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460
get their energy from food.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.740
They would die within minutes

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.140
if you stopped breathing.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.440
Trees help clean the air

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.160
by filtering out pollution.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.980
They also make oxygen

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.100
which they release

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.320
through their leaves.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.100
Breathing heavily

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.180
gives your body

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.120
extra oxygen

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.740
so it can work harder.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.160
You feel puffed out

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.500
and pant when your lungs

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.520
can't supply your body

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.720
with oxygen quickly enough.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.960
People can spend a few

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.140
moments underwater

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.120
without breathing.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.960
Most people can manage

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.140
about a minute.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.760
But the world record

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.920
is about 17 minutes.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.080
Have you noticed

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.200
that when you breathe

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.740
onto a window or a mirror

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.060
that becomes wet?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.660
That's because the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.980
air that you breathe out

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.400
is slightly back.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.820
Exercise is good for every

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.120
part of your body

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.320
especially for your

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.800
lungs and heart.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.680
Your lungs are full of tunnels

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.000
ending in tiny

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
air sacs called Alveoli.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.400
Here oxygen from the air

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.100
passes into your blood.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.540
Your blood carries

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.720
oxygen around

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.220
every part of your body.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.800
Believe it or not.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.220
You take about 23,000 breaths each day.
