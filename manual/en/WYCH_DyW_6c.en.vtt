00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.976
- [Interviewer] Bassem Youssef,
welcome to UC Berkeley.

00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:05.897
Can you describe how you went
from being a cardiologist

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:08.461
to starting a satirical TV show?

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.494
- When the revolution came,

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:13.881
everybody found himself so involved

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:17.570
in a way that it was never seen before.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.195
So I was not exceptionally outspoken.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:23.021
I was a normal guy, living
in a normal community,

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:26.299
and then the revolution
rattled so many people's cages.

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:29.137
And it just changed so many people's lives

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:32.479
and so many people's perspectives.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.289
I mean, I'll give you something
that might sound trivial,

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.555
but for example, with
our Facebook statuses,

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:43.432
we would always--if you were
from a certain educated level--

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:46.483
you would write your statuses in English.

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:49.167
After the revolution, we all
turned it to writing in Arabic

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:50.280
because now we were talking about

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.232
what's happening in our country.

00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:57.073
- So, you started this show
called The Program in Arabic.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:58.415
What was your purpose?

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:02.510
- The purpose was giving
high-quality entertainment

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.389
to people about issues that we care about.

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:11.595
And given the very very
politically-infused environment,

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:13.349
it was mostly politics.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.364
And because we wanted to
be humorous, it was satire.

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:17.530
So it was political satire.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.992
And of course I had that dream

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:22.346
of replicating the Jon Stewart experience.

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:25.001
So that was the purpose.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.340
But also the purpose has changed

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.183
as we continue to do the program

00:01:31.183 --> 00:01:33.766
because suddenly people kind of

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.508
looked up to us

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:39.066
in a way that we did not asked for.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.487
And, I think, this is partly
because they have seen other

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:45.641
people--serious political people--fail,

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:48.571
so people reverted to satire.

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.154
Which is, you know,

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.736
which is, number one, weird,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:55.390
number two, it puts a
lot of pressure on us.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.353
So, we were almost put in a
position by our supporters

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:02.825
to be their voices, and by our
enemies, as being a target.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:05.853
One of my episodes said, the
end of this program will be

00:02:05.853 --> 00:02:09.894
because you're putting too
much hope and too much weight

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.089
on the role of the program.

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.610
We are not required to
tell you what to do,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.607
and we are not required
to lead you in what to do.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:18.711
We are not demigods.

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:21.534
We're just saying our
opinion in a different way.

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:23.726
And don't hold us responsible

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.830
for whatever happens in the country.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.101
- Why take the risk of producing

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.954
such a politically irreverent program?

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:31.559
- The risk came to us.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.275
And when the stakes was

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.882
getting higher and higher and higher,

00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:39.636
we decided that it's a wise decision

00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:41.746
to stop taking the risk.

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:43.079
And this is why.

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:50.141
I always tell people, hey
I'm not a Nelson Mandela

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:51.844
and I don't want to be.

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:53.258
It's not my role.

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:56.125
So, at a certain point, you
had really to stop and think

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.751
about the safety of your
family and yourself.

00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.416
- There's so much turmoil
in Egypt right now.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:02.648
What are your hopes for your country?

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:07.107
- Anybody who likes his country
hopes that it will be stable

00:03:07.107 --> 00:03:08.940
but not falsely stable

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.513
because there's stability.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:15.690
There are some of the
biggest dictator countries

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.993
in the world that are stable.

00:03:17.993 --> 00:03:19.826
But what is stability?

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.173
Because there is a certain
kind of stability that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.154
you live in a bubble and you
think everything is stable

00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:29.398
until it bursts and then you think,

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:32.399
oh my god, that's not stable at all.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.649
And I think a co-existence,

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.447
co-existence is a big word.

00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:41.363
And diversity is another big word.

00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:42.446
And these two

00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.994
targets or hopes or values should be,

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:53.529
I think that's the
solution of so many things,

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:54.638
so many problems.

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:56.585
- You're here as part of
our commemoration of the

00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:58.912
free speech movement on campus.

00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:01.299
Did its legacy have an impact on you?

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.714
- It's amazing what actually happened here

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:04.491
in Berkeley 50 years ago.

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:07.345
And I've always been a
big fan about that era,

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:08.803
about the Civil Rights Movements,

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.243
and about what happened

00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:12.071
because I think maybe we needs

00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:16.233
in our region is Civil
Rights Movements of our own.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:19.585
And to actually stand here
and to be in the same spot

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:21.918
that actually it originated,

00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:25.495
it's an honor to be here.

00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:27.512
It's an amazing, amazing place to be.

00:04:27.512 --> 00:04:29.717
- Having gone through college yourself

00:04:29.717 --> 00:04:32.596
and then having gone on
to two careers so far,

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:35.556
as a cardiologist and a TV personality,

00:04:35.556 --> 00:04:38.482
is there any advice you
can offer to our students?

00:04:38.482 --> 00:04:41.101
- I don't think that your
life choices are limited

00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:42.906
to your college life.

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:45.323
As a matter of fact,
that's a lot of pressure

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:48.367
to put on people who
are 18 and 19 years old.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:50.533
Just like, okay, you have
to decide something now

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.946
that will affect you to
the rest of your life.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:55.989
Which I did, that deciding
that I want to be a doctor.

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:59.086
So after seven years of medicine,

00:04:59.086 --> 00:05:01.910
and 13 years of practice later,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.621
after 20 years of total studying
and practicing medicine,

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:07.699
I change my life into media.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.001
We like to set our path or goals in tracks

00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:12.944
but there's so many
things, so much happening

00:05:12.944 --> 00:05:14.653
outside the tracks.

00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:17.672
And I think people who have
made it in this world are people

00:05:17.672 --> 00:05:21.684
who actually got off the
tracks at certain points.

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:24.021
So, tracks are good

00:05:24.021 --> 00:05:26.188
but look out for the exits

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.402
and the diversions because
actually it's good.

00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:34.202
I'm an old guy, 40 years old,
telling people what to do.

00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:37.020
Alright, you know, do whatever you want.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.308
- What's next?

00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:39.766
- What's next for me...

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:41.479
Maybe I'll just come here

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.868
and make a startup in Silicon
Valley about nutrition

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:48.285
because I'm a big, avid vegan person new.

00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.404
I used to be a trash bin
of every single junk food

00:05:53.404 --> 00:05:55.493
you ever think about a year ago,

00:05:55.493 --> 00:05:57.812
with a huge, horrible eater.

00:05:57.812 --> 00:06:00.134
Now I've been vegan for one year now.

00:06:00.134 --> 00:06:02.251
I do triathlons and half-marathons.

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:04.987
I'm running next Sunday's
half-marathon in San Francisco.

00:06:04.987 --> 00:06:07.487
People tell me I look younger.
