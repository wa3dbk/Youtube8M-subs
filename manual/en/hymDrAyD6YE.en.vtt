00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.120
Hi, I'm Brigitte

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.290
from skis.com. This is Slope Style. I'm here with Lisa today from

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.450
Obermeyer and we're here to talk about the Obermeyer Charger

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.560
men's jacket. Now this is a premium jacket.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.660
It's very, more of your higher end coats. So, what makes it

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.680
premium?
Yes it is. This is from our men's Velocity Line.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.830
This is one of our most technical pieces in our men's line.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
It is our Genesis Stretch Fabric which is a stretch fabric. It does have a 4-way

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.000
stretch to it. It's also 20,000mm waterproof which is as

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.140
waterproof as we make. It's as highly waterproof as you can get.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.250
You wonder how they do that, make it so stretchy and that waterproof as well.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.320
I don't know.
It's just something I'm like, how do you do that? That's just amazing.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.380
Well the actual fabric is different from the waterproofing. The waterproofing is a laminate that's laminated

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.520
to the underside of the fabric so we can control how waterproof we make

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.610
each fabric.
So, what about the breathability of the coat?
It's still

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.690
at the 20,000 for breathability as well because it's a laminate.
Okay.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.850
And on the inside of the coat, what are some of the features

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.970
that you could point out?
One of our biggest features of this one is we use our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.070
Cocona. Cocona is a lining...
Oh, that sounds fancy.
It's made out of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.140
coconuts of all things but it's highly, highly breathable and it

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.280
dries really, really quickly. They use is in a lot of different applications but 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.400
we like to use it on the inside of our jacket where we feel that breathability and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.480
drying quickly is where you need it most.
So many different weather conditions

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.550
that it will acclimate to those.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
And what 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.670
about the other stuff that's on the inside of the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.760
coat?
Well this has a cell phone pocket, a goggle pocket with a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.840
shammy that's removable so you can clean you glasses or your goggles.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.040
All these jacket come equipped with Recco as well so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.170
if...
What does that mean?
It's an avalanche finder so if you're caught in an

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.260
avalanche, you can, they can find you easier. I guess that's the best way

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.340
to put it.
And, tell me about this. What's this sitting here for?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.510
Well, this is a little neck gaitor that comes in each jacket. It's actually

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.640
in the back of the jacket behind the neck and it's just a free little neck

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.730
gaitor so that you always have it with you, if you need it, if you come across some bad weather.
That's different. You don't 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.760
see that often.
You don't. And it's all machine-washable so you can throw it in the washing machine.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920
Cool and it, tell me who this jacket really is for.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.030
This is for your technical skier who is looking for the best of both

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.120
worlds. They want a lot of your technical features - your waterproof, your windproof, your

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.180
breathability, your lightweight, your comfort feel, your techie look

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.310
but at this price point, it's a great bang for the buck.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.600
And, I didn't get to how it fits. Is it a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.670
baggy fit? Is it slim?
No, this is a technical fit so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.730
it's not a real baggy fit. It's for the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.890
man looking for an alpine looking jacket and more of a 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.020
racer look to it.
Good. Well, thank you, Lisa, for explaining the Charger

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.140
Jacket. This is Slope Style and thanks for watching.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.180
 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.845
