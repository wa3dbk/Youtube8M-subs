00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Action Ben!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, just what is it that makes life at the University of Huddersfield so satisfying?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Based within historic mill buildings and rolling green hillsides...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
"Hold it Ben."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Dramatic music starts)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Loud zap)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Creatures of base matter. Submit immediately and without question to your new Galactic Masters!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That is an amazing PA!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
(Zap)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
(Mobile phone rings)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Hello?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.000
Helen in Applied Sciences has analysed samples from the probe, and it appears to have an organic component with some... interesting anomalies in the DNA,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.000
which could have implications if we assume that the DNA found in their organic probe technology is in anyway similar to the DNA found in them.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.000
So i've asked Fiona...

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
What? Keyboard Fiona?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Yeah

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.200
to create a sound file...

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.500
(Fiona continues) 
that will resonate in a way that disturbs the sequencing of their atomic structure.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.500
Really?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
The most elemental state of vibration in the universe, is sound

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
and DNA has been found to respond to vibrations of exactly the right frequency.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
So, if every cell in the universe absorbs and emits sound...

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
then some frequencies repair...

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
and others disrupt.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
So, Saqab has managed to cobble this together for us.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Thanks Saqab!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.300
You're welcome.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
This should carry the sound to the ship, and project it through what we reckon

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.500
is a titanium metal alloy with a poly-carbide coating that appears to be partly holographic in nature.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.750
I love a hologram!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Everyone loves a hologram!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Dramatic music)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Music stops)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.500
(Voice from ship) 
Impressive!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We've cleary underestimated you.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500
So, how about it? Is that enough for today then?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.000
Just we've all got stuff to be doing...so?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.000
(Voice from ship)
Yes, you've passed the test.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.500
What test?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.000
(Voice from ship)
This is a seat of learning worthy of the Annunaki.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.000
A seat of learning?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.000
(Voice from ship)
A seat of learning.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Wait, you want to come here as students?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You know we do have an open day? It's really well organised...we've got like, brochures and everything.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000
(Voice from ship)
Yes, could you email us a prospectus?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yeah...

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Voice from ship)
All right then, see you at freshers.
Thanks for your time everyone, bye!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
(Ships engines start)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Action Ben!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, just what is it that makes life at the University of Huddersfield so satisfying?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
Based within the historic mill buildings and rolling green hillsides...

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Screeching in background)

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.000
Sorry, we're going to have to cut there. There's a giant tentacled bat, hovering in the air above the library...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
(Cameraman)
Wow! It's dribbling radio-active slime and shooting fire out of it's nipples!

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.000
Indeed it is...yeah.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.500
How about that?!
