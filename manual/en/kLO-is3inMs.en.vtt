00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.440
What's going on everybody! Welcome back to
another episode of..

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.440
What the? Oh No...

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.949
Captain Willakers, Sir. What are we gonna do?

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.369
The men can hear her cries. She's coming for us!
Old Man

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.150
Deadbones help!
That's all I am aren't I?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.470
Deadbones help!
Just an old, old man.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.119
Old man! Answer Me!
Pause yourself boy and listen!

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.350
We don't need to do anything.
For no amount of time will change our fate.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.570
And no amount of planning will control our
destiny.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.270
There will be no stories told of us.
There will be no songs of our victory.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.899
No one will know our names
No one will remember our faces

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.899
So If your looking for a way out,
if your looking for an escape,

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.809
a way to see another sun rise,
a path to look at another day,

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.809
you shall not find one here.
For the only thing left for us is death.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.040
So run to the hills, go hide in the caves.
Live your lives in fear of never knowing when

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.180
the demons shall come if you must. For I know
my death and I have seen my own demise.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.259
It will be right here, guarding this Dwarven
shrine.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.030
I shall stand in the mother flame
I shall feel the princes cold breath

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.399
I shall pierce the demons fog, I shall endure
the widows storm

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.360
and oh yes... I shall FIGHT the god of death
For when my strength runs out and I can no

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.130
longer fight.
I will know that death did not chose me. I

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.360
CHOSE THIS NIGHT

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.649
So get a sword, and armor up, find a bow and
grab a pot.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.780
For cowardice and fear are in us no more.
We have always been and will always be. The

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.930
ones whom they call Dwarves.
