00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
Was I distracted because of the dress?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
And?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.811
Had he prayed in sincere 
instead of attempting robbery,

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.712
his father might have survived.

00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:10.216
I taught him some lessons and let him go.

00:00:10.216 --> 00:00:12.118
But still, 
you should have called the police.

00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:17.290
I couldn’t hand him over to the police when he’s wailing for his father’s death.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.261
Also, he’ll be a father soon.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.395
What if he comes again?

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:28.234
He won’t. I’ve reasoned him nicely.

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:33.271
If he returns evil for good, 
he’ll be a helpless trash.

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:35.842
He looked like a good man, though.

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.878
I’m sorry to hear that.

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:41.814
Thank God that I was bold enough.

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:46.774
Joe was tied and so scared, 
doing nothing but shivering.

00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:52.792
You are really something. 
How could you be that bold?

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:56.329
They say we can survive 
even in a tiger’s den, if we have will.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.434
That’s so true. Keep it in your mind.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:02.902
Ok.

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:05.972
You don’t need any sedative?

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:09.108
Come on, I don’t need any medicine.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:14.647
Joe took tranquillizer, though.

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:18.851
I need to go prepare a dinner.

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:26.659
I do the meal, and Joes do the dishes.

00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.638
You! Where were you 
without finishing dishwashing?

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.576
Why should I? And where were you?

00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:45.678
You’re supposed to do the dishes, 
aren’t you?

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:49.749
Those are not my dishes. 
I ordered the food, remember?

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:54.387
Are you that eager to preserve 
your mortal body?

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:59.792
I’m not. I just have a pain in my wrist.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:03.729
Your muscle’s weakened 
because you rarely use it.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.999
Gosh, something bugs my ear.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.002
Act up to your age! 

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:23.449
Mister.

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:24.291
Yes.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.291
Is that a real autography of Woobin?

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.790
Yes. He stopped by here the other day.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.360
Why didn’t you take a picture with him?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.562
I was not here.

00:02:37.463 --> 00:02:42.235
Can I have a bottle of soju?

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:43.970
I can’t sell alcohol to a minor.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.439
I’m not a student in uniform.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.207
What troubles you?

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:53.179
Mister, have you ever loved someone?

00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:56.115
You wanna die?

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.219
Their ramen tastes terrific.

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:01.187
Hi, long time no see.

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:01.821
Hi.

00:03:01.821 --> 00:03:03.289
Have a seat.

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.724
Three ramens please.

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.926
Sorry, ramens are all sold out.

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:09.695
I told you. We should have come earlier.

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:12.899
Hey, come here.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:14.600
Why?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.670
Just come, or you wanna hit?

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:25.291
Give me a cigarette if you have.

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.413
We don’t.

00:03:27.413 --> 00:03:30.616
You sure?

00:03:30.616 --> 00:03:31.617
Yes.

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:33.953
We don’t smoke.

00:03:33.953 --> 00:03:36.522
Of course you don’t.

00:03:36.522 --> 00:03:38.124
Darn freaks.

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.792
Can we go?

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:40.893
Yeah.

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.838
You can’t disturb my business.

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:55.007
Did I?

00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.246
Actually, I’m not myself.

00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.271
Not for me.

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.603
You’re not gonna eat?

00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:25.304
I’m not gonna eat rice.

00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:27.773
Then you’re gonna skip a meal?

00:04:58.304 --> 00:05:00.540
This is my dinner.

00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:24.397
You want some?

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:30.670
No. Go in somewhere and eat.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.139
Why?

00:05:33.573 --> 00:05:39.112
I might wield this at you.

00:05:39.112 --> 00:05:42.840
With that rice paddle? Come on.

00:05:49.388 --> 00:05:55.361
My supervisor complained about women at 24 hour fitness.

00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.395
Why?

00:05:56.395 --> 00:06:01.834
Because they fart on treadmills 
without shame,

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:06.639
and it smells horrible.

00:06:15.181 --> 00:06:17.583
What is it?

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:22.288
The story Ruby told me a while ago…

00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:24.323
Like what?

00:06:25.124 --> 00:06:28.294
Be careful when you fart.

00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:29.962
I don’t fart that much.

00:06:29.962 --> 00:06:33.065
Give me a break. 
I heard you several times.

00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:42.041
You don’t eat sour food, do you?

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.022
You’re not gonna do the dishes again, 
are you?

00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:57.623
No, I’m not.

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:02.061
Zealous for food, but lazy with work.

00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:08.100
Life is short. 
I can live doing whatever I like.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.205
You like working, so work hard. 
I’m not gonna stop you.

00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:16.175
Who on earth like working?

00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:19.779
We take efforts to live 
in a neat environment.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.748
Your fastidiousness attracts 
few blessings.

00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:25.051
It’s like fishes cannot live in clean water.

00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:31.357
Then why do you live like this, 
with all the supposed blessings?

00:07:31.357 --> 00:07:35.121
I just like a relaxed life.

00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:40.700
You may feel relaxed but some people around you suffer inside.

00:07:41.634 --> 00:07:51.544
Try to relax, 
and your face will look rosy like mine.

00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:55.381
What rosy face…
