00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.770
Hi! Welcome to 'Lachlan Likes a Thing', a
show where I take a thing and see whether

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.910
or not I like it. Now, the thing we're looking
at in this video is the Sennheiser Momentum

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.679
On-Ear portable headphones.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.040
Now, firstly, I want to thank Sennheiser for
giving me a pair of these headphones to have

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.360
a listen to. If you've been watching my videos
from the beginning, you'll know that the Sennheiser

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.640
Momentum was the very first headphone that
I looked at on my channel, and in that video

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.700
I absolutely gushed over them, I thought that
the Sennheiser Momentum was an amazing combination

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.070
of build quality and comfort and sound, and,
even though I've looked at a number of great

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.000
portable headphones since then, I still think
that the Sennheiser Momentum is one of the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.210
best overall packages that you can get in
terms of a portable headphone.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.550
And since that video I've also gotten a pair
of Sennheiser Amperiors, which I'm a huge

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.550
fan of as well. So, when Sennheiser announced
the Sennheiser Momentum On-Ear, which is the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
on-ear version of the Sennheiser Momentum,
I was really kind of exited, because I wanted

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.790
to know whether they could get, basically,
the same great qualities of the Sennheiser

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.940
Momentum but in an even more portable package.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.850
So here's the Momentum On-Ear and here's the
classic full-sized Momentum. As you can see,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.210
one is pretty much a smaller version of the
other. The only thing that's really changed

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.659
is just the size of the ear-cups, not even
the headband is really just changed much in

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.530
size, though there are a number of differences
with the Momentum On-Ear that are worth pointing

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.830
out.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.900
Number one, the Momentum On-Ear has gone down
in weight now, from 190 grams on the standard

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.900
Momentum to 160 grams, so it's even more lightweight
now. In terms of colors, the Momentum On-Ear

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.560
comes in four different colors, none of which
are black, so you get this ivory colour, but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.350
also there's a blue, there's a green and a
pink.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.659
The ear-pads are now a synthetic suede material
instead of leather, and this synthetic suede

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.500
is called Alcantara. Now I just found this
material a really soft, it's really quite

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.450
nice to the touch, and they're still quite
breathable, so the Momentum On-Ear is still

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.499
a very comfortable headphone. The headband
is also slightly different in texture, though

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.569
I don't know if this is also Alcantara.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.939
The other thing is that the Sennheiser Logo
is now slightly holographic in effect, if

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.120
you can see that. Personally I would have
preferred just the standard chrome logo, but

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.209
some people might like the kind of holographic
effect.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.709
One more thing is that the cable is still
detachable like it is on the classic Momentum,

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.709
you get the iPhone remote as wall as a standard
non-remote cable, but with the headphone jack

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.579
on the other end you just get a standard ninety
degree jack, none of the kind of fancy variable-angle

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.230
jack that you found on the Sennheiser Momentum.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.730
Overall, though, this is pretty much the same
headphone as the Sennheiser Momentum in terms

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.209
of build, and that's not a bad thing because
the Sennheiser Momentum is built brilliantly,

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.969
and the Momentum On-Ear preserves all the
qualities, it still has that really nice metal

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.510
construction, it feels really solid, really
premium-feeling headphone.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.870
So a nice touch with the Momentum On-Ear is
that you get different two carrying cases,

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.779
you get a standard kind of hard case that's
going to protect your headphones, and you

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:32.260
also get a carrying bag in case you want to
just be more lightweight, and this will just

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
stop it from getting scratches, so that's
pretty cool.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.480
In terms of comfort, the Momentum On-Ear is
remarkably comfortable for an on-ear headphone.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.669
As I said, it's quite lightweight, it doesn't
press very hard against the ears, and comfort

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.569
is pretty much the best I've felt from an
on-ear headphone except for the Audio Technica

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.889
ES88, though it is still an on-ear headphone
so it does still press against the ears, it

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.900
might still make your ears sore after a coulee
of hours.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.999
So if comfort's a top priority I'd probably
recommend the full-size Momentum. Noise isolation

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.469
is pretty much average for an on-ear headphone,
so, you know, it's going to block out some

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.059
external noise, though it's not going to be
quite as good as something that just cups

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:20.059
around your entire ear. But overall, as a
package, I think the Momentum is quite well-designed,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.290
but how does it sound?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.600
So, if you watched my early impressions video
of the Momentum On-Ear, you'll know that my

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.080
friends and I had some mixed feelings about
the sound of this headphone, and you might

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.340
be wondering, in the weeks since then, have
my opinions changed? Well, unfortunately they

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.970
haven't.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.480
So first of all, the Momentum On-Ear doesn't
really sound much like the full-sized Momentum.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.100
Whereas the full-sized Momentum is kind of
a warm, mellow, kind of laid-back easy listening

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.100
kind of headphone, the Momentum On-Ear is
a much more aggressive, V-shaped kind of sound,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.170
and what I mean about 'V-shaped' is that on
the spectrum of sound, the bass is relatively

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.760
emphasized, so all the drums and, kind of,
the bass notes, and the treble, the strings

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.570
particularly, kind of high-pitched sounds
are quite emphasized, and in the middle there's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:20.570
kind of a dip, so that vocals, kind of the
body of your singing, is relatively distant.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.100
It can sound quite recessed on the Momentum
On-Ear.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.800
Now, ordinarily, there's nothing necessarily
wrong with a V-shaped in and of itself, a

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.150
lot of people like them, I don't mind them,
I think that they can be quite lively and

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.590
exiting to listen to. The thing with the Momentum
On-Ear, unfortunately, is that the bass on

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.570
the Momentum On-Ear is so emphasized to the
point where it has a slightly loose quality

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.410
to it, it almost takes on a kind of droning
note if you're listening to a song with a

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.310
lot of bass notes.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.190
Now if you're listening to, you know something
that doesn't have that much bass, the Momentum

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.870
On-Ear is a quite a nice listen, it's quite
articulate, it's quite clean, it's got quite

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.860
a nice soundstage, maybe slightly even wider
than the standard Momentum just because the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.430
treble is relatively a bit more emphasized,
but as soon as, like a throbbing kind of bass

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.840
note kicks in, it really kicks in on the On-Ear,
and it honestly gets a little distracting.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.500
Now, I've said it before and I'll say it again,
I don't mind my bass, I own a number of really

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.740
bassy headphones that I quite like, I love
the Sennheiser Amperior, I love the Audio

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.740
Technica ES10, and recently I got a pair of
the V-Moda M80s, which I think are a really

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.550
nice, warm kind of bassy on-ear headphone.
The thing with the Momentum On-Ear's bass

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.430
is that unfortunately I just don't think it
sounds very natural, It doesn't sound very

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.980
well integrated into the rest of the spectrum,
and it really calls attention to itself.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.240
Now, I don't know, maybe you might like this
kind of really aggressive bass tone, and,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.200
by all means, if it sounds like something
you might like, go ahead and check it out

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.000
in the store and have a listen because this
should be relatively easy to find. I don't

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.510
think this is a technically bad headphone,
and I've read a number of comments from people

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.570
who do quite like the sound of it, so I guess
this is something that you might want to have

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.770
a listen to, just to make up your own mind.
Personally, it's just not my cup of tea.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.270
