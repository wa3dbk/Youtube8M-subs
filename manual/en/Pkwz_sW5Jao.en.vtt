00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.579
Coming up next...

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:07.180
I've nosed around for a village in Puerto
Rico that specializes in cooking one thing

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.320
and one thing only.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.040
You join me for lunch?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.550
I'll foot the bill.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.890
And later, why are people lining up for a
teeny, tiny, transparent fish?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:31.820
This is insane.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.510
Tourism may be the number one industry in
Puerto Rico,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.160
but thanks to my friend and guide Chef Maira
Morales,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.260
I'm just 45 minutes from San Juan, entering
a 100% no-gringo zone.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.510
We're in the mountains of south central Puerto
Rico, driving on PR-184,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.210
better known as the "Pork Highway".

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.360
We're going to the Guavate region in the hills
of Cayey,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.930
which specializes in just one thing

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.470
pork, with over a dozen restaurants to choose
from.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.670
We like pork.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.100
This is without a doubt, one of the best places,
and I can say in the world, not just in Puerto

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Rico

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
Oh my God

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.009
This happens to be one of my favorite places
worldwide.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.039
This is pig heaven.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.039
It is.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.600
An entire town devoted to cooking roasted
pig.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.490
Isn't that beautiful, isn't God perfect?

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.009
Spanish settlers first brought the pig to
this island and Guavate got it's start as

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.009
pig paradise

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.729
when one roadside shack endeavouring to feed
passing truckers was so successful that more

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.299
lechoneras sprang up

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.970
making the weekend gathering place for local
families to eat and dance the day away.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.700
The first Lechonera on the street, and I'm
told still the best "El Rancho Original".

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.840
The ears and tail for him.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.560
You're going to have the tail and the ears.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
That's great.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.770
These Lechoneras roast whole suckling pigs
over an open flame for hours.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.460
When it's done, they cut it up with a machete,
or huge knife so it's a great way to try all

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.460
the parts of a pig.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.460
Look at that!

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.730
Slow-roasted so it just falls apart like butter.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.430
You actually don't even need a fork,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.700
you can just stick your face into it.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.480
All of this little breast meat and fatty fabulousness,
that's gotta' be my first bite.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.720
There we go.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.660
When you told me this was the best place to
get pig,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.870
you said it was the best place in Puerto Rico.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.760
It's one of my favorites, no doubt.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.240
I've eaten this stuff all over the world,
I'm telling you right now

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.720
that little bite of pork that I had there
is the best pork that I've eaten in my life.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.160
Ha! ha! Yes!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.510
That is insane.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.370
Now, obviously when the guy takes that cleaver,
that machete and he's hacking up all the different

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.370
parts,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.650
you get all kinds of different pieces of the
breast, the thigh, the leg,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.710
And here's that wonderful piece of the belly,
with the skin and just the barest amount of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.730
meat and a lot of fat.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.470
That is absolutely beautiful,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.470
and tasty.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.470
This is pig heaven.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.680
Then there are the often overlooked morcels
that are simply the best parts of the animal.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.050
That's your department, I'll let you have
all of it.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.830
Look at that, what freaks me out a little
bit

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.830
yeah?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.230
It's that I buy these at the local pet store
also

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.230
For your dog

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.280
and my dog loves them.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.360
The skin here is so thick.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.180
Oh wow.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.990
That was...

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.960
Mmm, wow that guy could've used a q-tip or
two.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:41.770
I'm not eating any of it.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.412
Wow that's fantastic.

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:44.412
Good.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:45.412
You enjoy that.

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:46.412
That's a nice pig's ear.

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:47.412
Most of the time the ear's burnt,

00:03:47.412 --> 00:03:51.340
but you can see the nose the tail are still
just the same color as the rest of the it.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.540
It's gorgeous, they really know what they're
doing here.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.900
Equally tasty and rightly appreciated here
in Puerto Rico, the pig's tail.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.190
You just kind of gnaw on the end of it.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.190
Yes.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.190
Wow.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.360
That's big prize, because you only have one
tail.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
Right!

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.800
So that's *the* one piece that everyone wants.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.730
But each part of the animal has it's own unique
flavor.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.370
It's a front leg. That is a beautiful specimen
right there.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:29.350
Oh, the meat on this part of the animal is
so rich, and so melting, and so much more

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.080
go ahead you take it.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.200
intensely porky than any other place on the
pig,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.630
I mean people who don't eat the shanks are
really missing out on incredible, incredible

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.630
pork goodness.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.320
Oh my God.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.820
Do you like the toenails?

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.960
No, you go ahead and have those.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.530
It's gross, nobody eats those, I was just
kidding.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.330
I was just trying to get you to try one.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.490
No!

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.970
I'm enjoying every part of this pig, toe to
snout.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.840
You go ahead and have that part.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.970
A pig roots around with it's nose, so it has
this meat, these muscles that are in it that

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.000
are just...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.240
I don't know, it's yummy food.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.460
Just because of you.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.400
Grab that one.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400
That is...

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.970
Careful, it's a tooth.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.020
Here, it's just these little strips.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.350
That's actually very good.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.350
I'm telling you!

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.910
This is the first time I have it.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.200
All the meat from the face has different flavors
and textures,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200
It does.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.650
Depending on how much skin is covering it,
how much the muscle works.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.950
That is very earthy stuff.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.650
It has to have the hair on it.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.770
If it doesn't have the hair on it, something's
wrong.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.250
This is the quintessential pig meal.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.200
That's why we're known for it.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.810
Why you think we have an whole town devoted
to pig?

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.990
That's a really good point.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.860
In typical Puertorican fashion, food is followed
by festivity,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.780
and it's time to work off a little bit of
our meal.
