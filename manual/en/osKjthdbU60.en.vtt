00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.439
I'm here to talk about the different style
motorcycle helmets. We have three different

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:15.250
styles. Two street use helmets, one being
a full face helmet and one being a open face

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.280
helmet. On your open face helmet obviously
you're not going to have any face protection,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:29.579
you're just going to have your head protection
with a sun visor, and a chin strap. And usually

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:37.079
a good quality open face helmet will usually
have the option for removable ear pad, depending

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.620
on the temperature outside for warmth and
if for noise protection as well. Your other

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.469
style street helmet will be your full face
helmet, which provides a lot more protection.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.360
Obviously, because you do have chin protection,
face protection, and you also have a shield

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.390
that retracts. Opens and closes. You also
have some ventilation which helps with fog.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.540
And this helmet will also provide a lot more
noise protection safety for your ears, just

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.131
due to the fact that your ears are covered
while riding. Last style helmet that you have

00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:24.350
is your off road helmet. It is a full face
helmet, the different with this between a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.810
full face street helmet is you do not have
a face shield. In this particular helmet you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.229
would use a goggle to protect your eyes. But
this helmet is a lot lighter, it's a lot more

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.490
freer flowing, and a lot cooler for the warm
riding conditions that you have. And then

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.500
again you would also use a goggle with that,
but this is your off road style helmet. A

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.030
couple of things you just want to consider
when buying a helmet, is you need to make

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.700
sure that every helmet has a DOT approval
sticker on it, which is the minimal requirement

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.979
required to sell a helmet in the United States,
as far as safety standard goes - Department

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.819
of Transportation. One step further from that
when any helmet that you would want to buy

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.870
would be a Snell proofed helmet. Which is
a non-profit organization that puts helmets

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.260
through a little bit tougher testing than
the Department of Transportation does. So

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.390
if you can get a helmet with that Snell approval
on it you will have a much higher quality

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.319
helmet, and with better protection as well.
