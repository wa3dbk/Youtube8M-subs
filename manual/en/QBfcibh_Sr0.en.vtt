cars.com auto reviews

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.430
hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars dot com the
redesigned

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.690
2010 Subaru Legacy has been the subject
I'll a lot of debate around the offices

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.630
some others really like it others like
me art so crazy about it

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
and I'll a video when the car was
introduced to the other shows we talked

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.119
about some its styling and interior
elements

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.480
you're gonna go over driving and seating
aspects and talk about why if you need

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.630
all wheel drive this car

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.110
relief is a good car for you but if you
don't might not be quite as appealing

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.480
my car has the base four-cylinder engine

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
there's also an optional turbocharged
four-cylinder as well

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.660
6 honor as a for four solar power isn't
that bad

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.339
%uh the stick shift kinda requires you
to wind out each care but actually think

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.109
the optional

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.289
a continuously variable automatic
transmission is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.550
a better fit this a true test that both
cough

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.920
and leather ones obviously is a cloth
seats I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.350
not as supportive as they actually look
I'm fighting a lot back and forth in

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.699
corners and on longer trips I wish I
could a little more

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.950
I support down here on the leather seats
obviously optional again

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.400
not quite as high rent feeling as the
seats in the accord in the camera some

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.910
other cars you get in the segment

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.410
cargo volume about 14 and a half cubic
feet playroom for

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.450
a day at the golf course in fairly
competitive segment

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.270
gas wells with the automatic 23 31 see
how that's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.680
really good considering all wheel drive
a standard typically all-wheel drive

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.050
systems reduce smiles a bit

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.650
in the Ford Fusion you have to get the
v6 get all wheel drive not Knox

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.180
mileage on quite a bit comp so not a bad
set up still if you're shopping against

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.310
front wheel drive cars

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.410
some these competitors the fusion the
Malibu on

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.640
he's got 33 34 miles per gallon highway
so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.850
chamber doesn't make you pay a big price
to get all wheel drive but don't be

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.450
mistaken

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.040
you dupay a certain price for if you
need all wheel drive the Subaru makes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.940
a great choice and by the looks of it I
think more shoppers are figuring that

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.630
out because server sales are actually

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.600
up right now it's pretty amazing given
our current economic climate um

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.210
still I can't really find a compelling
reason beyond that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.500
that this car would make a greater
choice then

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.550
a Camry air an accord or fusion are
Malibu

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.090
I'm the seven its capabilities credit
might be a slam dunk for you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.090
if not some other cars might be a better
fit at the end of the day
