00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.860
It's always a bit tricky

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.730
When there's two people out here, because if there is more people...

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.170
there's more noise your going to be making obviously.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.800
But what I am trying to teach

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.160
this villager

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.650
is often out here they don't have much light,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.509
things like torches - illumination which helps

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.269
when your going for nocturnal species...

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.560
and what we are doing is moving our way 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.780
through the corn paddock 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.819
and um... they have had a couple of invasive
animals and particularly

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.980
one which I am after tonight, which I am confident I'll get

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.810
is what they refer to as the 'Cane Rat' - it's a native rat

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.990
and he infests this area

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.510
and he's after

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.260
all sorts of their produce

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.470
from pumpkins, pineapple, sweet
potatoes, carrots, you name it

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.800
ok - shh, shh.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.880
Generally what I'll do

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.129
is: when I hear something

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.260
I like to drop my body weight

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.710
down to the ground, get my ears as close as I can down to the ground.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.710
If my ears are down to the ground, I can put my ear to the ground 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.439
and I can listen through the ground. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990
These animals

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.880
these rats

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.510
whether it be rats, mongoose, genets, civets and rodent or small mammal 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.080
generally what you will do is at night time you have to stay very quiet

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.090
and after I do this talking 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.210
you will see what sort of mode you have to get into

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.310
 it's sort of like a instinctive -

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.160
like a instinctive 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.580
natural

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.550
hunting mode-of-night

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.230
it is where you stay quiet 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.570
and you just become one with your surroundings and listen

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.280
you listen to the trees

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.000
you listen to the crickets

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.860
and you listen to all the abnormal noises

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.650
those abnormal noises, are animals making those noises

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.810
and particularly out here, there's a lot of dry corn

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.159
that comes down

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.500
you can hear the animals

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.370
moving through the corn, that's exactly how I am going to plan my attack.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.810
Moving silently and then going for the grab - you keep the light always on their eyes,

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.890
as long as you have the light on the nocturnal animal's eyes, it gets stunned

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.079
it squints, it gets very confused

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:21.079
it's easy to plan an attack that way.

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.679
And like I was saying...

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.799
you have to stay really, really quiet, keep your eyes on him

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.809
and get that eye shine 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:10.959
with that torch 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.409
keep it in his eyes

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.119
as long as you have that light in his eyes, he's focusing all his attention 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.239
on where that light is coming from, know what I mean?

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.609
That way you can get close to these animals -

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.899
these guys here, this here

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.569
is what they refer to 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.019
as the Cane Rat,

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.349
and I'll tell you what

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.709
he's not that hard to catch if you know what your doing

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.479
generally what I like to do is as you saw me before,

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:39.039
I'll sit down, and I'll just listen and listen and listen.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.619
And I'll tune into the surroundings - you can hear the crickets in the background, you can 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.829
hear the owls hooting, you can hear the cows 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:46.999
in the distance

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.080
and all I'm looking for and hearing for is the gnawing

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.029
and this...

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.999
Hear him gnawing away

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.999
gnaw, gnaw

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.359
and that gnawing, generally 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.239
what he'll be doing out here

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.969
is he will be feeding on a variety 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.369
of food types

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.139
everything from

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.290
sugar cane, to pumpkin

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.689
you've been affected, your crops have been affected, pumpkins

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.109
to sweet potatoes 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.369
to pineapples

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:18.519
so you can see

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.229
there is other methods to capture these animals which are less invasive than using traps.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.419
Use your ears, and your sense of sight, if you have a little bit of light to help you

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.399
it makes it a lot better than jumping around in the dark because you don't know what your going to jump on

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.649
could jump on the mongoose and bang you have to fight right on.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:35.219
But this guy here 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.020
I'll tell you what 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.809
You won't want to get a bite out of him either, these guys here are carriers, then can carry 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:42.669
many different types of diseases 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.029
and um...

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.660
a bite from one of these guys could turn into a pretty bad infection.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.520
But what these guys will do at night time is scurry along 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.120
and um... it's not just the fruits

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.780
or the crops your after

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.490
they also eat insects as well

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.490
so it could be cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets -

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.229
they will feel around with their whiskers, their very sensitive and search around in the dirt...

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.209
dig it up...bang, swallow it down.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.199
You see his little claws,

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.970
absolutely perfectly designed for digging

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.419
but you

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.110
have been a bit of a problem

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.659
to these villages

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.699
haven't you, yes you have getting to the corn don't ya, you sure do,

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.100
ya look at you.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.110
Alright mate well, there's a couple things we can do with you 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.999
and I'm sure 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.410
the village cats and dogs would like to have a nice feed out of you

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.719
but I think you're going to get lucky tonight
and I might give you a release 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.169
back into the forest, because this guy here 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.419
at the end of the day, he's a native species of rodent - he's not a feral - he's a native.

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.689
To the villagers out here, yes he's guilty as a feral, but - 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.219
he's right at home 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.210
right here

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.669
in Africa.
