Hey, there! This is Terry from HockeyMonkey.com.
Today, we're going to take a look at another

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.290
elite skate from the Reebok skate line - it's
the 18K.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.840
The Reebok K skate series was designed to
maximize power transmission, while providing

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.750
a customized fit that enhances the skaters
stride. The Dynamic Support System, or DSS,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.110
is evident throughout the series and refers
to the ideal skate construction which optimizes

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.010
flexibility and stiffness. Reebok uses its
proprietary last, designed and engineered

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.300
to provide stride-enhancing fit accuracy.
The 18K has a generous fit profile, but is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.720
armed with the Pump® technology which allows
air to circulate around the ankles for great

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.199
heel lock and a customized fit. The 18K is
also equipped with the Skate Lock feature

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.280
which allows for variability within two seperate
lacing zones - lower and upper. Let's take

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.750
a closer look at some more of the technology
of the 18K skate.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.180
Reebok uses its Max Armour™ V construction
in the quarter. This is a multi-layered package

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.789
reinforced with metal mesh. The layers are
bonded together to create a core that provides

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:21.090
support, stiffness and flexibility. The flexion
and spinal zones of the Dynamic Support System

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
are comprised of an embedded composite of
monofilament mesh that provides additional

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.530
reinforcement. This quarter package construction
makes these heat moldable, which adds to the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.590
already great amount of customization that
this skate offers and means shorter break

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.950
in time.
The tongue is made of pro felt with a lightweight

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.590
EPE foam core and has an external molded lace
bite protector, designed to minimize tongue

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.929
twist. You can see that this tongue construction
gives you a good amount of forward flex. The

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.759
18K has the ventilated full lightweight carbon
composite outsole which helps reduce weight

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.370
in a skate and provides excellent rigidity
under the boot thus reducing torque while

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.450
you skate.
If you're looking for a skate with great customized

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.619
fit features and very good lateral support,
check out the 18K skates from Reebok. Available

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.940
at one of our super stores, or at HockeyMonkey.com.
Thanks for watching. Later!
