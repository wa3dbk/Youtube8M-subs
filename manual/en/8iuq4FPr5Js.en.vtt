00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
[running footsteps]

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.760
[music]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Everyone who's run has

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.010
heard the term

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.010
"pounding the pavement".

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.730
I remember learning in high school

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.730
physics class

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.210
that for every action

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.210
there is an equal and

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.210
opposite reaction.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So if we're

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
pounding the pavement

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the pavement is pounding

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
our bodies.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.590
[running footsteps]

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920
If we want to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.920
minimize the chances of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
repetitive stress injuries

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.920
we need to ...

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
... such as trails,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.120
beaches,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120
or grass.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.420
Trail running

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.420
technique and pacing

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.420
is much different

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.420
than on roads.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.420
First you'll find out

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.420
due to the soft surfaces

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.420
and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
uneven terrain

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.420
you'll run

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.420
a little more slowly.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.140
Also you'll encounter

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.140
roots, rocks, and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.140
other obstacles

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.140
so you need to

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.140
slow down a little bit.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.320
Since most trail running

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.320
or running on soft surfaces

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
is done on your

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
easy days

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320
don't worry about

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
your pace.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.330
The longer time

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.330
you spend out running

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.330
actually adds to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.330
your aerobic conditioning.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.450
Your body will thank you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
when you run on softer surfaces.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.520
You can build your mileage

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520
more quickly

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
and not worry about

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
overuse injuries.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.290
Also your body recruits

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.290
helper muscles,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.290
tendons, and ligaments

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.290
that aren't used as much

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.290
when you run in a straight line

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.290
on a road.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320
Which really helps you

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320
tremendously

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.320
to become

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.320
a stronger and faster

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320
and more efficient runner.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.300
Your mind will thank you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.300
when you're out running on trails.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460
It's like the difference between

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.460
working out

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.460
and having play.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
When we were kids

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860
we loved playing in the woods.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.220
You can run 10-20 miles

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.220
on the trails and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.220
not even realize

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.220
what you've been doing.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.590
Finally, your running buddies

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.590
will thank you.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.510
So many people

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.510
are just tired out of

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.510
being on the streets

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.510
and don't have any

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.510
joy in their training sessions.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Get them out on in the woods.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.020
They'll have a lot of fun.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.590
You'll having running partners.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.270
And afterwards

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.270
head out to brunch together!

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.270
[drum roll]
