00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.300
&gt;&gt; The President:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.467
Before I make an announcement
about our efforts to stand up

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:08.266
for U.S. businesses
and U.S. workers,

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.333
I'd like to say a few
words about the situation

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.400
in Afghanistan.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.000
Over the weekend,
as many of you know,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.900
there was a tragic incident
in which a number of Afghan

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.800
civilians were killed.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
What I've made to President
Karzai when I spoke to him

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.367
is that the United States takes
this as seriously as if it was

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:33.967
our own citizens and our own
children who were murdered.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:38.100
We're heartbroken over
the loss of innocent life.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.400
The killing of innocent
civilians is outrageous

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.233
and it's unacceptable.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:45.667
It's not who we
are as a country,

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:50.400
and it does not
represent our military.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100
And for that reason, I've
directed the Pentagon to make

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.166
sure that we spare no effort in
conducting a full investigation.

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.200
I can assure the American people
and the Afghan people that we

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.133
will follow the facts
wherever they lead us,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.900
and we will make sure that
anybody who was involved is

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.133
held fully accountable with
the full force of the law.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.266
Yesterday, I met with General
Allen and Ambassador Crocker,

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.567
who were here in Washington, and
I've extraordinary confidence in

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:27.000
them and in the many Americans
who are serving in Afghanistan

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.700
and who have made extraordinary
sacrifices to be there.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.934
Today I'll be meeting with
Prime Minister Cameron,

00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.500
who is part of our broad
coalition serving in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.834
Afghanistan, and we'll have an
opportunity to consult about the

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.333
way forward as we prepare for
the NATO summit in Chicago later

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.100
this spring.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.567
So make no mistake, we have a
strategy that will allow us to

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.800
responsibly wind down this war.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.367
We're steadily transitioning to
the Afghans who are moving into

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.500
the lead, and that's
going to allow us to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.533
bring our troops home.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.100
Already we're scheduled to
remove 23,000 troops by the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.367
end of this summer, followed by
-- following the 10,000 that we

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.433
withdrew last year.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.567
And meanwhile, we will
continue the work of devastating

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:19.867
al Qaeda's leadership and
denying them a safe haven.

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:22.400
There's no question that we
face a difficult challenge in

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.133
Afghanistan, but I am confident
that we can continue the work of

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.333
meeting our objectives,
protecting our country

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:35.333
and responsibly bringing
this war to a close.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.767
Now, one of the things that I
talked about during the State

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.166
of the Union address was making
America more competitive in the

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.066
global economy.

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:46.066
The good news is that we have
the best workers and the best

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.266
businesses in the world.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.200
They turn out the best products.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.734
And when the playing
field is level,

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:56.033
they'll always be able to
compete and succeed against

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:58.467
every other country on Earth.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:03.367
But the key is to make sure
that the playing field is level.

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:06.100
And frankly, sometimes it's not.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.467
I will always try to work
our differences through

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:12.233
with other countries.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.900
We prefer dialogue.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.800
That's especially true
when it comes to key

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.867
trading partners like China.

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:20.400
We've got a constructive
economic relationship with

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.300
China, and whenever possible, we
are committed to working with

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.066
them to addressing our concerns.

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:31.467
But when it is necessary, I will
take action if our workers and

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:37.066
our businesses are being
subjected to unfair practices.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:40.166
Since I took office, we've
brought trade cases against

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:45.800
China at nearly twice the rate
as the last administration,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.467
and these actions are
making a difference.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:52.600
For example, we halted an
unfair surge in Chinese tires,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.333
which has helped put over
1,000 American workers back

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:58.867
on the job.

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:00.934
But we haven't stopped there.

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:04.600
Two weeks ago, I created a Trade
Enforcement Unit to aggressively

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.600
investigate any unfair trade
practices taking place anywhere

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.800
in the world.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.266
And as they ramp
up their efforts,

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:15.066
our competitors should be on
notice: You will not get away

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:17.700
with skirting the rules.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.033
When we can, we will rally
support from our allies.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:25.066
And when it makes sense to
act on our own, we will.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.734
I just signed a bill to help
American companies that are

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:30.166
facing unfair
foreign competition.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.767
These companies employ tens
of thousands of Americans in

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:34.500
nearly 40 states.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.133
Because of subsidies from
foreign governments,

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.967
some of their foreign
competitors are selling

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:42.333
products at an
artificially low price.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.233
That needs to stop.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.233
This morning, we're taking
an additional step forward.

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:50.200
We're bringing a new trade case
against China -- and we're being

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.333
joined by Japan and some
of our European allies.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:56.900
This case involves something
called rare earth materials,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.367
which are used by American
manufacturers to make high-tech

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:03.166
products like advanced batteries
that power everything from

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.767
hybrid cars to cell phones.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.533
We want our companies
building those products

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:10.166
right here in America.

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:12.333
But to do that, American
manufacturers need to have

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:16.800
access to rare earth materials
-- which China supplies.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.967
Now, if China would simply
let the market work on its own,

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:21.233
we'd have no objections.

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:25.066
But their policies currently are
preventing that from happening.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:27.633
And they go against the
very rules that China

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.066
agreed to follow.

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:33.000
Being able to manufacture
advanced batteries and hybrid

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.033
cars in America is too
important for us to stand

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.567
by and do nothing.

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:39.333
We've got to take control
of our energy future,

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:43.166
and we can't let that energy
industry take root in some other

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.734
country because they were
allowed to break the rules.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:50.100
So our administration will bring
this case against China today,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.333
and we will keep working every
single day to give American

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:56.333
workers and American
businesses a fair shot

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:57.300
in the global economy.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.133
We're going to make sure that
this isn't a country that's just

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:03.133
known for what we consume.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:07.767
America needs to get back to
doing what it's always done best

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.400
-- a country that builds and
sells products all over the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.867
world that are stamped with the
proud words: "Made in America."

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.467
That's how we create good,
middle-class jobs at home,

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:19.633
and that's how we're going
to create an economy that's

00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:20.967
built to last.

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.967
Thank you very much, everybody.
