00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.600
We all know the world is changing.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.420
Population, urbanization, and climate challenges are straining the world's resources.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.220
Traditional agriculture + the global distribution model = BROKEN

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.789
Communities are seeking better ways to source healthy, local, and sustainable food

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:21.609
Hydroponics will play a key role.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.980
American Hydroponics will lead the way.

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:27.339
You can be part of the solution.

Growing with AmHydro means you are 10 times more productive

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.980
and use 90% less water than traditional soil-based growing.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.900
They're the most durable and indestructible channels made with

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.319
a reliable FDA-approved food grade high-density polyethylene.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.840
It's the only growing channel you can walk on.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.700
In fact, you can literally run over it with a truck and it still works!

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.760
Try that with the standard PVC channels on the market.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.020
AmHydro's channels make the growing process easier.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.880

In fact, you'll grow two and a half times more plants with AmHydro systems than with any other systems.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.920
Making your cost per plant cheaper and your ROI faster.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.480
