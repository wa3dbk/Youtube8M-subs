6 Tabletop Flower Tips
with Nico de Swert

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Hi, I'm style expert Nico de Swert, here
are some tips and techniques for tabletop arrangements at home.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.709
for a gorgeous and inventive place setting, I love floral
napkin rings. Start with stapling cardboard into a ring.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.400
Attach a leaf to the ring using floral adhesive. Add 
more glue to the top of your ring and secure more flower buds.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.660
I've used green button chrysanthemums 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.660
eucalyptus leaves and two hyacinths, an 
imitation pearl adds an elegant touch to this personal place setting.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.229
you should have fun with flowers

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.069
An interesting way of using them is to create a
floral birthday cake. Cut the floral foam

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.920
into a half sphere, submerge into water and place 
in the center of your cake stand

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.380
I've used hypericum berries

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.160
carnations, and chrysanthemums 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.880
start from the bottom and work up in layers finish
up with candles

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.170
e voila, 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.540
happy birthday

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.530
for this arrangement take a large white egg

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.670
crack it open with the tip of a sharp knife,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.270
rinse the egg with water, fill it 
and this is your floral vessel

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.270
you can also incorporate this into your centerpiece
like I did with this three-tiered stand from pottery barn

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.950
the cover and cute idea for party is to 
create a floral cupcake

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.210
Cut horsetail grasses in small pieces about twice
the size of the floral foam

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.920
they don't have to be exactly the same height

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.640
Pin the pieces of grass on to the floral foam using 
floral pins

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.180
make sure to maintain a straight line and cover 
the pins with a bright pink rafia

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.180
Add hypericum berries along the edge and finish it off 
with pink carnations

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.919
for a cleaner look

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:04.500
line your clear glass vessel with an interesting
looking leaf

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.319
This hides the stems and adds a visual 
interest to your arrangement.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.319
Here I've used tall natural grasses for a more modern
look

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.909
A really pretty way to add a splash of color to your arrangement 
is to use citrus fruit as a vessel

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.150
for your flowers. You cut the top off an orange

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.860
core it out rinse and add water 
and your container is ready to use.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
