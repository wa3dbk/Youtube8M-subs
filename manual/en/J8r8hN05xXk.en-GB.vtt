00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.740
In this lesson, we will learn about paper
and thin layer chromatography, both of which

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.070
are used in forensic science applications.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:31.859
Chromatography is a separation technique,
and this will be demonstrated using food colouring.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.660
Place this in a beaker with water, ensuring
that the water level does not touch the spots.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.170
As the water is absorbed, it separates the
multiple components of the food colouring.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.190
We have now created a chromatogram.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.000
The chromatography paper is called the stationary
phase as it “stays put”.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.050
Water is called the mobile phase as it “moves”
up the chromatography paper.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.000
Here is the key idea – a component that
is more soluble in water travels a greater

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
distance up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.750
the chromatography paper, and a less soluble
component travels a shorter distance.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.700
The retention factor, or Rf value,value, is
a measure of the distance that a separated

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
component has

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
travelled compared to the distance that the
solvent, in our example, water, has travelled.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.420
Rf = distance travelled by a component / distance
travelled by the solvent

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.590
These distances can be measured using a ruler.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.590
Rf = distance travelled by a component / distance
travelled by the solvent

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.590
Distance travelled by solvent = 6cm

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.590
Distance travelled by component A = 4cm

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.590
Distance travelled by component B = 2cm

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.590
Rf for component A = 4cm / 6cm = 0.67

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.590
Rf for component A = 2cm / 6cm = 0.33

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.590
Challenge:

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.590
What does the Rf value tell you about the
solubility of a separated component in the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.430
mobile phase solvent?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.640
Please pause the video to think about this.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.920
A larger Rf value means that the component
is more soluble in the solvent.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.640
A smaller Rf value means that the component
is less soluble in the solvent.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.130
Thin layer chromatography, or TLC, works in
exactly the same manner.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.189
Instead of chromatography paper, a glass plate
with a thin layer of silica gel or any other

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.270
adsorbent material is used.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.819
This thin layer of adsorbent material is the
stationary phase.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.469
Any suitable solvent may be used as the mobile
phase.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:30.189
If the separated components are colourless,
the dried chromatogram may be sprayed with

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:36.819
ninhydrin, which can turn some components
purple, or the chromatogram may be viewed

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.989
under UV light.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.019
Ninhydrin is be used to detect fingerprints
from a crime scene.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.959
Both chromatography methods can be used to
identify and compare samples of drugs, inks,

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.969
lipsticks, saliva, and explosives, just to
name a few.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.870
In conclusion, paper and thin layer chromatography
are used to separate components of a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.980
mixture based on their solubility.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.659
The relative solubility of separated components
can be determined by calculating their Rf

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.340
values.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.639
More soluble components have a larger Rf value
and less soluble components have a smaller

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.299
Rf value.
