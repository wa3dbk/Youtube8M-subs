Creating mural for your child's bedroom is
a long and complicated process but well worth

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.211
the effort. As long as you make sure you have
the necessary supplies on hand. You want to

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.300
make sure you have everything you need so
you don't have start and stop and go all the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.909
time and that you're able to do a great product.
First, we're going to need to have a variety

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:22.509
of rollers. I recommend having two small rollers
two large rollers so that then you can alter

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.119
if you're using them in a different paint
colors. You don't have to wait to wash them

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.960
and dry them. Also of course, need painting
trays at least two of these. Again the same

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.660
reason with the rollers so that you can be
working with multiple colors at the same time.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.760
Also a good flat head screwdriver really great
for opening up paint cans. A variety of brushes

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
big just typical painting brushes nothing
special about these guys just yet some nice

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.150
masking tape. Of course, the paint roller
covers they're going to be very important

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.640
to us. I recommend having a foam brush. These
are very good for some of the random detail

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.610
work that we're going to be doing later on
moving on, a good painting stick, a sponge.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.319
A sponge both to clean up the mistakes we
have and also to again add some of the painting

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:18.340
effects we're going to do today. Some good
painting tape to cover up those surfaces a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.569
good strong sharp pencil so make sure you
also have your pencil sharper on hand. Now,

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.060
we're getting more specialized. These are
brushes that are actually usually used for

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.069
oil painting and acrylic. So, we're actually
going to want these because these are going

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.740
to be some of the detail work we're going
to do that work pretty well also for doing

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.299
detail on just wall paint murals. A painting
pole preferably extendible if you can get

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.840
one but also like one of the wooden poles
would work just fine too this would make it

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.130
both easier to paint, quicker to paint and
also would help be able to adjust pole to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.619
have greater control over how you paint which
is critical for a mural. At last but not least

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.039
of course paint, paint lots of paint. Paint
in small cans, paint in big cans lots of paint

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.200
in addition to having a drop cloth to cover
up everything to protect your surfaces.
