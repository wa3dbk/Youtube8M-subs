00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.600
- Bonjour!
- How are you?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.160
Hello!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.800
How are you?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.000
How are you ? Fine.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.680
Je vais très bien!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.560
Where do you want to go?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.440
I want to go to Champs Elysées, please.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.560
- Hey Andrea!
- Andrea?

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.440
- Somebody is talking to me…
- Hello Andrea!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400
- Oh really? Oh sorry!
- Hello! Who is that?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.320
How are you?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.640
I'm good.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.840
I forgot to present you my car.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120
- Sorry.
- I think it's your wife in the back of the trunk…

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.760
No, no, no…

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.280
We are like husband and wife!

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.720
So now, who is in power,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.360
and who is in charge, here?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.560
Do you think that you and Novak Djokovic

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
have the same sense of humor?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.800
I really don't know…

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.000
He never laughs at my jokes.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.440
Maybe he doesn't want to show me that I'm funny.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.720
But you know how that is,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880
you're always the funniest person to yourself.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.800
Because otherwise, you wouldn't make those jokes.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.200
- Right? Because you think they are really funny,
- Yeah!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
and then nobody laughs, and you're like

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.280
these people are really stupid,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.000
they don't understand my humor at all,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.440
and in the end, you are the one that is stupid,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320
and it's just not funny.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.840
I can totally relate.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.280
I'm still sure you hid your wife

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.960
- in the back of the trunk!
- No, I promise…

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600
I'm going to check when we stop and we're out of here.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680
If you were going to make a band,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.640
out of everybody on the tennis tour,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960
male or female,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.240
who would you have in your band,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.440
and playing what instrument?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.800
OK, so I would definitely have

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.680
Serena Williams as the singer,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.400
because I think she's a great diva

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.120
and I heard she loves karaoke,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.640
so she would be a great singer.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.400
I would pick myself as the drummer, obviously.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.920
Let's say maybe Ana Ivanovic is very beautiful,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.560
let's put her as the bass.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
The guitarist is always the crazy one.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.320
How about…

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.840
Yulia Putintseva.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.120
She's crazy in a good way,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.920
so we would have her as the guitarist.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.600
Would you give me a really nice hug,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640
- before you leave?
- Yes!

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920
OK, really nice hug.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.360
That's great.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560
Wonderful hug!

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.960
- Wonderful!
- Thank you!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.440
- And a kiss.
- How does it feel?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.560
It feels fantastic.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.720
OK, I'm happy.
