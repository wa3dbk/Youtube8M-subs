00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:03.755
MAN: Oh.

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:07.360
What do you have to do to get
some service in this place?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.660
GROVER: Hello there, Sir.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.880
MAN: Oh no, not you.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.920
GROVER: Yes, sir, it is I,
Grover, your rhyming waiter.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.020
MAN: My what?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.260
GROVER: Your rhyming waiter.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.520
Today is rhyming day
at Charlie's.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.470
Whatever you pick to eat, I will
rhyme it, and then you

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.390
will get it.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.240
Get it?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.690
MAN: Yes, I get it, but
what's the reason?

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.130
GROVER: No reason.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.080
Just rhyme.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.240
For example, let us say you
ordered some cheese.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.400
I would think of a word that
sounds like cheese, for

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.720
instance, ooh, that
is a toughie.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.210
Cheese.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.640
MAN: Oh please.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.860
GROVER: Very good, sir.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.445
Please rhymes with cheese.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:42.860
Yes.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.375
But I am the rhyming waiter, not
you, so I have to think of

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.525
a rhyme for cheese or you
connect get your cheese.

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:49.110
Cheese.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.400
Cheese.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.890
MAN: I don't want cheese.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.530
GROVER: Then why am I
trying to rhyme it?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.010
MAN: All I want is
a tuna on rye.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010
GROVER: Oh, well all
right, tuna on rye.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.380
The customer has changed
his mind.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.450
Not a problem.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.160
I will just think of a word
that rhymes with rye.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.080
Rye, rye, rye.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.930
MAN: Sigh, tie, lie, cry.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.500
GROVER: All of those words do
rhyme with rye, sir, but I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620
have to do the rhyming,
remember?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.240
It is my job.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.810
MAN: Why do I come here?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.642
Why?

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.540
GROVER: Why rhymes too, but
I did not think of it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.630
Rye, rye, rye.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.030
You would think this would
be as easy as apple pie.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.235
MAN: You did it.

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:33.000
GROVER: Did what sir?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.440
MAN: You rhymed pie with rye.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.990
Rye and pie sound the same.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.791
GROVER: Oh, I am a poet and
I do not even know it.

00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:40.725
Oh, I did it again.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.130
Did you see that?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.500
MAN: I'm hungry.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690
GROVER: Yes, of course, sir.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.050
The customer is always right.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.053
I will be right back
with your order.

00:01:49.053 --> 00:01:52.160
MAN: Oh, that last.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.730
GROVER: Oh, this
looks so tasty.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.660
Here you are, sir.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.840
One hot slice of apple pie.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.272
MAN: I didn't order apple pie.

00:02:01.272 --> 00:02:04.600
I ordered tuna on rye.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.040
The pie rhymed with the rye.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.950
GROVER: Oh.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490
I am so sorry, sir.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.910
It is not easy being a poet.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.165
I think it was Shelley
who once said--

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:15.990
MAN: Just bring me
my lunch, please.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.380
GROVER: Yes, sir.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.510
With pleasure.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.910
MAN: Wherever I go,
he's always there.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.940
GROVER: OK, Charlie,
whatever you say.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.960
I am sorry, sir, but we are
all out of tuna on rye.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.670
MAN: Oh.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.911
GROVER: Perhaps you should not
have waited so long to order.

00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:37.170
MAN: But--

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.260
all right.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.600
Just bring me a cheeseburger.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.520
GROVER: Yes, sir.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.722
One cheeseburger, sir,
coming right up, sir.

00:02:44.722 --> 00:02:47.010
Now what rhymes with
cheeseburger?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.830
MAN: [MOANS]

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.050
GROVER: No, do not help me.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.875
I have to do this myself.

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:51.340
This should be easy.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.081
Cheeseburger.

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:55.331
Linoleum.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.310
Sarsaparilla?
