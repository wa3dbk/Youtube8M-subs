00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.400
Hello my name is Tena Sloan and I'm the owner
of Princess Pools in Dixon, Tennessee. I've

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.730
been in the swimming pool business for ten
years, seven and a half years of hands on

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.880
and going on two and a half years on the retail
industry we are going to be going over how

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.560
to clear up a green pool from winter time.
Before we start we will go over some key components

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:35.420
of a swimming pool. We have a Hayward sand
filter and a pump. The pool we are at today

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.809
and demonstrating on is the basic fiberglass
pool. It has three returns and a skimmer and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.590
right now I am going to test the water, to
test the ph, the alkalinity and the calcium.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.840
Those are the main three components, not components,
but ingredients in a swimming pool. You have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.900
to have those for the pool to function properly.
I am going to be testing the water and I usually

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.239
carry a Taylor test kit with me. It is the
most accurate unless you come into a store

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.140
and have your chemicals tested on their water
analysis treatment machine. With this test

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.470
we have what our called reagents and with
the reagent it tells you on the inside how

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:27.659
many drops per reagent to put into the water
to get the proper alkalinity ph reading. On

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.770
this one it says to put five drops. You put
the lid back on, shake it up a little bit.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.880
I don't know if you can really tell that color
but the ph is low which with a green pool,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:58.710
this is not a bad thing. I'm also going to
check the chlorine and it also has a maximum

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.479
line. The chlorine also has its own reagent
and tells you how many drops to put in the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:20.670
water to get the accurate reading. With the
chlorine it is five drops.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.050
We have no chlorine reading. As you can see
it is white. If we had a chlorine reading

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:36.010
the chlorine should be at 3.0 so in this case
what we want to do is boost the chlorine and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.930
leave the ph low to clear up the green pool
and to kill the algae.
