00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.660
Hey everyone.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.430
You're watching DanceOn.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.190
I'm your host Luan Legacy, and
thanks for tuning in to

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.120
another episode of your
weekly Smash recaps.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.320
This week's episode picks up
where we last left off, and

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm not sure how I
feel about this.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.270
In this week's episode, I
finally figured out why this

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.907
show is called Smash.

00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:21.700
Because everyone in
the episode is

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.100
smashing each other.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830
We see that Ivy and Dev
are in bed together

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.860
after a drunken slumber.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.130
And the two realize that they
have made a huge mistake but

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.350
agree to keep it a secret.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.920
But that could be a little
difficult when Karen is asking

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.140
him where his ring
is to marry her.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.890
What is he supposed to say?

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.150
At Ivy's apartment?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.820
Lies upon lies upon lies!

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.460
This episode is off
to a rocky start.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180
After a stressful tech period,
Bombshell is finally ready to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.040
hit the stage for its first
preview with a live audience.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.510
The curtain rises, and Rebecca
has her shining moment as the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.520
star of the show.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060
The chorus gets their own piece
and does an amazing job.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.970
Even the boys in their skimpy
little towels get a rave from

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.025
the audience.

00:00:57.025 --> 00:00:58.856
Everything seems like
its going great.

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:00.490
Whoo, doesn't end that way.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
We have singing, singing,
dancing, and

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.120
then Marilyn dies.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.210
Kind of anticlimactic,
if you ask me.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.230
And the audience doesn't know
whether or not to applaud,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.240
which really kills the
mood of the night.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.350
And everyone agrees that
they need a new ending.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.610
But on a lighter note, Sam takes
Tom, along with a good

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.610
chunk of the crew members,
to church.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.980
Yeah, everyone in show business
needs a little Jesus

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.530
in their life.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.570
Karen is invited to sing in
front of all the members, and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.135
everyone just rejoices and
relieves themselves of the

00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:28.230
stress of the show.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.820
The show climaxes when we find
that Rebecca has to go to the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.390
hospital because of an allergic

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.070
reaction involving peanuts.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.280
She believes that somebody
deliberately put peanuts in

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280
her smoothie to make her sick.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.870
And because of this, she decides
to drop the show and a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.390
new Marilyn must be chosen.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.670
Will it be Karen, the
official understudy?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.950
Or will it go to Ivy,
since she already

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
knows most of the part?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.990
The season finale of the show's
next week, and I can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.910
guarantee you guys won't
want to miss this.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.200
Until then, this has
been Luan Legacy.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.280
You're watching DanceOn.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.700
Thanks for tuning in to another
episode of your weekly

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.950
Smash recaps.
