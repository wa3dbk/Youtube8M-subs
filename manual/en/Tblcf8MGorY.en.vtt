00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.200
Nothing catches the eye quite like a ring
completely covered in diamonds.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.110
This style of setting is called pavé,
and it creates some of the most dramatic jewelry out there.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.510
Pavé is a French word meaning pave - like pavement
But think more like a cobblestone street.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.210
In the pavé style jewelry, many small gems
are set very close together.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.000
It's like the jewelry has been paved with diamonds.
Now, let's take a closer look.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.200
The pavé style is a form of bead setting.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.000
The first thing to understand about bead setting is that
the gems are set directly into the surface of the metal.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So, how is bead setting done?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
First, a hole is drilled into the metal surface

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.200
which makes a concave impression
just the size of the stone.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.500
Then, the gem is placed into that impression.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Then, the jeweler uses a finely pointed tool

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
to push tiny bits of metal over the edge of the stone.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
Finally, the jeweler finishes the metal by rounding
and smoothing it into a bead

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
thus creating a bead set gem.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Now for the pros and cons. First, the pros...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.520
Pavé looks gorgeous. It’s like the jewelry
has been dipped in diamonds,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.000
and unlike highly polished gold which can get
scratched, pavé always sparkles. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.500
The main con of pavé style jewelry is that since there
is such a small amount of metal holding the gems in

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.200
there is a greater chance of them falling out
if they weren’t set properly to begin with 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.320
or if the ring gets hit particularly hard.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.870
However, since the gems are small, they are
generally fairly inexpensive to replace.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.300
The takeaway here is that cheaply made pavé jewelry
will likely end up costing you more in the long run.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.760
If you like the pavé look, it’s better to pay a little
extra in the beginning and end up with a quality piece.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.220
So, now you know all about bead setting, and how
if you put several bead set gems together

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.580
So, now you know all about bead setting, and how
if you put several bead set gems together

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.000
it can look like a cobblestone path...ok, let’s use the
French word and make it more special: Pavé.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
