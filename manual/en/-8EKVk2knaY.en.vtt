00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.650
Seth &amp; Riley's Garaaaaaaaaaaaage.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.580
Not this again!

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.220
How not to videos.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.760
Josh here again, and welcome to How Not To.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, you might have heard about Seth &amp; Riley's Garage already.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.740
It's a refreshing lemon drink with alcohol

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.260
and today I'm going to teach you how not to prepare one.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.400
First, the jar.

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.429
Invite a possessive roommate in your life.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.301
Using a jar will become very uncomfortable.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.880
What are you doing, Felipe?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.760
You want to grab my jar, huh?

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.900
No.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.530
I'm watching you...

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.380
And now for the ice.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700
A good tip is to get into a fight with your
girlfriend.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.930
For example by saying,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.040
"You're starting to
sound a lot like your mother lately".

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.860
[BANG]

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.700
No more ice for my Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.920
Thanks honey!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.860
Another important part of making your Seth &amp; Riley's Garage hard drink,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.360
is pouring it from the bottle.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.360
Before pouring, rub the bottle three times.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.820
The genie might appear, granting you three wishes.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.840
Wish that you were unable to pour a Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.640
I wish I was unable to pour my Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.160
There! Now you're not able to pour a Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.880
The last step in making a Seth &amp; Riley's Garage, is squeezing half a lemon with a squeezer.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.780
Get involved in a seventies style car chase.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.380
At some point you'll surely crash through
a fruit stand.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.259
Oh-ow, we did that ourselves.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.900
Ah, that was epic.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.699
Now you know how not to prepare a Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.000
Man, all this talking is making me thirsty.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.760
Honey?!

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.060
Could you make me a Seth &amp; Riley's Garage, please?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.000
Thank you honey.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.620
Next time, we'll learn how not to put up your tent.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.911

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.180
Seth &amp; Riley's Garage.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.340
Kind of genius.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.260
Kind of.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.060
Just click the button, it's simple.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.040
Ah, si!

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.260
Not you Felipe. The people at home!
