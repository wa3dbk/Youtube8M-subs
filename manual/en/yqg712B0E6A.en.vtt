00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:13.400
[narrator] A sea of red flooded
parks in northeast Kansas

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.567
for the first annual
"Hands on Topeka."

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.433
[Jaron McConnell] This park
has always been messy and

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.333
I just wanted to come out
here and clean it up.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.500
[Amy Mentzer] It's kinda
nice to like help out.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
I think it's pretty fun.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.233
[narrator] Members of 22 United
Methodist churches left their

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.567
pews on a Sunday to set up
recycling bins, rake leaves,

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.800
and pick up trash in
nine community parks.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.200
[girl 1] It's been
really fun cleaning out
the pond and helping.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.133
And seeing all the
little tadpoles running
around the lake.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.367
[girl2] I think the funniest
thing we've pulled out of the

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.266
pond today was a lawn chair.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.567
[girl 3] Yeah.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.767
[narrator] All ages pitched in and filled 1200 trash bags.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:57.233
[Jayna McFarland] It was such
a great idea that we decided we

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:59.967
just had to jump in and get
involved no matter what.

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:03.734
Even though she's kind of a
challenge, but we thought we had

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.500
to find a way to be involved.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.667
[narrator] Eight hundred church
members signed on for the

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.467
simultaneous day of service,
but the pool of volunteers

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.000
grew close to 1,000 as
neighbors joined in.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.834
[Patrick Woods] The guy who
lived across the street came out

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:19.033
and we gave him a lunch
and put him to work.

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:23.600
You know it's that kind of
open hearts and open doors

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.967
that people really enjoy.

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:27.533
That's why it's my church.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.934
[narrator] Organizers say
there is already excitement

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:31.633
for next year's event.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.467
In the meantime, they hope
that "Hands on Topeka"

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.934
may inspire similar events.

00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:40.533
[Andrew Gardner] We hope that
when people remember the

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.300
red shirts with 'Rethink
Church' they think of

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.166
The United Methodist Church,
that we're people who were

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.000
concerned about the community.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.533
[Evelyn Fischer] We even got
credit for one park we didn't

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.734
clean because somebody
in a restaurant said,

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:56.734
'What's going on? Oh
that's the Methodists.'

00:01:56.734 --> 00:02:00.700
So the word is out that
United Methodists are
making a difference.
