00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.166
In this video, we will demonstrate how to use Slide Master in PowerPoint for Mac 2011. 

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:16.233
To begin, let's open PowerPoint by clicking on the spotlight feature located at the top right hand corner of the screen

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:21.333
In the search field type in "PowerPoint" and click on the application name to launch it.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.600
The slide master's purpose is to let you make global design changes 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.933
such as replacing default font style and have that change reflected on all the slides in this presentation.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:36.066
To start slide master, click on "View" from the menu bar

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.933
scroll over "Master" and select "Slide Master."

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:45.000
You can now see on the left pane your current master slide on top and several other slide layouts below it. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.133
and several other slide layouts below it. 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.233
You can adjust the style of any of these layouts.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.766
First, apply a theme to the whole presentation. 

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.666
Click on the slide master on the left pane

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.733
click on the themes tab and choose the theme you like.

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:05.866
You may also customize the color scheme, fonts, or backgrounds used in your chosen theme. 

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:10.900
Changing these options results in a more personalized design.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.800
To make additional changes to your text styles, click on the text box and click on the "format" tab.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
To fill the text with a solid color or change the effects 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.533
click on the capital "A" drop down arrow in the "Text Styles Styles" group and create a style of your preference.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:32.500
To make changes to the other slide layouts, select them from the left pane. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.300
As an example we'll select the title slide layout.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.833
Click on the title box and adjust its size. 

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:46.500
You can also change the size and position of the subtitle text box and other background objects.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.900
Now place your mouse pointer on the border of the text box. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.900
As soon as it turns into a cross arrow right click on it. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.233
Select "Format Text" go to "text box" and select the type of alignment that you want. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
Then press Ok.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.200
You can make similar adjustments to any other layout in the slide master. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.900
When you are done with the changes click on the slide master tab and select "Close" from the Master View group. 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
This will return you to your "Normal" presentation view. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.433
Now that you are done designing your presentation, you may begin adding content to your slides.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.866
