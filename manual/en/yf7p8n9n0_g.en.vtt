00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.220
AMEN: Talk to me about the difference that
the scan made in your life.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; DAVE ASPREY: Dr. Amen, your SPECT scan
12 years ago rocked my world.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.660
I was a very high performing engineer.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.920
I was getting my MBA at Wharton while working
full time at a startup that we sold for 600

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920
million dollars.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
And I was struggling.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.269
I would sit down to do one of my tests and
I would get 100% of first question.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.600
I get 50% of the next one and I couldn’t
remember my name on the third question and

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600
I felt guilty.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.860
I felt that there’s something wrong with
me.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.739
I ended up even having extra time assigned
for the tests and I still struggled.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.079
I did graduate but barely.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.530
During that time I read your book, your first
book, and I said I’m going to get a scan.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.329
And I did.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.090
The psychiatrist who evaluated said, “Dave,
inside your brain is total cast I don’t

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.809
know how you’re standing here in front of
me, you have amazing ___________,” and that

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.239
lets me going “It’s not me.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.239
It’s my meat.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.900
It’s my biology.”

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.230
And that was something that you can’t fix,
something you can’t repair.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.870
So it turned from being a lack of effort,
a lack of willpower or just being a bad person

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.640
into being someone who had a medical issue
that could and would be dealt with.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.870
So that open the door to let me perform in
levels that most people are amazed by and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.430
that I’m 41.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.530
I’m running a successful company, The Bulletproof
radio podcast, which is millions of people

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.850
and I’ve had the opportunity to interview
expert like you and to get to know you and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.240
to help hundreds and hundreds thousands of
people.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.780
Without your scan at the beginning I never
would have done that so thank you.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.780
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.680
AMEN: If somebody was thinking about coming
to the clinic to get a scan and they _______

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.950
some of the noise on the internet, what would
you say?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.820
&gt;&gt; DAVE ASPREY: For everyone who’s making
a difference, there will be a handful of critics

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.130
and there’s an amazing study.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.100
It says ‘Those who approach the world with
a skeptical view have three times the level

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.500
of senile cut of dementia later in life.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
So you need to look at the source, where it’s
coming from and what conflicts of interests

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.100
they are because when I look at critics online
they are very angry people who obviously need

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.560
the most brain scans, and there are people
with conflict of interest and these are pretty

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.880
much the only two kinds and sometimes there
are even connections between those people.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.640
But when you published as much science as
you have, when you’ve written a dozen books,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.680
when you’ve got thousands and thousands
of people who benefit it including people

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.770
like me who would want to talk about this
in public and a lot of people who benefit

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.130
it but still don’t want to admit that their
brain might not be perfect.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.130
I don’t care.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.260
I kick ass for my brain wasn’t that perfect
and that sort of thing is amazing.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.960
So when you get things like this interview
and you look at all the other stuff out there

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.080
and you get a few detractors, the detractors
are a sign of success.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.650
There’s a couple guys who taught me this.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.450
One is Peter Sage who is a famous entrepreneur
doing some incredibly big world changing things,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.540
and the other is Tim Ferriss regarding the
4-Hour Body, 4-Hour Work Week and both of

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.140
them have an approach to critics and skeptics
that are pretty similar, which is, that it’s

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.270
a sign that you’re changing world.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.890
So for people who are thinking of how many
are getting a scan and they see somewhat hoax

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.380
somewhere online balance the evidence and
the evidence is very clear.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.380
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.540
AMEN: When you saw your scan, what did it
do to your relationship with your brain?

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.150
&gt;&gt; DAVE ASPREY: My relationship with my brain
changed a lot because I don’t identify myself

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.500
as being my brain.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.250
When, to this day, something happens that
I don’t like that isn’t like me, “What

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.850
did my brain do, not what did I do?”

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.480
And the difference there is profound because
I can control what my brain does but I am

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.040
not my brain and that for me was a huge thing
because it allowed me to be more forgiving

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.850
for myself and also when I look at other people,
“Is that person actually evil person or

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.430
is that a person who’s profoundly toxic
or a person who has been abused or a person

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.530
who whacked their head too many times and
they’re acting that way without their own

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.040
knowledge, without their own consent, without
their own permission.”

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.650
There’s so much of that behavior in the
world around me and around us but people who

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.180
are aware of it they are medical professionals
who are aware of it, they’re psychologists,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.530
they’re spouses, they’re children, so
there’s a lot of people feeling terribly

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.320
guilty about things they’ve done who don’t
know there’s a biological basis for their

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320
behavior.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
It’s not a personality defect.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.410
AMEN: And be healed if you do the right thing.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.580
&gt;&gt; DAVE ASPREY: Absolutely!

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.920
I’m a living proof of this.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920
AMEN: That’s awesome.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920
Thank you my friend.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.926
&gt;&gt; DAVE ASPREY: Thank you Dr. Amen.
