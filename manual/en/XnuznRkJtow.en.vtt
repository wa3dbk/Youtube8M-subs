00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.339
Building a stucco wall.  For centuries,

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.580
stucco has proven to be one of the most
enduring, versatile

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.690
and weather-resistant exterior wall
finishes available...and with its variety of

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.000
colors and textures,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.430
stucco continues to be one of the most
popular wall systems.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.930
Stucco can be applied over standard, wood
frame walls

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.890
in a three-coat process and over masonry
and poured concrete walls

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.390
in a two-coat application. Before
starting your project,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.949
check local building codes for wall
assembly and moisture barrier

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.899
requirements

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.760
in your area. Weather-resistant stucco
walls require the use of two layers of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170
grade D waterproof building paper over
the wall sheeting

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.090
including plywood, OSB, exterior
gypsum board

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.829
and concrete board, before the application
of the base coat stucco.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.960
When attaching the waterproof building
paper,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.559
vertical seams should be overlapped by 6
inches or more

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.949
and horizontal seams should be overlapped
by 4 inches,

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.330
in shingle fashion.  The building paper
should also extend 16 inches

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.620
around all corners.  Once the water
resistant building paper is in place,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.660
all trim accessories should be installed.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.670
Trim accessories can be cut to size
using metal snips.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.720
Cut edges are often very sharp, so always
wear gloves when working with these

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.550
materials.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.860
a weep screed is a typical excess will
be required by code.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.460
Weep screeds are installed along the
bottom edges to allow any water that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.950
has entered the wall to escape.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.060
Casing beads should be installed to neatly
terminate stucco at the end of the wall.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.960
Casing beads also act as a guide to help
maintain a consistent stucco thickness.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.650
casing beads, for a three coats system,
should be three quarters of an inch

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.370
thick.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.530
Casing beads for use in a two-coat
system over masonry or concrete

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.800
should be 1/2 inch thick.  Then,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.340
galvanized expanded metal lath or 1 inch
woven wire stucco netting

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.680
is installed over the entire surface,
overlapping by one inch on the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.980
horizontal seams

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.340
and two inches on the vertical seams.
Galvanized nails or staples should be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.920
used every six inches,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.230
both vertically and horizontally. Make sure
that the nails or staples

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
penetrate the studs a minimum of one
inch.  The lath or stucco netting should also

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.310
extend 16 inches

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.050
around all corners.  If the base coat
stucco is applied to a clean

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.100
unpainted concrete or masonry surface,
waterproof building paper and metal lath

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.120
are not required.  Then,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410
control joints should be placed to create
wall panels no larger than 144 square

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.060
feet,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.550
keeping the panels as square as possible.
Stucco will shrink as it hardens and cures.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.760
Control joints help reduce the potential
for shrinkage cracking.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.960
Expansion joints are required anywhere
there are existing wall expansion joints

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.040
and at inside corners and changes in
substrate.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.870
Expansion joints are designed to allow
for the expansion and contraction of the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.190
stucco wall panels

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.340
with changes in temperature.  Corner trim
should be used on all

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.290
outside edges, to protect the exposed
stucco and to provide clean

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.520
finished lines. Now that the substrate is
properly prepared,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.080
it is ready for the base coat stucco
application.  QUIKRETE Base Coat Stucco

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.890
and QUIKRETE Base Coat Stucco with Water-Stop are recommended for use

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.340
in a traditional three coats system over
wood sheeting and

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.690
as the base for a two coat application
over masonry or concrete.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.970
These pre-blended stuccos are
extremely workable for hand applied

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.540
stucco applications

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.090
and have the high bond strength required
for a successful project.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.500
Mix the base coat stucco to a workable
consistency.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.140
The proper consistency is achieved when
the stucco will hang on a trowel

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.360
held at a 90 degree angle.  Stucco that
is mixed too wet will sag.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.490
Stucco that is mixed too dry will
not adhere properly to the metal lath.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.740
One bag of 80 pound base coat stucco
will cover about twenty seven square

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.660
feet

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.110
at three-eighths of an inch thick.  Using a
square trowel,

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.050
held at a 45 degree angle, apply the base
coat stucco using

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.300
firm trowel pressure to force the stucco
into the lath.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.139
Work from the bottom of the wall up and
apply at a thickness of

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.090
about three-eighths of an inch over the
entire area.  Then,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.889
using a straight edge or darby, screed the
stucco to a uniform

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.040
depth of 3/8 of an inch thick.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.970
Once the stucco has become thumb print hard,
scratch horizontal grooves, 1/8 of an inch

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.540
deep,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.419
into the base coat, across the entire
area with a raking tool.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.850
This is why this step is commonly
referred to as the scratch coat.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.770
Allow the scratch coat to cure for 24 to
48 hours.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.690
Keep the surface of the stucco damp with
a fine water mist.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.750
This step will help reduce shrinkage
cracking, especially in hot dry

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.260
conditions.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.400
Now, mix and apply another 3/8 inch layer

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.520
of base coat stucco directly to the
scratch coat.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.660
This step is called the brown coat.  Using
a straight board or darby,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.410
screed the brown coat surface to a true
even 3/8 inch thickness.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.840
Fill any surface boards with
additional base coat.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.490
The total combined base coat depth
should be three-quarters of an inch thick.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.130
As soon as the strucco has lost its
sheen, float the surface uniformly.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.930
Then, cure the base coat with a fine water
mist for 24 to 48 hours.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.230
For two-coat applications over masonry
block walls and poured concrete walls,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.610
the scratch coat step is eliminated from
the process.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.020
Simply dampen the wall.  Apply the brown
coat. Then, screed and float the surface to a

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.730
uniform 3/8 inch thickness.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.910
Now that the base coat is complete,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.360
QUIKRETE Finish Coat Stucco can be used
to provide numerous decorative color and

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.830
texture options for your stucco wall.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.820
Finish Coat Stucco is available in both
white and gray formulations

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.270
and can be combined with more than 20
standard QUIKRETE Stucco &amp; Mortar colors.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.699
Popular textures, such as heavy lace, light
lace,

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.389
dash, sand float and smooth finishes are
easy to achieve with a little practice.

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.680
Working from the bottom of the wall to
the top, apply a consistent 1/8

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.290
inch thick coating of Finish Coat
Stucco.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.250
Then, use a whisk brush to lightly dash
finish coat stucco onto the wall.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.720
Then, use a trowel to knock down and flatten the stucco.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.250
If you prefer a heavier texture, first
spread the finish coat stucco

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.550
in a thin application to achieve good color
coverage,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.550
and then, double back with a heavier
uneven application.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.160
Once the heavy coat begins to harden
knock the finish down with a trowel,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.790
creating a heavy lace finish.  If a
smooth finish is your preference,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.190
simply use a trowel or sponge float in a
circular motion.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.870
It is important to complete the entire
wall in one application.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.699
This will help limit any color
inconsistencies from batch to batch.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.300
Then, keep the surface damp for several
days by applying a fine water mist.
