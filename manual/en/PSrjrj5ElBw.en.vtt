00:00:00.473 --> 00:00:02.961
- Hi, Heather here again, and today,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.981
I am reviewing another Envy wig.

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.817
This time, it's the very popular Angie,

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:11.584
and the color I'm showing
today is Chocolate Cherry.

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.310
Now, I know that the most popular color

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.030
for this wig is Dark Red.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.426
This is very similar to the Dark Red,

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:20.259
except it's got a dark brown base.

00:00:22.315 --> 00:00:24.112
Their dark brown is pretty neutral,

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:26.862
it's not too golden, not too red.

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:31.252
Then, the highlights throughout are the

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:32.502
pretty dramatic

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:35.646
fiery copper red.

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:38.051
It's a very, very pretty color.

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.644
Definitely very well suited
for this particular wig,

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:44.894
because this is quite edgy.

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.141
In fact, when I tried it on,

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.242
my fiancee told me that it looked like an

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:53.627
extremely high end cosplay wig.

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:57.210
Which, if you're familiar with the cosplay

00:00:58.265 --> 00:00:59.120
phenomenon,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.092
you'll know that it's pretty trendy.

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:04.631
Very edgy wigs, very edgy hair pieces,

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.947
but usually they're not very expensive.

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:09.426
This might actually be
very good alternative

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:12.150
for someone who thinks that
that style is super cute,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.239
but wants a wig that hold
up a little bit longer than

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.749
a weekend at a convention. (laughs)

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.832
This wig is really, really well made.

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:25.025
It has a monofilament top

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:27.478
and a lace front

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:30.493
which will give you the appearance

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:32.988
of a human hairline, very, very realistic.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:35.488
It's short, and I'll show you.

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:39.124
It's quite short in the back,

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:40.687
doesn't even come close to my shoulders,

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:42.570
and I have virtually no neck,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.153
so it's a very, very short wig.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.246
I love these long face framing layers.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.414
I'll brush her forward a little bit

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.737
so you can see a little bit better.

00:01:54.737 --> 00:01:58.470
You can part Angie any way you want.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.696
I just went with where the natural part

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:02.494
in the wig was when I
got it out of the box.

00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:04.221
This is virtually out of the box,

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:06.923
all I did was shake it out a little bit.

00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:09.524
You'll note that it doesn't really seem

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:12.267
like it looks exactly
the same that it does

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:15.267
in the manufacturer photos for Envy.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.295
That's because all those
wigs have been styled,

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:21.966
and put on a very, very slender model

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.843
with giraffe neck. (chortles)

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.686
This is what it will
look like out of the box,

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:28.711
I can almost guarantee it.

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.589
It's still extremely beautiful,

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.235
even if it does look
a little bit different

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.581
from what it does in the
manufacturer's photo.

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:38.432
If you want the volume
that that particular photo

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:41.825
seems to represent, it's
not hard to acquire.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.726
All you need is some
synthetic wig friendly

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:44.726
styling gel,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.501
or something like that.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.513
You can actually use that sculpting gel

00:02:51.513 --> 00:02:53.696
to get some more volume out of Angie,

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:55.779
and it's not hard to get.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:59.488
You can basically make this
wig as big as you want,

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:02.667
'cause there is some volume
built in here at the crown.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.641
All you need to do, really,
is play with it a little bit,

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:08.880
and you can definitely bring out the most

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.873
in the razored layers
that occur in the back.

00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:14.963
They have a slight flip to them,

00:03:14.963 --> 00:03:19.516
and it's hard to see when
the wig isn't styled.

00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:22.178
I don't style the wigs
before I model them,

00:03:22.178 --> 00:03:25.034
'cause not everybody wants
to go through that hassle.

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:27.614
You can bring out the flip

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:31.020
with a little bit of styling creme,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.835
so keep that in mind.

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:35.944
Right out of the box, though,
she's incredibly cute.

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:37.802
I really, really like this cut.

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:40.582
It's very, very flattering
for fuller faces,

00:03:40.582 --> 00:03:43.389
because it's so structured
around the front.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.391
You can actually brush
it back off the face

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.326
if it starts to drive you
crazy, it'll still look cute.

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:51.636
You can actually have more
fringe cut into the bang

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:54.349
if that's what floats your boat.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.467
I really like this.

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.986
The Envy fibers are very light weight,

00:03:57.986 --> 00:04:00.596
they tend to be a little
on the shiny side.

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.161
Like I've said in other videos,

00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.149
"If the shine is a little bit more than

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:09.679
"what you prefer, it's
very easy to tame that

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.411
"with just a little bit
of dry, spray-on shampoo,

00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:14.910
"which is just basically spray-talc."

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.130
Just work that through the top layers

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.726
and that will take care of the shine.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.379
This color doesn't seem
to be too shiny, though.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:26.869
I think it's got just the
right amount of sheen.

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:30.953
I love the dramatic color,
it's very, very, very pretty.

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:33.684
Now, I'm going to take this one off,

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:37.684
so you can see what Angie
looks like underneath.

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:51.532
Like I said, Angie has a monofilament top.

00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:54.550
So, I definitely recommend
wearing a wig cap underneath it,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.110
because monofilament can
be a little scratchy.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.343
The wig cap will keep
that from bothering you.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:05.673
It has a comfort grip at the
top to keep Angie in place.

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:09.687
Like I said, it has a
very generous lace front

00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:11.854
to mimic a human hairline.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.599
The sides and back are open wefted

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.285
to allow Angie to breathe.

00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.702
There is quite a bit of hair on this wig.

00:05:24.662 --> 00:05:27.240
If you're ever worried
about the wind blowing,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.944
and people being able to see your hair,

00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:32.025
you'll be fine.

00:05:32.025 --> 00:05:33.784
Even though this wig is very short,

00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:35.470
you will still be able to get away with it

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.688
without having to worry about
every time the wind blows.

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:40.518
You can see in this particular color,

00:05:40.518 --> 00:05:43.401
that the highlights,
the red highlights are

00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:45.934
concentrated towards the top.

00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:47.850
They seem to emanate, pretty much,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.773
right from the crown
and from the top part.

00:05:51.773 --> 00:05:54.537
At the bottom, that's where you get

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:57.204
a lot of the darker brown color.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.982
That is extremely attractive
on this wig in particular,

00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:05.437
because she has so much layering going on.

00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:09.379
That color gradient will
bring out the layers,

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.792
and make them look a little bit snappier.

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:14.223
Now, I'm going to put this one on

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:17.556
so you can see how easy it is to put on.

00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:27.177
The Envy line is very, very comfortable if

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:29.859
you have a slightly larger head like I do.

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:32.672
This one, because it's short,
fits a little bit more snug,

00:06:32.672 --> 00:06:36.339
but it's still very,
very, very comfortable.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:38.737
And, there you go.

00:06:38.737 --> 00:06:39.651
Easy-peasy.

00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.289
The beautiful thing about
this slightly edgy look

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.869
is that you don't have
to brush it. (laughs)

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:47.881
You can just, literally,
run your fingers through it,

00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:50.137
and it's ready to go.

00:06:50.137 --> 00:06:52.970
So, this is the Angie wig by Envy,

00:06:54.877 --> 00:06:57.316
and the color is Chocolate Cherry.

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.066
Thanks for watching.
