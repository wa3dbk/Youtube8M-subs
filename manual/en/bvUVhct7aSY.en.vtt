Hi there, this particular drill here is called
my 12-inch dribble drill. Pro basketball,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:20.330
ball handling, 12-inch dribble drill. What
this does is it teaches you a phenomenal crossover

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.289
in between multiple players. For example,
I will come up to the garbage can with a dribble,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.280
cross and then immediately cross between the
garbage cans, for the lay-up. I will move

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.800
the garbage cans closer, I think right at
six inches, I will bring them in to twelve

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.600
inches down to about eight or six inches,
crossing between the garbage cans. Here we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:58.620
go. I'll just go slow first, so you get the
idea. Cross, cross, dribble, dribble, dribble,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.450
lay-up. Obviously, you want to make your lay-ups.
There's no excuses for missing lay-ups, no

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:17.700
matter what level you're on. Slow again, dribble,
dribble, dribble, cross through, and up. Okay,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:35.640
here we go. (demonstrating crossover) One,
now we'll bring it in closer. It gets very

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:51.729
interesting. (Demonstrating crossover). Got
to finish! Got to finish the basket, no excuses

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:11.980
to missing lay-ups. Get your mind right. Okay,
here is

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:24.110
six inches.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.800
Now, we'll go to the other side.
