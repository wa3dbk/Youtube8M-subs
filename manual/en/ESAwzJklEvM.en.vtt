00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.350
NARRATOR: If the CST-100 ever has to splash down in the water, engineers and designers

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.220
want to make sure the astronauts inside have everything they would need to keep themselves

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.160
and the spacecraft safe.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.510
That's why The Boeing Company tried out a host of equipment during recent testing

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.340
in a specialized facility outside Las Vegas.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.730
Boeing is developing the CST-100 in partnership with NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.870
The capsule-shaped spacecraft is intended to carry crews to low-Earth orbit

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.140
and offer NASA astronauts a vessel to space.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.840
The spacecraft is not meant to splash down in water to end a mission,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.510
but rather parachute to an open area of land.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.120
But that doesn't mean engineers are not preparing the capsule and crews in case a water

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.010
landing is called for.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.470
John McKinney: We want to make sure that the equipment that we have either in the vehicle

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.050
or the recovery forces bring with us is designed properly.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.480
NARRATOR: The testing took place at a Bigelow Aerospace facility near Las Vegas

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.500
and builds on activities that began last year.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.880
The evaluations provided engineers with significant insight to their designs and expectations.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.120
Alejandro Diaz: Crew safety is at the core of everything we do.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.300
We take the time out to do this development testing.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.070
You can think of many ideas at the office but once you get in here and test things out,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.410
that's when you actually determine how good something works.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.570
John McKinney: That's the beauty of testing, it is the real world.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.070
You can design all day long but until you take it out and test in a real environment,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.350
you don't know how it's going to perform.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.920
NARRATOR: Testing for the CST-100 design will continue throughout development.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.410
The spacecraft is expected to make its first space mission later this decade.
