Hi I'm David Cantieni on behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to be sharing with you some

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.170
useful techniques for practicing the Irish
style flute. In this segment I'd like to talk

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:23.320
about tone production and tone good tone come
with for most and with relaxation. So I recommend

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.230
pouring yourself a nice cup of tea or something
to drink that would relax your throat and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:40.980
your head and you'll enjoy. So here's to you.
The next thing to do for making a good tone

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.510
is I'd like to just show you here the flute
which you are probably familiar with; but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.400
this is where your wind is going to pass you
pass right over that section. So that is one

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.501
important part for making a good tone. Now
when you put it up to your mouth your are

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:13.530
going to want the edge of the tone hole to
be in the edge of your lip. Like this. You

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.040
want to be perfectly relax. Notice that I'm
not changing my mouth I'm just putting it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:32.229
up there just like I'm talking. Then without
doing very much you can just. Of course that

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.140
kind of sound inst what you are aiming for
in the long run. But you start there. The

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.900
next thing that you do is work on focusing
on that stream of air that is coming out of

00:01:44.900 --> 00:02:00.340
you mouth. As you make a small stream of air
you find that you can actually blow harder

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.439
and the harder you blow where you can get
a louder sound and you can get a more focus

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:20.139
sound. So the final step of this portion would
be playing and listening very hard to the

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:26.909
how the sound changes when you change the
stream of air. First you put up there.
