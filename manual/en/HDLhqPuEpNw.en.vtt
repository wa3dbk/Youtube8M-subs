You'd think that after playing over a thousand
iOS games it'd be harder to find games that

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.080
feel unique and fun, especially in genres
like the Platformer, given its sordid and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.500
over-used history in the 90s. In fact I'm
often more surprised than not at the creativity

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.460
of developers, but Muffin Knight by Angry
Mob Games certainly takes the cake (and that's

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.390
the yeast of the jokes you're going to have
to endure).

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.680
The premise is simple, if a little strange
- the amusing animated introduction tries

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.710
to make things clear. You've been magically
enchanted in an attempt to return all the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.800
pastry goods that have been scattered across
the landscape, with each one transforming

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.750
you in to one of over a dozen unique characters.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.440
Each of the eye-popping cartoonish levels
is essentially an 'endless' arcade game, pitting

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.320
you against a constant stream of increasingly
challenging monsters that act as obstacles

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.750
to your main objective of collecting muffins.
Each of the characters you transform in to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.270
has a unique power (from simply firing arrows,
to dropping unicorn 'mines' and even punching

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.899
them in the face) that can subsequently be
upgraded with points earned as you level up.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.990
Unlocking new levels is performed in one of
two ways - either by blunt force (by reaching

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.150
a target 'level' on your character) or by
skill (by collecting a target number of muffins

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.950
in a single round). As such, skilled players
are rewarded with easier leveling (as later

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.189
levels provide experience bonuses), while
those less talented at the game aren't punished

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.420
by being unable to progress - quite frankly
it's an ingenious system and one that deserves

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.490
as much praise as the game itself.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.219
Should you feel bored smacking around simple
AI characters you can up the challenge by

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.430
facing another player in a local multiplayer
match, but it would have been great to challenge

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.539
friends on Game Center online as well.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.899
Its one Achilles Heel is its control system,
which despite customization options can fail

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.369
to register touches at critical points due
to its smallish buttons. It's a minor quibble

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.490
and one that shouldn't stop you from enjoying
what is otherwise an amazingly fun game in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.129
Muffin Knight.
