00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:07.169
So we just learned how to use a capo in the
previous lesson but capos while they work,

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.730
they serve a function especially for singers/songwriters
who really are concentrating only at open

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.310
chords they are limiting in a since because
once their on you no longer have your open

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.360
strings to play on. Another way of creating
new chord shapes is by using your first finger

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.649
on your left hand as a bar and creating bar
shapes. The first shape we'll look at is the

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:40.500
E type bar chord. You'll see what I mean.
So watch! Here's what our bar will look like.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.230
Our first finger will be laid across the let's
say for example the fifth fret. You want to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.719
give it enough pressure just that first finger.
The closer you get to the fret the better,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.920
make sure your thumb is right behind that
bar. So you really get an open feeling from

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:10.970
it all. Now remember how our E major shape
had been second fretted A string, second fretted

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.140
the D, second fret of the G. Well watch this!
If we use a different fingering for the E

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.061
major here, use our third finger, our forth
finger and our second finger instead and we

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:34.670
move this shape all the way up and start on
the seventh fret and then we apply the bar

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.420
we have essentially moved an E major chord
up to the fifth fret. Which now has a base

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.870
note of A and has the same value as open A
major. Everybody might be like hey why do

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.300
I want to do this, this is more difficult
then A major. Because watch! This same shape

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.290
right here with your first finger barred,
your third finger arched on the seventh fret,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.369
forth finger arched on the seventh, second
finger arched on the sixth. If you move everything

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.660
up one fret, keep that same shape, now you
have a B flat major which before we couldn't

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.790
play. If you move that up one more we have
a B major. You notice how this works? Anywhere

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.219
we move the low E string being our base note,
and have this shape we have new chords.
