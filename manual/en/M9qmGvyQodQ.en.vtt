00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.450
Hello, DisneyCarToys here with my Frozen dolls,
and today we're going to play with Chelsea's

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.960
Clubhouse.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.070
This adorable Barbie set comes with everything
you see here, including the Chelsea doll.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.820
The Chelsea Clubhouse comes with adorable
furniture like this set of table and chairs,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.939
her kitchen with an oven and refridgerator,
and this little daybed.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.970
The house has two floors, and forget the stairs,
take the elevator!

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.009
The roof can act as Chelsea's bedroom, or
it can be a garden.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.381
Hey kids, Anna, and Barbie, and I are going
to go in the house to hang out, so you can

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.510
play with Chelsea a bit in her clubhouse,
but probably only ten minutes.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.800
If you need anything just holler.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.650
And get along!

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.920
Yay, Chelsea, thanks so much for having us
over!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.330
What should we all do together?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.530
Let's play pirates.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:08.460
We can be like Peter Pan, and we can sword
fight, and have eye patches.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.310
I don't want to play pirates, that's too much
of a boy thing.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.970
Let's do something girly, like play house
in the clubhouse.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.080
Now raise your hand if you want to play house.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.470
Oh man!

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.870
There needs to be another boy here!

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.720
Sorry Alex, you're outnumbered by girls.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.590
Looks like we're playing house.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
Okay everyone, here's the rules: I'm going
to be the mom, Alex of course will be the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840
dad.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.110
Krista and Felicia, you're the kids.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.909
And for this game of house we're going to
pretend it's Felicia's birthday and we're

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.410
making some cupcakes.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.120
Okay kids, I just finished making the cupcakes.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.590
Who wants to lick the bowl?

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.660
Now Krista, while the cupcakes are baking
I need you to take a nap.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.660
Ding!

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.720
Oh the cupcakes are ready everyone.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720
Mmm.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.010
They smell good.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.870
Oh Mommy Mommy, I lost my special stuffed
animal bunny, fluffy bunny.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.950
Oh Alex, I mean husband, I need to get the
cupcakes out of the oven.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.970
Can you help Felicia find her stuffed animal
bunny.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.910
Okay, I think it's upstairs.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.819
Going up!

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.170
I found the bunny!

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.400
Yay, yay, you found him.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:56.750
I don't know what I'd do without him!

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.470
Hey everybody, the birthday cupcakes are out
of the oven and ready to eat.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.360
(yawn) That was a good nap.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.599
I'm ready for my cupcake.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.840
Wait, there's only two cupcakes!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.780
Come on!
(knocking)

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.940
Come on kids, ready to go.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.430
Aww, we were just getting started.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.959
Sorry we have to leave, but you can play with
Chelsea another time.
