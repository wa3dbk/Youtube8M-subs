00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.770
This is a true story.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.040
Not the game, but what I’m about to tell
you.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.010
I’m sitting in the theater, they’re showing
the previews of upcoming movies…and one

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.150
of them actually turns out to be a video game.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.390
I mean, not that you could tell, it didn’t
show any gameplay whatsoever and it used every

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.770
single movie trailer cliche imaginable.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.330
But sure enough, it was a video game.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.180
When it’s over, my friend looks at me and
says, “That looks like the worst movie ever.”

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.430
And that’s what video games are now.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.770
They’re like Rachel Leigh Cook in She’s
All That.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.851
They think they need to be something else
to be the pretty girl, when in fact, they

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.480
were already very attractive.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.140
But no, video games think they need to be
movies for people to like them.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.800
That makes me not like them.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.010
Video games should want to be video games.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.140
Except this one.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.040
This one can be whatever it wants.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.380
Listen, I can count on my hands…how many
video games I’ve played that have told stories

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.390
worth remembering.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.710
Honestly, even good games often have lousy
stories filled with plot holes, and bad writing,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.330
and shallow characters…and that crap gets
in the way of what video games should deliver.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.100
That being fun gameplay.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.380
So it’s a pretty sad state of affairs.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130
Kind of makes me want to cry, but guess what.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.290
Only one video game has ever made me cry.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.110
And that’s The Walking Dead.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.130
This is a video game with a story worth remembering.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.229
In fact, this is a game with a story you won’t
forget.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.820
So this is season two of The Walking Dead—all
five downloadable episodes released on a single

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.820
retail disc.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.310
And it picks up shortly after the events of
the first season, in which we were introduced

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.880
to a little girl named Clementine.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.420
A little girl who’s journey has prompted
a more emotional reaction from me than any

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.680
other video game character, probably ever.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.870
But here’s the thing, I don’t want to
talk about it.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.720
One, because I’m trying to get over it,
and two, because I don’t want to spoil it.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.080
Seriously, you guys, if you haven’t played
it…go get season one right now.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.220
These episodes only take about 90 minutes
a piece.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.770
And when you finish one, it’s impossible
not to start the next one.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.470
For Clementine.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.020
Which brings us to season two.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.060
We meet back up with Clem shortly before she
experiences another horrific event sure to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.040
add a couple more years of therapy…and in
terms of the game, it’s pretty much what

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
you remember.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.360
Same awesome gameplay, same structure.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.730
It’s all the same as you remember.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.800
All the same, that is…except for Clementine.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.890
In fact, one of the coolest things about season
two…is that Clem isn’t the same girl she

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.190
was when we left her.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.270
All her awful experiences have hardened her.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.270
They’ve made her stronger.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:22.890
She’s not the one who needs protection anymore.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.450
So as you might’ve noticed, season two is
all about Clementine, and her evolution from

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.450
a scared little girl…to a little girl who
walks around with a hammer.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.450
This is her story.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.750
And the coolest thing about it…is that you
decide how far she goes.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.010
Your choices determine whether she’ll at
least retain the kindness she had in episode

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.010
one…

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.860
Or if her heart will become as hardened as
her nerves.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.110
You can make Clem do things you never would’ve
expected before.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.430
She might break into houses, or threaten people…she
can even use the cuteness that made you love

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.760
her…

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.069
To manipulate people.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.400
Suddenly, the hammer doesn’t seem so bad.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
So what’s not to like?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.750
Well, I will say this…the focus on Clementine
does came at the expense of other characters.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.510
Like, season one had more interesting characters.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.180
In this one, it seems like anyone who isn’t
Clementine is kind of only there for Clementine,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.180
you know?

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.570
To develop her character in one way or another.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.900
And actually, you know, we’re two seasons
into this now…and the game still has the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.040
same technical problems.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.090
It just doesn’t run that well.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.240
Which sucks, because the design work is so
incredibly good.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.180
Like, the art direction, and graphics, and
the voice work, and writing…

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.070
It’s just a shame it doesn’t have the
same quality on the technical side.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.030
But you know, even with those hiccups…you
guys still need to play this game.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.740
Or actually, maybe “game” isn’t even
the right word for this.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.230
It’s more like one of those choose-your-own
adventure novels, only in video.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.960
Or like a movie where, all that stuff you
yell at the screen?

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.389
Yeah, the characters actually listen.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.010
I don’t know, I never know what to call
this.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.919
That’s the brilliance of The Walking Dead.

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.610
It’s a game that tells a story, not in that
predictable, segmented, video game way.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.180
Gameplay, cut scene, more gameplay, another
boring cut scene.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.720
In this one, the story is the game, and the
game is the story.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.960
And even I have to admit…

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960
It works.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.770
You want to tell stories, video games?

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.590
Don’t try to be movies.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:40.800
Try to be The Walking Dead.
