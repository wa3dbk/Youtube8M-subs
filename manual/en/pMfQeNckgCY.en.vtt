ONE SPOT. I HAVE TO FIND THEM EACH TIME I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.460
COME HERE. THEY MIGHT BE ANYWHERE. THIS IS
ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD IN HERE,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.720
BUT WE HAVE TO FIND THAT EXACT SPOT. WHICH
IS THIS SPOT WHERE THE FISH ARE GOING TO BE.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.659
&lt;GUIDE&gt; WE RE JUST WAITING FOR THE TIME. IT
