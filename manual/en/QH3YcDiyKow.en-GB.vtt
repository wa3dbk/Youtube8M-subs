Okay, so there's this guy called cassette
boy, he basically steals innocent people's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.240
work. Rehashes it, re cuts it and makes us
all sound like rappers, good, and perverts.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.110
Hmm, not so good. So anyway I've heard he's
stolen a load of my tapes and apparently he's

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.010
done a new mash up. Hopefully, I won't have
to sue him.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.990
I'm just going to rap it up. Take one. Food
education and demonstrations this is going

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.739
to be big. We're going to carry on eating
like pigs, spatulas, tongs, there's no right

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.130
or wrongs. We have a laugh really, we have
a laugh. We're going to cook, tigers, giraffes,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.572
gas mark two and a half, this is the maddest
thing I've ever done. I'm having some fun,

00:00:41.572 --> 00:00:47.039
live from London, live in person, blatantly
naughty. Check out my recipe I went a bit

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:57.149
crazy, a little free gravy for you. Food Tube!
Get yourself a spoon, this is what I'm going

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.370
to do, just, for you. Me, Jamie Oliver, I'm
your man! I've got a thick bottom pan and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.710
people understand that. Tea towel just lands
in your hand like that. Freezeframe this,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.180
you can see my wang. Put it up on Instagram,
they'll close you down man. You can see it,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.880
you can feel it. Cheers man,
It's all happening with the hand, my wife

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.760
will definitely melt or grate chocolate over
that she would love that! Yeah!

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.400
Share it with your friends, give it to your
mother, show it to your boyfriend, show it

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.980
to your lover!
Just chop it up, you can just mash it up.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.130
Give it a good old mix up, give it a good
old bash it, flash me, slash me, slash me's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.930
not quite the right thing I wanted to say.
Yeah!

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.530
I'm going to have a nice dinner tonight. What's
not to like?

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.900
This is the man that represents Essex, like
that. Moo.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.850
Yeah, that's how we roll! We run out of budget.
So there we go, apparently I can rap. Thank

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.390
