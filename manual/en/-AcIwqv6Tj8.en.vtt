&gt;&gt;CLARK LINDGREN:
To me it always seems a real tragedy to have

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.170
a student come to college and say, “I want
to be a biology major” for whatever reason,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.910
or “I want to be a science major,” and
not find out until maybe their senior year

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.019
that actually the thing that biologists really
do isn’t very appealing to them.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.110
They were attracted to biology because they
were really good at doing biology in a course

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.110
structure.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.420
But throw them into a laboratory where there’s
a lot more open-endedness to the problems,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.100
[and] you have to use a lot more creativity
to solve your problems, they’re just lost

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.280
and they don’t really like it.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.670
So to me it seems almost like false advertising
to bring students in.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.330
“Trust us, you’ll like it.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.330
Trust us, you’ll like it.”

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.170
But we don’t really let them really “do
it” until maybe their senior year, and they

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.510
do an independent research project, and they
actually get to do something similar to what

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.000
we’re doing in BIO-150.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.040
&gt;&gt;SUE KOLBE:
The thing I like about the [BIO] 150s … that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.320
I think is special is, you learn to work with
people.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.830
Science doesn’t just happen — one person
looking at a microscope discovering things.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.000
… It happens with people.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:33.330
There’s like 10 or 12 different 150s, so
students can pick the 150 that they feel they

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.850
identify with the most, and then they buy
into it right away.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt;LINDGREN:
So [my section of the course] is called “The

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.340
Language of Neurons.”

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.590
The topic we focus on [is] how neurons communicate
… with other neurons.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.409
The idea is how do nerves communicate?

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.700
What is the nature of that form of talking
that they engage in between different cells?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.841
It’s an important, interesting question
as to how cells talk to each other in this

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:05.841
way.

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:09.860
They use a chemical message that gets transmitted
from one cell to the other and basically tells

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.109
the receiving cell what to do, whether to
become more active or to become less active.

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.620
That’s happening all the time.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:48.749
In fact, in the human brain, that’s happening
at trillions of synapses in the brain simultaneously.

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:49.749
…

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.290
As usual, it’s really impressive.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.909
You have to kind of keep pinching yourself
and saying these really are kids who, prior

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.889
to this semester, had done nothing like this
before, had [not] really taken any college-level

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.819
science classes or biology classes.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.639
And then you see something that’s not that
much different than what you see when you

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.050
go off to your professional meetings and do
this.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.969
&gt;&gt;MAISIE DOLAN ’15:
One of the cool things is that we’ve all

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.480
been working on the same things, like how
to write an abstract, how to ask scientific

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.491
questions, how to create a working hypothesis
and create an experiment that helps us prove

00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:29.829
the hypothesis — or disprove the hypothesis
(hopefully not!).

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.930
So all the [students] have the same tools
and the same structure but are all coming

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.279
at it from really different places.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.609
So that’s been really cool.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.690
They’re people working on sunscreen and
radiation or how hermit crabs walk up hills.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.200
&gt;&gt;LIZ QUEATHEM:
It looks good right now.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.090
I think we’ll have a lot of people come
out.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.629
We have a lot of our alumni who have come
back, so I’ve seen a lot of my students

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.560
from last year … that’s really fun.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.379
&gt;&gt;KATHRYN VINCENT ’13:
It’s really fun to come back and look at

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.669
people’s posters and see what projects they’re
doing and how they’re trying to think like

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:04.669
a scientist.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:11.459
I remember back in 150-days when we’re all
trying to wrap our heads around how to do

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.799
a project, and actually seeing it come to
fruition is really a cool thing to do.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.449
&gt;&gt;QUEATHEM:
If they see somebody who did a project looking

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.000
at, let’s say, joint angles in goats, and
they did a project on sheep last year, they’re

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.780
so excited.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.100
And they know what to ask because they know
the morphology.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.450
So, it’s good.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.930
&gt;&gt;LINDGREN:
Obviously, this represents a lot of hard work

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:42.630
and commitment to having done this during
the semester.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.240
It’s really fun to see how much this event
itself means to them.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.630
They’re taking this very seriously.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.790
It’s very important.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.949
That’s a feature of this way of teaching
that’s really hard to get any other way,

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.310
so students really own it.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.659
This isn’t just something they’re doing
because we tell them they have to do it.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.650
They really want to do this because, at some
point along the way, after they spend enough

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.740
time on these projects, they really become
their projects.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.930
And that’s just a whole different way of
looking at whatever you’re doing.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.330
If it’s something you really want and you
think is important, you’re going to own

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.439
it and contribute in a way that you don’t
… if you’re just being told to do it.
