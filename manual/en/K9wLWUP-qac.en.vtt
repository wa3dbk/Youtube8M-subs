THE PRESIDENT: It is just wonderful to be here on this beautiful day.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:15.767
Congratulations to Coach Geno on
just the incredible season that

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.800
took place as a consequence of
these extraordinary young women.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.633
I want to just say
that it is a thrill.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.834
This is one of my favorite
things about the job.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.166
I am a big fan.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:32.600
I want to congratulate everybody
who runs the UCONN program --

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.633
from the assistants to the
trainers, to the students to the

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:39.200
ticket-takers, and of course,
the UCONN fans everywhere -- you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.567
should all be
extraordinarily proud.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:46.333
And I want to thank again Coach,
and his wife Kathy, for being here.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.367
Congratulations also on being
Coach of the Year -- although

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.367
when you're winning by an
average of 30 points, it's not

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:55.133
that hard of a selection -- (laughter) -- to make.

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.633
And we are thrilled that you're going to be coaching the Women's

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:01.300
Basketball team in
the 2012 Olympics.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
You're going to do a great job.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.734
(Applause.)

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.300
Under Coach Auriemma's leadership, this Huskies program

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.967
has redefined excellence again and again: Six of the last 15

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:24.867
NCAA Titles, five undefeated regular seasons, three

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:31.166
undefeated championship
seasons, two 39-0 seasons.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.700
But for this team, an undefeated
season just wasn't enough --

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.934
they became the first team in
NCAA history, men or women's, to

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:44.533
win every single game by double digits -- (applause) which is

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:48.834
just an unbelievable,
unbelievable statistic.

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:53.567
I want to congratulate also Maya, who is here -- Maya Moore

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:54.333
-- there you are.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.000
Raise your hand.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.166
Naismith Award, National Player
of the Year, and an equally

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.000
impressive achievement -- Maya
was one of only five players

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.033
chosen nationwide as first-team
Academic All-American.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.100
So give it up for Maya.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.100
(Applause.)

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.333
Renee Montgomery --
where's Renee?

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.200
There you are, Renee, holding
the ball -- for winning the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.900
Honda Sports Award that
recognizes the top women's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.567
player in the country not
just for athletics, but also

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:30.100
academics, leadership, and
willingness to give back to her

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.867
community; and to all the
players who make a true team.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:38.266
It's clear these women have a
competitive streak -- from what

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:43.800
I understand, they have trouble
sometimes turning off that competitive streak.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.300
I've heard that "Movie
Pictionary" gets pretty fierce

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.567
among the women here.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.800
But Coach Geno and each of these women also understands that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.467
being champion doesn't stop
when you step off the court.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:03:01.400
Just last week, these ladies
were recognized by the NCAA for

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.200
top academic
performance as a team.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.233
And over the course of 24 seasons, Coach Geno's teams have

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.500
a 100-percent
graduation rate.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.834
That is worthy of some applause.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:18.734
(Applause.)

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:22.200
They also spend time off the court in service to others.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.567
"Geno's Cancer Team" -- and I'm
wearing a bracelet that I just

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:33.266
got, right here, I want to show
it off -- raises money to fight cancer.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:37.000
And these young women visit
pediatric patients, mentor

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.166
at-risk youth to show they can
make something of themselves,

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.700
and give their time to folks
in the communities who need it most.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.867
All of this makes the Storrs
community stronger; it makes the

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:51.767
state of Connecticut stronger;
it makes our country stronger --

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:55.133
and I know this team gets
a lot out of it in return.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:59.633
I also want to say
something as a father.

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:03.033
You know, it was this program
in the mid-1990s as much as

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:07.400
anything that helped propel
women's basketball into the national consciousness.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.266
Thanks to players like each of these women and those who came

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:13.633
before them, our young women today look at themselves

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:19.300
differently, especially tall
young women, like my daughters.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.133
My girls look at the TV when I'm
watching SportsCenter and they

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.934
see women staring back.

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:26.333
That shows them that they
can be champions, too.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:29.900
And so, as a father, I
want to thank all of you.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.600
Thank you to all the NCAA female
athletes who work hard day in,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.567
day out to set a positive
example to which our daughters

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:43.033
can all aspire -- to be healthy
and active, to be part of a team.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.633
Finally, I understand that Coach
Geno has promised to go 40-0 next season.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:48.567
(Laughter.)

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:53.100
So, Coach, if that happens, I guarantee you that you will be

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500
welcome back at the White House.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.300
(Laughter.)

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.066
All right, give them a
big round of applause.

00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:59.033
(Applause.)

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.300
All right.
