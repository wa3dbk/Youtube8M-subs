Daddy Troy: Welcome back to Gear Daddy. I’m
your host Daddy Troy. You know last week we

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.830
looked at the off road Urban Jungle Stroller.
This week we are going to the opposite end

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.820
of the spectrum. We are going to talk about
the top 10 things to look for when you buy

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:25.620
an umbrella stroller.
And umbrella stroller is the lightest and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.170
most compact of all strollers. They can be
left in the car for everyday use. Their small

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.140
profile makes them ideal for traveling. And
they are also very, very cheap. One of these

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
will cost you about $15 at a big box store.
Today I am going to list the top 10 things

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.149
to look for when you go to buy one of these
umbrella strollers. But you can put your pens

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.909
away because we have a printable list at DadLabs.com
episode 284. So let’s get started.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.079
The first thing we are going to look at are
the wheels. Now you will notice on these strollers

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.440
these wheels are not inflatable they are usually
just pieces of plastic. And therefore they

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.579
are the first things that are going to go.
And you will notice the wheels on this particular

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.530
stroller are actually thicker, a little more
durable and cushiony than the ones on this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.250
stroller over here that are thinner and might
be more apt to wear out first. Now unlike

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.860
higher end strollers these strollers right
here don’t have an extension. So tall dads

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.250
would actually have a problem with how low
to the ground these are. You are always bending

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.579
over to push it. If you can find one that
has extension, go for it.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.229
And in order to stop the strollers from rolling
with your kid in it or to keep another kid

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.350
from pushing it a lot of strollers come with
a braking mechanism. As you can see right

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.119
here you use your foot to depress it and it
brakes. And then the stroller doesn’t move.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.369
Now these are cheap plastic. And so you want
to make sure you get sturdy cheap plastic

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.609
so that the stroller won’t move. It is a
safety mechanism.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.330
And speaking of safety the American Academy
of Pediatrics has published a report that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.759
says about 13,000 kid each year are taken
to the emergency room for a stroller related

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.079
accident. Now about 75% of those come from
kids falling out of the stroller. So you can

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.799
guess what the most important part of he stroller
is going to be-it’s going to be the buckle.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.700
Now as a parent you are always going to be
buckling your kid in even though you might

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.340
be tempted not to. And you want to make sure
that the buckle is both sturdy and one that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.369
you can easily use, not all buckles are created
equally.

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
Another 11% of injuries come from the stroller
tipping over. Sometimes from the parent putting

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.530
a bag, just like a shopping bag on the back
of the stroller and there it goes. So you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.451
never want to do that. Now some strollers
not very many of these umbrella strollers

00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:22.610
come with some sort of storage mechanism underneath.
That gives a low center of gravity. Its’

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.850
within the base of support and therefore keeps
it from tipping over. Those are a little harder

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.420
to find but worth it if you planning on storing
some stuff while you’re out on a stroll.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.690
The small footprint of an umbrella stroller
allows you to navigate really crowded areas.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.170
You will also notice that the front wheels
turn a lot so that makes it really easy to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.840
move around. But if you ever find yourself
on a straightaway and you just want to keep

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.870
going straight find a stroller that allows
the front wheels to be locked into place.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.490
And this becomes especially useful the older
the stroller gets. The wheels become slightly

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.260
unbalanced; the whole thing is a little wonky.
If these are locked down it will go straight.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.060
And when you are going straight it won’t
wobble back and forth on you.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.471
Umbrella strollers are not designed for comfort.
They are actually pretty uncomfortable and

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:06.240
your kid wont spend a whole lot of time in
it but nonetheless you still want to make

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.350
sure that at least when your kid sits in it
he or she finds it somewhat comfortable. So

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.940
take your kid along with you pop it out and
put the kid in it. Now remember you as the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.260
adult make the final decision but at least
you can look at your kid in it and see if

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.630
it’s too small or too big for your kid or
if it might pinch the kid somewhere.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.690
The reason these are called umbrella strollers
is number one because they kind of look like

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.430
it when they are collapsed. And number two
they collapse. So you want to look at the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.160
collapsing mechanism. It’s usually on the
back. There are a variety of different types.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.240
This one in particular you stick your foot
underneath, you pull out and boom the whole

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.520
thing just collapses. Now be careful and don’t
do this with your hands because you risk getting

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.830
pinched. Which brings up my final safety point
that the AP Report said that one of the injuries

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.410
that kids get is really small but it is also
pinching with strollers. So be careful with

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.650
that. If you watched my episode last week
you know that one of my big pet peeves is

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.800
sun and rain protection on strollers. Now
with these lower end strollers you seldom

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.570
get really good sun or rain protection. You
look at this stroller right here, there actually

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.430
isn’t any on this one. And you look at this
stroller right here there actually isn’t

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.360
any on this on either. That thing doesn’t
actually do that much in terms of sun and

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.390
or rain.
Now if you are going to have one of these

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.330
sun or rain shades find one that the whole
thing tilts on it’s axis. Notice that this

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.670
one is locked in place. All you can do is
bring it forward and it stops. If the whole

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.580
thing could actually tilt forward then you
could change it with the angle of the sun

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.880
and maybe leave the sun off your baby’s
face.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.260
And finally number ten when you go to collapse
the stroller and throw it in the trunk you

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.920
need to some sort of mechanism to by which
to keep it as one unit. This particular stroller

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.240
right here has a piece of plastic such that
when I collapse it, you simply clasp and shut.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.410
Well that’s it this week for Gear Daddy.
Remember all 10 points are listed at DadLabs.com
