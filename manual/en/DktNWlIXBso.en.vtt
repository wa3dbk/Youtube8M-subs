00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.319
former miami hurricanes football player
tyrone mosk lanes that he did not take

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.339
money from a booster by the name of
neves uh... shapiro so um... it was

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.949
alleged that he had accepted one
thousand dollars on shapiro's yacht when

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.890
he was playing college football uh...
but he completely denies it in fact

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.649
several players for the miami hurricanes
uh... denied that

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.249
this happened or when they're being
questioned by uh... reporters they

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.089
completely change the subject

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.210
his subject it usually means that he did
accept money calm but this is an ongoing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.429
issue within college sophomore college
football teams and at and always brings

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:40.850
out the question of whether or not they
should be compensated in one way or

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.749
another so they're not taking money from
boosters yeah and and this woodcock

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.469
there's always different elements of
these cannisters him i mean i has huge

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.470
blow up

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.919
and existence is a sort of piracy of
incidentally an art belief

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:59.339
their acting like they had the senate
control and don't unknown unknown usual

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.630
there's so this is a matter of of
keeping it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.510
but this is the smallest or under wraps
enough the people can continue to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
believe that this is curious with
college sports right behind that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.910
economic

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.750
extracurricular activities and they go
back to classic yeah

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.890
i'm so proud

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.479
but my football play gabby this class
for a fact that there is a playful

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.439
monitor play basketball certain ones you
know something as opposed to an end to

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.159
course with the cost of education you
what i have a way around it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.520
union but

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.270
the probability all of the as you know
tara most of the player

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.969
we always come after the players

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.530
and as a anything about another mode

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.569
more window of the israelis beyond the
boosters

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.849
the rich alarmed to discover ronan job
dollar bills and people on thousands of

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.619
dollars at these kids

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.229
and then there's a whole you know

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.580
maybe these eighteen year old

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.610
in nineteen twenty old kids ages one by
leading the rules unisys go around and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.100

your arm out this fun about these funds
dried up

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.729
and also also it's important to keep in
mind that these students are in such a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.900
boner of all places right because

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.630
not only are they playing football and
making these universities so much money

tuition just like any other student i

does someone get scholarships but a lot
of them down right so they stuff today

good states was financed with both of

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.519
the work

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.570
if you started on our own strengths

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.139
