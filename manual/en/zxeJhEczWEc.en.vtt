Hi there, my name's Lanny Jackson and I'm the

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.900
assistant manager at the Richmond go
kart track. Can you tell us a little bit

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.500
about

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.820
Richmond go karting and how it got started.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.070
Sure, Richmond go kart has been in
operation for sixty years. The current

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.040
ownership

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.040
have had it for about forty-three years
and I used to come here when I was a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.350
kid ten-years-old years ago and it's
the same

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.700
track only it's always been upgraded
and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.900
fixed up over the years. Awesome. Yeah it's a
great

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.909
happy place and we really enjoy it.
Right now we're sitting in the new

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.830
high-performance karts. Can you tell us why you
decided to get these

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.870
and what the plan is. People were coming off
the track 'well that was fun but karts

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.800
are a little slower for the older
individuals' and so we decided to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.850
pride to get a little bit faster karts out for

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.600
some of the older guys and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
it's been working out really well

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490
Over the War Room we are

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.360
big fans of Richmond Go-Karting. Can you tell us

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.300
how it got to a place where it such a
following on a different social media

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.990
networks

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.400
well we advertise primarily in
newsprint

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.610
and we do some advertising on radio
ferries is here which is something new

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.200
for us

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.300
in the pamphlets and stuff and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.780
we also advertise on the back of the buses this year

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.960
trying out a few different things to
advertise that our brand new karts is here

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.700
video marketing it's brand new process
here. Martin put together a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.140
video of our new karts and it's put on our
website

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.000
and it's looking very good. So everybody come
out and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.239
give it a try
