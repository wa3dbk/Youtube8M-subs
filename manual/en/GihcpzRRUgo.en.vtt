Hey, what's up you guys, it's Travis.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.040
Right now I am in a
hotel room.  I'm in a hotel room because,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.000
you guessed it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
I sold my ass for crack last night.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.389
Yes, I did.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.500
I was trying to think of things to stay busy. So I decided to come up with a list of my favorite

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
things to do in a hotel room to stay busy.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.859
Play with a lamp.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.900
Be a lamp.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.000
Hang up your lips.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Drink some coffee.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.539
Have a pillow fight with yourself.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.920
(laughing)

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500
Crash from the coffee.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.010
Drink more coffee.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Fix your hair.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Have a dance party.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:01:00.000
(Dance music playing)

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.700
Practice yoga.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.260
Get freaked out when you see a window
cleaner outside your hotel room.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800
What the f**k?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
Be a ghost.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
Boo....booo.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.560
Crash from the coffee again.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.100
Drink more coffee!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640
Have a caffeine overdose.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.850
Lose your f**king mind.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.800
Read a magazine.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.100
That reminds me of the time we went to the Poconos....(snooty laughter)

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.640
Look at the room service menu.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.600
Eat the room service menu.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.200
Take the stairs.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.750
(stepping downstairs sound)

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.400
Take the elevator.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.900
(elevator ding sound)

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.320
And those are the things that you can do to stay busy when you're alone in a hotel room.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.700
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.700
This is ridiculous

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.270
What are you doing?
