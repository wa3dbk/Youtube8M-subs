Why Christians do not accept Jesus Christ? Documentary

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.000
How can we explain that Jesus is the Messiah, if God forbids human sacrifice?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.500
How can we explain that Jesus is the Messiah, when it is written that the Messiah will bring peace,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200
...and he said, I have not come to bring peace, but a sword?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
Jesus Christ, a false god

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.500
It is attributed to Jesus to a deification, he never had

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Jesus did not have any awareness of having pre-existed forever

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.500
How can Jesus be the Messiah, if the only way that gives the right to the throne of David, is from the father, not mother,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.500
but according to the New Testament Jesus had no human father?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Paul's interpretation, by his followers, interpret to Paul in a way that does not fully correct

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.266
that has influenced an interpretative tradition of over 18 centuries until now,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.500
and now we must think again

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.500
he was a different man

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
how can you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, when it is written, that the Messiah will remove all idolatry from the earth, and Christians are idolaters

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Yeshua is his real name

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It is without any doubt, we think of a Jesus fully law-abiding, fully Jewish,  stuck to the Torah, the Torah teacher, who never broke the law ...

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.000
in short words, he was a Jew, that he did not try, he did not attempt to found Christianity none

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Jesus' teachings transmitted and remembered in Greek, is a Jesus, not original

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.500
is a Jesus, reinterpreted, rethought and rewritten

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
