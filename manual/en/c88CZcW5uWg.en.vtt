00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.620
Most of the Bayern players have been back in training for one week now and with me is coach Pep Guardiola.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.820
You’re looking forward to your third season at Bayern now.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.340
Do you know the club by heart now?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.260
No. At big clubs like Bayern Munich there are always surprises lurking.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.840
Of course I know the team, the club, the city and the Bundesliga better.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.360
That’s normal after two years but as a coach it’s always most important to focus on your players

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.160
and on how to best support them.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.700
I need to focus on our opponents and on my team –

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.520
everything else is handled by the fantastic organisation at Bayern Munich.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.660
You said you know the city of Munich.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.120
You’re very popular in this town. How important is that for you?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.460
It’s very important.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.120
I’m the coach of Bayern Munich but I’m a normal person

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.480
who wants to be in touch with the people in the city I live in.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.140
I go to restaurants and other places in town.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:35.480
I love to talk to people from here and I have to say the people here have been wonderful to me from day one.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.980
Does your family still like it here too?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.220
Yes, they felt comfortable here form the very start.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:51.780
The kids are in school and speak German better each day. Everything is fine.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.060
Your players enjoyed a very long holiday which was longer than last season after the World Cup.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.400
What effect will that have on the season?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.640
Do you think the team will be better from the start?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:14.600
Seven or eight of our players had a very short holiday last season following the World Cup.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.100
However, they showed outstanding performances in the Bundesliga,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.280
the cup and also in the Champions League last season.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.160
When I still used to be a player we had more time to recover and regenerate

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.040
but nowadays the schedule is increasingly busy with more and more matches to play.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.060
We play more competitive matches and more test matches than we used too

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.000
but of course the same applies to each and every team.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.480
It’s best in that situation to not dream about an ideal situation but to adapt to any situation which arises.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.100
On Saturday the international players return and new signing Douglas Costa arrives too.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.640
How quickly do you think he can integrate here? As quickly as Juan Bernat did last season?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.540
That would be good.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.020
We needed a player who has his strength in one-on-one duels with opponents.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.440
Last season we experienced difficulties due to the long injuries of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.160
So we needed a player with the talent to win individual duels who can also play on both wings.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.600
He’s a young player, only 24 years old

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.000
and in the past five or six years he’s been competing in the Champions League.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.220
With Shaktar Donetzk he usually made it to the round of 16 or even the quarterfinals

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.340
and now he plays for the Brazilian national team.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.080
In the club we are all convinced of him.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.660
Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Matthias Sammer and Michael Reschke –

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.720
we are all convinced he will help us in the next four or five years.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.820
Next week the Bayern team travels to China for eight days.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.840
Do you expect that will be tough travelling or are you hoping for an enjoyable and interesting trip?

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:14.440
When I was a young coach at Barcelona I always considered these trips to China

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.240
or the USA to be a problem

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:24.120
but last season when we travelled to the US or on past trips to China

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.080
the club Bayern Munich did a great job organising these trips.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.620
It’s usually pretty comfortable.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.600
Obviously this is a trip for our sponsors but that is completely normal nowadays.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.180
Clubs have to travel around the world to show themselves

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.980
and to establish themselves in different places.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.040
We will play three test matches against good teams:

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.860
Inter Milan, Valencia and Guangzhou Evergrande.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320
I expect it will be good.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.940
Last year’s pre-season trip to the USA was good too.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.040
So it’s a good preparation to.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.780
Thank you Pep Guardiola
