Hi!

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
It’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.380
Today, we are going to show you how to change
the door gasket on your dishwasher and it’s

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.830
a really easy job; you won’t need any tools.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.670
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.330
Now to do this repair we will start by opening
the dishwasher door completely and then we

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:24.800
will just reach into one corner and see if
we can get a piece of that gasket, pull it

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:37.140
out and simply peel it out of the opening
of the dishwasher tub until it is completely

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.140
removed.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:48.719
You will note that each hand is curled up
about an half an inch and we can take the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.059
new gasket and you will note on the old one
that there is a little rib on either side

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.969
that will go into the dishwasher first.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.780
So we will start by cleaning that opening,
make sure there is no debris particularly

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.420
in the corners; remove any of that might impede.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.100
However, the gasket will fit in there and
you can wipe that out that over the rag just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.000
to make sure that it is nice and clean and
dry.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.520
We will take that gasket and we will start
it in one end allowing enough room to make

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:42.939
that bend on it, and then we are simply just
going to press that into place all the way

00:01:42.939 --> 00:02:34.260
around and we want to take care that we don’t
stretch it in the corners; maybe we should

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.760
have the same amount on the opposite end to
tuck into the corner; if not take note of

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.879
how much you would be short or how long extra
you would have been and center it up and then

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:55.480
start over, and again make sure that we don’t
stretch it in the corners, and then you can

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:06.569
close the door to check the fit 
and your repair is complete.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.530
I told you it was an easy job.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.900
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
