00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.189
once you know how to create button
symbols and movie clips symbols you

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.219
can combine the two to create animated buttons

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.409
let's go ahead and see the three buttons
that are already working in this

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.639
project so you can see how this works

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.700
so right now

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.390
as soon as I hover over a button
you're going to see the movie clip on

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.699
the overstate start to animate

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.819
so anytime I hover over each one of these
animals they start to move

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.700
and I've also added a sound clip so
that when they click the downstate

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.760
you can hear the sound of the animal

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.970
now what we need to do is add the one for the horse

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.930
and were going to that by first creating a button symbol

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.470
and then for the downstate or the
overstate were going to create a movie clip

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.900
so to do this I'm going to look in my library and I have everything organized into

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.930
folders

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.100
and I want the very first

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.700
frame of the button to be my course one picture

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.360
so the picture that's gonna start out
the same picture that will start out for

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.290
the movie clip

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.270
so I'll go ahead and drag my horse onto the button

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000
kinda get it positioned exactly the way I want it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.930
and then I'll select all the elements
that make up that button

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.180
modify convert to symbol

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.320
and call this btn horse

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830
make sure I change it to a button symbol

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.880
and then click ok

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.440
now I can double click inside of that button

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520
and my upstate is just going to be a
regular static

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.460
non moving horse

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.600
from my overstate I want it to still have
the same shape AND the same text

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.370
and I do actually wanna start out
with this first frame of the horse

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.480
so I'll go ahead and hit f6 on my keyboard or that's the same as doing insert timeline

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.880
in key frame

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.830
that's gonna copy everything on the the key
frame before it

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.520
to the over layer

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.860
or to the over frame

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.260
now what I need to do is I need to change
this from a regular old graphic symbol

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.720
of horse one

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.290
to a movie clip

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.360
and inside of that movie clip we're
gonna have these four different pictures

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.970
to keep looping and show the animation
of walking

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.879
so with that horse selected

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.819
I'll go up to modify

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.450
convert to symbol

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.029
make sure it's movie clip

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:19.649
and then type mc horse

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.900
now I can double click inside of there

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.089
and now I have a movie clip you can see
I have a movie clip within

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:31.249
the button symbol within seen one
and I can start adding my animation here

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.619
so I want

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.259
one two three and four frames

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.549
for my one two three and four pictures

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.179
I'll click on the second frame and hit f7

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.869
and do that all the way up through frame
four

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.879
so that I can make room for all of my
horse pictures

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.489
so I'll grab the second horse picture

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.529
for frame two

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.549
and the third

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.999
for frame three

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.600
and the fourth

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.569
for frame four

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.799
now I don't want to move this original
picture because I want to look exactly

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.979
the same as it did on the out state for the
button

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.799
so this is the one i'm gonna use to
guide the alignment of my horse

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.059
it's easier to do this when you have the onion
skinning on

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.700
and you can go ahead and stretch this out to about four frames so you can see all the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.109
four frames

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.079
so I'll click on the second frame

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.249
and well zoom in on this and get pretty
darn close

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.549
and i'm going to try to line up

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.359
his eyes

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.529
alright so I'll click on frame three

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:40.229
grab that horse

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.689
try to line it up

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.629
and then frame four

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.819
and try to line it up

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.839
and this might take some tweaking

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.449
and you'll have to test this animation
and see if he looks like he's jerking

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.679
around too much then you might have to
adjust the positioning of one of these

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.000
frames

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.500
so now I can go back into my button

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.180
and I have a movie clip on the overstate

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.900
and it's gonna animate when a mouse hovers
over it but I also want it to still be

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.389
animating when I have somebody click
on the button

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.029
so I'll just hit f5 on my keyboard I don't
need another key frame because I just

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:18.289
it to keep whatever was happening on
the overstate

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.289
now to add an audio

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.330
I can click a new layer

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.700
and when a person clicks on a button I
want it to make a sound so in order

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.389
to add audio to this frame I need to create a blank key frame

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.169
and then from here I can go up to the
properties panel

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.869
and choose the horse WHENNY sound

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:39.580
and it only brings up the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.800
sound files that I've actually loaded
into my library

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.390
and now that sound is on the downstate

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.029
so let's see what we've got going we'll

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.919
go back to scene one

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.559
and we'll zoom out

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:56.800
and test

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.490
and now when I rollover the horse should move

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.279
and I do see some things that I might
wanna tweak

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.349
there's some weirdness happening there
so it looks like I'm going to need to position

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.600
this horse a little bit to fine tune it

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.759
but as soon as I press

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:11.889
down

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.599
I should hear a horse WHEENY okay

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.199
so that's how to make animated buttons

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.039
by using both the button symbol

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.000
with a nested movie clip

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.560
inside of it
