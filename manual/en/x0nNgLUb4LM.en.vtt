00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.630
Some religious groups require followers to
fast for many hours a day, and continue that

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.630
fast for days or weeks!

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.150
Isn't not eating for 16 hours a day every
day dangerous?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.660
Bom dia earthlings, thanks for stopping by
DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.190
The Holy Month of Ramadan is wrapping up this
week, and those Muslims who have been fasting

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.300
for 15 hours a day or more will be able to
enjoy food anytime again.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.230
It's not just Muslims who fast, Christians,
Jews, Confucians, Hindus and other religions

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.989
have followed the practice for 1000s of years.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.059
Non-religious folks fast too, usually for
medical or dietary reasons.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.499
For some people, the idea of abstaining from
food while the sun is in the sky is unfathomable,

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.530
and they might feel that's it's unsafe!

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.489
So science is here to demystify some fasting
myths.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.710
A person is considered to be "fasting" if
they've abstained from a meal for 8-12 hours,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.440
so if you think about it, most people fast
every night -- and BREAK their fast in the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440
morning.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.069
That's where the term BREAK-FAST came from.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.840
Fasting is a completely normal part of being
an animal on the planet earth.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.600
Many organisms eat only once a day or less,
especially those eating high-calorie foods

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.670
like meats.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.030
Cold-blooded carnivores, like snakes, can
go DAYS between meals, warm blooded carnivores,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.530
like wolves or coyotes, hunt daily.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.840
Like the coyote, humans are built to be able
to fast for a short period.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.259
A day or so isn't going to hurt you and some
studies have shown short-term fasts can extend

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.719
lifespan, boost immunity and mental function,
and so on.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.899
We did a whole video about that last Ramadan.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.640
A study published last month in Cell Stem
Cell found that fasting two to four days at

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.890
a time can cause a reduction in white blood
cells, which is actually a GOOD thing.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.790
See, the cells that are killed off are the
older or damaged immune cells, and when the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.219
body rebounds, it uses stem cells to create
brand new, healthy ones.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.719
Long-term fasting, on the other hand, is a
whole other beast.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.289
When humans fast, our bodies go through a
very predictable schedule.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.450
Our bodies are great at squirreling away energy
in the forms of fats and sugars.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.990
But, like coyotes, ideally, we'd eat every
day or so to replenish those reserves.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.760
After 24-48 hours of fasting, the glycogen
reserves stored in our liver and muscles -- basically

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.010
carbohydrates -- are empty.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.099
After two days, the body's figured out that
it needs to feed on itself, and will begin

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.230
breaking down muscle and fat tissues.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.209
Obviously, water is important too.

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.620
72 hours without water is dangerous, so while
straight food fasting isn't so bad for you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.319
in this short a burst, 72 hours is the beginning
of medical dehydration.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.959
So drink water, no matter what.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.569
Some of you might already be Yahoo-ing to
get the lowdown on a fasting diet, but the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.790
problem is, we don't REALLY work that way.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.960
When you fast, you lose a few pounds right
away, but it's mainly liquid weight, and it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.099
will be replaced as soon as you eat again.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.310
Which is another thing, Researchers at Cornell
asked college students to fast for 18 hours,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.040
and then offered them a buffet-style meal
(not unlike Iftar, or community meals after

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.739
sundown during Ramadan).

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.930
THe most popular foods were those that were
high in calories, carbs and starches, because

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590
our cells don't know if we're EVER GOING TO
EAT AGAIN!

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.150
Therefore, they turn on the cravings for carbs
and fats which might fend off long-term starvation.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.920
But that's silly, you know you're going to
eat again!

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.519
Don't listen to your reptilian brain!

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.650
Ideally, a human coming off of a fast would
eat vegetables and fruits.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.220
Lean meats and a few carbs can be part of
the meal, but not a big part.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.670
Ultimately, fasting puts stress on the systems
of your body, but low-level stress isn't going

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.410
to hurt you, and it might build up the systems
-- similar to how exercise stress builds muscles.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.069
Fasting isn't dangerous or deadly, as long
as it's done properly and in partnership with

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.190
a healthy diet and exercise.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.000
If you decide to fast, let us know why and
how you've done it!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We're curious.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.269

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.980
heck it's doing up there come to our SpaceOut
on July 30th at 4pm Pacific Time!

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.260
We're getting experts from NASA JPL who actually

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.520
Martian for Day!

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.510
