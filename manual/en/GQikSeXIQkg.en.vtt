We are Benny and Carine Steveninck

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.152
We have been racing pigeons
since 1997

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.786
and we have been quite successful.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.901
Here we are at the breeding loft.

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.494

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.389
80% of my breeders are
related to Chipo.

00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.143
This pigeon is Chipo,
he needs no introduction.

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:18.949
This is a very tame and
friendly pigeon which begged

00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:22.151
to be basketed as a young bird.

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:27.819

basketed for races up to 600 km.

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:50.545

the young birds from the second round.

00:02:42.422 --> 00:02:45.036
They are raced in two sections,

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:48.119
one for cocks and one for hens.

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:53.964
We have a few pigeons left
which have not yet been moved

00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:56.566

Crack is a son of Chipo.

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:26.746

to the dam of his sire;

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:12.362
