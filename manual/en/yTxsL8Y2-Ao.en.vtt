00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.400
Hello and welcome back

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.680
In my last video I split Queen Helen, and Wil, my friend that was with me there

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.380
took one of the nucs to come and use at this trap out.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.140
This is a trap out.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.060
The bees have built a home, inside the wall, up here.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.340
And due to the age of the home and the nature of the siding

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.280
the homeowner doesn't want to do any kind of modification here

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.560
so he doesn't want to have anyone cut into it to expose the hive.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.860
So Wil is doing what's called a trap out.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.360
And that's where you take some mesh material and make a cone out of it

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.480
And basically trap the bees

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.100
out of their home.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.700
This cone makes it so the bees come out but they can't get back in.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.540
And then set up another beehive next to it that has brood and other bees in it.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.620
And the bees have nowhere to go but into this hive here.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.160
The idea is, eventually...and it takes time, this doesn't happen over night...

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.920
but over the course of a few weeks or, worst case, a couple months

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.700
the bees should make their way out of the wall

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.880
and into the hive.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
The best way to get bees out of a wall is just to open the wall up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.460
because these trap outs can be tricky.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.140
You never know what's going to happen

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.360
Sometimes they work and sometimes they're a miserable failure

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.740
I tried one last year and it was my first attempt and I didn't know what I was doing and it was a miserable failure.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.120
This is Wil's 2nd time doing a trap out.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.740
He's much more experienced with doing the cut outs, where you open the walls.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.320
He is a licensed contractor and has experience with this kind of thing. And a beekeeper.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.260
But trap outs are a little less common.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.540
Less desirable to do.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.080
Very tricky.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.260
But can be done

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.300
After the bees move out of the wall, there's still going to be comb left inside.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.460
Usually that means you have to open the wall up anyway and get the comb out so that more pests

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.300
like rats or other undesirable insects don't make their way in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.240
but since the homeowner doesn't want to open the wall up that's not going to be an option.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.180
Just have to wait for the bees to come out

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.000
and fill in the gaps.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.000
And seal it up so that more bees don't move in in the future.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.400
This way the hive is saved, we're not killing a hive, and we're preserving the bees.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.140
And we're getting them out of the way so the homeowner isn't bothered by them.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.300
Here's an update to the trap out.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.320
It's been 5 days and Wil contacted me to let me know that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.140
the box that he tried using wasn't working.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.020
So he got a different box and the bees seem to be moving into it now.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.180
We don't know if the hole was too small on the other box or maybe there were too many bees living inside it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.400
but the bees from the wall just did not want to move in

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.920
When he replaced the hive he found another hole that the bees were going in back into the wall.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.180
And he was able to seal that up.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.700
It looks like this is going to work, it's just going to take some time.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.160
But that's how a trap out is done.
