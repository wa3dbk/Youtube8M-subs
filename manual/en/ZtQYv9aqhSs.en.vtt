00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
(crowd cheering)

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.603
(narrator) This season,
Break'N Reality details the lives

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:08.908
of some of the world's best break dancers
as they chase fame and success,

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.190
but also try to stay true to their roots.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.451
♪ (music throughout) ♪

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:15.903
Breaking, also known as b-boying,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:19.324
is an intense artful dance form
that consists of four elements:

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:25.128
Top rock, Footwork,
Power moves, and Freezes.

00:00:25.538 --> 00:00:29.602
When combined, it's one of the purest,
most raw dances known to man.

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.292
Some use the dance for expression.

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:36.217
I truly live this as a culture
and as a lifestyle.

00:00:36.447 --> 00:00:37.471
Some for money.

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.949
You can book a job overnight
that will make you so much money

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.782
you've never even seen that many zeros.

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:42.964
Some for fame.

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:44.857
For me it's everything,
I want to get it done,

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:45.820
I want to accomplish it,

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.933
I want to make history,
and I want to go out on top.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:49.392
But all for the love.

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:52.914
Once you start dancing, it's encoded
in your DNA. You can't stop.

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.065
Follow along as four unique
and influential dancers

00:00:56.315 --> 00:00:59.096
pull back the curtain to reveal
the culture of breaking,

00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:00.740
and the business behind it.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.062
Kid David, after making his name
in the competitive world,

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:07.713
he's now in Hollywood
finding commercial success.

00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:11.522
I'm proud of the fact that I've been able
to stay relevant in the b-boy scene,

00:01:11.523 --> 00:01:13.793
and make my mark in the Hollywood scene.

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:15.493
But with all this success,

00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:18.045
he's a man on a mission
to win his first world title,

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:20.800
and solidify his place in b-boy history.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.287
Roxrite, the b-boy legend
and reigning world champion,

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:29.540
physically and mentally prepares
to defend his title at the BC One in Rio.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.830
Winning this would be
just as big, if not bigger,

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:33.555
than winning it the first time,

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:36.210
because nobody's done it,
nobody's done it back-to-back.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.898
Adding to the pressure,

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.372
He's planning to take his relationship
with longtime girlfriend, Marisol,

00:01:41.373 --> 00:01:42.661
to the next level.

00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:45.039
I have finally decided
to ask her to marry me.

00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:47.062
But will he be able to balance training

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:48.183
while also preparing

00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:50.051
for the most important
moment of his life?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.318
I've just got to remember
that I've got to go in there

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:54.069
and do what I do best.

00:01:55.217 --> 00:01:56.437
The pressure is on.

00:01:57.507 --> 00:02:00.747
Jeskilz, a French-Algerian b-girl
trying to bring back

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.053
the essence of b-boying
to the streets of L.A.,

00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.639
created a new event where
it's not about competition,

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.359
it's only about dance.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.514
The reason why I started
Cypher Adikts in L.A.

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:11.599
was because I felt like
the scene needed it.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.697
While bouncing back from major surgery

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:15.833
and trying to get into
dance shape once again,

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.608
Jeskilz pushes her boundaries.

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:20.791
But how far is she willing to go
to maintain her reputation?

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.939
(French) It's your decision.
If you stay like this, you'll vomit.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.698
Right now I'm really annoyed,

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.383
and yeah, I guess I want to quit.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.513
Ronnie, winner of
America's best dance crew

00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:35.409
and current member
of the hit Vegas show Jabbawockeez,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.812
revels in his success.

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.496
The Jabbawockeez show
is one of the newest shows,

00:02:39.497 --> 00:02:42.248
and one of the hottest shows
on the Las Vegas strip.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.610
At the world finals in Rio,
rather than competing again,

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.595
he performs a showcase with his crew.

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:52.410
But he soon realizes that he needs
to go back into the cypher himself.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.357
Next year is going to be
Red Bulls BC One's 10th year anniversary,

00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:58.045
and I haven't competed in so long,

00:02:58.275 --> 00:02:59.451
I'd love to go back.

00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:03.934
All of this and more will collide
at the World Finals in Seoul, Korea,

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:06.402
as they celebrate
their 10 year anniversary

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:09.656
with the biggest
and most fierce battle ever fought.

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.831
Four of the world's best
pursue their passion,

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:15.779
fight for what they love most.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.177
I'd rather live my life
knowing that I tried,

00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:20.106
rather than sitting back and watching.

00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:23.688
Break'N Reality.
Making a living, and keeping it real.
