00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.910
&gt;&gt; At Johns Hopkins Bay View medical
center, our patients are our priority.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.120
We've invested in new technology for our
operating rooms,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.550
so that surgery is even better and safer
than ever.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.340
A novel intraoperative CT scanner and
neuronavigation system are at the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.290
center of this high-tech initiative that
focuses on image guided surgery.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.170
Situated on rails that connect two

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.220
operating rooms, the ICT can travel
between

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.080
both rooms, bringing the scanner to the
patient instead of the other way around.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.560
This is an extraordinary benefit to the
patient for a number of reasons.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.080
In the past, verification of surgical
success was made after the surgery and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.829
anesthesia ended by moving the patient to
another area to receive a CT scan.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.030
Scanning during surgery, within the
sterile field

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.910
of the operating table, can improve
patient outcomes.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.380
&gt;&gt; That means less trips to the
operating room by the patient, better

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.679
quality surgery and greater accuracy in
removal of tumors.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.746
Better patient outcome and potentially
less health care expenditures.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.474

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:26.717
&gt;&gt; The ICT works in concert with brain
navigation software

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:31.525
that enables the surgeon to precisely
assess anatomy and instrument placement.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.975
These neuronavigation tools are
strategically placed and

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:38.918
provide vivid direction similar to a GPS
device.

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:43.890
Detailed images shown on flat screen
monitors above the operating table enhance

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.420
the information the surgeon and his or her
team have to work from.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.668
An image is taken preopertively and then

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:54.240
compared throughout the surgery to gauge
accuracy.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.900
These tools and techniques are at the
forefront of image guided neurosurgery.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.440
&gt;&gt; Not only we'll be able to have the
feeling, as

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.570
the instrumentation goes into the spine,
that we are in the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.860
right spot by millimeter, we will be able
also to verify the final

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.180
result on the spot before the patient,
wakes up,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.070
&gt;&gt; Johns Hopkins Bayview is the only
hospital on

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.000
the east coast with this dual room ICT and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.278
brain navigation technology.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:29.070
Combined with its specialized neuro
intensive care unit,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.460
it is proving it's commitment to premier
patient care.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.140
Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.274
Hopkins medicine within your reach.
