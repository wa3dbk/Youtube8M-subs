00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.840
Licensed games, whether they be for a movie,
TV show, book, or a brand always make gamers

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.210
raise their eyebrows with caution.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.240
It's not the idea of marketing tie-ins, but
more that in about ninety five percent of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500
cases, these games are absolutely terrible.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.240
Isn't it funny then that when a brand spends
the time and effort to make a truly engaging

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.950
game, the idea of the brand tie-in seems almost
quaint?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.500
That's exactly what we have here with Penny
Skateboards, and their game Penny Time.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.780
Anyone who's played Bit.Trip Runner will immediately
understand how to play Penny Time, but for

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.309
the rest of you, allow us to explain.

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.969
This is a platformer, where all the jumps
and dodging are tied to the game's soundtrack.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.030
Seeing that you play a skateboarder, the moves
in this game are the ollie, the hippy jump,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.569
and the power slide.

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:55.149
See, your skateboard has the ability to freeze
time so each level has you avoiding frozen

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.289
in time obstacles on the way to your destination.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.899
Each move is performed with a directional
swipe of the finger, and the move needed is

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.769
color coded as you approach it in the level.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.100
Swiping in time with the music will net greater
rewards depending on what section you're in.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.200
The levels follow a pattern of easy basic
point grabbing followed by a section dedicated

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050
to raising your multiplier.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.300
These sections are broken up by checkpoint
dodos who each have five skateboards for use

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.790
should you happen to stack it.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.260
At the end of each act is a pig.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.150
At this point you can cash in your current
score by swiping back on the screen, or you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.730
can risk your pot for greater rewards overall,
but if you mess up, that score is gone.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.850
This creates a rather intense risk verses
reward in the level, that players aiming for

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.160
achievements and high scores will have to
come to terms with.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.520
The visuals sport a rather simple yet striking
block colored 3D style that seems a little

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.050
off at first, but warms on you as you travel
through the frozen landscapes.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.100
The music is beat driven to help with gameplay,
but the tracks are groovy without being obnoxious.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.180
Five levels may not seem like much content,
but with the two difficulties, oncoming content

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.330
in updates, and what is needed to fully complete
each level, there's more than enough value

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.909
for money here.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.890
Really the only criticism is a bit of a hefty
one in that swipes don't always seem to register.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.631
Nothing is worse than jamming along to the
groove you've worked yourself into only to

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.760
be taken out of it by a failed up or forward
swipe.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.200
Mileage may vary on other people's devices,
but even with this in mind, Penny Time has

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:31.950
a solid sense of charm, style, and fun that
we here at AppSpy can easily recommend 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.390
to all.
