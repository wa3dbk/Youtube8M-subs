We spent a lot of time on
this channel ripping on religion.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.000
For good reason.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.700
But there are a lot of things that churches actually
do really well, and we could learn a lesson from that.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.400
Churches know
how to handle fear.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.800
There are so many things
in our life that we all dread.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.600
Whether it's the death
of a loved one,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.800
whether it's our
own impending death.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800
What if we lose a job or just have
a loved one who's very sick? I mean,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
churches know
that you are

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.400
upset and you are scared
a lot of the time.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.400
And they know exactly what they have to do
to help you out in those stressful situations.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.300
So, how do we, as atheists, respond
to those same situations?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.600
As atheists,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
we don't want to rely on false hope,
which is a lot of what religion offers.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
We don't want to rely on that,
we want something tangible and immediate.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.200
And that means we got to provide resources
for people who are dealing with those tough times.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.000
I gotta say, right now there
really aren't that many ways--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.700
ways to learn about how to deal with those
difficult situations, if you're an atheist.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500
They're starting to appear.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.300
There's a great website
called GriefBeyondBelief.org,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.100
that helps people deal with the death of
a loved one. That's a fantastic resource.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.800
But we need more of that. We need people who
have been through some really traumatic times

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.800
who are willing to put themselves out there and say,
"Look, I've been through this," "I went through a breakup,"
"I lost a child."

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.000
"And let me tell you what it was like for me
and let me tell you how I got through it."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Help the people who are gonna be dealing
with the same problems after you've already
gone through them.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.000
Christians know how to do that.
They have been doing that for so many
decades now, and they've mastered it.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.200
We got a follow suit.
We got to help people deal with
the worst moments of their life.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm not saying we
should copy the church.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.900
Believe me, there are lots of things
we don't want to do just like them.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.300
But we also have the luxury of knowing what they
do that we really hate and we can avoid all that.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.200
We can learn a lot from Christian churches
from what they do well,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.500
about how to get our own
message across. And maybe if we,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100
you know, followed
some of these pastors,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
we can actually
do ourselves a favor.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.100
