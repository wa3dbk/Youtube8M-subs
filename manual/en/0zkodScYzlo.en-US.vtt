Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.022
And I have a wonderful story for you called "Miracle Oil"

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.560
Today's memory verse is from Psalms 95:7

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:19.257
It says "He is our God and we are under his care"

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.394
The message for today's story is "God uses others to love and care for us"

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.628
When Elijah was hungry, someone shared a special meal with him

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:34.742
Elijah had been camping at the little brook for a long time 

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.680
But the water no longer splashed along

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:39.680
there had been no rain

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:42.617
and the water in the little brook was almost gone 

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.771
Elijah studied the clear blue sky

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:50.034
There wasn't a rain cloud in sight for miles 

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:51.885
Elijah knew why

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.417
God's special people were still praying to Baal for rain

00:00:55.817 --> 00:01:00.480
but God wanted them to understand that He was the one who sent the rain

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:01.680
not an idol

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:04.628
And it would not rain until God said so

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:07.337
Suddenly, God spoke to Elijah

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:12.685
"Go to the village Zarephath," he said, "A widow woman there would feed you"

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.411
Elijah quickly started down the dusty road to Zarephath

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.302
When Elijah reached the village gates, he saw a woman gathering small sticks 

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.782
Elijah was hot and thirsty from his long long walk

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:29.257
"Would you please bring me a cup of water?" he asked the woman

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:31.702
"And please bring me a little bread too"

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.828
The woman turned to Elijah with tears in her eyes. She said,

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.422
"I don't have any bread in my home

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:42.068
I only have a handful of flour and a little oil.

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:46.194
I'm going home now to make a fire with these few sticks

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:49.497
I will cook one last meal for my son and me

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:51.280
And then we will die

00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:54.445
because we have nothing left to eat"

00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:57.200
Elijah smiled at the woman

00:01:57.657 --> 00:01:59.062
"Don't be afraid," he said 

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:01.520
"Go ahead, cook the meal

00:02:01.977 --> 00:02:04.171
but make a little loaf for me first

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:09.520
God promises that there will always be plenty of flour and oil in your containers 

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.540
and you will not run out of food until he sends the rain again

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.725
 and new food beings to grow"

00:02:16.502 --> 00:02:18.868
Well, the widow woman believed the words of the Lord

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.360
So she did as Elijah asked her to 

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.782
She went home and began to cook

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:28.971
Elijah sat and sipped his water as the woman made a little loaf of bread for him

00:02:29.588 --> 00:02:33.920
He watched as she measured just the right amount of oil and flour

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.497
He then saw her mix them together to make bread dough 

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:41.200
Soon, he could smell the bread as it slowly baked 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.771
Oh what a treat it was to have good fresh bread again!

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:49.497
For more than three years there was no rain

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:51.554
And nothing could grow

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:54.400
but the widow's flour and oil

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:55.817
never ran out

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.360
God had provided food and water in the past

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.577
and he would provide it now for Elijah and the kind widow

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:04.740
and her son

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.794
