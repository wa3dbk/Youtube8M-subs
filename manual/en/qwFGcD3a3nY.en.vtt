00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:37.414
Welcome to Sonny's the Car Wash Factory. In cleaning cars one of 
 the most important things is the side of the car.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:41.920
There's different shapes and sizes of vehicles so 
 we need multiple diferent size brushes. 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.190
One of the items we stock at Sonnys that we 
 build is our SFB Style Side Brush. 

00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:51.110
They range anywhere from 18 inches all the way up 
 to 63 inches tall for a van. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.710
And these are nice pieces of equipment because they can be mounted on 
 the entrance or exit  leg or any piece of equipment. 

00:01:57.772 --> 00:02:00.770
that it will fit under. This one here is 
 mounted on a foundation frame top brush 

00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:06.620
And it's built into the inside leg, it's a 28 inch tall brush and it 
 fits right underneath this leg so it takes up no more conveyor space

00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:12.220
We have other ones that can be mounted free standing, there's room in 
 the tunnel for them, or if you want to use the 63

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:20.790
inch one for vans. they could be run with 
 either cloth, neoglide,  or even microclean. 

00:02:21.526 --> 00:02:23.530
to get some great cleaning power and to mixup the cleaning materials. 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.310
Everyone of them needs a hydraulic power pack to run 'em 
 and if they're in a combination with some other piece

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.630
of equipment you can sometimes share a powerpack to do a 2 flow 
 controls and utilize one power pack in the same space. 

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:41.450
We'll take a walk in the back room and we'll take a 
 look at that powerpack and whow you that support equipment. 

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:48.190
Side brush support again hydraullic drive needs a powerpack. 5 horsepower 
 single flow power pack will drive any of our side

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:54.640
brushes from the 18 inch rocker brush all the way 
 up to the 63 inch SFB Van Rocker Brush.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:59.520
It's important that you have it, if you have something already in place 
 and you're buying a new brush you can use it 

00:03:00.558 --> 00:03:05.560
