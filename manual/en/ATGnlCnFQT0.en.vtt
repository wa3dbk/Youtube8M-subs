00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.830
The man in charge of Afghanistan’s Olympic
hopefuls likes to lead by example.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.840
“Sometimes I walk five kilometers or sometimes
I walk seven kilometers and sometimes it’s

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.920
ten kilometers depending on my work.”

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.620
Zahir Aghbar’s day begins at 5am.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.339
He gets up to pray, goes for a run and then
heads to work.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.410
On the way, he likes to stop off and join
others in their work outs.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.269
“When our youths see the head of the committee
doing exercise with them and he hears their

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.820
problems, whether you think it or not, it
will have an impact on them.”

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.629
Two members of the Afghan Taekwondo team and
two runners, one female, have already qualified

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.050
to compete in London 2012.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.899
The boxing and wrestling teams have yet to
make the grade.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.410
Zahir Aghbar tells this wrestler to wear more
clothes otherwise he will get pain in his

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.480
muscles.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.600
The man replies that he likes to show off
his body.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.219
At forty nine, Zahir Aghbar has a lengthy
CV.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.600
He’s been in the army and the police.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.930
He’s worked for the Afghan FBI known as
the NDS.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.220
He was once in charge of securing President
Karzai’s palace and he’s held ministerial

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.930
positions in the Afghan government.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.500
While he’s changed his job a few times,
one constant thing throughout his life has

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.590
been his love of sport, especially while he
was at university.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.300
“I was participating in ping pong matches,
basketball, swimming, athletics and I was

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.300
goal keeper in Urdu team for a while.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.510
I was also a member of the national hand ball
team.”

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.570
“This is the national stadium of Afghanistan
called the Gazi stadium.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:51.070
The people know it by this name but unfortunately
in the past, innocent people were killed here

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.570
and there was lots of fear in this place.”

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.360
The Taliban used to organize football matches
here and then at half time, they’d use the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.700
pitch to carry out executions.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.450
The victims were often female.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.590
Ten years on and Zahir Aghbar’s got plans
to build a female-only gym on this site.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.959
“Today there are lots of females getting
sick, especially during pregnancies, they

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:09.959
die.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.440
Sport is a major way for them to get healthy.”

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.480
“Another part of our work is in these days
we’re trying to build a new facility for

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.630
our taekwondo team.”

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:35.090
“We are going to one bed here, one bed here
there will be 4 athletes in every room and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:47.580
there will be a bathroom in here.”

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.090
In Afghanistan, tribal disagreements are often
a cause of conflict.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.280
Zahir Aghbar hopes that through sport, he
can encourage Afghans to treat each other

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
equally.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.940
Now there is a black president of the United
States.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.560
I hope we can also move on like other countries
so we stop talking about ethnicities or tribes.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.630
We should all be Afghans and develop our country
from this current situation.”

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.960
Afghanistan won its first ever Olympic medal
in Beijing 2008 thanks to Rohullah Nikpai,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.370
who took bronze.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.180
Rohullah’s going for gold this year.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.620
Zahir Aghbar’s hoping some of his other
athletes do the same.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.130
“The international community has promised
it will support us during the Olympics.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.850
Do your exercising, wrestle and relax but
you should be fully prepared.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:49.960
This is what I promise to you guys, you should
be fully prepared.”
