00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.009
hi there, as you know I am Trevor Crowe
from Crowe productions

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.830
and I just want to quickly go through
with you something that we've been doing

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.950
with a lot of our clients, and that is
YouTube advertising.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.380
pre-roll ads are many have you have seen

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.660
had before where there you can skip the
at the beginning in the video that you

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.510
want to watch.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.730
But most the time it's usually car
commercials.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.289
But if we don't skip the ad it's
usually because they're actually

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.170
relevant to our interests.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
and that's what I want to show you over the next few minutes are is creating an ad for your business.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.950
 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.100
to go out then beginning I've YouTube
videos

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.559
that catered towards the your target
demographic.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.820
So you can actually increase your
engagement get the views up dramatically

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.739
on YouTube,

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.760
and also drive traffic to your website.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.469
and our call to action us as in you know
give your phone call

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.010
and I have some business generation so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.190
moving forward we do a lot of
promotional videos and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.399
our clients are sometimes
disappointed by

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
the number views are that they get on
YouTube.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.740
and or just sitting on

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.930
their website. So, one of the ways that
we've addressed that is by

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.299
coming up with a number of different
methods to promote the video.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.630
Video can be a tool you know
sitting on the shelf are actually being

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.860
used effectively.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.500
So video obviously you know you can use
it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.200
in presentations, on your website,
through email marketing campaigns,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.740
you can have it on a USB stick your DVD
you know for playing at trade shows.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.920
There is a number uses in a lot of our clients
see

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.140
returns on their investment with all
those

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.509
avenues are being used. If you want to
take it a step further,

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.920
advertising like this can be very
effective so,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.710
this is an example I video we produced
back in April

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.229
and as you can see the gradual increase
in the use over time has just been

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.920
simply

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.869
are organic search results people
finding them on YouTube you to being the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.979
second largest search engine in the
world

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.649
and then you can see here back at the
beginning in December

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.680
this is when we started you to pre-roll
advertising campaign and sharply

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.580
I starts to go up almost double the
views in a matter of months

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.989
now this has actually not how many times

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.330
the video Adeste displays on YouTube

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.440
this is how many people are interested
enough to not skip the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.530
add and that's actually arm

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.319
a pretty good results so when it comes
to display I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.840
honing in on who sees the ad you can get

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.450
narrow down your target demographic rate
down to age group

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.660
hi in to rate down to interest groups so

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.959
people researching on how to build
attacking

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.200
who knows whatever it is that year
you're trying to reach you can narrow it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.470
down based on their interests groups

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.239
also geographically if your business is
serving a geographical area

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.760
you can hone into our target our area
that you're just interested in serving

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.110
so these ads were only show up

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.970
in the area that you specify you can do
it by postal code

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.970
I'll I should say we can do it by postal
code

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.580
opt-in by radius targeting I'm really
getting into the specifics

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.540
so you can see this as an example just
one month

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.040
are for one of our clients in see that
that had showed up seventeen thousand

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.830
two hundred ninety four times

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.640
on YouTube that's considered an
impression are not an actual view

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.610
have that 17,000 there was 2211 people

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.909
interested enough to watch the entirety
how that video and not skip the ad

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.700
she can see not everybody skips the and
getting some people who are actually

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.110
interested in your product or service

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.340
and you've reached them effectively when
you've reached them in their interested

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.549
enough in watching it

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.280
are you as the advertiser page 4 cents a
clicker basically

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.659
you're paying only when someone's
interested enough to watch the ad

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.120
and that's different from print
advertising or television where

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.640
you know ninety-nine percent of the cost
goes out the door

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.139
with people who watch your commercial
who are interested at all

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.660
so that for that month the cost was
eighty one dollars

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.280
arm and at about 2200 I

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.650
132 people actually clicked through

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.259
after watching the video they clicked
through to the website

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.290
and they may have our click through to
the website to find out more information

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.860
or find your phone number so you can see
the whole sales funnel

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.410
works quite well with this campaign

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.460
so with this in mind on what we're
proposing

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.419
INS's totally flexible but we're
recommending is a fourteen hundred

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.440
dollar spanned

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.650
or two hundred dollars a month for six
months the beauty of the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.770
the YouTube advertising and even Google
AdWords for that matter

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.830
is you can spend arm as little or as
much as you want

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.940
and it doesn't hurt to try it so this is
what we're proposing it really does work

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.419
arm so we would cut together a 30- to
60-second commercial

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.990
that either using existing footage that
we have here archive to crow productions

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.030
and with a custom call to action see you
may say

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.479
you know i really wanna aster promoting
our spring launch

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.289
and get awareness out there and get the
views and shares up

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.289
are you can do that and we can put
together something really cool

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.940
also part of the package is a fully
reporting ball and trackable results so

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.699
will send you emails and Dom show
everything that I just showed you

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.620
specific to your campaign

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.310
were also tweak it along the way so that
arm we can

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.400
fine to me what it is that we're doing
and who were reaching

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.389
added that fourteen hundred dollars
bandits estimated that there should be

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.949
above seventy three thousand impressions
that means how many times the ad shows

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.880
up on YouTube

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.770
at about 73,000 there should be about
9,000 YouTube views

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.110
are people who are fully engaged and
interested enough to watch your video

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.060
I and then about 700 click-throughs to
your website

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.949
either to you find out more information
or to call you call you so

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.210
