00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.439
If the question is, “What would a first-person
physics simulator had been like on the Nintendo

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.790
64,” there are two answers.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.800
The first being that you ask some pretty strange
questions.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.690
The other being Barrel Toss.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:54.960
Unfortunately, it’s not 1998 and the iPad
is not, in fact, a Nintendo 64.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.580
The project of a new developer known as Game
Carrot, Barrel Toss is simple in both name

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.769
and concept.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.330
Clear the barrels from each hangar by tossing
things at them.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.909
This becomes progressively more difficult,
of course, as each hangar adds new obstacles

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.780
that make barrel tossing a lot more difficult
than you’d think it would be.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.290
You have a few weapons at your disposal.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.100
There are crates, shoes, cannonballs...the
only catch is that the crate is the only one

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.710
available at the start.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.440
If you want to use those other weapons, you
have to unlock them.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.380
And if you want to unlock them, you’ll have
to knock off a few thousand barrels first.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.220
In fact, 2,500 for one weapon, 4,000 for another.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.810
This is ridiculous.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.570
Obviously, that takes quite some time to do.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.200
And this has become pervasive in a lot of
games for mobile devices.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.910
Technically, the game is free, but it takes
a long time to gain access to better weapons

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:52.910
and more levels.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.640
So you have to keep playing the same ones
over and over, with the dangling carrot being

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.659
that you can just buy those extra features
with an in-app purchase.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.560
That’s not really a problem.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.480
Certainly not one that’s exclusive to Barrel
Toss.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.510
But the game does have problems, and specifically,
it’s a lack of content.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
The game has three weapons and three different
hangars, each with its own levels.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.090
But that’s all there is to Barrel Toss,
and it gets old well before you’ve done

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.430
enough to unlock everything.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.730
Of course, there’s not much you can do about
repetition in a game like this.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.720
You’re essentially throwing objects at other
objects the whole time.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.650
But the game is fun, in a Boom Blox kind of
way.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.000
The problem is the difficulty spikes pretty
quickly.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.510
And since you have to clear those barrels
with very limited throws, it quickly evolves

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.560
from challenging to frustrating.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.350
Another problem is the overall presentation.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.390
I mean, to be fair, Game Carrot is an independent
studio with a pretty small team.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.950
But at the same time, Barrel Toss is an unattractive
game.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.630
The colors are dull and washed out...and there’s
this obnoxious music.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.300
Is this what the kids call dubstep?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:28.050
Sounds like a computer is having a **** seizure.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.190
Barrel Toss is kind of a fun idea, but to
me, it felt a bit too dated and was a little

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.910
too frustrating to recommend.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.100
It reminds of a game that we would’ve raved
about on the Nintendo 64, only to play it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:50.769
15 years later and suddenly lament our sobering
from nostalgia.
