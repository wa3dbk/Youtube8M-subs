00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:24.920
Owls: mysterious nocturnal hunters, these
unusual birds have captured our imaginations

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.300
for centuries.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.560
However, even though they hunt almost exclusively
in darkness, owls are nothing to be afraid of.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.880
There are more than 200 species of owls around
the world, and these versatile birds of prey

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.460
make their homes on every continent except
Antarctica.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.320
Although there are differences between species,
owls share some key features.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.420
Owls have sharp talons, hooked bills, and
heads that can swivel around in almost any direction.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.079
Something interesting about owls is that they
cannot move their eyes. If owls want to look

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.379
at something that is not straight ahead of
them, they have to turn their whole head.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.719
Owls also have soft plumage. It is these soft
feathers that give owls their greatest advantage

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:41.079
as a hunter: silent flight. Most birds flap
noisily when they fly. Owls' feathers have

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.350
special edges and a velvety soft covering
that absorb sound and let owls fly so quietly

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.819
that their prey never hears them coming.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.439
Owls typically swallow their prey whole and
then regurgitate a pellet of anything too

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:08.319
tough to be digested, like fur, bones, and
claws. Dissecting these pellets is a good

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.859
way to find out what the owl has been eating.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.460
Owls are good parents, too. They stay with
their nestlings and bring them food to eat

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.220
- meat, of course. The parents will rip the
meat up into small enough pieces that their

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.220
babies can eat it. The parents will care for
the young until they are fully feathered and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.440
ready to fly off on their own - a process
which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.200
few months, depending on the species of owl.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.660
Finally, you are probably familiar with one
kind of owl call: the hoot. But owls make

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.680
an interesting variety of noises!

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.640
I hope you enjoyed learning about owls today. Good
luck seeing one - or hearing one - in your neighborhood.
