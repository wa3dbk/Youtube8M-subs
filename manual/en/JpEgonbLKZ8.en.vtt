The WILMER
Toddler hand

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.430
Wooow

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.430
BOOOM!

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.430
Why did you choose a prosthetic hand for him?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.430
- Why did we choose a prosthetic hand?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.430
To give him the opportunity,
to be able to learn how to deal with a prosthesis

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.430
Not because we want him to,
but to give him the opportunity.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.430
Does he use his prosthetic hand a lot?
- Actually, it is a part of getting dressed.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.430
When he gets dressed,
he also gets his prosthesis on.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.000
He wears it al day,
till he goes to bed, or takes a bath.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.430
And what does he think of the hand?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.430
- Yeah, for him it is really normal.
He likes wearing it.
