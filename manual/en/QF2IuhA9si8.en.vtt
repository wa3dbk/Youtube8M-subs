00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:06.327
To our common cause, to our star.
To you, Rita.

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:08.438
To you, Margarita Sergeyevna.

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:12.221
Anton’s made arrangements.
The investors will invest in the new movie

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.380
and you can choose any new part you wish.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.393
My husband is the only one now
who is going to invest in my roles.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.885
All others gone.

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:23.269
Why is he so mad about her?
Such a hunk dealing with this crone…

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.062
He owes her a lot…

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:29.728
You still don’t have any children,
do you? Does it somehow affect your…

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.217
This subject is closed.

00:00:34.114 --> 00:00:36.114
I want to adopt the child.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.687
To share warmness
and happiness with one lacking it.

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:44.794
But I cannot see why do YOU need this?

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.900
You could have your own children.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.608
Vanie! Come here.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.254
Vania… Ivan Antonovich…
Sounds good, doesn’t it?

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.984
Wait! Stop!
I’m mother of Vania Yerofeyeva.

00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:03.721
You abandoned the baby back
in the maternity home, now forget him.

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:05.329
You should have thought of it before.

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:08.127
What can you know about my life at all?

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.871
I had spent five years 
in a rehabilitation centre.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:13.236
And I’ve recovered. I don’t drink anymore.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.817
I’m begging you, let me see him…
at least for a minute.

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:20.942
I’d gladly helped you…
But Vania Yerofeyev is not here already.

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:28.862
Yeah, smile! Smile, move your happy faces 
closer to each other… Well done! Well done!

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:31.156
Some rest. Are you tired, kid?

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:36.477
Vania.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.175
Mom! Mommy, what took you so long?
I’ve been waiting for you.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.237
Forgive me.

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:44.484
– Who’s out there?
– What’s up?!

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.136
Mom, don’t leave me!

00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:49.203
I’ll take you away from here. I love you.

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:51.103
She wanted to kidnap my boy!

00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:53.564
She’s his mother;
she just wanted to return her son.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.982
– Ouch! What are you doing?!
– Vania, stop that!

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:01.127
You can take any one else.
Does it really matter for you?

00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:03.829
I am the mother of this boy! Get out!

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:14.324
You know, even if I have no chance at all,
I will still struggle for him.
