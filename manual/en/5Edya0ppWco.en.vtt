00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.700
Space out this Halloween in this illuminated
galaxy makeup look powered by GEMMA, Adafruit's

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.400
miniature wearable electronics platform.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.379
Five NeoPixels form a constellation across
the night sky created with rich colorful purples,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.529
pinks, and blues.

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.550
Begin by soldering a simple chain circuit
in the shape of your favorite constellation.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.210
We were inspired by Cassiopeia, the vain queen
from Greek mythology, of course.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.800
There's a step-by-step guide to go with this
video and the link in the description.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.000
There you can also find our circuit diagram,
sample code, and products used for this look.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.219
Program GEMMA to light up the pixels in the
color of your choice and test to see that

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.019
everything's working.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.729
Feel all the connections to ensure nothing's
getting hot.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.440
Think about it: gluing a short circuit to
your face could burn you, so better to check

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.749
now then find out later.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.339
Since your skin is slightly conductive, insulate
the backs of the pixels with E6000 craft adhesive

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.339
and allow to dry.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.890
At this point you can also glue GEMMA and
a battery pack to a hair clip.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.191
Test your circuit on battery power, then turn
it off and apply liquid latex to the back

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.850
of each pixel.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.350
Apply your foundation as usual, then gently
place the circuit across your forehead and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.580
clip GEMMA in your hair.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.149
Use a sponge wand applicator to add more liquid
latex where needed, and hold the pixels in

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.140
place for a few seconds until they stay on
their own.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.310
If you've never used this stuff before, test
it to make sure you're not allergic.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.380
When the latex is dry, flip on the power switch
and watch your pixels glow.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.460
It should feel very comfortable with no noticeable
prickly feeling when the power's on-- if you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.659
getting a tickle from any of the pixels, go
back and insulate with more glue.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.460
Now onto the shading: start with a deep black
eyeshadow, and pack it all across your forehead

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.319
from the hairline to about halfway down using
a flat brush.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.789
Switch to a bigger brush and a highly pigmented
purple shadow, and blend it across the browbone,

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.679
into the black, and down the temples.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.010
Add a bit of contouring under the cheekbone
at an upward angle into the hairline.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.879
You can also contour your neck right under
your jawbone.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.599
Highlight your cheekbones with an iridescent
nude, then it's onto the eyes!

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.599
We're going to do a simple smokey purple eye:
start with a medium shade all over your lids,

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.060
inner corner, and under-brow highlight.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.830
Then use a deeper purple in the socket and
blend toward the outer corner.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.980
Sprinkle loose glitter over the entire look.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.049
Line your eyes with a black gel or pencil
liner.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.569
Curl your lashes and apply falsies to the
outer edge, then finish off with a generous

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.830
coat of mascara.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.730
To keep your look intergalactically fabulous
the longest, finish with a setting spray and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.060
pack a spare set of batteries.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.590

space faces we found on YouTube.
