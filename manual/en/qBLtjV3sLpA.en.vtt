00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.508
I’m Elinor Renfrew, the course director at Kingston 

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:04.644
University for Fashion BA.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.124
It’s a world-renowned course and it’s world renowned because

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:13.096
of its destinations and the students that we have here go

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.903
into industry and are some of the best designers in 

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:18.480
the world.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.593
The course is three years and it is fashion design

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:26.517
and we’re one of the few courses in the UK that only offer 

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:30.488
fashion design and our students go on to work as

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:32.960
designers but it may be that they go on to be stylists,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.059
they may go on to be illustrators, they may go on to be

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.426
in PR but predominantly they’re design students

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:43.305
and I’m here sitting in the third year studio and you can

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:46.045
see behind me the students working on their collections.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:50.178
The course is very much about portfolio; it’s well known

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:53.280
for that and Kingston wins awards for portfolio

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.380
and for illustration.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.466
Every year in any national competition the students 

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.229
at Kingston are up there with the winners.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.295
We’re a sponsored course at Kingston, which makes us 

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:06.223
quite unique.

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:09.939
We are sponsored by large American companies – 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.582
Banana Republic, Brooks Brothers – and in the UK we have

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:16.760
companies such as John Smedley Knitwear,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.477
French Connection and we also have Topman and a

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:25.400
trend forecasting company called Studio M and they 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.840
work with us, with the students, to sponsor projects with

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.417
competitions exclusively for Kingston.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.575
The students from these competitions win some

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:38.720
amazing places and they go on paid internships to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.470
New York and they go to Brooks Brothers and Banana 

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:46.630
Republic over the summer and every year we send about

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:50.200
five students out there and we now have a new sponsor,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.710
Old Navy which is San Francisco and these are 

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:54.710
exclusively to Kingston. 

00:01:54.707 --> 00:01:57.840
In addition we do enter other competitions through

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.720
the British Pastoral Council and every year students 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.280
from Kingston win awards and win positions,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.820
internships, placements at the companies.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:14.540
We are studio based here and all the students work 

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:17.160
very much together, they support each other,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.600
although they all work in their own areas,

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:21.920
they all know each other, we’re one campus,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.980
we’re one site and there’s a real community and I think

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.860
that’s one of the things that we pride ourselves is

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:30.580
the fact the students are proud to be here, the staff 

00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.600
enjoy working with the students, we all work very much as 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.480
a community here.

00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:38.550
When they leave, the students then come back and want 

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:41.190
to work with our fashion students from Kingston 

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:45.740
so they will go on and work in the industry alongside 

00:02:45.744 --> 00:02:47.230
graduates from here.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.090
If you look at the companies all over the world,

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.870
most of the design companies in the world will have

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:56.800
Kingston students as their design directors within the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.600
design team.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.020
In the UK we have companies like All Saints, Religion,

00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:06.220
Paul Smith, there are quite a few companies that are 

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:09.590
actually mostly our Kingston graduates in the design team 

00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:14.470
and also abroad – H&amp;M, Zara, Abercrombie and Fitch in 

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.720
America, and Zara in Spain.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.530
When we are looking for students to come here,

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:23.760
we’re looking for students who can innovate, that are 

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:26.730
creative, hard working. It’s a tough course, it’s very

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:30.160
tough here but they have a lot of staff contact time,

00:03:30.164 --> 00:03:34.480
high expectations and working within peer groups

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:37.620
that have high standards. So we’re looking for creativity,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.880
but we’re also looking for students that are completely

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.100
dedicated and really want to get a career in fashion

00:03:44.096 --> 00:03:45.640
and want to be successful.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.440
They are competitive as well as being supportive 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.400
because they realise the industry is getting smaller

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.970
and there are more students leaving.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.380
If you come to Kingston, I think it will probably be one

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.960
of the best experiences you will get because we are part

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.440
of a design school and we work closely within the design

00:04:04.436 --> 00:04:08.200
School – 3D design and 2D design – so students get the 

00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:11.560
opportunity to work with communication design students, 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.370
they get to see students from product design, architecture, fine art,

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:17.760
they are all in the same building.

00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:22.010
We do collaborative projects within the studio with just

00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:24.640
fashion where students will work on a group project on a

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.680
trend for a company in London and from that they will

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:31.740
get a paid internship for the best ones from the group.

00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:34.900
They will work on styling, they will work on all sorts of

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.340
things to do with trend forecasting which is quite different

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.440
from design. That’s the only group project we do.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.650
When it comes to third year, they focus very much on 

00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:47.556
their collections and portfolio and throughout the three years

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.610
it’s portfolio, 2D design and 3D design and the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.240
the understanding of taking 2D design into 3D design.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.850
It’s all about working on the body, understanding the 

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:01.760
the body from drawing the body, fashion illustration,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.500
toiling, cutting for different silhouettes and really trying

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.590
to be quite extreme in what they want to do but also

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.400
never forgetting that it needs to end up in a store and 

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:16.580
somebody needs to buy it.

00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:20.500
We encourage as much creativity across three levels but

00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:23.280
professionalism is the one thing that our students are 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.850
known for.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.440
We also run a professional practice module and that one

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.910
is – we work again closely with industry and we bring in 

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:34.080
designers who will have their own practice including

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.060
Sophie Hulme who is a graduate of Kingston, very 

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.280
successful graduate from 2007, who will come in and brief

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.380
the students. They will do a project and then from that

00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:49.070
project they will then produce work in order to gain a 

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:52.340
place, with their CV, with their cover letter. So it’s a very

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.470
professional package and this helps them when they 

00:05:55.474 --> 00:05:58.660
come to third year and they find their own company

00:05:58.655 --> 00:05:59.580
to work with. 

00:05:59.584 --> 00:06:02.740
This year we’ve had some very successful outcomes 

00:06:02.742 --> 00:06:05.960
for that project where third years have secured projects

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.000
with Lanvin, Miu Miu, Armani, so it’s global and that

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.190
really sets them up for when they leave.

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:18.070
So the whole time at Kingston is about linking with

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:20.830
industry without losing creativity because that’s what

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.940
they are looking for. They come to Kingston for 

00:06:22.943 --> 00:06:28.030
creativity before anything else but also I’m told time and

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.960
time again that our students are very employable, they 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.960
take it seriously and they are a huge asset in the

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.430
workplace as interns but also when they graduate.

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:42.700
We also do trips – next week we’ve got first years going 

00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:45.790
out to New York and they will visit the sponsors. So go

00:06:45.792 --> 00:06:49.480
to the studios and see the kind of companies that they
 

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:52.220
will be working for on projects in second year. So everything

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:53.220
is integrated.

00:06:53.222 --> 00:06:56.310
The staff I have here are very dedicated and they are

00:06:56.311 --> 00:06:58.840
are very varied. They all have their own businesses, 

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:02.720
I’m the only full time member of staff, but I do that

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.460
because I want to bring in people who are already out in

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.940
the industry to bring in designers running their own labels

00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:12.260
to bring in that expertise into the department,

00:07:12.263 --> 00:07:15.070
whether it’s knitwear, whether it’s accessories, whether

00:07:15.072 --> 00:07:18.350
 it’s menswear, that expertise comes back into the

00:07:18.346 --> 00:07:21.550
department and the staff are very very generous with

00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:25.590
their time with the students and with their sources and 

00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:31.230
resources. It’s a complete package here but it’s a

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:33.700
partnership and it’s only going to work if you are

00:07:33.695 --> 00:07:37.900
dedicated and you want to be here and we have a very 

00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:42.700
high retention, we have very few students leaving

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.600
Kingston. They want to be here, they want to be part of

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:53.960
the whole experience and I think of all the colleges

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.760
and courses that I know, I think we offer a very

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.720
diverse, creative and altogether professional package

00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:07.640
to any student who would like to apply to Kingston.
