00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:07.529
- Ladies and gentlemen I am
on the range today with...

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.604
- Mr. Richard Ryan from Full Mag!

00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:11.539
- Exactly, exactly okay.
(Richard chuckling)

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.976
A damn marksman and so what we did today

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:17.600
was we created this contraption,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.504
the Long Island Iced Tea!

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:21.112
Let me show you how we made this.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:22.778
First thing we doin' is we cuttin' off

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:27.416
a piece of the bottom to get
this to stand flat you know.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:28.780
To get us nice and level.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.967
- Oh that's cool, that's smart.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:34.437
- So we can do is give us
just a little marking around

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.372
where the bottle 's gonna go basically.

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:39.797
Okay let's see.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:44.365
So here you go.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:45.950
- Oh no, you're gonna put this on me.

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:47.970
- Put your hands over it first.

00:00:48.103 --> 00:00:48.784
- What, how?

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:49.734
- Yeah I mean you can
use your thumb to get it

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.354
close in there and then kinda go in.

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:52.288
- Like this?

00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:53.387
- Yeah. let go.

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:54.542
(chuckling)

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:55.877
Perfect (giggles).

00:00:56.257 --> 00:00:58.670
So this is tequila, go.

00:00:58.737 --> 00:00:59.554
- [Richard] Hyah, way better.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:00.016
- [Skyy] Yeah.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.125
- Way better.

00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:02.472
- Get that nice in there.

00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:06.224
Nice, oh shit you goin' that deep okay.

00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:07.612
- Aright, aright, aright.

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:09.400
- Go.

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:13.045
Okay good there we go.
- [Richard] Yeah.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:16.818
- [Skyy] Oh, got it.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:17.561
- [Richard] Come on man!

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:18.627
There we go, that's good.

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:19.854
- Sweet.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:20.939
- And there you have it!

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.161
The Long Island Iced Tea Watermelon!

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.372
- It's too bad we're not gonna drink this.

00:01:26.372 --> 00:01:27.389
(laughing)

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:31.034
- We gonna put a cap in
this watermelon's ass okay.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:32.386
And why are we doin' it?

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:34.952
In celebration of this, okay.

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:37.425
Our Fourth of July t-shirt sale.

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:41.721
We got some shirts on sale,

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.890

meantime, let's shoot his up.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.796
(giggling)

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:46.864
- I want to get one of those shirts.

00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:47.758
- I got one in the car for you.

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:49.133

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.246
- Let's shoot this thing!

00:01:50.263 --> 00:01:54.217
(both laughing)

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:03.595
- That's right homeboy.

00:02:03.798 --> 00:02:04.877
Just a little bit bigger than this.

00:02:04.877 --> 00:02:06.719
About the same size okay.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.347
(Richard laughing)

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:08.322
But not as sharp okay.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:10.435
But it gets the job done.

00:02:11.322 --> 00:02:12.942
(coughing)

00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:15.764
50 cal boys and girls okay.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:16.774
That's right.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:21.998
(gunshot)

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:24.889
(booming explosion)

00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:27.850
(heavy metal music)

00:02:32.905 --> 00:02:34.061
(gunshot)

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:53.682
(gunshot)

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:57.840
(Skyy laughing)

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.535
- Still some gin left!

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:05.404
(laughing loudly)

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:06.919
- Ain't nobody want that.

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:09.392
(swishing)
(spitting)

00:03:09.537 --> 00:03:10.431
(Richard laughing)

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:10.849
- Yeah!

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.917
Good gin okay.

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:13.322
You can't even really taste the gunpowder.

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:14.646
(both laughing)

00:03:14.646 --> 00:03:16.120
- The cool thing about this is like,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.488
you can always speculate before hand.

00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:21.588
But the fact that all these
bottles broke right here,

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:24.479
there's no way that the
bullet hit all of 'em

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.324
because it's aimin' for
the middle to low portion

00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:30.772
of the watermelon there,
so it's just the sheer

00:03:30.772 --> 00:03:33.976
pressure of that 50 cal
hittin' the watermelon

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:36.736
and the rind and
everything, all the pressure

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:39.070
on the glass and everything
what caused all this to shatter.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.724
Which is really really cool to watch.

00:03:41.775 --> 00:03:43.110
- Hey, so listen here okay.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.393
I'm gonna thank Ryan for
bringin' me out here today.

00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:45.693
- Thanks.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.585
- And ya'll check out his channel,

00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:50.755
youtub.com/fullmag okay (giggling).

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:52.078
- I keep lookin' at my
shirt like it's gonna

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.389
tell me where to go but it's just a logo,

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.602
it's just my logo.

00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:57.756
- And go get yourself a t-shirt

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:01.013
at teespring.com/tipsy okay.

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:02.719
And come drink some of this gin.

00:04:02.818 --> 00:04:04.751
Okay we can't let this waste,
people dyin' everywhere okay.

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:06.658
(both laughing)

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:07.604
- Sweet.

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:11.795
(techno music)
