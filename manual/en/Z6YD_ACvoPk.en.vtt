Hi its Camille with POSGuys.com. Today we're
going to take a look at the Zebra ZXP Series

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.000
7 card printer. You guys know, possibly anyways,
that I love card printers. So we are going

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.810
to do a quick run-through just so you can
see the ins and outs of this machine.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.810
This is where you load your cards. Just like
this, this slides that way and your cards

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.810
pop in right there. This snaps in place. You
can hear its nice strong snap. Closes up.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.390
Fits about 200 cards. Nice size!

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.960
LED display with menu buttons, return, print
test cards, etcetera. You can find your IP

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.090
and I am going to say select return to go back.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.090
This is your media bay. Pop it open with that
button. A nice new feature on this one for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.430
me anyways is this drawer where you pull the
media out, like its a little drawer. This

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.440
saves on cut fingers from having to stick
your fingers in the machine and pull out media

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:16.459
that is stuck in there tight. The media itself
which is this CMYK ribbon pulls out just like

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.049
I did right there. you don't have to do any
major snapping or pulling you just pick it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.939
up. Look at that I can do it really fast.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.939
To put it back in there you... make sure it
is lined up with the axles, the inside rotational

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:42.389
pivots there. Shut it nice and firm. See how
I did not quite get it right there. It must

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:49.389
have something blocking it. So pull it out
make sure that nothing is jamming it. Aww

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.429
I am just kind of pathetic today aren't I?

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.679
I usually do not have this much trouble shutting
it but there it is. There you go! That is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:07.679
a fully closed media drawer.
This comes down, oh before I shut it this

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.830
is your print head right in here. So the print
heats up the ribbon and transfers it to the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.080
card.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.870
This is closing it up and right there is where
your cards come out. If you listen closely

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.610
right now you can hear it is checking the
printer ribbon. Getting everything lined up

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.610
making sure that it is working. Do you hear
it spooling?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.740
This card output holds about 100 cards which
is great if you are doing high volume and

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.240
will work fine if you just need one or two
like you're printing student IDs on the fly.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.350
My favorite feature on this printer is its
composite black printing. What that means

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.230
is if you have an image made of CMYK like
those panels we saw earlier which were Cyan

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.230
Magenta Yellow blacK then what it does it
will automatically put the black on the image.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.540
A lot of printers will just do CMY which unfortunately
results in a faded black.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.400
One downside of this printer is that while
it can print on regular card-stock just fine...

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.450
yeah we'll put it in there. See that is a
100 cards. Right there. While it can print

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.450
on regular card stock just fine it can't do
keychain cards. Now mind you, the Zebra ZXP

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.350
Series 7 can't do keychain cards so see if
Zebra has any other options. They might have

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:43.350
some that can handle it. Keychain cards come
like this. When you print on them they are

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.130
three up and they snap apart like this. That
is your end keychain size. So that is it!

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.290
This is a Zebra ZXP Series 7! A really nice,
NICE quality card printer. I would not suggest

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.390
doing edge to edge printing but I really do
love it otherwise. If you are interested in

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.580
purchasing it or you would like more information
please contact us at POSGuys.com. We do not

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.580
have it listed on the website because it is
such a specific product that it does not appeal

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.460
to a lot of people to have on our site but
we do love our card printers and we can help

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.460
you find what you need for your business specifically.
