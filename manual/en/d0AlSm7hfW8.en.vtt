00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.267
I'm Natalie Hodson here in
the bodybuilding.com kitchen

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.733
showing you how to make one
of my favorite recipes,

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.933
Lime and Curry Tilapia.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.367
And this is a really
easy recipe to make,

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:23.267
and it tastes really good.

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.433
Even if you don't have tilapia,
you can use any other kind of

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.967
white fish or even chicken.

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:31.067
I use the same exact spices and
seasoning with chicken as well.

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:33.133
Here are the ingredients that
we're gonna use in our recipe

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.767
today, and it's really
easy because I use the same

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.967
measurement for all of the
spices.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.933
I have 2 teaspoons of yellow
curry, and sometimes you can

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.600
find this in the international
section of your grocery store

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
and then sometimes you can find
it with all the other regular

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.367
spices.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.433
Here's we have 2 teaspoons of
garlic powder, and just make

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:54.500
sure that you don't get the
garlic salt, that you get garlic

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.600
powder.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.700
The garlic salt looks a lot like
the garlic powder, but it has

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.367
salt mixed into it.

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:05.333
I have 2 teaspoons of black
pepper, 2 teaspoons of chili

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:11.000
powder, and 2
teaspoons of oregano.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.167
And then we're gonna use 4
tablespoons of lime juice, and

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.733
you can use fresh lime juice
or lime juice from the bottle.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.533
Both will work.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.033
This is actually
from the bottle.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.700
The fresh lime juice tastes a
little bit better, but you can

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.000
use either option.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.400
And I have a few lime wedges cut
that we're just gonna squeeze on

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400
top at the end and
then we have our tilapia.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.933
Now most tilapia comes frozen.

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.133
You get it in a big bag and it
comes frozen so just make sure

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.300
that you defrost it first.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.800
You can defrost in the microwave
or set it out the night before

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.767
and let it
defrost in the fridge.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:44.900
So the first thing that we're
gonna do is turn the oven on to

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.567
medium heat.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.300
And we're just gonna
let that get warm.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
And then we're gonna add the
lime juice on the bottom of the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.067
pan.

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:02.800
Now I'm cooking all four filets
at once so I might just--you

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.033
wanna just make sure that you
have enough lime juice to cover

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.533
the bottom of the pan so I'm
just gonna add a little bit

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.233
more.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:14.033
It's actually 'cause I like
mine to have a nice lime flavor.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.533
So I added maybe another
teaspoon, 2 teaspoons or so.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.100
Just until that covers
the bottom of the pan.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
Then we're gonna put
our tilapia filets in.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.100
Now I'm gonna cook four at once
today, but you could certainly

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.367
half this recipe and
just cook one serving size.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:39.833
Usually with fish I eat about
3 ounces or so at a meal.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.967
And then what I'm gonna do is
just take half of my seasonings

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:50.267
and sprinkle that over the fish
so I just--I'm using a spoon,

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:53.033
and right now I'm
adding the curry powder.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:56.000
And I think the curry powder is
a really important ingredient.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That's the thing that gives it
the most flavor besides the lime

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.033
juice.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.167
And we're gonna add
the garlic powder.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:08.533
Sprinkle that.

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:12.467
And then our black pepper.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.667
And keep in mind if you're doing
this with chicken instead of

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:19.100
tilapia, just make sure that you
cut the chicken into thin strips

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.467
so that way it cooks
all the way through.

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:27.800
Right now we're
adding chili powder.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.433
And this is just gonna give your
recipe a little bit of a kick.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:31.333
It's not super spicy.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.933
I wouldn't say
this is a spicy dish.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.733
It just adds a little bit of
flavor, a tiny bit of spice.

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:40.133
Now we're adding the oregano.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.567
Alright.

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:49.300
And then I'm gonna take one of
my lime wedges and just squeeze

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.067
a little bit of fresh
lime juice over the top.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:57.167
Just kind of gives it
a nice fresh taste.

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:02.567
And then what I'm gonna do is
sort of pat the spices into the

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:06.500
tilapia so that way when I flip
them they just don't absorb into

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.300
the liquid and then
I'm gonna flip 'em.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.467
And we're gonna put the spices
on the other side as well.

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:17.367
So, flip.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.533
Alright.

00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:37.067
So now we are going to add the
rest of the spices on the other

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:39.267
side of the fish.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.600
And now I'm adding
the curry powder.

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:56.133
And the garlic powder.

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:05.933
And the black pepper.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:14.300
And the chili powder.

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:23.967
And the oregano.

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:33.667
And a little bit of lime juice.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.633
And then what I'm gonna do is
let the fish cook for 3 minutes

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:40.733
on this side and then I'm
gonna flip it again,

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:42.933
cook it for 3 minutes
on the other side.

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:44.333
And it's done.

00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:58.267
Alright.

00:05:58.267 --> 00:06:00.200
So we've cooked the fish for
3 minutes on one side and

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.300
then 3 minutes on the other
side and it looks pretty good.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.067
The way that you can tell it's
done is you take your spatula

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.533
and you stick it into
the middle of the fish.

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:10.867
And as long as it's white all
the way through and that it's

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:13.400
not clear anymore, that's
how you know it's done.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.700
So I'm just gonna take
out one filet right now.

00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:20.367
Put it on my plate.

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:22.733
And you can serve this
with a lot of things.

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:25.767
I like to usually eat it with
brown rice, but today we're

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:28.700
actually gonna serve it with
my Death by Garlic Roasted

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.967
Asparagus which we
have right here.

00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.067
So I'm gonna put a little
bit of that on the plate.

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:41.033
This is a really good low carb
option if you're trying to watch

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.367
your carbs.

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:45.600
And I think I'm actually
gonna take a bite and see how it

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.800
tastes.

00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:53.333
It tastes really good.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:57.067
The lime and the curry makes
a really nice combination.

00:06:57.067 --> 00:07:00.300
