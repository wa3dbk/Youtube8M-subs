GREG GROSSMAN: My name is Greg Grossman and
I'm 16 years old.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.820
TERRE GROSSMAN: Greg was very young and people
were calling him the prodigy chef and I just

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.129
wanted him to be a happy kid.
GREGG GROSSMAN: We have an hour til the tasting

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.800
starts. We're just finishing up some final
proteins.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.539
SCOTT FELDMAN: I do think that you'll be reading magazines
like Bon Appetit's Best New Chefs issue and

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.789
a Greg Grossman could pop up for sure.
GREGG GROSSMAN: It wasn't just a job on the

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.489
side. It wasn't just a hobby. It wasn't just
something I was interested in. Food really

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.860
became my life.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.540
[Music]

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.350
GREGG GROSSMAN: [On the phone] It's an 8 course
tasting menu but I'm sending someone out—someone's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.559
already out now buying backup wine. Right
now we're at six courses and two desserts.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:45.039
[Music]

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:52.039
GREGG GROSSMAN: So he needs to do a cognac
bar blanc and a sherry reduction and a rosé sauce.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.609
[Music]

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.969
GUNTHER BILALI: Hey Greg.
GREGG GROSSMAN: How's it goin' boss?

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.550
GUNTHER GILALI: My friend Greg.
GREGG GROSSMAN: Pleasure. It's great to meet

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.949
you.
GUNTHER BILALI: I'm looking forward to see

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.700
if he could handle it quite frankly. This
is the first time that I'm tasting his food.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.540
GREGG GROSSMAN: A piece of trout in the bottom,
some of the raisin around it, olive oil...

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.409
[Music]

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.500
GREGG GROSSMAN: We're definitely putting our
all behind this tasting and we're hoping that

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.820
his reactions are going to be positive.
GREGG GROSSMAN: [To sous chef] Use the aromatic

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.350
veg, infuse the liquid.
GREGG GROSSMAN: We're gonna try to give Gunther

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.720
a large spectrum of what we would like to
do in the restaurant space, so we're going

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.880
to be covering seven courses and two desserts.
All classic dishes from the 1920s reinvented

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.040
and reimagined in new ways.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.820
GUNTHER BILALI: Have you noticed anything
about the chef?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.649
GUEST: That he's young?
GREGG GROSSMAN: Sixteen.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.719
GUEST: Sixteen? Really?

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:52.719
TERRE GROSSMAN: Greg was always doing things
that surprised us as a young boy. The only

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.259
TV show on in his room was Cartoon Network
and all of a sudden the Food Network was running

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.780
constantly.
GREGG GROSSMAN: One day I came home from school

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.950
and told my mom to get out of the kitchen
and said that I wanted to make her dinner.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.909
I remember her popping in like every five
minutes to make sure that I wasn't burning

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.820
the house down.
TERRE GROSSMAN: I think that was the point

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.200
when I realized that he was amazing at cooking.
GREGG GROSSMAN: I actually went into a kitchen

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.530
that was near me and asked to start dishwashing
and bussing tables. My parents were definitely

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.730
a little wary at first. They didn't want their
8, 9 year old kid where there was knives and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.930
fire as my mom would say. Or if the state
liquor authority or child services came in

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.819
the restaurant probably would have been closed
down.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.959
GREGG GROSSMAN: It was sort of that spark
of this is what I want to do. I was really

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.330
driven to just go forth and learn as much
as I possible could about food and cooking.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.830
Someone from the New York Post actually came
into my school. It ended up being a full page

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.640
which I was shocked at. There was definitely
a turning point. After that, I had a lot of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.739
people asking me to do things for them like
getting to cook for Martha Stewart and all

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.500
of these amazing people was just a once in
a lifetime opportunity. I mean, really for

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.799
anybody.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.099
[Music]

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.799
GREGG GROSSMAN: How much is it?
VENDOR: Like $200.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.500
GREGG GROSSMAN: $200?
VENDOR: I'll email you an invoice.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.299
GREGG GROSSMAN: That would be awesome. Thank
you man.

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.360
VENDOR: Thank you.
GREGG GROSSMAN: I appreciate it.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.230
TERRE GROSSMAN: Greg has basically become
a businessperson at a young age.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.400
GREGG GROSSMAN: I go to the professional children's
school and my schedule changes on a day-to-day

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.930
basis depending on what I'm doing at work.
It's a mix of working in kitchens and being

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.780
a chef, I'm always pursuing new opportunities,
helping people who are trying to start restaurants...

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.220
GREGG GROSSMAN: [To agent] Thank you.
SCOTT FELDMAN: I do worry sometimes are we

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.010
pushing him too hard? Is he pushing himself
too hard?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.970
GREGG GROSSMAN: We do need to figure out someone
to go in a cab to the hotel in Reddington

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.040
right now. Ugh, you're killing me.
GREGG GROSSMAN: Can we start rendering the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.959
skin side now?
TERRE GROSSMAN: I'm always in awe of the amount

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.709
of pressure and details he handles.
GREGG GROSSMAN: [To Greg] Something burning?

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.930
GREGG GROSSMAN: Why is my mother here? I'm
very confused.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.930
GUNTER BILALI: His age was kind of a road
block in the beginning but when I took the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.010
time to get to know him, I saw his character
and his level of maturity and all the factors

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.379
that made him special.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.379
GREGG GROSSMAN: We decided to serve a seared
New York strip that has a pommes sal vi goat

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.189
which is a very old French recipe.
SCOTT FELDMAN: You don't realize that he is

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.269
16. You really do think you're talking to
a very mature adult who's been in the business

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.320
for years and years.
GREGG GROSSMAN: Oh, we need to caramelize

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.400
the baby fennel too.
GUNTHER BILALI: The Bowery bought him all

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.400
this kitchen equipment and all these chefs
are coming up to him. I was like—I was shocked.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.130
It really was wild.
GREGG GROSSMAN: I think it needs a little

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.730
acid, though. You agree? Rice wine vinegar
or—lime!

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.080
[Chefs discussing flavor]

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.010
GREGG GROSSMAN: I love this! I just wish it
was for 30 people instead of 6.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.740
[Music]

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.580
GREGG GROSSMAN: There is freshly caught and smoked
trout smoked over cherry and apple wood and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.310
on top there's a potato tuile. On top, the
trout is covered in some vanilla oil. Enjoy.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.960
[Laughing]

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.280
GREGG GROSSMAN: It's going very well. We've
been on time with everything. I'm very happy

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.280
with all the food that's going out. Everyone
seems to be happy with it.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.470
GUEST: It's fantastic. The trout is excellent.
GUNTHER BILALI: Great dish. The fish is great.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.850
GREGG GROSSMAN: It was a lot of hard work
to put the tasting together in a very short

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.260
period of time. We were very concerned in
the beginning about Gunther and his team's

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.770
reactions to our food.
GUNTHER BILALI: I thought the food was very

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.780
creative. Cooked perfectly. The presentation
was excellent. It was a great meal. I think

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.930
that we have an excellent foundation to build
from and take it from there.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.150
GREGG GROSSMAN: Obviously it's an amazing
opportunity for someone my age to do something

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.150
like this and I'm very very happy, trilled
in fact that they enjoyed it like they did

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.020
and we'll be able to move forward with Gunther
on the new restaurant project.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.270
