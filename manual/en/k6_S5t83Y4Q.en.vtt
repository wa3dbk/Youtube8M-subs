00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:08.790
Y’know what?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:21.609
We’re going to play this review at a higher
difficulty.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.259
We’re going to do the entire thing without
using the S-word.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.499
Y’know the one, and if you don’t, just
remember the first scene of Jurassic Park,

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.730
when the dinosaur gets loose and starts chewing
on the guy and Muldoon’s shouting orders...

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.370
Yeah, that one.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.460
We can go without that word because when you
get right down to it, that’s not what Splatoon

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.460
is about.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.460
At all.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.730
Sure, it centers around an online, 4-on-4
experience where taking out enemies is certainly

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.540
to your tactical benefit, but if all you’re
doing is being a hunter-killer and neglecting

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.820
the actual state of the battlefield, you’re
going to lose.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.539
Splatoon is about one thing: ink.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.179
And in true Nintendo fashion, those three
letters and that one concept gets polished,

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:04.900
tweaked, altered, and elaborated upon into
something truly impressive.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.810
Whether you’re a kid or a squid, both states
fall under the umbrella of “Inkling,”

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.560
a brilliant choice for a name since it not
only wraps up that dichotomy with a bow but

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.070
also indicates that the whole package is a
completely new idea.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.350
From a genesis of blocks of tofu spewing ink
around a square comes a game about speculative

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.549
evolution, where the Squids defeated the Octopi
for the right to grow legs, take on an anthropomorphic

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.310
form, and build cities that look a hell of
a lot like Shibuya.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.230
You’ve got the fashion-consciousness of
The World Ends With You, the rebellious, tag-the-world

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.689
mentality of a Jet Set Radio, and a lobby
area that shows you just how Miiverse integration

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:38.829
should be done.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.850
Best way to cool off from a strenuous bout
of ink-flinging is by running around and just

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.170
throwing Yeahs at particularly interesting
bits of art, which is to say anything that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.439
doesn’t have Squidward in it by this point.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.490
But let’s dig into the gameplay, shall we?

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.000
Eight squids-and/or-kids enter, four emerge
victorious, by putting their ink all over

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.050
EVERYTHING.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.240
Ink the floors, because that’s how you win.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.960
Ink the walls, because even if you don’t
get credit for them at the end they’re still

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.750
a tactical consideration and allow you to
use the verticality of these maps to your

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.790
advantage.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.190
Ink your opponents, since the time it takes
them to respawn means there’s that many

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.510
seconds with one fewer gun spewing the opposing
color.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.970
The more you ink, the faster you build up
your special meter, allowing access to your

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.190
massive attacks like turning into a huge,
invincible Kraken or unleashing a large, terrain-piercing

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.180
acoustic attack called the Killer Wail.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.500
(Have I mentioned this game loves fish puns?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.599
Because it loves fish puns.)

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.800
You distribute your ink via a variety of weapons,
some designed for close-range like the huge

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.409
freakin’ paint rollers you’re probably
heard were OP; to mid-range, rapid-fire arms

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.540
designed to look like Super Soakers or airbrushes;
to long-range, slow-firing chargers for finding

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.569
a nice sniper’s perch and covering your
allies.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.300
Sure seems to be using plenty of terms from
that genre-that-won’t-be-named, huh?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.370
Well, how many of those games let you turn
into a squid?

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.160
Need to climb up a wall?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.540
Ink it and squid right up there.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.830
Need to get the hell away from some dope with
a roller?

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.950
Squid back the way you came.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.980
Need to ambush an incoming enemy?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.849
Chill out in squid form, you’re nearly invisible.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.849
Grate in your way?

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.849
Squids fit through ‘em.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.130
Oh, and it speeds your reloading, too.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.409
One mechanic, one trigger, innumerable facets.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.159
And that’s just where things begin to diverge.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.860
First off, yes, there’s no voice chat in
this game.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.819
Frankly, I don’t miss it one bit, since
you have - right on the gamepad - a map updated

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.940
in real time that shows the entire battlefield,
your color, your enemy’s color, and the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.750
positions of your allies.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.569
If you can’t figure out your next move based
on that data, guess what, you’ve got bigger

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.350
problems than not being able to yell at your
teammates about what they’re doing wrong.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.709
Turf War matches are a scant three minutes
long, which has been determined by science

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.110
to be the optimal duration: any longer and
you’d lose that hectic sense of urgency,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.920
any shorter and you’d be left with too much
un-inked territory and little cause to engage

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920
the opponents.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.040
Honestly, how much coordination do you need
for those three minutes?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.680
If you’re with a team of weakling inklings,
chances are you wouldn’t have won had you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.990
been able to bark commands and, eventually,
racist invective at them anyway.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.480
Even in Ranked mode, you’re not going to
need to school ur noobz as it’s not even

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.240
available until a player reaches level 10,
by which point they’ve played through several

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.570
hours of Turf Wars and should be able to handle
themselves.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.700
Ranked Battles play by a different set of
rules, though, as the teams vie for control

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.640
of a particular tract of land called the “Splat
Zone” and must hold that area for the duration

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.660
of a countdown.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.610
It mixes up strategy rather significantly;
the Squid Beakons which come with my favorite

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.810
Krak-On Roller are fairly useless in Turf
Wars, but deploying them near the Splat Zone

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.480
allows my allies to jump right back into the
fray faster after respawning and regardless

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.470
of our current positions.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.820
Needless to say, I know my strategy, and from
what I've enjoyed of Ranked thus far my allies

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.910
do as well.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.200
This particular mode wasn’t available at
launch, which made some people rather upset

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.200
because it’s quite good.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.760
It was, however, available four days after
launch, as Nintendo seem to be rolling out

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.400
features to compensate both for a lack of
initially-available content and to keep interest

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.810
on their box during an otherwise sparse summer
season, and one without even the faintest

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.190
hint of that elusive Zelda title for the Wii
U.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.480
It’s a mildly controversial decision, but
it’s hard to categorize the game even at

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.030
the outset as anything less than “fun.”

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.880
At least the servers have been mostly stable,
too, despite getting utterly hammered by heavy

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.880
turnout.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.160
The occasional lag spike can wreck your game
and eject you from the match, but those’ve

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:36.780
been few and far between, even on this floating
chip shop we call home.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.520
One particular wrinkle that helps with the
replay value is the daily refresh and improved

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.140
stock of the outfitters in the aptly-named
Booyah Base (fish pun!), where a band of shopkeepers

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.400
will constantly critique your style and freshness.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.680
As your level improves in online play, new
and more powerful gear will appear, with a

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.270
variety of stat-boosting parameters like increased
movement speed, reduced ink consumption, or

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.240
a number of stealth tricks.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.190
Each piece of gear - aside from looking funky
and/or dope - also has a number of secondary

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.990
slots according to its level which develop
sub-abilities through EXP gain in battles.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.210
And I haven’t even mentioned the single-player
campaign yet!

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.070
Here’s a point where I don’t need the
S-word at all, as the solo Splatoon experience

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.330
is more akin to a platformer that just happens
to have a gun.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.390
While there’s certainly some Octobot forces
to be inked with extreme prejudice, most of

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.580
the action here is from a brand of running,
jumping, climbing, and huge freakin’ bosses

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.970
that wouldn’t feel out of place in a Mario
Galaxy game, but which feel like a natural

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.520
extension of the mobility-centric elements
of the entire ink mechanic.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.301
It’s not a terribly long or fruitful quest,
with just over a couple dozen stages and some

00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:41.770
alternate versions of stock weapons to unlock,
but playing through it will make you a more

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.110
effective and agile combatant in the multiplayer.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.160
And then you get to redo most of it in amiibo
challenges, but we’ll get to those later.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:58.340
It’s easy to say there were high expectations
for this game - after all, it’s Nintendo’s

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.270
biggest new IP since Pikmin, and it’s been
a long 14 years to say the least - but Splatoon

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.670
has managed to become something more than
just “Nintendo made a shoo…” nope, we

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.190
agreed on this, not gonna say it.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.710
It’s not about the guns, anyway, it’s
about the ink, it’s about using the ink

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.190
for stealth and controlling key chokepoints
on the battlefield, it’s about using the

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.790
ink as a tool for getting up walls and giving
yourself an escape lane and a chance to reload.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.840
You can’t do that with bullets.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.280
And, this being Nintendo, their unique interpretation
on the genre comes complete with a top-flight

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.610
soundtrack, interesting, well-modeled characters,
and a layer of adorableness that makes the

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.780
whole thing immediately accessible and unironically
fun.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.760
Even if you can’t tell the guy next to you
that the Squiffer is a weapon for ****s and

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:48.740
he’s a **** ******* **** ******ing ***** *** ****** mother
***** **** ***** for picking it.
