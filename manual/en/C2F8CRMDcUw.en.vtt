ABC 
News sat down with a woman by the name of

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.869
Cindy Jackson Cindy Jackson has holds the
record for the person with the most plastic

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.830
surgeries in the world okay shed's had a total
of fifty five cosmetic procedures done and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.460
you know look she obviously has an issue she
has psychological issues but given the fact

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.910
that she's had the most plastic surgeries
in the world she doesn't look that bad okay

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.370
let's watch the video [video clip] if you
pass Cindy Jackson on the street you would

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.899
have no idea why she is famous why she holds
a world record but Cindy Jackson has had one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.190
hundred thousand dollars of cuts pulls peels
jabs and a whole lot of whatever that is it's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.059
not just operations I mean I've had fourteen
full scale operations with anesthetic only

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.210
fourteen but I've had botox my upper and lower
eyes done twice five face lifts electrocution

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.970
in fact you'd be hard pressed to find a part
of her body that hasn't been cosmetically

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.640
enhanced I've never even heard of this knee
liposuction yes yes you know on the inside

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.950
of the knees you get the fat pads you're knees
almost rub together when you walk watch Cindy's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.970
face change over the years in her search for
perfect beauty and eternal youth she's had

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.820
more cosmetic procedures than anyone else
ever fifty two that's a world record Cindy

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.759
is now fifty five years old I didn't set out
to set a world record is was never my ambition

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.240
it's just that I had so much done like recently
to her hands I'd had everything done to look

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.150
younger to look better and my hands were letting
me down so she had them injected with a substance

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.979
that apparently stimulates collagen production
I did have prominent veins and tendons sticking

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.479
up and now you don't see them at all you're
messing with nature nature messed with me

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.390
I don't have any problem messing with nature
that's absolutely true I'm messing with nature

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.130
but that's what people do we redirect water
we call it plumbing you know that's not natural

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.400
the way I look at myself [end of clip] alright
so you get a little taste of her insecurities

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.220
as she mentioned there she's had fifty five
different procedures done and when you read

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.920
about her you automatically assume that she's
going to look like cat women but then you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.640
see her and yeah she looks like she's had
a ton of plastic surgery but at least she

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.730
doesn't look that disastrous she needs help
okay she later on in the video talks about

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.900
her father and how her father never told her
that she was beautiful and made her feel ugly

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.960
and obviously that's carried into her adult
life and now she's going off and she's doing

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.420
all these crazy plastic surgery don't do it
I'm not one of those people that says don't

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.450
get plastic surgery at all if there's one
thing that you've been insecure about your

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.820
whole life and you want to change it then
okay but there has to be balance in your life

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.760
there has to be as Cenk would say bounds of
reason so yeah I feel bad for her you know

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200
I hear you but I'm going to say something
a little un-p.c. it kind of worked out for

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.070
her now look you know me I'm much more anti-plastic
surgery than you are right I think something

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.430
is going to go wrong somewhere down the line
it's not a good idea et cetra but you know

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.751
we also have to keep it real she didn't look
that bad I'm surprised that she looked that

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:43.880
decent and her plumbing point might have been
a little absurd but kind of fun and not that

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.210
bad we do mess with nature in other ways she
almost won me over the plastic surgery no

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.670
that's way too much and I think that she got
incredibly lucky that nothing has gone wrong

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.760
that you know the news article I mean the
video you saw said fifty two surgery the article

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.390
said fifty five maybe she got three in between
who knows she gets so many but it's a minor

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.290
miracle that she hasn't hurt herself significantly
in the process so don't do it but keeping

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.730
it real it didn't look that bad yeah and I'm
not going to say don't do it I mean don't

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.540
do fifty plus plastic surgeries don't get
your knees liposuctioned it's an incredible

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.650
waste of money and incredibly risky and I
think plastic surgery has become so common

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.900
that people automatically forget all of the
risks that are you know included in getting

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.720
these procedures done but look I agree with
you Cenk whatever she did she did it the smart

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:57.100
way she went to the right people she must
have done her research and that's a good thing
