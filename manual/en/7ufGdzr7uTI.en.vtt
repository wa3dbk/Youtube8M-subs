00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:01.601
- On this episode, I talk about

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:04.263
shifting TV budgets to video,

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:06.294
I talk about wine.

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:07.849
Yeah, I still talk about it.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.407
And I talk about how do I stay on top of

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:13.542
technology from San Francisco.

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.708
You keep asking questions.

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.288
I will continue to answer them.

00:00:18.288 --> 00:00:22.445
(light music)

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:25.039
Everybody, this is Gary Vay-ner-chuk

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.338
and you're watching episode 29

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.298
of the #AskGaryVee Show.

00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:31.099
Fun fact about 29,

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.184
I don't have one.

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:34.364
And so here we are.

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:36.731
You have not seen the SF office.

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.524
Most of you in my whole VaynerNation

00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:40.244
have never seen the SF office

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.152
so it's exciting for me
to now tape an episode

00:00:43.152 --> 00:00:44.993
here in San Francisco.

00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:46.598
A tremendous crew of peeps here.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:47.845
Big shout out to all of you guys.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:49.449
I'm thrilled to be doing
this with you guys.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.906
Also, I'm trying a little
bit of a new format today.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.858
I'm going a little bit shorter

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:55.643
so feedback, question of the day,

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:57.560
what do you think of the
three question format

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.526
versus the five question format?

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.721
Yes, I did the question
of the day upfront.

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.581
Deal with it.

00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:04.584
- [Mayanmurfee] Ben asks,

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:06.676
"What do you think about
recent Omnicom advice

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:10.764
to move 25 percent of ad
budgets to online video?"

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.883
- So for the small businesses
or the entrepreneurs,

00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:16.174
Omnicom is a big kind
of conglomerate agency

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.254
in my VaynerMedia world these days

00:01:18.254 --> 00:01:20.181
and they do a lot of what's
called working media,

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:21.816
the dollars you spend for distribution.

00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:23.805
Not to create content.

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.908
Something we do a lot in social channels

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.733
but not on TV, print, radio,
all that kind of stuff

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.275
so I just want want to set the
stage for that question.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.380
The thing that scares me

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.221
with that general kind of statement

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.489
is that when people think of online video,

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.903
they think about spending five, 10 percent

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:42.926
of the overall budget,

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:44.645
let's call it 100 thousand dollars,

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:46.202
on the video production,

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:47.756
the quality, the stuff

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.631
and 95 on the distribution

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:50.863
and then what they spend on,

00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:52.420
and maybe up to 80.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.017
Maybe 80 to 90.

00:01:54.017 --> 00:01:54.784
Let's say 80.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:57.325
I want to be polite here
today in San Francisco

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.208
because it's got a little
bit more of a polite vibe

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:00.833
than New York.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.130
Of that 80 percent,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.833
they pounded in right hook form.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.713
What does online video
mean to most people?

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:08.187
Let me just explain what it means.

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.380
It's pre-rolls on YouTube

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.215
where people tab out

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:12.483
and don't actually consume it.

00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:15.137
You go to espn.com and a video pops up

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:17.356
and takes over 30 seconds of my time

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.660
which pisses me off.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.295
And so what I'm most worried about

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:21.325
when I hear people allocating

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:23.409
and it's part of the bigger story which is

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.736
that people talk about moving TV budgets

00:02:25.736 --> 00:02:26.974
into other places.

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:30.517
My problem is I actually like
live television commercials

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.871
more than I like banner ads on websites

00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.800
and pre-roll video

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.347
that's blocking the user

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:37.705
from doing what they want.

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.074
So this isn't about
traditional or digital.

00:02:40.074 --> 00:02:42.090
This is are you bringing value

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.412
and when I hear move from television

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:46.008
and put it into online video,

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.070
what I know is going on in
actual practitioner world

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.415
is people are spending
that money on online video

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:53.417
that is annoying customers

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.590
and putting it in places
where they don't want it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.972
versus putting more
percentage of the money

00:02:57.972 --> 00:03:00.165
on actually creating great video

00:03:00.165 --> 00:03:02.005
and then figuring out a more native way

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:03.308
to distribute it.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:04.250
That being said,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.794
Facebook dark post video native to me

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:08.465
is a very attractive option,

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:09.703
especially if you've been seeing it,

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:10.723
the audio doesn't play

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.226
but if you're into it, you click it.

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.584
And so that's my overall thought,

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:15.220
which is that in theory it's great

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.258
that we're moving traditional dollars here

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:20.805
but I see a lot of people
misplaying digital.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.095
- [mayanmurfee] Laura asks,

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:24.100
"On Fridays, we drink wine.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.610
What's a good drinking home alone

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.909
bottle to yourself wine?"

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.663
- Laura, I'm,

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:31.817
Laura?
- [Voiceover] Laura.

00:03:31.817 --> 00:03:34.083
- Laura, I'm a big white wine fan

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.237
and so the place where
I'm really obsessed with

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:40.213
these days is Italian
White Non Pinot Grigio

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:42.002
so NPG.

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:42.913
And what I mean by that is

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:45.192
look for things like Soave.

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.792
Look for Greco Di Tufo.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.399
Look for Fiano.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:52.001
These other white varietals from Italy

00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.842
where a lot of people don't know them.

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:56.050
They don't realize their quality.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.479
And I think between 8 and 22 dollars,

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.658
you can get an enormous array

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.353
of tremendous high acid quality

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:05.417
drink by themselves

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:06.840
but wait I'm drinking it by itself

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.323
but now I want a little cheese

00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:10.041
still able to fold into that

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.194
so Italian white wines to me are grossly

00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:16.337
and Stunwin because I know you're
going to be with DRock,

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:18.043
when you edit this episode,

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:21.031
throw up a couple of logos of labels here.

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.382
Actually take over my whole face.

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:25.325
Show seven or eight
logos of Italian whites

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:27.128
in that eight to 22 dollar range

00:04:27.128 --> 00:04:29.048
that people can slow motion this video

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:29.867
and catch the name of

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:32.298
or link it down below.

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:33.383
- [mayanmurfee] Matthew asked,

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.020
"You talk about upcoming companies

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.762
and predicting their success.

00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.748
Where and how do you find
these rising companies?"

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:43.021
- Matt, this is why I love this damn show.

00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.311
We are getting into actual tangible stuff

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.871
not just the sizzle that
I have to do on stage

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:48.623
because I only have an hour

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.872
and I got to make you pay
attention and then drill you.

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:52.510
This is the quality of this show.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.095
Here are two tangible things
you should do every day.

00:04:55.095 --> 00:04:56.036
I'm going to add a third.

00:04:56.036 --> 00:04:57.183
Three things.

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.901
Jason Hirschhorn.

00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.973
Pause because I was going to say Google it

00:05:01.973 --> 00:05:03.118
and then I wanted to say Bing it

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:03.895
and then I got caught.

00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:04.795
You know I never get caught

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.636
so little rusty here in San Francisco.

00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:07.766
Google Jason Hirschhorn.

00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:09.911
Media ref is what I think it is.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.803
He's got a newsletter.

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.682
Tremendous way to stay on top of it.

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:13.709
TechMeme

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:16.293
T-E-C-H-M-E-M-E

00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:17.474
Recode.

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:18.989
These are two blogs that I think,

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.782
well, TechMeme's an
aggregator of all the news.

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:21.841
I go there every morning

00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:23.397
to see what's bubbled up.

00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:24.830
Recode I just like in general

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.832
and TechCrunch, that's mostly just solid

00:05:26.832 --> 00:05:28.390
but TechMeme aggregates everything

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.001
so I go to Tech M-E-M-E every morning.

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:31.957
I read everything.

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.300
That helps me see things

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.705
and then my littlest funnest hack.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.781
I go into the iTunes
App Store every morning,

00:05:38.781 --> 00:05:40.457
click the Apps tab

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:44.869
and look at the top 150 paid and free apps

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:46.914
on the iTunes store

00:05:46.914 --> 00:05:49.167
to get a sense of when
things are bubbling up.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.020
Both Yik Yak, Snapchat,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.954
a lot of these things I kind
of watched grow organically

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.173
through that channel

00:05:57.173 --> 00:05:59.269
before the TechMemes and Recodes

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.619
even wrote about them

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:02.423
and so it's about putting in the work.

00:06:02.423 --> 00:06:05.074
Those are your two tips of the day.

00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:06.350
Everybody, thank you so much for watching

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.950
episode 29 of the #AskGaryVee Show

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.015
here in San Francisco.

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:12.171
Again, let me know what you think

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.663
of the three question format

00:06:13.663 --> 00:06:15.582
versus the five.

00:06:15.582 --> 00:06:17.142
You keep asking questions.

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:18.931
I'll keep answering them.

00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:19.773
Oh crap, wait.

00:06:19.773 --> 00:06:21.674
Subscribe.

00:06:22.777 --> 00:06:24.199
I need subscriptions

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.804
because I can't push this many right hooks

00:06:26.804 --> 00:06:28.725
in social so subscribe.
