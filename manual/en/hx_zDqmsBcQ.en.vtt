00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:12.303
Super Dimension Fortress
MACROSS

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.520
Piercing through the mighty sky...

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.590
...a thunderbolt strikes the Earth.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.430
To awaken us, the young mankind...

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.470
...so struck the Light.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.500
Macross! Macross!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.150
The brave youths who arise...

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.250
...fight to protect their loved ones...

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.320
...all through the days of their voyage, as the war rages on.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.220
"Will you love me, tomorrow?"

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:05.490
Slashing through the Darkness, their destination is...

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.740
...the blue planet, shining in the distance.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.280
Macross! Macross!     Macross!

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.770
To the Darkness far beyond the stars,

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.850
Taking along the children of the universe,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.890
The Arrow of Fate shoots off

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.960
To seek an end to the timeless war.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.990
Macross! Macross!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.440
Vermillion rays of sunlight and lullabies...

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.510
The sleeping newborn and mother's breast...

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.580
Heroes fight to protect their loved ones.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.080
"Will you love me tomorrow?"

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.990
Slashing through the Darkness, the beam of light extends.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.230
Will there be a day when it will fade away?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.770
Macross! Macross!    Macross!
