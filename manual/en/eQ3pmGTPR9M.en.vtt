00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.670
I'm a graduate lawyer at a commercial firm
in the city.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.369
Studying law is about immersing yourself in
the law and any law school is able to do that.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:15.080
They provide you with an environment, the
library, the classes, the lecturers, the books

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.789
the texts etc, about immersing yourself in
the law. What VLS does, what I found was a

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.359
great advantage, was that you're also able
to immerse yourself in the actual courts because

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.349
you're right in the centre there.

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.199
One of the stand out features of Victoria
Law School is that they appreciate that it's

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.290
more than the theoretical part. You know,
there's a lot of practice and experience

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.700
and skills that you have to get and they do
provide a line of opportunities and experiences, 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.490
for example in the Magistrates Court program, they have a County Court program, they do something

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.380
with the Sunshine Youth Legal Centre, and
all these opportunities and experiences are

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.090
open to every student to participate in.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
In the County Court program it's a small
group of students who go in and they basically

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.100
have a one-on-one with the Judge over a period
of time. It's phenomenal, because you're

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.070
sitting in with this Judge in his courtroom
and he's telling you how the court system

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.310
works. You just don't get that anywhere
else.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.090
With a law degree you can work for government,
you can work as a criminal lawyer, family

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.289
lawyer, commercial lawyer, banking. It's
a really great degree to have no matter what

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:20.499
your future holds.

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:24.780
There's a program that the law school has,
it's a mentoring program, and the mentor

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.609
I was assigned to I'm still in touch with
him today, and I run things by him.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.359
The support that the faculty offers - because
of the size they're able to offer that unique

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.079
one on one support.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.619
Court proceedings are infamously know and
associated with large volumes of documents.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.859
I've been giving some presentations on the
iPad and how a lawyer could take advantage

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.100
of the iPad and make it work to their benefit.
Be more efficient more productive and ultimately

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.100
paperless. More environmentally friendly.
More organised. Less clutter. It's Cheaper.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.229
I mean they say a law degree is the key to
the world. You know, you could do anything

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.169
and everything and the opportunities and the
directions are limitless.
