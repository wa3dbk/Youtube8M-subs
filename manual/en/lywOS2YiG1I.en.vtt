00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:10.820
Actually to do this, there is volume here
in the body of this rabbit. We need something

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.540
to replenish this and be able later to take
it off without deforming this shape, I chose

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.760
this, but you can have anything. One of the
things you have to do whenever you choose

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.300
the base, is wrap with paper, because the
paper is going to stick into the clay, then

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:48.930
it will be easier to remove whatever you place
as a support. Normally all the clay figurines

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.240
require a structure. This is going to be our
structure. We have to put this away after

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.520
we make the model; this is a little bit of
a challenge. One of the things we are going

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:15.310
to do right now, is to wrap these slabs to
this base in order to make the body. We are

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:38.610
going to start like this because the body
is going to be, at least, this long.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.700
Now you can see we have to melt the two pieces
together. This is very important to have a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:02:04.420
solid structure

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:25.950
and figurine. Then we know right here we have
the base of the body. This equals this, we

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.340
have to add more material here, and try to
come down, and try not to shape too much downward

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:58.340
because our structure equals this tight form
which we use.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:16.249
Now
we have more or less the body structure here.
