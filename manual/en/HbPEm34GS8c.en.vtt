Hi I'm Janna from Cutting Edge Stencils.
Today we are going to stencil some

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.960
furniture. Together with Kim Myles, we
created this beautiful Indian inlay

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.419
furniture stenciling kit. With this kit
and Benjamin Moore paint, we're going to

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:33.110
transform this, into that! And this is how
we did it.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.140
 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.790
Look how beautiful it turned out and it
was so much fun and so easy.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.350
Do-it-yourself with Cutting Edge
Stencils and Benjamin Moore paints.  Thank

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.979
you for watching!
