00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:06.830
Hi, Welcome to HomeRemodelWorkshop 
don't you just hate it when that neighbor kid shows up and blows a hole in 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.919
your wall with a doorknob

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:15.919
in the next couple of minutes we're going to show you how to take care of that

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.800
some basic tools and materials you're going to need to do this project

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.919
is the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.439
wall board knife

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.400
the drywall compound pan

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.410
drywall compound, a utility knife

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.410
a keyhole saw and a scrap piece of drywall

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.240
as an example of the repair that we're going to be fixing today

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.439
is this hole that 

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:50.070
was caused by a doorknob hitting your drywall
I'm sure we've all seen it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.720
and if not in our houses in someone
elses

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.980
here is where we start

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.160
first you need to cut out the drywall
patch with your keyhole saw

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.940
roughly square it doesn't have to be
perfect

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.580
take your tape measure

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.170
measure both directions of your patch

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.650
and you're going to cut your patch
slightly smaller than the opening

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.860
mark your scrap piece of drywall on the back with your patch side in the center

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.860
and about an inch and a half extra on all sides

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.600
then after marking the back of the patch, go ahead and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.890
take your utility knife

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.939
cut the back of the paper only

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.010
do not cut all the way through the drywall patch

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.390
after cutting the back of the paper

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.810
slowly split off

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.810
the excess pieces leaving the paper on the
front of the drywall patch and clean it up

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.600
check the drywall patch for size

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.370
making sure that it fits

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:07.150
loosely in the hole

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.049
after you've tested your drywall patch for
fit

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.099
take drywall compound smear it around and
inside of the hole using ample amount

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.099
of mud

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.909
after applying generous amounts of
drywall compound

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.489
gently place your patch in the hole

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.749
allowing your knife to

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.969
flush the drywall patch up with the
surrounding surface of the

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.299
drywall wall around it

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.299
do not press to firmly in the center as
you'll push the patch into the hole

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:54.840
after placing drywall in hole

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.249
very gently apply a light coat of
drywall compound

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:04.399
so as not to press the drywall patch into
the hole

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:10.469
allow twenty four hours to dry

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.959
at this point lightly sand any high
spots

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.449
we are ready for our final drywall coat

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.809
apply mud

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:29.239
pulling firmly and as thinly as possible, pull as smoothly as you can

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.129
prior to final sanding

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.430
if you can see the inside of your wall

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.309
this is why this patch doesn't require
any nails or screws.  So there you go, 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:39.570
at this point

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.109
simply  lightly sand, prime and paint

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.449
the patch is gone

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.819
Have a nice day
