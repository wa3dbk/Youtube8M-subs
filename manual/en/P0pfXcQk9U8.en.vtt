Hey guys this is Kyle with MSD, today we are
going to show you how to update the Atomic

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.820
EFI.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.130
We've got a new update out that's going to
help you drive a little better.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.230
First off the micro SD card that came with
the system, you're going to want to put it

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.390
in a card reader, we've got a little USB converter
here, we got this one at Radio Shack you can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.279
go to Amazon.com, Best Buy, or Walmart or
where ever you find your common electronics

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.140
you'll find one of these there.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.040
Also before we get started your going to want
to copy down all of the settings that you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.710
have put in to your system, your initial set
up, your advanced set up timing, things like

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.710
that.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.550
This will be a hard restart so it will erase
all of those, but if you write them down first

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.809
it will be easy to plug them right back in,
it won't take but 2 minutes.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.810
Next go to AtomicEFI.com where you are going
to find this page where you can download the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.309
2 new firmware items that you need, just click
on the download button and read through the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.629
instructions, you'll be good to go but we're
going to walk you through them here.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.229
When you download them I suggest just put
them right on your desktop that way you can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.430
find them again, put your micro SD card into
a slot for the computer, and when it comes

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:25.140
up simply drag and drop the Atomic files into
the SD card, no need to put them into a sub

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
folder or anything like that, just right there
in the main folder.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.990
As soon as you have done that, close it out,
and your ready to take it to the Atomic and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.990
install.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.491
Alright we came outside to Chewie's 86' Chevy
truck that just got an Atomic installed and

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:47.950
we're going to do the update now, take your
micro SD card out of the card reader and then

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.671
the top of the hand held here you will see
a little slot and you just go right down there

00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:02.360
and it should pop in really easy and snap
in and then once it is in we'll key on without

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.860
starting the engine and immediately it goes
into an update.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.749
That will take about 30 seconds or so roughly
for this update to happen, as soon as the

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.700
update is done on the hand held it's going
to ask you about the second file that updates

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.860
the ECU, you want to hit up, and then select
yes, and then it will go into the next update,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.459
it says erasing at first and then it goes
into the update, agin it takes about 30 seconds,

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.749
and there it is the Atomic EFI is complete,
you just back out of the screen here with

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:42.319
the left arrow and your back in the main menu,
go into your initial set up, put all that

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.060
information in and your ready to roll.
