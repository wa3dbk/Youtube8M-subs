00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.940
I'm applying to CSM BA Fine Art

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.660
Talk to me about why you were particularly interested in
studying at Central Saint Martins

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.800
When the students apply for a BA, they've
made some decisions about the degree program

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.920
and in their portfolio they'd be
able to demonstrate and support that direction.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.840
I work a lot in black and white photography and I also do acting

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.960
and I know that CSM has a very large
department for that.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.740
It's really important that you have a focus on the
subject for which you're applying

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.266
so if you're applying for, say, graphic design

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.460
we'd expect to see an interest in typography,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.860
working with type and image
and all sorts of image making

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.560
because you might be going for the more
illustrative end of graphic design

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.320
so an awareness of what would be expected from me.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880
I came up with this thing that every time you do a piece of design,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.960
the creative process is all about work and play.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.680
Part of your job as an applicant is to research the college and the courses

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.020
because the key question is why
are you applying to this course specifically.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880
Of course if you're
applying from abroad you can't visit

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.100
you can't do an open day

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.020
but you can research us online.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.500
I got asked about where the inspiration comes from

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.280
what is the idea behind it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.540
why I want to be on that course specifically and my
interest.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.452
First of all I have to submit a mini portfolio of 12 images

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.369
also with a 250-word statement about my work

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.060
I wrote briefly about my practice, where my interests lay.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.720
I started to make discoveries about what can I do with drawing

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.600
what can I do with color

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260
what can I do with various media

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.759
and if I work with this in relation to that I actually may end up with something new and different.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.120
I'd also brought along a lot of documentary photography

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.480
of things I've done in the studio or done outside of the studio

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.000
and I sourced final images.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.900
What I did was to ask her to stand against the wallpaper and I put the camera on very long shutter speed

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.920
well, maybe two seconds.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.020
The need to be able to realize their imagination

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.120
they need to be able to visualize what they're thinking about

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.497
it's not just about drawing what
you see

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.660
it's actually drawing what your thought is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.860
and putting your thoughts on
paper.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620
They'll be expanding on their experimentation

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.380
and their ideas will be more mature.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.340
Their creative voice will be stronger.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.080
I decided to do something that I hadn't done before

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.300
I just made a pop-up book

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.680
based on the story of this beautiful bird...

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.980
You get the feeling that they're pushing at the boundaries a little bit

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.660
they are creating a little bit of tension between themselves and what they are doing.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.360
Very often our job is to help student understand what level is suitable for them.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.760
For example, if they want to do a BA programme

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.340
they may perhaps need more help with design development or process development

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.040
or expanding on their skills

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.220
or just the way they think

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.160
or even understand how to primary research and secondary source

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.640
they may well need
to do a foundation.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.100
Students have all sorts of different expectations

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.900
particularly if they have already come from a diploma

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.740
where they will have a range of quite developed technical skills

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.000
but they are quite lacking in terms of just the originality of their thinking or their concepts.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.300
Now, that's something that can be developed very quickly.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.780
I was offered Central Saint Martins' Graphic Design

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.260
but I wasn't offered to go into second year.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.880
I was thinking that I already have experience

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.820
why do I have to learn everything again

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.300
I got a bit insulted because I thought my
work is good.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.300
We just have to explain to the student that they are going to have a completely different experience

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.900
almost of deprogramming

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.340
by going into the first year of an undergraduate course here.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.120
It's about "unlearning"

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.580
letting your ego take a step back.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.120
It's not because they're not good enough to go into stage two as a direct entry

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.460
but they need to have more  experience of a different type of curriculum.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.620
I had to make so many things just so that this would work.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.460
Without first year I realized I wouldn't be able to do the work that I do now

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.460
although I wasn't happy at first, I'm very happy that I got to do my first year here.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.665
By the time they get to be here, I want to see a real focus on the discipline

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.960
and the skills then of that discipline evidenced.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.710
We're looking for a more acute sense of where it is you are going to go

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.580
and we're looking for that recognition of what it is you're going to learn.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.180
An important question you need to ask is

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.560
'what is it I'm looking to learn and develop on a degree?'.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.760
I had this idea that if it comes easily then it's what you are meant to do

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.860
if you struggle then it is not that great

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.500
but I love the struggle now

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.440
because with this persistence I get
such new great projects.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.300
That's really interesting that you've got to
engage with a struggle.
