00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.320
Welcome to the IU Southeast Children's Center!
Our facility is conveniently located just

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.110
across the parking lot from main campus. We
offer high-quality, affordable services to

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.020
students, faculty, staff, and members of the
local community with children between the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.890
ages of two to the age of thirteen.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.070
&gt;&gt; WANDA GREGORY: We operate as a preschool
during the day, which means we do a structured

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.050
academic curriculum with our children. Then,
we have the after-school program where the

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.790
older children come in and if the children
come in in the afternoon that need help with

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.620
their homework, the staff helps them with
their homework too.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.370
&gt;&gt; BARBARA KAELIN: The Children's Center makes
my life so much easier. It was the major reason

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.760
I decided to come to IUS.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.820
&gt;&gt; TAMMY TACKETT: It was right here when I
needed it for classes, when I needed to study,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.730
I mean it was just so convenient just to drop
off my children and know that they were safe

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.480
and sound and not too far away from me.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.000
&gt;&gt; MELANIE SMITH: I can feel comfortable bringing
my kids here. I feel like they're safe and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.620
they're happy and they're doing activities
that will engage them and that they enjoy.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.731
&gt;&gt; BARBARA HALL: We have all kinds of programs
that we have for the preschoolers, they come

00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:17.390
in the mornings mostly. We do art activities
with them, we do story-time, music, and we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
have the centers that they play in. We have
a computer room, we have a new big SmartBoard

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.461
that they really enjoy, we do all kinds of
programs on that.

00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:29.671
&gt;&gt; BARBARA K.: Especially for Nicholas, because
he is an only child, the Children's Center

00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:35.960
has enriched his life tremendously because
he doesn't get that kind of interaction with

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960
other children at home.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.880
&gt;&gt; WANDA: We are in a house that our children
are incorporated all into one large group.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.750
We don't have them sectioned off by ages into
different classrooms or anything.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.970
&gt;&gt; BARBARA H.: It makes the small children
feel really good with the bigger children,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.540
you know kind of as their peers and looking
up to them, and the big ones really enjoy

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.150
helping take care of the little ones.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.610
&gt;&gt; MELANIE: It's affordable daycare for me
that I can trust and as a single mom trying

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.399
to put herself through school, that's definitely
great.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.700
&gt;&gt; WANDA: We only charge for the time that
a person uses the Center. Many other places,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.230
they require that you pay whether you're there
or not. We are not contracted, which means

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.620
that they are free to come and go. It's an
as-needed basis.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.920
&gt;&gt; MELANIE: So that enables me to attend school.
If I had to pay full child-care expenses,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.510
I don't know if I would even be able to be
here.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.450
&gt;&gt; TAMMY: I would recommend the IUS Children's
Center to my friends because it is such a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.370
wonderful place. The staff, the care of the
children, it is great. The children here are

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.030
wonderful and I just think that my friends
would really enjoy bringing their children

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.030
here.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.830
&gt;&gt; WANDA: I love the kids coming in and just
seeing their expressions and they're so happy,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.610
and it's nice to know that you've made their
day or they're enjoying themselves while they're

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.599
here at the Center, and that's what drives
me to be coordinator and do what we do.
