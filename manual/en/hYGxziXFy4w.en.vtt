00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:09.782
Hello i'm Magnaomega

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.541
In another Speedpaint with CloudAlpaca.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.802
This time I'll draw Sailor Moon.

00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:21.320
In this process, I can take an hour approximately.

00:00:23.578 --> 00:00:27.639
So many attempts...

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.748
Until I find something I like.

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:45.847
I structure the anatomy better.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.675
I trying to keep the curves and energy of the original sketch.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.722
Drawing some details and clothing.

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:11.227
I used reference clothes of Xina, the Warrior Princess.

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:16.504
And I ink with the pencil with maximum hardness.

00:01:28.544 --> 00:01:30.194
Many details in the armor ...

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:08.419
For the Lunar Scepter, I used a reference image.

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:11.581
And I deform it to make it as a base.

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:39.312
For such long lines, I use the editable guide line of CloudAlpaca.

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.241
I give more volume to the line, with a thicker edge
&nbsp;simulating shadow.

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:05.057
In another layer I define large volumes of shadow.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.628
I keep the same color lineart.

00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:35.157
Then, I a create patterns deleting or adding fine lines.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.851
On a new layer, paint base colors.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.426
Colors can change many times during the process.

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:29.842
New layers for shadows.

00:05:44.897 --> 00:05:50.416
When I defining the background color, should I change
some  base colors and shadows.

00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:35.315
I add some gradients to vary the colors.

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.833
I add bounce color light to enhance the colors.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.399
And here's the final result.

00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:11.932
