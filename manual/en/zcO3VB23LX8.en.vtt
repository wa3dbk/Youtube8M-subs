Oven Baked Fried Green Tomatoes Recipe

00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:04.133
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. 
 Let me show you what I have:

00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.497
I have the Paula Deen Southern Cooking Bible in its hard back glory.

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:16.184
I originally just had it on my Kindle thing on my 
 iPhone, but I think having it in hard copy

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:20.503
and on my iPhone will give me just the kick in the 
 butt that I need to go back to the project and

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:29.722
finish what I started. I am going to start over, start anew. 
 Just take a deep breathe in, deep breath out,  

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:34.935
and do the 328 recipes project for this cookbook.

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:40.612
I am going to veganize it, as I told you all before and thank 
 you all so much. I love you guys for dealing with my craziness.

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:45.534
I'm like a 20 something, crazy, like figuring out life person.

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:48.971
So if you have stuck around for all of that, thank you so much.

00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:55.171
I am so excited to have all of you. It's like 11,000 of 
 you all. I never said thank you for 10,000 or any 1,000s

00:00:55.171 --> 00:01:01.510
So thank you so much for subscribing to my 
 channel. Okay, now I am just being silly.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.082
The only thing about this $30 cookbook, and yes I know that I 
 could have gotten it cheaper on amazon or where ever, 

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:11.004
but I like to support my local bookstore. Especially 
 when I use their internet all the time.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:17.996
$30 . . . that was half of my budget for the rest 
 of the month. So this is going to be a test.

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:23.801
But we will survive, we are going to make it. It's okay. Might have 
 to ask my parents for some money. Just playing, I got it.

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:31.115
It's okay. So today, Day 1 of the Project, Southern Queen of 
 Vegan Cuisine, we are going to start off with 

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:35.364
Fried Green Tomatoes. It is not only a movie here 
 in the south, we actually eat Fried Green Tomatoes.

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:40.060
But today I am going to try to make them a step healthier 
 as I always do and we are going to bake them.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.440
And, have a good time. Here we go.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:48.810
Oven Baked Fried Green Tomatoes Recipe

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:55.400
So we are going to start this recipe by thinly slicing our tomatoes and 
 you want them to be about a 1/4 - 1/2 in thickness.

00:01:55.403 --> 00:02:01.930
And you can tell that my tomato was a red tomato and it 
 was starting to ripe by the red colorization on the inside, 

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:05.640
but that is okay. Its okay. It is still a firm tomato.

00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:10.910
Lay your green tomato slices out onto paper towels, sprinkle them 
 with salt, and that is going to help 

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:12.350
to draw some of the moisture out.

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:17.440
Leave them for about 15 minutes and as you can 
 see all the moisture is on the paper towel

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.340
and it is even dripping off the top of the tomato, so 
 be sure to give the top a little pat too.

00:02:22.338 --> 00:02:29.080
Now you are going to preheat your oven to 425 degrees 
 Fahrenheit and lightly spray a baking sheet with a little

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:35.200
cooking oil, like in the spray can, or you can lightly 
 grease it with whatever you have. Go with it.

00:02:35.202 --> 00:02:38.380
In a small bowl, you are going to whisk 
 together water and ground flax seed. 

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:46.000
This is going to make like a viscous-gloopy mixture, kind of 
 like an egg wash to coat our tomatoes in.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.770
So leave that for about 5 minutes until it sets up.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.430
While that is setting up, you are going to take a shallow bowl. If 
 you have one of these lovely soup bowls it would be perfect.

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:59.770
My grandmother has taken a hobby to collect 
 them, so why not, lets use it.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:08.850
You are going to whisk together your flour, corn meal, 
 salt, pepper, paprika, what else do we have,

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:12.750
whatever else seasoning you would like to add, whisk that all together..

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.400
So now it is time to dredge your sliced green tomatoes.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:21.220
Your going to take you tomato, submerge it 
 is your flax seed-egg wash water mixture,

00:03:21.224 --> 00:03:25.660
don't leave me un-vegan comments about saying egg wash 
 mixture. It is flax seed and water.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.090
It is just like an egg wash mixture. Submerge it in that. Then you 
 are going to take your sliced tomato and put it in 

00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:32.700
your flour and your seasonings.

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:40.240
Make sure it is all coated, but make sure you dust off all the 
 excess, because I had coats of flour that I did not need

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:47.350
once they baked up. So dust off the excess and place it 
 onto the baking sheet that you have prepared with cooking spray.

00:03:47.347 --> 00:03:51.430
So our next step of course, after you have them all 
 laid out on the baking sheet is to bake them

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:57.260
at our preheated oven temperature of 425 degrees. Bake 
 them for 15 minutes on the first side

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:04.370
flip them over. Even thought they dont look like they are going crisp 
 up, they will. Flip them over and bake for 15 more minutes

00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:04.370
flip them over. Even thought they dont look like they are going crisp 
 up, they will. Flip them over and bake for 15 more minutes

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:08.730
And once you take them out, go ahead 
 and plate them up and serve immediately.

00:04:08.732 --> 00:04:12.320
The quicker you serve them, the crispier they will be.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.070
And I have made fried green tomatoes plenty of times 
 and that stands for fried in oil or baked,

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:19.950
because they don't last long.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:24.630
These turned out really crispy, I really did like them. If 
 you have never had a fried green tomato before,

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.890
it is kind of sour. That is how I can kind of explain it.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.390
You salt it, and pepper it, and put the seasons on it, 
 but its kind of like a tomato, but its not.

00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:38.740
I think it is a southern acquired taste to just gobble these things up.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:43.840
So you may have to get used to it, or 
 you Northern partyers may not understand whats going on.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:43.840
So you may have to get used to it, or 
 you Northern partyers may not understand whats going on.

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:49.740
But they are delicious, let me tell you. That is it for today. Bye.
