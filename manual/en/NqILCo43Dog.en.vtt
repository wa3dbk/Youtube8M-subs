Hi! I'm Karen with Expert Village. Now we
are going to glaze our Death by Chocolate

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.580
Cake with our ganache glaze. I've warmed by
ganache glaze up again so that it will be

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.680
more pourable. We are going to pour this over
so that it totally coats the cake. Using a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.369
rubber spatula, pour all the glaze into the
middle and work your way to the edges. It

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:44.600
will take all of it. With a metal spatula,
I am just going to coax glaze over to the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:54.100
edge. You can turn the cake while you are
doing it just so that it will drip down the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:07.260
edges.
See it is starting to drip down the edges.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:24.060
Okay, you just coax it over there to the edge
and just lightly and then take the spatula

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.120
and spread it. If you need a little more just
push a little bit more over the edge and gently

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:53.960
spread it around. Get a beautiful glossy coating
with the ganache glaze. Coax it around the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:03.920
edge
and spread it gently. Don't worry if it gets

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:19.530
a little messy around the edge. We will wipe
that later. Now turn the cake, push it over

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.670
the edge and spread it. You don't want to
push too much over the edge because you will

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.330
end up with a big puddle on the plate so we
will just very gently coaxing it over the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:46.700
edge and spreading as it comes down. This
is how we will coat this whole cake; almost

00:02:46.700 --> 00:03:03.620
just around the edge. Okay just check all
the way around to see if we have covered everything

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:15.430
and oops, I'll clean that up later and just
smooth around the edge and give it one more

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.480
smoothing on the top. Before we put our chocolate
roses, chocolate leaves on there, we are going

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.520
to let this cool completely.
