00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.737
(SIGHING)

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:14.046
You know, l had a neighbor,
growing up, with a name
right out of Dickens.

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.345
Mr. Charles Hazard.

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:21.885
And Mr. Hazard didn't like
the neighborhood dogs

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.053
messing up his flower beds.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.455
One day, l heard
a bunch of yelling
from across the street,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.956
so l ran on over
to Mr. Hazard's,

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.796
and there were about
15 grown-ups standing
around my dog, Teddy,

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.766
who was writhing
on the ground
in obvious agony.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:38.166
Blood was pouring
out of his mouth.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.570
Mr. Hazard had
ground up a glass bottle

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:43.907
and put it in a bowl
of dog food and
fed it to him.

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:47.209
What did you do?

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:50.848
Well, l got some gasoline
and burned down
his flower beds.

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.349
But that wasn't
satisfying enough.

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:58.122
And then l remembered,
Mr. Hazard was
an elected official.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.523
He was the head
of the town council.

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:03.493
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:08.000
So come Election Day,
l drove over to
the black section of town.

00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:11.369
Now, these people
hadn't voted in any of
these elections, so...

00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:14.337
l was only 13,
but l had a farmer's license

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.373
and l filled up my car
with black voters

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:18.707
and drove them
to the polling place

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:20.109
and then waited,
then drove them on home.

00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:23.114
But before they got out
of the car to vote

00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:28.321
l said, ''l don't
mean to influence you,
but l think you should know

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:31.990
''Mr. Charles Hazard
has intentionally
killed my dog.''

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.094
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:39.763
l drove 96 of them
to the polls.

00:01:40.862 --> 00:01:42.966
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

00:01:46.535 --> 00:01:50.041
And that's the day
l fell in love
with America.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:55.378
What time do we land?

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.049
7:30 a.m. in D.C.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:01.352
l want the CIA
in my office
at 10:OO.

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.688
Assistant Deputy Director
or higher.

00:02:05.087 --> 00:02:07.758
Tell them that if
l don't see someone
at 10:OO,

00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:12.766
l'm gonna start docking
their allowance at a rate
of $1 million a minute.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.230
Yes, sir.

00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:15.999
And get me another
one of them, would you?

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:17.066
(CLEARING THROAT)

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:19.302
Yes, sir.
