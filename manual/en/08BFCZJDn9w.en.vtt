00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.770
LESTER HOLT reporting: Whether

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.770
it's a running back breaking

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.830 position:98%
through the secondary or a wide receiver on a foot race for the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.930 position:98%
end zone, most offensive players in the NFL have a single goal in

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.470 position:86%
mind--to get down-field as far and as fast as possible.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.900 position:92%
ANTONIO FREEMAN (Former NFL Wide Receiver): We're thinking,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.870 position:97%
wow, I've got to get from A to B within a certain time frame and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.970 position:63%
I can't let this guy throw me off track.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.000 position:92%
So it's kind of like a chess match at that point in time is

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.670 position:56%
to battle to see who's the toughest.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.600 position:89%
HOLT: Defenders on the other hand have a different goal--

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.030 position:97%
to stand in the way of the offensive player and stop his forward progress.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.270 position:94%
HARDY NICKERSON (Former NFL Linebacker): When you are coming

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.500 position:80%
in and making the tackle, you've got to come in and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770 position:69%
you got to stop him right there on the dime.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.000 position:97%
HOLT: Who wins this epic battle between the ball carrier and the defender?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900 position:86%
Newton's First Law of Motion helps supply some answers.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.230 position:88%
TONY SCHMITZ (University of Florida): Newton's First Law

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.370 position:92%
says that if an object is at rest it requires an unbalanced

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.070 position:70%
force to make it not be at rest or similarly,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.800 position:91%
if an object is in motion, it tends to stay in motion in a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.270 position:67%
straight line at a constant velocity unless

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.030
an unbalanced force acts on it.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.930 position:88%
HOLT: In football, we see unbalanced forces whenever one

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.430 position:89%
player exerts a force on another and causes him to change

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.170
his direction and/or speed.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.200 position:84%
JIM GATES (University of Maryland): So, imagine that a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.900 position:80%
quarterback is just taking the snap from the center

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.300 position:83%
and a lineman gets free from the opposing team and is

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.470 position:78%
coming from the other side and--when they collide,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.430 position:91%
you can see an unbalanced force acting on the quarterback,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.100 position:97%
driving him across the field in the direction of the charging lineman.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.430 position:59%
That's about as unbalanced as it gets.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.330 position:86%
HOLT: In physics, a player's natural resistance to that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.230 position:73%
unbalanced force is something called "inertia."

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.600 position:95%
SCHMITZ: On the football field you can think about inertia as

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.930 position:91%
being a running back who is already in motion doesn't want

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.830 position:73%
to change the fact that it's already in motion.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.200 position:84%
So, it's going to take some external unbalanced force,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.430 position:80%
i.e., a defensive player to stop that running back.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.500 position:83%
HOLT: Consider former New Orleans Saints running back

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.830 position:98%
Deuce McCallister, who at 6-foot-1, 231-pounds used his inertia

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.100 position:63%
when running to make him hard to tackle.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.570 position:94%
SCHMITZ: The size of the player is important to a concept of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.170 position:73%
inertia because higher mass means more inertia.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.270 position:86%
HOLT: But a player's mass is different from his weight.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.200 position:88%
Mass is a measure of how much matter an object has while

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.170 position:86%
weight is a measure of how strongly an object's mass is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.530
attracted by gravity.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.400 position:95%
SCHMITZ: So, for example, a body on earth would have the same

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
mass as that body on the moon.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.330 position:97%
but it would weigh less on the moon because gravity is less on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.830
the moon than it is on earth.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.630 position:80%
HOLT: NFL players with more mass have more inertia,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.330 position:59%
and are harder to move off their path.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.300 position:73%
This concept even works on a quarterback sneak,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.200 position:86%
when a quarterback uses the combined mass of his entire

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.770 position:58%
offensive line to gain a yard or two.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.170 position:86%
JOEY HARRINGTON (Former NFL Quarterback): If you got an

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.430 position:83%
offensive line that can overpower the defensive line,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.230 position:73%
that's just get on their hip and you just fall,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.470 position:63%
I mean, you just ride that wave forward.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.530 position:86%
HOLT: In the NFL, whenever players go head to head it's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.530 position:91%
Newton's First Law of Motion that helps determine who will

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.400
win the battle of the gridiron.
