00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.760
As my daughter grows up, I guess the fear
is more about her getting into the wrong crowd,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.549
or staying on a street corner and creating
a nuisance.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.559
Well, people say that, don't they, getting
in with the wrong crowd, but they have minds

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.339
of their own, ain't they?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.900
A huge part of being a teenager is seeking

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.910
approval from your peers. That peer approval
becomes more important than what parents think

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.840
and that's why young people will take risks
in order to be part of the peer group.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.280
Well, within in my group of friends, people
were involved in different crimes, such as

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.870
robbing, selling class C drugs, class B drugs,
class A drugs.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.540
I think signs of knowing that my son was hanging
around with the wrong type of people would

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.160
be bad moods, wanting to go out a lot when
he was quite a family-type of child. And also,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.460
not really knowing these friends.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.880
It's important with teenagers, as they're

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.299
getting into the teenage years, to keep the
communication lines open with your child,

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.190
because if you don't do that and they're off
doing things that worry you, you really won't

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.880
be able to find out anything about it. So
make it clear to your child, you're still

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.190
there for them, you still want to hear about
things that are going on in their lives. You're

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.880
still interested. If you just take the view
that oh, you don't want to have this friend

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.420
and you don't want to hear about it, then
it will close communication down.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.620
She never really knew what I was getting up
to cause I kind of hid it away from her, and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.300
I think the only time she really realised
was when I first got arrested. And then at

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490
that point, I think it was a bit too late.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.990
You sometimes need professional help with

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.819
that, you know, phone a helpline or talk to
somebody who's been through these things.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.930
You know, somewhere that's got counsellors
who are used to hearing about these very serious

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.570
types of issues.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.079
He realised how crucial it was for him to

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.989
come away from these young guys that he was
hanging around with because he realised for

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.340
himself that they weren't really friends,
they were enemies.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.439
To be quite honest, all my friends that I
look back to, everyone regrets what we went

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.689
through and what we've done and if we could
turn back the clock, we wouldn't have gone

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.819
through that and done that. We would have
done things differently, but I mean you don't

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.209
really realise that among those ages. You're
very vulnerable. You think you're doing the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.989
cool thing, but really it's not.
