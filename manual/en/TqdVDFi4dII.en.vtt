00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.390
Alright, today on this 2011 Kia Soul, we're
going to install part number 11110 from Curt.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.860
This is what the hitch looks like once installed
on the vehicle.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.160
Next, we'll give you some measurements that
will help you out in selecting some accessories.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.380
From the top of the receiver opening down
to the ground is going to be 10-3/8 inches.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.760
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
outside edge of the bumper is going to be

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
6 inches.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.560
Now, we'll go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.820
First off, we're going to lower the exhaust
and get out of the way for some more working

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.820
room.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.560
We're going to spray the exhaust hanger with
some lubricant and then remove it so we can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.030
spit it out of our way.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.140
That just gives a little more flexibility.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
That could be more if there's one behind the
exhaust if you want to remove that as well.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.570
Alright, our next step is to go ahead and
remove the inside fender well and if there's

00:00:46.570 --> 00:01:47.389
a mud flap, remove that on the outside edge

00:01:47.389 --> 00:02:11.000
of the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.530
fender well.
