00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.520
Hello humans of the world

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.929
My name is Arthur

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:05.000
and this is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.320
The Wonderful world of QA

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.320
QA is believed to been is existence as early
as 3000 B.C.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.230
with the antcient game of Pok-a-Tok

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.910
a brutal game that never quite got all of
it's bugs removed

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.590
because, as was tradition

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.449
testers were sacfcaficed to the gods

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.070
as well as the captain of the loosing team

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.690
If we cross the Atlantic,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.690
we find QA testers slugging it out in Gladitor
battles in the year 264 B.C.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.160
Testers de-bugged everything from fighting
techniques

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.160
to unique ways of dying

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.720
Several centuries later, in the year 1066

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.790
In medieval Europe

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.220
testers were finding ways to crash the game
of jousting

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.220
Often times, these crashes led to unorganized,
bloody battles

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.020
[Music]

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.979
Unfortunately, a few centuries later

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.049
the world's so-called greatest games

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.720
became quite dull

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.240
Testers became unmotivated due to the lack
of excitement

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.149
and propmtly died

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.549
Poor little Ralph Baer was unfortunate enough

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.009
to grow up in a world full of such mediocrity

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.040
As he aged

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.960
he realized that the lack of excitement in
games

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.860
was directly related to the rise of morals

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.640
With his invention, Pong

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.869
he planted the seed of a virtual world

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.930
full of terribly gruesome possibilities

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.230
Before the world and it's morals could catch
on to Ralph's master plan

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.220
friends were killing eachother in the comfort
of their own home.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.950
As video games advanced

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.000
Quality Assurance testers started to rise
from the dead

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.390
Every kid, and 30 year old living is his/hers
mother's basement

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.470
wanted a job to do what they loved most

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.900
Playing video games

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.090
The shocking reality is that these testers

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.700
Do not get to play games at all

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.200
They get to test

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.900
one game

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.940
One should never confuse the two

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.819
Your average tester will live at work, in
a cramped space

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.050
fueled by all of the free caffine they can
consume

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.069
Testers stare at the same game all day every
day until their eyes bleed out

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.830
When a tester has lost his/her vision completely

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.349
They are quickly replaced

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.920
by an eager gamer, lining outside the door

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.920
waiting to ruin his/her life for the next
several months

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.319
These hard working testers are also generally
hated

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.870
by everyone

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.190
Take a look at little Timmy here:

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.220
Timmy's boss hates him because he thinks Tim
doesn't work hard enough

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.409
The programmers at Timmy's work hate him because
he works too hard

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.700
Gamers, although never meeting Timmy

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.700
will hate hm as well, because they will blame
all of QA

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.159
for not finding the bugs that the programmers
chose not to fix

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.830
and Timmy and his fellow testers all hate
eachother

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.349
because none of them have taken a shower for
weeks

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.739
Quality Assurance has been a part of some
of the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.909
greatest games in the world's history

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.209
Tester have slaved away

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.810
to please you, the gamer, for months

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.120
Leaving humanity behind

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.310
these testers emerge from the scum of the
game industry

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.060
beaten, torn, hated, and eventually

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.310
fired
