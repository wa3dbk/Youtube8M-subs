00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.840
this will be a variation to use with the embroidery
chain stitch

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.839
i have a contrasting color

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.590
you can do this with the same color

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.599
or a different color its up to you

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.570
just insert your tapestry needle

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.180
and then pulling it up leaving a little length
on the back side

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.410
and now just

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.039
weave your needle

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.699
through the stitches like this

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:47.100
and i am going below both loops

00:00:47.100 --> 00:02:18.760
you can see it is creating this little rope
effect

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.450
and thats all there is to it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.760
insert your needle to the back side

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.010
and make a knot

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.950
secure your yarn

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950
and cut it off

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.760
and you have a whole different look

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.409
with your embroidery chain stitch
