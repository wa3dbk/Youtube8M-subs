during christmas day that they are not

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.800
offering their employees any overtime
for working on christmas day no but

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.759
that's it

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.549
bill o'reilly

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.820
santa claus

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.369

all week trying with their family and
change the salon only almost

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.850
i'm sure that bill reilly is attacking
mcdonald's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.540
as we speak

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.690
could be that sister large corporation
bill o'reilly is never going to match s

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.009
not only in a word

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:48.830
not giving them over time

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.960
i mean that's disrupting in in jesus
face

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.810
welfare and justification is

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.960
has to work on that day their
volunteering to work on that with day

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.489
which by the way i'm not

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.879
high-paid f_ lee i don't believe that
okay

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:04.809
because its

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.960
christmas day who was killed volunteered
to work on christmas day

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.250
and you're not getting update me
incident

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.140
don't really have a christmas present
basically in this country at this point

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.630
the secular holiday right like i know
the origins are not secular right now no

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.170
volunteer my absolute this patent two
things of that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.480
or one this how they always do it like

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.470
well i mean when there was no laws no
regulations file or the wages somebody

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.520
so volunteered to work

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.490
i think that worked well dats i didn't
make that work twelve hours they

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.960
volunteer to work twelve hours a day
they will barter work sixteen hours a

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.700
day that eight-year-old volunteer to
work in the months what do i didn't make

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.450
it one in drag him out of the house that
out

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.130
right and so that's why you need laws
and regulations to make sure that they

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.340
don't get away with that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.520
and on the voluntary sub is also senator
robert

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.549
those uh... cm minors

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.340
bennett co-workers s_n_p_ hein mit
romney is a photo op

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.040
because

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.750
there to see you know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.200
doing the mit romney and wonder when so
you know more taxes and less regulation

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.480
so that he would not be safety
regulations for those same exact workers

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.670
and then when they were blessed on it
that they made the guys leave work and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.689
cut their pay you pay them

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.309
for for a big deal too

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.939
that diet this year for one on the radio
set

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:25.959
at

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.919
we didn't make them go it was just
mandatory

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.889
node that would be in the definition of
making them before

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:35.819
well

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.749
against this version is

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.659
ided gregg under their head i just
thought about fire yet expected so i'm

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.089
not buying it these employees are being
forced to work and it's not get overtime

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.709
is the most rediculously and how we can
possibly be

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.549
any the amount of profit

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.329
that mcdonald's makes endl

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.959
little tiny tiny amount they pay their
employees

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.189
there's one sorry we didn't get to
earlier this week there was a spark plug

00:02:59.189 --> 00:02:59.759
old man

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.219
and profiled avidly was on the front
page of huffington post

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:08.309
he had been working for at mcdonald's
ford thirty years okay

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.609
and you are now how much is getting paid
after thirty years a little over eight

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.849
dollars

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.509
eight dollars okay

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:19.349
discussion about the dot all dot the
private company let them make their now

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.860
that you need to regulate that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.939
it's rediculous that they're making that
kind of profit and their pain

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.239
in their employees are loyal employees
so little u_s_ pressure

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.289
how greeted you possibly be

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:33.079
in answer to that purple rich in its

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.159
because they are

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.680
in the legal responsibility a fiduciary
responsibility the squeeze every single

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.189
red penny

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.609
for their shareholders

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.429
so we should be surprised by that it
shouldn't be like all-cause it turns out

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.969
that way they can repay all i got it
turns out i won't chrysler workers and

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.259
saying what's up there you know what
that means that when it comes out with

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.159
my personal concern to

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.219
dizzying legal responsibility make every
single penny they can

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.079
personal friend of mine he spent
twenty-five years word for mcdonalds

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.639
he has a bad luck is likely to go to
college he lost a leg to cancer and he

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.759
worked there for twenty-five years

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.779
and first week that the air

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.799
they gave him a special bonus

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.470
twenty five dollars

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.979
now our own we do not conflicting

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.759
