Panasonic introduces the Lumix GF 3

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The newest version of the Lumix-series 
is their smallest and  lightest 4/3 camera

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The GF3 supposedly combines user-friendliness
and a superb image quality

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You control the device with the scrollwheel

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And with the touchscreen

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is especially convenient when you record video

As you can see right now. Huppakkee!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The GF3 has numerous creative filters

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Like 'expressive' for more contrast in colors

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And 'miniature' for a lovely 'Madurodam' effect

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The GF3 has a flash

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Its specifications are comparable 
to those of the big boys

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A 12,2 megapixel sensor

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Several high speed auto-focus options
and settings make for a complete package

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
High quality in a compact device, 
that's the idea

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That's why there's no viewfinder
but the clear LCD does the trick

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Even in bright sunlight

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The Panasonic GF3 is available 
in the second half of 2011

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Exact information on the price 
is not available yet
