Voiceover: In this video
we're going to explore

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.100
positive and negative feedback in terms of
physiology.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.540
So, many molecular and physiological

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.870
processes are controlled by feedback
mechanisms.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.060
There are two types of feedback mechanisms
that we're gonna talk about.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.540
The first is positive feedback.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.180
It's when the rate of process works to
increase a product.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.150
We can think of this as a domino or chain
effect.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.660
So, the process will work to increase one
product, which will then

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.710
go ahead and stimulate the production of
another product, and so on.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.880
The opposite is negative feedback or when
the rate of process

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.510
has to be controlled to prevent the
accumulation of a product.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.210
Negative feedback works to decrease the
product.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.430
So that's important because if we have an
accumulation of a product in our blood

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.910
for, example, we can't have it build up

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.350
to excessive levels, that could be really
toxic.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.530
That's why negative feedback mechanisms
are put

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.080
into place to control the process that's

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.120
increasing the product, so it will work

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.780
to inhibit that process by decreasing the
product.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.910
Let's look at a physiological process that
uses positive and negative

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.970
feedback, and more specifically, occurs in
females.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.950
So, the first structure here in blue is
called the hypothalamus.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.870
The hypothalamus, as you may have heard in
your

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.380
studies, is the master control gland of
our endocrine system.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.390
Now, it signals, or basically talks to,
this next gland here.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.070
The pituitary gland.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.260
The pituitary gland is further broken down
into two lobes.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.260
The back lobe is the posterior and the
front lobe

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.840
that we are going to focus on is the
anterior pituitary.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.905
Now, moving down, we have another organ
called the ovary.

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:19.115
So, females have two ovaries that are
located way further down in the body.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:23.060
While the hypothalamus and the pituitary
gland are up in the brain.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.970
Now, I've also color coded these four
hormones that we're going to talk about.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.850
So that way we can keep them straight as
we go through the process.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.160
The first is estrogen.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.810
The second is GnRH, or gonadotropin
releasing hormone.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.970
The third is LH, or luteinizing hormone.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.090
And the last is progesterone.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.680
So let's start.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.180
During the menstrual cycle, and more
specifically, before ovulation,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.210
small amounts of estrogen are secreted
from the ovaries.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.270
This small amount of estrogen is just
enough

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.080
to trigger the release of two other
hormones.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.300
So, it stimulates the release of GnRH from
the hypothalamus, and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.050
also works to stimulate the release of LH
from the anterior pituitary.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
So, this is an example of positive
feedback, because the process that

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.500
stimulated estrogen also stimulated the
release of GnRH and LH.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.830
So, GnRH can also, then, work on the
anterior pituitary to

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.870
stimulate the production and release of
even more LH into the blood.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.830
So, here's positive feedback again.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.500
The hypothalamus communicates it's message
out to the anterior pituitary.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.208
Now LH can also go ahead and stimulate the
release of even more estrogen.

00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:00.000
Again, positive feedback.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.890
So, here we have a cycle.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.680
Estrogen causes the release of GnRH, which
causes the release of LH,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.670
which causes the release of even more
estrogen, and the cycle continues.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.480
So, you can see that chain effect we were
talking about.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.580
So, estrogen is produced, let's write that
over here.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.330
Which triggers GnRH and that works to
trigger LH.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.724
Now GnRH and LH are going to be

00:04:28.724 --> 00:04:35.100
accumulating in our blood due to positive
feedback.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.910
So, when high amounts of LH are produced
in the blood, another

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.330
hormone will wake up, so to say, and that
hormone is called progesterone.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.870
So, progesterone is triggered when it
senses that these LH levels are too high.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.480
And it's secreted from the corpus luteum
after ovulation.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.270
So after ovulation, the progesterone will
trigger the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.560
GnRH production in the hypothalamus to
turn off.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.470
And then that will also trigger LH
production

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.940
in the anterior pituitary to also turn
off.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.850
So, can you guess what this is called?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.360
If you said negative feedback, then you
are correct.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.590
Since the levels of product are becoming
too high in

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.260
the blood, something needs to cause an
inhibition of those products.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.080
That way they don't accumulate in the
blood.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.720
That's why progesterone comes in and turns
off

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.770
that positive feedback process and
decreases the products.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.690
That's where we have an example of

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.980
negative feedback in this specific
physiological mechanism.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.960
Going back, we can see that the LH caused
the production

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.110
or of progesterone or the secretion of
progesterone in the first place.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.310
And then progesterone is going to go back
and work on inhibiting

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.810
further GnRH and LH release, as you can
see in this little cycle.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.750
So, that's how we maintain homeostasis or
balance in our body,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.610
which is really important for maintaining
molecular and physiological processes.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.020
That way, nothing in our body becomes too
out of balance, too high, or too low.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.010
That's the beauty of physiological
feedback.
