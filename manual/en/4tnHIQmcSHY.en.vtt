00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:05.726
Robin: Sir, can we have
a moment please?

00:00:05.794 --> 00:00:06.727
He's incredibly late.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.896
Hop in. We'll talk
in the car.

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:11.732
Shepherd:
What is it, lewis?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.101
Lewis: We have
a small problem.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:15.403
Robin: Was small. Now it's
a medium-sized nightmare.

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:17.405
Lewis: To her, a problem.
I see an opportunity.

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:18.889
It could have been
if we'd caught it.

00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:19.907
We caught it.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:21.676
At 5:45. 5:45 doesn't
do me any good, lewis.

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:23.177
5:45, network news
is in makeup.

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:24.679
You have 12 people
working for you. Why--

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.598
Guys, do I have to
be here for this meeting?

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
Sorry, sir.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:30.201
It's on
the evening news.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.668
It's buried.
The third story.

00:00:31.736 --> 00:00:33.004
It's got a bullet.

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.671
Sydney was
at a protest rally.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440
They burned a flag.

00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:37.375
Today?

00:00:37.442 --> 00:00:39.176
Lewis:
About 13 years ago.

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:41.545
In front of the department
of commerce. Anti-apartheid.

00:00:42.847 --> 00:00:44.782
Let me get me see
if I got this.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.767
The third story
on the news tonight

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.769
Was that someone
I didn't know 13 years ago

00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:50.237
When I wasn't president

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:51.789
Participated
in a demonstration

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.291
Where no laws
are being broken

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:54.625
In protest of something

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:56.294
That so many people
were against

00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.296
It doesn't exist anymore?

00:00:58.363 --> 00:00:59.797
Just out of curiosity,

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:01.632
What was the fourth story?

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.217
Right. See, I think
it's important,

00:01:03.284 --> 00:01:04.551
When we deal with it.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.053
Shepherd:
Don't deal with it.

00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:07.137
Excuse me?

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.639
They're trying
to get us to swing

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:10.107
At a pitch in the dirt.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.542
Nobody wins these fights.
It'll go away.

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:16.814
Lewis: I'm not sure that's
the wisest course of action.

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:17.982
Shepherd: Aw, hell.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.449
Robin: See, it's already
distracting you.

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:20.735
Why don't you let us
put together a--

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:22.103
Shepherd:
No, you reminded me

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.004
I'm supposed to have dinner
with sydney tonight.

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:26.490
Oh, it's terrific.

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:27.825
Beth, I love it.

00:01:27.893 --> 00:01:29.827
I can't believe
I'm loaning you clothes.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.996
I thought you owned every
piece of clothing there was.

00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:33.497
Well, work clothes.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:35.333
I always have dinner at
the white house in a suit.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.833
I thought a dress
would be nice.

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:38.335
Go ahead. Try it on.

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:39.503
[telephone ringing]

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:41.005
I brought earrings, too.

00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:42.006
[ring]

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:43.007
Hello.

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:44.341
Shepherd: Hi.
What are you doing?

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.377
Uh, just trying on
dresses.

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:49.013
Listen, I feel terrible,
but I have to cancel our date.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.347
Sydney: Another woman?

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:51.782
Ha. No. I gotta go
to st. Louis

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:54.318
To avert a massive
airline strike.

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:56.754
Boy, if I had a nickel for
every time I heard that one.

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:57.755
Shepherd: Thanks
for understanding.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:01:59.257
I'll call you later
this evening.

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:00.774
Ok. Bye.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:04.345
Boy, I hate doing that.
She was trying on dresses.

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.180
I tell any girl
I'm going out with

00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:07.782
To assume all plans
are soft

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.766
Until she receives
confirmation from me

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.268
30 minutes
beforehand.

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:12.769
And they find
this romantic?

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:14.939
Well, I say it with
a great deal of charm.

00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.025
Look! Look, there it is!
Carmen's house of flowers.

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:19.359
Hey, coop, we gotta stop.

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.112
I gotta get her
some flowers.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.480
Here?
Now?

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:24.481
Well, that's what men do
when they break a date.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.566
That's not
what men do.

00:02:25.717 --> 00:02:26.884
I know no men
who do that.

00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:29.186
Hey, coop, I'm gonna hop out
at the flower shop.

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:30.837
You gonna hop out, sir?

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:32.790
No, he's not hopping.
No hopping, sir.

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:34.891
Stay in the car.
I'll get the flowers.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.560
Shepherd: Then it's
not gonna be personal.

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:38.396
At least let the agents
do a security sweep.

00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:39.713
We don't know
who's in there.

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:41.865
You think there's a florist
planning an assassination

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.402
On the off chance
I might be stopping by?

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.137
It's possible.

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:47.571
Florist: No.

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.906
No.

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:50.408
You're not
hearing me.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:51.908
Listen to what
I'm saying.

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:54.245
It was at
the basketball game.

00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:55.579
Excuse me.

00:02:55.647 --> 00:02:56.914
No, girl. At the game.

00:02:56.982 --> 00:02:58.916
I'm telling you,
kiki wasn't even there.

00:02:58.984 --> 00:03:00.117
Excuse me.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:01.285
Ohh. Hold on.

00:03:01.353 --> 00:03:03.920
I will &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;
right with you.
