00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.340
-[Curtis Smith] Welcome back to Southwest Yard and
Garden. I'm Curtis Smith. Today Willie

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.700
West, from Sun Vista Landscapes, is going
to show us how to remove, professionally,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.439
a large tree. The homeowners had plans
to bring this tree down themselves. And

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
Willie, they were planning to do a single
cut and just drop the whole tree.

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.400
-[Willie West] Yeah the homeowner claimed that's what
she was going to try and do. The problem

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.150
with that Curtis, is this tree is about
30% dead. And the majority of the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.480
Deadwood is over on the street side.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.039
-[Curtis] So that's light.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.960
-[Willie] That's very light wood over there.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.060
-[Curtis] The weight of the tree is over here.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400
-[Willie] Right.
The chance--there is a reasonable chance

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.540
that she started cutting, dropped a tree
that way, the tree would actually pivot

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.390
on her, twist and fall right over on the
house. And that's an insurance claim.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.700
-[Curtis] Willie this tree has been chopped in the past. That's caused some of these problems now hasn't it?

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.300
-[Willie] Yeah, probably
about 10-15 years ago. If you look at the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.090
other trees in the neighborhood, you can
see that a lot of these have been topped.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.400
Somebody came through, told the
homeowners they need to do it, and they

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.160
all did it. What's happening, is when you
do come in and top a tree, the new branches

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.510
that grow out have a very weak
attachment. So they can actually--their

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.040
not as strong as the original tree would
be. So you have a potential for failure there.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.400
-[Curtis] So you're going to be roping
yourself into the tree. yeah we'll be

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.980
-[Willie] Yeah. We'll be roped in. We'll be tied in. Most of the tree branches--

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.120
when we take them out, we will do
control drops on them. So that, we can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.270
control which direction they're going to
fall, and at what weight they are going to fall.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.530
-[Curtis] Okay and the other factor is something
like this. It's important that, especially

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.080
because of the hazards, that the person
who's doing this be insured. yeah anytime

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.620
-[Willie] Yeah, anytime a homeowner is interested in having somebody remove a tree or work on a tree,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.060
they need to make sure that the person
is properly insured. That means liability

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.660
insurance and workman's comp insurance.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.480
-[Curtis] Willie, one of the problems you've got here,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.810
is you've got vehicles parked here
on the street. And they're within range

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.580
of these branches, even though they're
parked at least one house away.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.280
-[Willie] Yeah, that's one of the things people
underestimate--when they see

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.560
these branches they think they can drop
them fairly easily out into the street.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.680
The problem is, a couple of these branches could easily reach almost two houses down,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.470
if you took them
down in hole. And if your neighbors got a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.320
nice new car parked out there, they're
not going to be real happy with you. okay

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.520
-[Curtis] Okay, well these have to be moved then. Or at least what can be moved, needs to be moved.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.340
A lot of people don't realize how
tall these trees really are. Here, we've

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.610
got Adam up there taking a picture down
to show what it look like once you're up there.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.480
That's a long ways down.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.880
-[Willie] Yeah,
he's up about twenty to twenty-five feet right now.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.540
As you can see, he's not even up near the
top of the tree. But yeah that's one of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.520
the things people don't realize from the ground. Once you get up there, it's a long fall back down.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.760
-[Curtis] These ropes are important.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.800
-[Willie] These ropes are very important. It's what our lives depend on.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:03:57.280
[motor buzz]

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.380
[falling tree branch]

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.130
-[Curtis] What we see here is not pruning. What
we're seeing is removal of branches, so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.910
the tree can be cut down without
damaging things around it. This is not

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.200
pruning. This might be called topping but
this is not what we recommend doing to prune a tree.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.540

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.720

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.680
[falling tree branch]

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.760
-[Curtis] I'm standing here where a cottonwood
tree stood not long ago. And thanks to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.000
Willie and his crew, we've seen how
professionals can safely remove an old tree.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.860
Without damage to structures that
are nearby. Without damage to cars on the street.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.510
Without injury to themselves. Our
purpose was not to teach you how to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.650
remove a tree, but give you information. So that you'll know what's involved in

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.850
tree removal. So that you can hire
professionals who can do the job safely.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.960
Be sure they're insured. Otherwise your
insurance is going to cover these things.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.950
We also want to show you why this tree
was removed. This is a tree which, at the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.630
base, was still structurally sound.
However, starting at about 10 feet up, it

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.420
was rotten and hollowed out. It was full
of carpenter ants, and that rot ran up

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.920
beyond the 20 foot level. So the top of
the tree potentially could have blown

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.090
out in a storm and caused damage. This is
one of the reasons to remove a tree.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.500
This damage began when the tree was
topped many years ago. We thank Willie

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.570
and his crew for showing us how to do
this safely.
