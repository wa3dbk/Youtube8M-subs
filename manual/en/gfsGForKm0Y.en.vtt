00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:12.039
hello everyo ne Michael here once again
from the daily note 2 youtube channel. Today I

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.129
want to show you an app that is really
too good to be free, but it is.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.519
it's called mobizen

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.869
and it has really powerful and 
has unique features

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.469
so let's go over how to install this app,
and go over all the cool things this app

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.039
can do

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.759
the easiest way to install this app will be
through the google play store but

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.329
a lot of people have told me that 
they  are told the app is not available for

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.660
download in some countries. so you can
get this by going to this link hosted on

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.860
their website

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.580
thanks to GregPCHandyman for
providing that for us and also thanks to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.460
Mike from Maine for telling me 
about this app

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.460
one thing you need to do is make sure
you enable USB debugging to run this app

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.359
you also need to download 
the mobizen windows application

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.399
and although it may seem like a long
process initially, you only need to do

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.340
this once, and it is very good in walking you 
through the process of connecting for the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.580
first time

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.740
and after that connecting becomes
a cinch and it will let you connect

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.770
through usb or wifi

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.280
so let's connect it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.510
mobizen has a background service that
runs, so when you have the device

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.369
connected over usb

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.370
or your device is connected to 
the same wifi network,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.230
you just have to start the application
on your PC,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.100
and it will automatically connect through mobizen

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.830
you can see that there is a notification
alert

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.500
and now we're connected

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.200
you can see the screen needs to stay on 
while you're accessing it, so I prefer to

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.020
reduce the screen brightness

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.500
here's one cool trick that I didn't know
until just recently

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.280
you can resize the phone

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.510
double-click to toggle between 
the original size and the last size you

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.150
had it at. I currently have my computer
running in 1080p, and you can see it

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.640
will go all the way

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.500
you can even make it go bigger

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.760
you can force it in landscape mode
using the Rotation locker app or it will

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.840
happen automatically when you launch apps
that only runs in landscape mode

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.950
and before you get any ideas about gaming,
I want to let you know that the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.279
frame rate is pretty limited

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:12.189
if I had to guess, maybe around 15 frames 
per second?

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.389
you can see it comes with a nice looking skin
for your galaxy note 2. All the buttons

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:17.350
work

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.159
volume up, volume down

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.090
menu

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.290
the back button

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.309
home button

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.510
but it doesn't give you the power button,
but I can get around it by installing an

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.009
app called screen off and lock

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.019
let's go over some other features

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.639
you can access the note 2 with the
keyboard and mouse, and that includes

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.560
the ability to type as well. and it seems to
do ok with other languages or at least

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.469
with my Korean keyboard

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.159
with mobizen, you can also 
backup your apps.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.279
and while it's backing up, 
you could still use the phone

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.159
now I must stress that this is not going
to backup your data. For example, if you

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.579
backup your Apps

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.940
uninstall the app,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.459
then restore it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.569
you can see it skips through all the ones
that you have installed

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.349
and it will restore the app, 
but not the data

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.349
so for example if it's a game you will
lose all the progress you've made in the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.009
app and you'll have to start 
from the beginning

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.650
if you're looking for a backup solution
of your apps and data

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.249
on a unhacked device, 
there is an app called Helium,

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.109
formally called Carbon

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.099
I'll probably do my next video on that

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.649
onto other features, skin hit this
triangle button below the samsung logo

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.019
and with this icon you can take a screenshot,

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.369
which gets saved to your PC

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:36.529
the next icon you can take a video
of you using the note 2. like the screen

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.309
recorder function that never came on the
galaxy note 2 officially

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:45.259
you can see the mouse and touch location
is captured. You can record with the skin or

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:50.489
without it, in 2 video formats 
all this is configurable in the settings.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.989
but with that said the quality of the
video is pretty limited

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.899
you can write on the note 2's screen
from the PC

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.739
not sure what this may be used for but

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.869
if you're using the Note 2 
to do presentations with,

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.259
sure, why not.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.819
with this icon you can access files

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.669
or you can copy one or more files by dragging

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.229
but I guess it would only make sense to do this 
trhough mobizen and when you're

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.529
connected over wifi

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.829
one last thing, there is a task killer
function right aboout the home screen

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:26.069
that works just a little differently
than holding the home button for your

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:33.069
recent apps

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.960
one last tip. if you do run into some
problems getting the galaxy note 2

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.050
recognized on your pc,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.090
I would recommend you download Samsung
Kies from the samsung website is a

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.879
software much like iTunes but by samsung
for your galaxy devices

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.960
and when you install it, it installs all the
drivers for your device, and that tends

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.810
to fix most connectivity issues through USB

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.759
so anyway that's mobizen

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.399
it's hard to believe it's free and 
how full-featured it is

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.930
seeing how commercial 
their presentation is

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.039
I think they do plan on charging for it 
in the future

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.990
and don't forget to check out more
videos about the galaxy note 2 in my

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.009

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.220
and make sure you subscribe for more
upcoming videos

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.700
once again, thank you for watching
