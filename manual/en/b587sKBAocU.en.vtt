00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
I'm Daphne Gill from the ASU Libraries

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:03.291
I'm here at Hayden Library

00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:05.082
to discover one of our Hidden Treasures

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:06.432
The collection of stage costumes

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:07.854
from designer Irene Corey

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:09.731
Irene literally changed the face

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:11.074
of costume and makeup design

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:13.109
For over 50 years she designed

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.789
Costumes sets and makeup

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.463
from theatre classics to theme park characters

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.514
Her innovative animal characters

00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:21.077
influenced CATS and The Lion King

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:22.645
She also designed the costumes

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:23.976
for the television show Barney

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:26.255
and came up with his trademark purple color

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.883
I'm meeting with Theatre Archivist Kathy Krzys

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:31.373
Kathy collected costume and design materials

00:00:31.373 --> 00:00:34.049
representing Irene's entire theatrical career

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:35.524
Let's go on inside!

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:46.819
Hello Daphne!

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.383
Welcome to the Child Drama Collection

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:49.624
Hey Kathy

00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:52.057
I see that you met my friend Job

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:52.786
(Daphne) I sure did!

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.221
This is a wonderful costume designed by

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.587
Irene Corey

00:00:56.587 --> 00:00:58.281
for the play The Book of Job

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.284
which is a show that toured for

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:02.471
22 years throughout the entire world

00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:05.389
In the 1950's Irene became nationally known

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:06.564
for The Book of Job

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:08.556
featuring 10 amazing costumes

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.556
based on stain glass windows

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.761
and the mosaics of medieval cathedrals

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:14.197
Before designing a costume Irene would do research

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:16.266
in books while visiting historic sites

00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:18.213
or observing animals in zoos

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:20.409
She would adapt characteristics of what she saw

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.902
into her makeup and costume design

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:25.579
Irene was really into process

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:27.987
When you look into her collection

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.443
you're going to find just little ideas

00:01:30.443 --> 00:01:32.096
on the back of menus

00:01:32.096 --> 00:01:34.286
on the back of envelopes

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:37.191
For example she designed  the show The Sly Fox

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:41.233
and each one of the characters was a bird of prey

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.720
She went to the Audobon book

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.189
and drew a sketch of what she saw

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.557
and then incorporated the features of that bird

00:01:49.557 --> 00:01:51.188
into the character

00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:54.598
and then she wrote something really cool notes

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:56.216
You know like living coprse

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.098
That way it gave her an image of colors

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:00.537
that she wanted to use

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.230
And just to cap it off

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.654
she designed a scarf that looked like the carrion

00:02:05.654 --> 00:02:08.906
that it might have flown away from the corpse with

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:12.283
And it's also really hard when you are in the theatre

00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:14.625
to know what the costumes are going to look like

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.085
throughout the whole show

00:02:16.085 --> 00:02:18.254
So she came up with this great idea

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:21.681
of doing little sketches or costume plots

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.399
One of the other innovative things in her book

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.466
in her book that she wrote

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.044
is she talks about her theory and process

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:30.163
and I've  used that word process before

00:02:30.163 --> 00:02:32.022
but I think that's the most important thing

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:34.002
this collection can tell you

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.314
Well when I was looking through the books

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:36.969
The ideas that popped out to me were

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.597
innovation and inspiration, and guidance

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:42.440
The costume doesn't end at the neck

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.728
[Kathy] Exactly

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:47.117
So there's no separation between costume and makeup

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:49.136
If she was here in the room with us right now

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.402
She would pat you on the back

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.116
[Kathy] And I'll do that for her [Daphne] Laughs

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.539
Lot's of time there's a separation in the theatre

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.428
where the costume designer just does the costume

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.902
Someone else comes in to do the makeup and  the hair

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:03.239
and it doesn't match

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.652
With her it always matched

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.793
[Kathy] I have much more to show you [Daphne] Great!

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:11.313
Next, Kathy showed me the unique costume designs

00:03:11.313 --> 00:03:12.992
for Shakespeare's The Tempest

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:16.139
Irene set the play on an island under the sea

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.573
Daphne, this is Propero

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.299
from The Tempest

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.531
We have all of Irene's costumes

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.702
from this play

00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:26.954
[Daphne] Wait you have all of the costumes?

00:03:26.954 --> 00:03:29.225
All of the costumes, headpieces, wigs

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.662
This is the most innovative piece

00:03:31.662 --> 00:03:33.740
from the play The Tempest

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.964
This Prospero head piece was

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:38.595
 one of the first times an off-stage radio controlled light

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:40.379
was used in a costume

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.159
So one of the areas of expertise for Irene Corey

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.717
was the masks

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:46.154
and I see that you have one right here

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:47.400
I do

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.345
And Irene made masks from paper

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:53.005
which very few theatre designers ever did

00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:55.777
By coming here you can see

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.206
exactly how she made it

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:01.095
And we also have slides in the collection

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:04.267
that show the entire process for creating a paper mask

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:04.994
Very cool!

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.460
I want to know what your favorite Irene Corey production is

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.051
Hands down, Alice In Wonderland

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.525
She created them for a mime troupe in Dallas

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.105
to perform outdoors in the summer

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:20.820
so she had to come up with all kinds of innovative ways

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.390
to create all the things that happened to Alice

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.160
The growing, the crying

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160
the Jabberwocky

00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:29.490
After 40 years of stage design

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.310
Irene opened her own design studio

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.701
making angel wings for church pagents

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:34.950
theme park costumes

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.671
and foam characters for commercials

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:43.340
The Irene Corey Collection is part of the Child Drama Collection

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.074
documenting the international history of children's theatre

00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:47.665
back to the 16th century

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.480
Visit the library on the web

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.225
and use our information guides

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.953
for each of the unique collections

00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:56.362
or schedule an appointment with Kathy

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:01.865
Thank you so much for inviting us to the Irene Corey Collection

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:04.886
But I think there's one thing you haven't experienced yet

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:10.714
I think you need to try on one of Irene Corey's designs

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:11.074
Ok!

00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:14.634
You are gorgeous!

00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:15.815
Thanks for coming today

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.566
And thank you for joing us

00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:18.952
