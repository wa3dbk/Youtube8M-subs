00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.194
In this video I will be showing you a basic 'how to apply' liquid latex

00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:09.748
building up layers with one ply tissue, and how to achieve smooth edges for a more realistic finish.

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:13.741
So just quickly, it's very important to let you know before using latex that people can have quite

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:22.011
severe latex allergies. So, if you're someone who regularly uses latex gloves and you know, you're fine, or you've used latex before, you're fine...

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:28.577
But if you're unsure, you can test for allergies, just look up how to patch test if you are unfamiliar with how to do this.

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:32.357
Secondly, make sure that you do not get latex in your hair or in your clothes, because it aint coming out

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:34.407
without ripping out your hair or destroying your clothes.

00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:39.455
I discovered this the hard way that even areas where I could not visibly see hair

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:44.861
there was really fine baby hair and the latex took care of that by removing all of said hair for me.

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:50.397
So it might be worth looking at shaving the area before you apply it, as this will allow for the easiest and least painful removal.

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:55.327
So, first of all make sure that you have cosmetic or skin-safe liquid latex

00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:59.730
craft and mould latex can have double the amount of ammonia, which can make it more unpleasant to use.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.648
I like to pour mine into a plastic cup before I apply it to allow for it to vent for several minutes so the ammonia fumes can dissipate a little bit.

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.257
Now the application depends on what effect

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:12.482
you're trying to get. I will show you basic latex + tissue build up for a wound.

00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:17.071
I always separate my tissue into one ply as it's way easier to work with and usually makes the

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.423
application a bit smoother and the edges a bit smoother.

00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:23.241
I usually like to apply it with my fingers or a disposable sponge.

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:28.876
You can use brushes if you soap them before and afterwards, but if you don't do this the latex will dry in your bristles

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:31.007
and it will basically be too much work to get it out - the brush will be dead (RIP brush).

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:35.339
To ensure a smooth application, you want to make sure that your latex doesn't have any lumps in it

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:40.331
so remove any lumps, make sure that it's quite fresh and that it's not too thick when you're using it.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.496
Apply it as smooth as you can get it onto your arm.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:47.627
I usually find that using my fingers will help smooth it out a bit better.

00:01:48.598 --> 00:01:52.518
and then very gently apply the one ply tissue onto the area.

00:01:52.518 --> 00:01:55.511
Make sure that you smooth it out really gently with your fingers.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:02:00.319
If the tissue gets any ripples or lumps in it, and it isn't applied smoothly, it will show through the latex.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.750
So taking your time with these steps and making sure everything is very smooth as you apply it, will get you a better edge.

00:02:06.437 --> 00:02:10.197
Next, I will very gently pull away the edges of the tissue

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:14.741
and the latex that has soaked through will weaken it so it should just come away quite easily.

00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:19.173
leaving a feathered edge which, again, won't look as harsh as having straight lines

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:22.571
which will give away that you're using tissues and where those edges are.

00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:23.689
 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.048
and then you will want to apply another layer of latex on top

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:27.391
of the tissue, just to kind of seal it.

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:32.716
and, again, make sure you do this quite gently - you can disrupt the tissue and make it like crinkle up

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:38.256
or rip, by doing this, so just do it quite smoothly so you get the latex and the tissue really smooth (I need to google a synonym for 'smooth').

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:43.969
and then I will blow-dry it completely with a hair dryer, you need to dry each layer or it may not completely dry

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.272
So you can chose how many layers you want to build up, depending on what kind of wound

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.398
you're creating and how deep you want it to look.

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:53.163
So for this one I think I did 3 layers.

00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:57.342
and I will build up the tissue so it is thickest in the centre, so each time you apply the tissue

00:02:57.342 --> 00:02:59.194
apply it smaller, to the centre,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:00.857
and that way you've got a more, um

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.418
gradual edge that makes it look more realistic.

00:03:07.273 --> 00:03:09.833
Now, I've colour-matched it to my skin

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:10.822
So I like to start with something a bit more opaque

00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:14.647
before I move on to fine-tuning the colour match, so I would suggest using something like rubber mask grease paint

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:18.202
I'm using the Mehron ones here.

00:03:18.202 --> 00:03:19.976
Or you can use something like pax paint.

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:24.940
just to get a cover over that really bright whiteness that comes through with the tissues.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:32.477
and then after that you can tweak the colour for a more subtle realistic colour match, using something like a skin illustrator fleshtones palette

00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:36.614
I won't show you how to colour match here, because it's to my skin, so it probably won't really help you guys because

00:03:36.614 --> 00:03:43.275
everyone has different coloured skin. But I will do a video later about how to effectively colour match skin.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:45.548
Okay for colour matching just see what you have at home - lots of different things can work.

00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:53.901
including using rubber mask grease paints, grease paints, alcohol activated paints, water-based paints, cream paints,  um just using

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:58.518
normal makeup - like you can try using your foundation, and lipsticks

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:02.571
they usually don't sit as well, but sometimes you can get away with it, so just see what you have and play

00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:07.716
So I just used some tweezers and a pair of little tiny nail scissors just to get in there and cut open where I want the wound to be

00:04:07.716 --> 00:04:13.294
and then using a bit more latex just to stick those flappy bits down so that they stay smooth against my skin.

00:04:14.268 --> 00:04:21.068
And then I'm going to use a little bit more tissue and latex just to build up a bit of texture on the inside

00:04:21.068 --> 00:04:21.568
and blow dry that.

00:04:21.568 --> 00:04:26.726
and I also recommend trying not to apply too much blood, especially if you do manage to get nice edges and a nice colour matched wound,

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:29.108
there's no point in hiding all of that work.

00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:32.980
So for me, on the inside of the wound, I will apply a few different colours instead of straight up red.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.288
I will go for the coral adjuster and the rose adjuster colours from the skin illustrator palette

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:41.895
and then a little bit of the blood-reds and aged blood from the FX palette.

00:04:41.895 --> 00:04:46.133
Then, lastly, I will apply some blood and smear it around and remove some of it with a tissue to give it a

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:50.456
worn in, messy look to it.

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:58.646
You can also create the effect that you have more blood than is actually there by applying it and then wiping a lot of it off

00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:01.082
so it's still quite clean but it's got that suggestion that there was a lot of blood there before.

00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:10.165
So this is the finished look, and you can see with just a few layers of latex it is quite flexible still.

00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:16.952
it should kind of last through movement and, you know, going out to costume parties or Halloween

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:17.747
or whatever you're using it for.

00:05:17.747 --> 00:05:19.722
To remove latex the options are pretty limited.

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:22.769
So what I'll usually do is find a corner and carefully peel it off.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.868
which is why it's best to use it in an area with no hair, or shave it beforehand.

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:31.841
So on the underside of my arm there wasn't a whole lot of hair, so it was relatively painless to pull it off

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:36.378
but if you want to be using it over areas, like around my mouth area, I found that the baby hairs around there would

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:42.637
get caught up and so it might be best just to gently shave that area first, or just kind of endure peeling it off.

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:44.879
I have read that you can use isoproply myristate to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.920
to get it off

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.643
which is basically like an oily makeup remover.

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:53.683
I feel like what this product would do is kind of encase each hair with

00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:57.915
a little bit of oil, and so you could very very slowly and very gently

00:05:57.915 --> 00:06:02.936
try and get the latex off the hair, but this process would take a really long time

00:06:03.904 --> 00:06:06.784
you would still get some pulling on the hair

00:06:06.784 --> 00:06:09.076
and it might not be 100% effective.

00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:13.101
So really, ideally, you've just got to use it on an area that doesn't have hair

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.174
and if it does have hair, just very gently try to pull it off or resort to using isoproply myristate, which you can get

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.475
at cosmetic- oh, makeup stores.

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:23.676
so you can use this technique to build up larger wounds as well, so I've got this video here

00:06:24.388 --> 00:06:29.268
where I built it up on my face, lots of layers and peeled back around my lips

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:32.114
and applied some little teeth I made out of just rolling up toilet paper and latex.

00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:35.726
I've also got a video where I make it on a face cast.

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:39.195
and build it up quite thickly and applied that as well

00:06:39.195 --> 00:06:43.010
but as that is a thicker build in these videos, it does get quite stiff and it

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.564
does make it hard to move your face which makes it hard to talk and hard to drink and hard to eat

00:06:48.564 --> 00:06:49.469
so keep that in mind when using latex.

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:56.471
So in my other video I will show you a way that I'd be more likely to use latex, I probably wouldn't use it for wounds as much

00:06:56.471 --> 00:06:58.508
myself any more these days. I'd probably use nose and scar wax or sculpt gel.

00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:03.781
But, I would use it for really thin peeling skin for like blisters that had popped

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:05.163
and burns, it is really nice for that.

00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:09.608
and so next I will show you a video on how to do a water scald on your hand using latex.

00:07:11.544 --> 00:07:18.544
and you can check that out here. If you're not already subscribed, please subscribe for updates on when I release new videos.

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:19.387
And I will chat to you guys soon. bye.
