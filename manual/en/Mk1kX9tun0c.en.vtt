00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.740
My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village and I am making tomato soup. All right,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.970
now that our oil has gotten nice and hot and
you can tell when it gets hot because the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.000
oil will do a little shimmer on top. I’m
not sure that you can see or not on the tape

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.470
but that is actually what is going on right
now. So as I said earlier we are going to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.171
throw the carrots in first being careful not
to splash yourself so I am just going to put

00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:37.160
it in nice and level like that, give it a
little shake. All right, then you get that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.200
little sizzle there and while this goes I
am going to get the next ingredient lined

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.890
up. This is going to be our celery, which
I am going to let this go for another twenty

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.329
seconds or so and then we are going to add
our celery. And also the other advantage to

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.059
adding our ingredients one at a time, is that
if you add a bunch of cold ingredients to

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.579
hot oil all at once, you take like all of
the heat out of the pan and you are basically

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.500
like starting over and that just ruins the
whole effect because if you were to just basically

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.010
start everything from a cold pan you are not
going to get that same flavor. You also want

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.659
to make sure that with the olive oil that
you are on top of it because olive oil has

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.720
a really low smoking point and will start
to burn pretty easily which we do not want.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:43.590
All right, and while this is going I am going
to put a little salt and pepper in there,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.030
I believe in seasoning as you go not just
all at one time. Like I said, you can ‘t

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.670
really go wrong with a whole lot of pepper
in my opinion, especially in a nice rustic

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:09.539
tomato soup like this one. All right, next
thing, onions and garlic both at the same

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.989
time. All right, this is the part at which,
once everything gets nice and coated, this

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.249
is the point at which you are going to reduce
the heat for a little bit and just let it

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.169
all kind of simmer out because you are not
going to want to do anything with this until

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:33.099
the onion turns a nice translucent yellow.
Also if you were to keep up this high heat

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.360
all you would do is burn your olive oil, not
what we are looking to do.
