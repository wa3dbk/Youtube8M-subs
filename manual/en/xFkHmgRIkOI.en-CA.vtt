00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:02.602
One thing I've seen in
a few YouTube videos

00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:05.037
with people using a table
saw for the first time

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:08.541
is free-hand cross-cutting
a piece of wood like this.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.640
and that's a really
bad idea because

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:12.512
it can cause a lot
of kick-back.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.248
I've never done it myself
but I'm about to try it

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.250
and that could provoke
some kick-back

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.119
and I have a catch-clothe
behind my saw

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.722
so I'm not gonna damage too
much of the shop, so...

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.476
Let's see
what happens.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.949
Wow, that was disappointing.
I thought that work piece

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.251
would just go flying
into this here.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.154
But maybe kick-back isn't
as easy to provoke as I

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.590
thought it would be
but I'll try again

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.426
with a wider piece of wood,
see what happens there.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.640
Well, that was
more like it.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.742
Not as spectacular as
I thought it would be

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.744
the piece of wood was
moving at a good speed

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.682
but not really fast enough to
cause a lot of serious injury.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.985
The bigger danger is probably
more if you're cutting like this

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:28.354
and the piece starts
to get away on you

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.057
if you're not intuitively
aware of the danger here

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:33.359
you might be inclined
to try to hold it down

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.927
and get your fingers
into the blade,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.263
and that's where the
real damage happens.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.132
But, even though I had a
hard time getting kickbacks

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.268
and they weren't
that bad, you should

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.271
never cross-cut
free-hand.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.773
Always use something
like a miter gauge,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.276
which helps you hold
the piece very steady.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:55.047
Or, even better, make
a table saw sled,

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:58.684
which will really hold
the piece steady.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.554
And when it's in here it
really can't get away on you.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:04.190
Kickback is almost
always a function

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.259
of the piece starting
to get at an angle

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.095
and pinching the blade
and a sled like that

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.731
will really prevent
that from happening so,

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:14.734
kickback in a table saw
sled like this is...

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.275
Just doesn't happen.
