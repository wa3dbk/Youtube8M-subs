00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.570
I’ll always remember when Super Mario 64
came out on the N64. And it was the first

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.849
time I really felt like I was freely exploring
a 3D space.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.170
And I wasn’t thinking about the technology,
the 3D-ness of it, but mostly about the fact

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.369
that it felt like a real place, which was
always the dream to go into an imaginary virtual

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.119
place inside the machine.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.900
I think it’s fun for someone who’s not
very powerful, like a young child to like

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.599
do
something really powerful on the screen.

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.190
That’s one of the strongest feelings you
get when you’re playing video games is that

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.699
feeling of, “I miss that world and I want
to go back to it.” And that’s what you

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.579
try to
achieve with every game you make is to create

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.250
a world so real that people miss it when
they’re not playing the game.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.550
For Monkey Island, it was really me sitting
around writing a lot of little short stories.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.089
I wrote these one-page stories just over and
over and over again, really trying to pull

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.230
out
of that world what it was that was going to

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.499
be interesting about that.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:08.490
The thing about games is to me the main character
in an adventure game is the world. It's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.720
not Guybrush Threepwood. It's the world. It's
that world that he exists in. And Guybrush

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.770
is just the lens that we use to look at that
whole world.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.180
And it was really about making sure that world
made a lot of sense.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.180
Without a doubt, the single largest advance
in the development of video games is the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.720
presence of network connectivity.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
As soon as games were available to network
and then we were able to create the internet,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.160
it created this ability to create worlds,
imaginary worlds, with real people.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.210
This is not about something that changed the
history of video games. This is the biggest

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.210
change in humanity that we’ve probably had
since the development of fire.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.360
No time ever in the history of the world has
more music been played more times than in

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.550
video games right now.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.530
Take a game like World of Warcraft where people
are playing 20, 30 hours a week and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.100
the music is in your face, pounding. We’re
doing things now that Beethoven and Mozart

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.930
never dreamed of that would be possible, you
know.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.930
We’re able to do things in music and branch
out interactively. And if the player stops

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.620
here…

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.760
then we need to keep this rolling. But if
he goes in that direction, then let’s start

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.950
bringing
in a percussion track. It’s almost like

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.480
the player becomes the conductor.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.480
I’ve always said that if Beethoven were
alive today, he’d be a video game composer,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.560
no
doubt in my mind.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.959
Your skill watching a movie might be eating
popcorn. A skill playing a game is you feel

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.410
like you've succeeded at learning something
and you're good at it.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.530
When you press the button, you jump. It's
not just a jump. When you press the button

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.540
and
hold the button, you jump higher. When you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.020
jump and push left when you're going right,
you change direction in the air. All these

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.470
things add to this visceral experience in
the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.349
game that you would never get from a movie,
and you feel like you're learning something

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.510
like riding a bike or riding a skateboard
and you can come back to it and improve.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.209
And there's something about that motivation.
There's something about that kind of

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.950
experience that drives a player to continue
to play that game and come back to it again

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.400
and again.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.540
It's not just a puzzle. It's something that
people really can relate to and feel very

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.819
emotional about.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.319
Disney Epic Mickey, it wasn’t just an intellectual
exercise for players. It wasn’t just mash

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.940
buttons and beat a bad guy for players. It
really touches people. I hope they see the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.190
potential of video games as a medium where
you can learn something about the world

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.060
and about yourself, try things out in a virtual
world that we would never want to you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.930
trying out in the real world…

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.110
And return to the real world from these virtual
worlds kind of a changed and better

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.939
person.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:30.319
Video games aren’t this trivial little form
of entertainment. It's not like just a colorful

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.169
crossword or something that we’re doing
here. This is something that touches people

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:34.889
deeply.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.969
If you don’t play video games yet, we’re
going to get you. Trust me, we’re going

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.809
to find
a way to get a game to you. So you can understand

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.249
just how powerful this medium is.
