00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt; ANCHOR: Two leading universities that serve
deaf and hard-of-hearing students are teaming

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.790
up to encourage more deaf individuals to enter
the health care field. Congresswoman Louise

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.821
Slaughter announced the creation of a task
force on health care careers for the deaf

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:18.539
and hard of hearing in Washington this week.
With a continued shortage of qualified health

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.990
care workers, proponents say this effort is
long overdue. YNN health reporter Casey Bortnick

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.990
explains.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.720
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: With just one final exam left

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.779
&gt;&gt; KYLE GAHAGAN: They told me it was going
to be hard.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.269
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Kyle Gahagan is cramming.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.170
&gt;&gt; KYLE GAHAGAN: To get into medical school
you need to have a high GPA.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.780
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: The college freshman knows he'll
need more than good grades to become a doctor.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.090
&gt;&gt; KYLE GAHAGAN: I have people that understand
the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.770
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Kyle is enrolled at the National
Technical Institute for the Deaf. An institute

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.100
of higher learning that Kyle says has opened
doors for him.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.299
&gt;&gt; KYLE GAHAGAN: The support that I have here
is what I want to have in medical school.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.760
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: It's the kind of support Dr.
Michael McKee didn't have.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.899
&gt;&gt; DR. McKEE: I was born deaf.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.790
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Even before entering medical
school, McKee says he had a hard time changing

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.840
attitudes including his own.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.300
&gt;&gt; DR. McKEE: At that time, I thought it was
impossible for a deaf individual to get into

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.800
the field of medicine.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.260
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Now a family physician with Lifetime
Health, a cochlear implant and a special stethoscope

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.050
helps him hear his patient's heart beat.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.880
&gt;&gt; DR. McKEE: I feel actually that it was
a really good fit for me.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.130
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: With the health care field experiencing
a shortage of doctors and nurses, McKee says

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.571
it's time to open the medical field for the
deaf.

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:35.220
&gt;&gt; DR. McKEE: We need that diversity. The
task force I think will allow some of those

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890
barriers to be broken down.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.380
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: For Kyle, becoming a doctor is
more than just a career goal.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.750
&gt;&gt; KYLE: When I was 12, my mom died of cancer.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.070
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: He says the compassion doctors
showed his mother in her final days inspired

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.500
him to want to help others.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.940
&gt;&gt; KYLE: I think she'd be happy for me cause
I know she knows I'm doing something that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.940
I want to do.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.950
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: McKee also works for the National
Center for Deaf Health Research through the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.640
University of Rochester Medical Center, the
same organization that offered Kyle an internship.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.730
And Amy, after some time off in his hometown
of Baltimore, it's right back to work for

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
Kyle. He'll be right back here in Rochester
this summer.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.730
&gt;&gt; ANCHOR: All right, we wish him the best.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.730
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: We do.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.950
&gt;&gt; ANCHOR: Casey Bortnick, thank you.
