Hi friends, Welcome to Priyanka's Kitchen

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.820
The dish we are going to tell you that is served during fasting.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.800
Yes, we are talking about Sabudana Khichdi which is known to everyone.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.700
So, we will start how to make sabudana khichdi. so come with me

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.900
so for making sabudana khichdi, firstly you take 250gm of sabudana and soak it for 1 hour

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.200
and after that put it in the strainer to infuse the water for almost 2 hours after that

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.300
it will look like this, then press it and if it mash up then that means its ready to cook

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.640
will take 2 medium size chopped potatoes to put in it

00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:52.237
you can take green chillies according to your taste, as in i like spicy then i have taken 3-4 green chillies

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.700
take roasted almond, roast it on the low flame,after that peel it and crush it coarsely

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.220
since we are making it to have in fasting so will not use normal use, instead will use This one Sendha namak

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.149
it is easily available in the market you can purchase its powder &amp; take a piece of it and grind at your home

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.240
and in the last we will put coriander leaves for garnishing

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.420
Now put almost 2 spoon of cooking oil in a pan

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.160
once the oil heat up then we will add chopped potatoes in them

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.840
will cook these potatoes till then they are cooked

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.080
if you want you can put green chillies along with potatoes, but we will put it later on as its taste good when it is crunchy

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.120
when you feel the potatoes are coked then we will add salt, with this they will look separated

00:02:13.234 --> 00:02:17.554
as you can see that these potatoes are cooked then we will add salt 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.600
remember it is sendha namak it is less salty so it is put in good amount

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000
and now we will put chopped green chillies

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.480
now you see these potatoes are getting red

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.920
when they get red and cooked , press it like this

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.000
as they are cooked and now we will add some red chilli

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.140
and take the peanuts , roast &amp; peel and then coarsely crush them and then put it in it

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280
see, its color is getting changed

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.300
now we will put sabudana  in it

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.160
after putting sabudana then we will put salt in it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.220
although we have added salt but then we will put salt in it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.280
as i said that it is sendha namak and it is less salty then normal salt

00:04:03.872 --> 00:04:06.112
now will put crushed black pepper

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.860
and now cook it for 5 minutes

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.840
now our khichdi is almost ready, will cook it for more 2 minutes 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.800
and you will notice that there is one advantage of getting sabudana cooked, that it becomes transparent

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.627
when it reaches to this level that means its cooked

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:36.866
now our sabudana is completely cooked

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:42.759
we have taken the juice of the half of the lemon, and will put that juice in it

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.340
and the chopped coriander leaves

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.260
after that turn the flame off and get it mixed. so that it get  mixed nicely

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.760
take it off in the bowl

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:30.604
after that garnish it with left over coriander leaves

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:33.499
