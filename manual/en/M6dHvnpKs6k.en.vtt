reasons for bringing a tripod on your next trip.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.100
Well I'm coming to you from beautiful Recife,
Brazil. I've been traveling around

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.690
the world for about 7 months now, and
when I first started on my trip

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.480
I had to decide if I was going to bring
a tripod, or a flash,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.600
or both, and I decided based on weight
and space and all of those restrictions that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.080
I couldn't bring a flash.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.120
But I did want to bring a tripod for some
very good

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.530
reasons, and I want to talk to you about those reasons today in this episode. But before I do that,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.880
I want to remind you that Adorama has some

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.760
Alright before I get into to my 4 reasons
for bringing a tripod for your travels,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800
let me just had this little disclaimer.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800
If you can bring a flash and a tripod you should, absolutely, if you have space and the weight

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.030
is OK few bring your flash. I didn't have
that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.280
availability, those options. I had to really cut
down on my weight so I had to choose

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.350
between one or the other

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.620
and the tripod won out for these 4
reasons, and the first reason has to do

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.720
with low light.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.550
A tripod allows you to shoot things in a
really low light,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.780
where flash just can't help you out. For
example,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.100
I was shooting Quito at night, that
meant a really long exposure. Now a little

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.010
flash on my camera isn't going to light up an entire city,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.250
and so my tripod allowed me to shoot
really long exposures,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.850
with low ISO to reduce the noise, while keeping
my camera from moving around,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.110
and so I was able to create some really
nice low light photographs were flashing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.940
just wouldn't work.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.740
On travels I want to capture those
kind of things. Cityscapes, and scenic photography,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.250
a flash isn't going to help me, but a tripod is
going to do the trick.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.620
The second reason I chose to bring a
tripod

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.789
was it allows me to do some really
awesome things in scenic photography,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.750
specifically with water.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.020
It allows me to drag the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.550
shutter, using a neutral density
filter, and so I can go into the forests,

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.310
or the jungles,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.680
and create that really glass-like effect on
water,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.530
it's something that a flash just won't
help you with. One of my most significant

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.570
reasons for bringing a tripod

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.830
is that most DSLR's today shoot video,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.790
and shooting video handheld looks really
wobbly and it can make you sort of motion sick,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.410
because it's really not still, you need a
tripod.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.380
You can see these boats behind me, I shot 2 videos, one handheld, and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.960
you can see it is sort of all
over the place, even though I'm holding that camera

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.900
as still as I possibly can.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.530
But being hand-held just isn't a match for
having a tripod on your camera,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.310
that is going to really, significantly
increase the quality

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.990
of your videos, if you are shooting videos with your DSLR. The last reason,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.120
reason number 4,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.610
is HDR photography. Now, I've said in the
past I'm not a big HDR fan, but

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.020
in my travels I have discovered that I am
really becoming a fan of HDR photography.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.120
For example, this is an image of the Basilica
of the National vow It's one of my favorite

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.300
pictures from this trip.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.820
That would have been totally impossible had I not had a tripod,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.100
and when I was in Mindo friend asked me to shoot some pictures of his hotel,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.480
again HDR photography came into play,
totally impossible without my tripod.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.550
I just keep finding these situations
over and over again,

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.430
where I want to shoot at low light, I want to shoot
some video, I want to shoot some HDR photography

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.190
I want to get some really cool scenic stuff,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.660
all of that stuff requires a tripod. Even

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.370
shooting the stars. I was out one night
and said wow, these stars are amazing,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.740
and I got this shot of the stars it
would have been totally impossible without a tripod,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.010
and, more notably none of those would
have been possible with a flash,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.820
and so for me, my options for travel
photography are much greater with the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.400
tripod than they are with the flash,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.810
and that's why I chose that one over the
flash. Again, if you can bring a flash,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.110
bring it, but if you had to choose I think
the winner is clearly the tripod.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.420
