00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.279
So let me give you a brief timeline of what
happens from the death of Solomon down to

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.040
the destruction. So, when Solomon died in
922 [BCE] the structure that had been erected

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.730
by David and Solomon fell into these two rival
states and neither of them of course is going

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.060
to be very strong. You have the northern kingdom
of Israel and the southern kingdom referred

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.040
to as Judah, each with its own king: Jeroboam
in the north, Rehoboam in the south. Sometimes

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.270
they're going to be at war with one another,
sometimes they're going to work in alliance

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.750
with one another, but 200 years later, from
922 down to 722, 200 years later the northern

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.309
kingdom of Israel will fall to the Assyrian
empire.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
The Assyrians come down to the border of the
southern kingdom, to Judah, and Judah remains

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.670
viable but it is reduced to vassal status.
It is tributary to this new world power. Finally,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.569
Judah will be destroyed about 150 years later
--about 587-586 [BCE]. The Babylonians, the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:44.280
neo-Babylonian empire, they have conquered
the Assyrians and they assume control over

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
the ancient Near East and take the southern
kingdom. Now the story of the northern kingdom,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.340
Israel, that is presented in Kings, is colored
by a Judean perspective, and it is highly

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.010
negative and highly polemical. So Solomon
was succeeded by his son, Rehoboam, but the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.649
ten tribes of the north revolted when he refused
to relieve their tax burden. They came to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.909
him and asked if they could have some relief
and he answered them very harshly, so they

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.289
revolted and a separate kingdom was set up
under the rule of the Israelite Jeroboam,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.490
just at the end of the tenth. So, divided
now into these two kingdoms, they begin to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.650
lose power, probably losing any control they
may have had over outlying territories.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280
So let's focus first on the northern kingdom
of Israel. The area was more divided by tribal

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.740
rivalries and religious traditions than Judah.
You have ten tribes in that region. Jeroboam

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.210
didn't seem to be able to establish a very
stable rule. 1 Kings 12 tells us of Jeroboam's

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.560
effort to break the connection with the traditional
religious center of Jerusalem in the south.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.430
He establishes his own government at Shechem--that
was a place that was already revered in Hebrew

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.120
tradition. This is where we have the covenant
renewal ceremony by Joshua, so it's already

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.730
a somewhat sacred site. So he establishes
his capital in Shechem, and then he establishes

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.060
royal shrines, one in the southern part of
Israel and one in the northern part of Israel;

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.810
on each of the borders, north and south of
the kingdom, in Dan and Bethel (Bethel in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.890
the south and Dan in the north).
A golden calf is placed in each shrine according

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.010
to the text, and this is viewed by the Deuteronomistic
historian as a terrible sin. Indeed the story

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.360
is written in a manner that deliberately echoes
the story of the golden calf that was made

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.950
by Aaron in Exodus 32. There are linguistic
echoes that make it very clear that we are

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.920
supposed to view this as a sin as great as
the sin of Aaron. It may well be that if Jeroboam

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.800
did in fact do this that he was a good Yahwist
and was just trying to establish alternate

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.840
sanctuaries for Yahweh that would rival Jerusalem's.
But the Deuteronomistic historian wants to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.150
see this as another instance of idolatry,
and therefore, deliberately echoes the primordial

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.810
cultic sin of the golden calves when talking
about Jeroboam's activity. It brands his cultic

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.349
center as illegitimate idolatry. Jeroboam
is represented by the biblical writer as having

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.410
made unacceptable concessions to Canaanite
practices of worship, and so he is criticized

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.090
for this. Despite his best efforts, his kingship
is fairly unstable, and in fact in the 200-year

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.659
history of the kingdom, the northern kingdom
of Israel, we will have seven different dynasties

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:34.569
occupying the throne.
