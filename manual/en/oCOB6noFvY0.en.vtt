00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:09.999
September, 18th

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.549
21th century

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
My name is Thomas Light

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.679
I'm the researcher who design Megaman X

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.300
 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.500
He's the first of a new generation of robots

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.149
which the ability to think,...to feel...

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.900
and make their own decisions.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.710
However, this gift could be dangerous

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.200
&lt; First Rule:"A ROBOT MUST NEVER HARM A HUMAN BEING" &gt;                                         If X were to break the first rule of the robotics, the results would be disastrous...

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.400
and i fear thar no force on earth could stop him

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.800
 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.110
approximately 30 years will be required before we can safely confirm his reliability.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.300
unfortunately i will not live to see that day, nor do i have anyone to carry on my work.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.500
Therefore...

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.870
I have decided to seal him in this capsule.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.180
which will test his internal systems

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.700
until he completes his development.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.100
Please, don't disturb the capsule until that time.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:25.499
 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.059
 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:34.479
 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:40.069
