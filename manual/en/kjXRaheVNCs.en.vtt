00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.280
I’m wiped out, fed up with fighting my own people

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.380
I wouldn't be surprised if they killed me with their own hands

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.380
I want to believe in us

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.660
But I’m afraid “us” is an illusion

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.200
All followers of every man for himself

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
Nobody respects us and I think I know why

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.260
We’re greedy and divided

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.200
We’re being fooled, we’re not even forming a community

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.720
Preoccupied by needs
Are we all short-sighted, incapable of taking the long view

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.460
We don’t want the good, we want the gain
Even if we let the common interest crash

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.620
We live unconscious of the stakes
But despite ourselves, the media puts us in the game

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.660
Manipulated like pawns, everybody bets on our division

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Victims of xenophobia

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.360
Unable to organize ourselves a lobby

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500
We’ll always be beggars in the doorways of their world

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.620
As long as we believe we need to beg for respect

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.460
Respect comes forefront and the fight is economic
Look at the Asian community

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.560
We make a lot of noise and little dough
We give a few hits and get slapped back hard

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.260
The media messes with us with impunity
Knowing that insulting us carries no risk

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.500
We don’t scare anyone, we’re the laughing stock of everyone

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.840
And our riots unfold far from the Presidential Palace

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.100
Just burning a few cars
Of poor people like us and wrecking our own structures

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.860
Where’s our Revolution, where’s our evolution

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.420
We’ve been in France for generations and where are we at?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.400
Even if it brings me down
It’s clear we’re at the bottom of the social ladder

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.040
In the crosshairs of the media there’s no better target than us,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.280
So you tell me why there’s nobody more divided

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.180
We complain about racism but aren’t we that ourselves

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.120
It’s them against us but mostly us against ourselves

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
Algerians against Moroccans
Moroccans against Tunisians

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.100
Antilleans against Maghrebis 
Maghrebis against Africans

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.680
Turks against themselves
Even in the mosques our hearts are divided

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.000
Everybody wants to lead, everybody wants to dominate
And refuses to conceive the best could be Pakistani

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.820
You could ask the question, who are the most racist?
Just look at the problems posed by mixed marriages

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.260
You can’t criticize others for what you are yourself
I salt the wounds, it’s fine if these words bothers you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.300
There’ll never be evolution without asking deep questions

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.060
And is there anything more crazy than a madman who believes he has reason

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.260
Do I need to spell it out?
As long as we’re taken for what we’re not

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.840
We’ll run in all directions but we’ll never advance one step

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120
Poverty cannot excuse

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.080
All this acting uncivilized
The constant aggression and insults,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.940
Ultimately,
Only help those who call us crass

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.200
Only help those who hate us
Point to us as the problem and with that we’re slandered

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Realize you serve as a useful idiot if you have no vision
If you don’t like getting beaten, why’d you hand over the stick?

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.040
You want to tear down the system, spit up the pill
Start by refusing to be manipulated

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.300
For a rebellion to succeed, it must be thought-out
And I know, you don’t lead a revolution with your pants down

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.340
And those who enter politics betray us
Wallow in the the role of typical Arab or Black

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.000
It doesn’t take much to corrupt them, it’s not just the system
You get walked all over only when you crawl

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.900
You’ve lost and you’re lost when you start hoping
To become someone by negating your identity

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.380
They have trouble lasting because treason is disposable
And every traitor sits on an ejector seat

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.180
As for those among us who succeed
They’re forced to flee before jealousy gets them

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.260
Because in the heart of the envious and the eyes of the incapable
Success makes you guilty

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.580
Is that an excuse? To justify selfishness and flee the past in a Lexus

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.240
Hard to lend a hand without getting an arm cut off

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.740
But if I don’t take care of my own, who will?
It’s only at home that success leads to impasse

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.020
Because the last want to kill you to take first place
And your disappeared brothers that you keep crying for

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.140
It’s not the cops who’ve hit them

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.060
We’re the first victims of our own violence
The sign of our profound ignorance

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.140
We hit each other for hash, coke or cash
And soon we’ll be hitting each other to clash

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.360
Need of solidarity if one dares to hope
One day to leave precarity

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.300
It’s not only by hating others that we build ourselves up
In the mirror you sometimes see your worst enemy

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.260
I’ll never be your leader
I don’t have the virtue, nor the valor, nor the rigor

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.240
If I have one merit, it’s that I tried
And if I have a pretension it would be that of loving you

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.240
And one who loves doesn't cheat
I paint a dark picture but I’m just describing what I see

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.460
Come back to earth, let your illusions float out to sea
When your eyes are opened, like me you’ll get this bitter truth

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.260
This bitter truth, this bitter truth, this bitter truth

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.240
Need of solidarity if one dares to hope one day to leave precarity

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.180
It’s not only by hating others that we build ourselves up
In the mirror you sometimes see your worst enemy

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.380
All followers of every man for himself
Nobody respects us and I think I know why

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.440
We’re greedy and divided,
We’re being fooled, we’re not even forming a community

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.200
Need of solidarity if one dares to hope one day to leave precarity

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.560
It’s not only by hating others that we build ourselves up
In the mirror you sometimes see your worst enemy

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.320
All followers of every man for himself
Nobody respects us and I think I know why

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.980
We’re greedy and divided,
We’re being fooled, we’re not even forming a community
