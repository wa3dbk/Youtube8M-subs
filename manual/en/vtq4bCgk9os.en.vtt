Today on our 2003 Honda CRV well be installing
Draw Tite Hitch part number 75690.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.330
Now before we begin our installation heres
what your hitch will look like on your vehicle.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.620
Well go ahead and give you a few measurements
to help you when selecting accessories such

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.910
as a drawbar, a bike rack, or a cargo carrier.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.570
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outermost part of the spare tire is 9 inches.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.520
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 15 inches.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.160
Now lets go ahead with our install.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.980
To begin our installation well need to lower
the exhaust by disconnecting the rubber exhaust

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.260
hangers from the exhaust here at rear of the
muffler.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.859
The hunger on the inboard side will need to
remain on the vehicle as you will not be able

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.780
to put it back on once the hitch is installed.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.450

at the forward side of the muffler.

points.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:39.390
