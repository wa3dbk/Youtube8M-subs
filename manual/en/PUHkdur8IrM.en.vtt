00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.990
Now I will talk about the deep layers of

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.929
the planter side of the foot.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.019
First muscle that I will explain is the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.540
flexor digitorum longus, that's the muscle that

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
goes here and this is it stand okay.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.580
Now that's not the muscle that i will talk

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.590
about now because I talked about this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.199
muscle in previous lessons but, I want to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.779
talk about is here from its stand own we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.109
have the lumbrical muscles arising and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.420
that's the origin of these lumbrical

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.270
muscles. The insertion of the lumbrical

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.440
muscles is the plantar aponeurosis  and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.460
here actually on the lateral four digits

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.450
planter side. The function lumbrical

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.719
muscle is to actually flex the proximal

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.930
phalanxes and to extend the distal

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.840
phalanges. It is innervated also by the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.059
plantar nerve just like the previous

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.640
three muscles that i explained.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.010
Now i will remove these two muscles

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.200
because i want to explain some other

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.340
muscles, here we have the flexor digiti

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.430
minimi ,then we have the flexor hallucis

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.540
brevis, then we have the oblique head of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.119
the adductor hallucis and we have the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.490
transfers head of the adductor hallucis.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.110
The flexor hallucis is obviously going

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.090
to flex to hallux adductor is going to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
adduct it and flexor digiti minimi

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.829
serves for reflection of the fifth toe

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.729
and the flexor digiti minimi and the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.340
adductor hallucis are innervated by the lateral

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.950
plantar nerve, while the flexor hallucis

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.070
is innervated by the medial plantar

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.450
nerve. Now there are only two more groups

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.509
of muscles left now we'll explain and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.590
that is the interosseous muscles  we have

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.799
dorsal interosseous muscles  and we have

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.710
the planter interosseous muscles .

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.360
Let's start by explaining the dorsal

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.730
interosseous muscles. The dorsal interosseous muscles

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.680
as you can see

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.409
here have origin for example a fifth toe

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.650
on the fifth metatarsal bone but it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.969
inserts here on the 4th finger,

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.519
same goes here it originates in the

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.189
fourth metatarsal bone but inserts on

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.139
the third phalanx here.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.409
Ok what does this produce is actually

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.739
the phalanxes are pulled here laterally

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.189
ok and here from both sides it stays in

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.420
place, that's why muscles are pulled

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.139
apart from each other okay and that's

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.389
called the abduction of toes. Now we have

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.250
plantar nterosseous muscles that are

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.680
slightly different. The planter nterosseous

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.799
muscles arise from the same metatarsal

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.200
bone where they insert into phalange,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.189
that's why most phalanxes here are pulled

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.379
medially ok,

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.269
and because of this the fingers or toes

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.180
are pulled together that's called the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.799
adduction of toes.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.810
Hello everyone. I developed animated

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.459

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.659
I put on links down there in

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.639

here in a video. If you're not going to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.500
purchase my software, then at least make

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.299
