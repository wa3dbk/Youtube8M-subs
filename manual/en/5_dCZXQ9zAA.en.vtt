00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.796
This application is for posterior shin splints- 

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:15.810
where the pain often is located in the anterior or front, 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.204
and slightly medial portion of the shin.

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:21.560
This is often due to overuse of the posterior tibialis

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.706
muscle which is actually on the backside of the tibia.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.706
muscle which is actually on the backside of the tibia.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:29.548
This application is more for pain relief versus functional correction.

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:31.765
One of the most common areas for shin

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.201
splints is actually along the inner lower leg.

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:38.106
And if I placed a dot approximately where 

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.985
pain typically occurs. 

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:42.410
This can vary from person to person: 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.304
higher, lower, front, or back. 

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.811
What I am going to have you do is tear

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.120
a strip of tape off the roll.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.291
We are going to split that into a

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.453
Y-strip by folding it down on the perforation 

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:58.746
and then tearing down the tape. 

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.372
And it will stop at the anchor.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:01.951
Let’s go ahead and tear the paper off

00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:04.179
the back of the tape now at the anchor- 

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:06.270
which is the logo end of the tape. 

00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:10.254
Now place that anchor 2-3 inches below

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:11.471
that site of pain.

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:12.771
Now lets go ahead and rub that on

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:16.394
really well...  And from here- 

00:01:16.394 --> 00:01:18.065
what you can do is just peel 

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:20.705
the paper off the back of one of the

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:23.105
legs all the way down to the last inch 

00:01:23.464 --> 00:01:25.436
and a half or so, and now grab

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.168
that so there is still paper on there. 

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:28.411
Holding the anchor you are going to put

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:31.086
that tape on full stretch just going next to 

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:33.205
that site of pain, and with this hand

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:34.645
go ahead and lay that tape down. 

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.521
If you go up by your knee joint you can just

00:01:39.521 --> 00:01:42.320
go ahead and lay down that anchor with no tension.

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:46.810
(go ahead and lay that down… ok, rub that spot down) 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.690
Ok, lets go ahead and take the other piece off-

00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:54.350
same thing, leave the last inch and a half

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:56.520
and go around that site of pain.

00:01:56.518 --> 00:01:59.300
You can put that tape on stretch and bend 

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.350
right around that site if you would like.

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.880
Laying that tape down. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.740
And that last bit of tape- the last

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.820
two inches or so again, lay

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.100
that tape down without any tension. 

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:12.310
Lets go ahead and rub that on well with

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:15.840
the paper backing (actually very helpful).

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:24.610
And now I will have you tear another piece of tape off this roll.

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:29.260
Again split that into a Y-strip by 

00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:33.390
folding it down the center and tearing

00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:34.740
it right down to the anchor. 

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.310
And you are going to remove the paper backing. 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.310
Ok, this is important- what I want 

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.580
you to do is anchor on skin on the back

00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:50.040
of the leg at about the level of the site of pain. 

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.540
Make sure that anchor is on there well. 

00:02:56.982 --> 00:02:58.890
From here you are going to take that 

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.420
paper strip just like we did the first

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.200
strip you are going to leave an inch and 

00:03:03.298 --> 00:03:05.150
a half- and you are going to pull 

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:06.670
with good tension on that piece. 

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.780
Again going around that site of pain, 

00:03:09.578 --> 00:03:13.100
and you can go up the leg and lay

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:16.780
that down or across the leg.

00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:19.280
Ok, the same thing with this second piece. 

00:03:21.285 --> 00:03:22.480
Now you are going just above the site 

00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:24.530
of pain this time putting good 

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:25.500
tension on the tape. 

00:03:25.736 --> 00:03:26.930
No tension on the anchor and good 

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.040
tension at the site of pain and then 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.150
laying that tape down again with no tension. 

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:37.900
Rub that on creating a little friction.

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:40.600
That heat from the friction does help 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.080
the tape adhere better. 

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.660
I like to get down by the anchor 

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:46.490
really good, just to make sure-

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:49.410
that’s kind of a very flexible point 

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.640
that needs extra adherence,

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:55.550
and that’s the application for posterior shin splints.
