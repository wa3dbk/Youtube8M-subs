00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.910
I've got to really really interesting
story story here this is a funny one

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.139
Fox News did they do headlines

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.509
I don't know once an hour twice an hour
who knows and they did a headline wanted

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.639
the breaking news headlines lewis was
that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
sometimes books go on sale they put up a
clip

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.330
and this is this is this is boxing use

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.080
I don't know anchor for lack of a better
term Heather now right

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.740
talking about how al gore's book on the
so-called global warming crisis

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.430
is on sale Louis for only a dollar check
this out

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.270
well talk about an inconvenient truth
for former Vice President Al Gore

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.379
there's a picture that's now circulating
on Twitter you can see this right here

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.480
and shows the price for this book on the
so-called global warming crisis

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.520
well it's melton to just one dollar

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.190
its also labeled a superb I super by

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.059
I now we're not exactly where this
picture was taken but Amazon that common

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.570
I on the on Amazon dot com rather the
book sells for about twelve dollars

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.000
it's at 12 a buck 20 to buy use one

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.080
as this is this is so pathetic first the
mall

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.310
let's say it were unusual that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
older books end up being really cheap a
few years after their written let's say

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.720
was really unusual

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.700
is that really a headline right now is
is this what Fox News considers to be a

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
headline

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.920
but let's let's look beyond the surface
Lewis this is all about trying to

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.110
criticize al gore

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
because Sean Hannity's book let freedom
ring

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.909
cost you a penny on the Amazon
Marketplace

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.680
Steve do sees book the mister and missus

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850
happy handbook can you imagine buying
anything so absurd

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.930
that thing is 99 cents you can buy it
for 99 cents and a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.509
and and even if we go there's a long
list of these the most interesting one

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.729
of course is Sarah Palin

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.969
remember when Sarah Palin wrote that
book going rogue.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.829
there are over fourteen hundred copies I
love it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.920
hardcover copies of it on Amazon

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.459
available were one sent each

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.660
apparently that's not breaking news
though Lewis David I

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980
I wouldn't take one of those books if
you gave me a hundred dollars

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.640
I I feel like if anything is possessed
by demons it's one of those books

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.970
yeah I hate that little tiny Louis pat
robertson for years has been talking

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.060
about all the things that are possessed
by demons none of which we have any

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.379
evidence actually are

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.410
I would not by Sarah Palin's book on the
off chance that it was the money clip is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.910
that I would actually believe that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.330
in the grand scheme of things on Fox
News there have been

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.410
a far more ridiculous headlines the nest
so I'm glad here at least they're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.060
mentioning

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.430
al gore has a book I but change right
this is the most factual

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
headline we've heard relating to al gore
and the climate

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.010
crisis in years which is that al gore
exists

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.849
he has written a book they've correctly
cited the name of the book

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.650
maybe this is actually one of boxes
better stories I think it is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.800
I i say without a doubt maybe the best
story
