00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:29.449
(music playing) I grew up in a small town
in Canada, only seven thousand people.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.460
The first picture I ever took was taken with
a box camera, a Brownie box camera, and I

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.140
remember pushing it into my chest, ten years
of age at the time, and pushing that device

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.980
down, and it went "clunk."

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.510
I got the buzz right then, and it's never
stopped since.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.040
Now Speed Graphic was the camera of the time,
and if you had this in your hand, as a young

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.410
man, I have to tell you, you really felt you
were hot.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.950
Turn this way, that way.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.240
I mean that was a charge like nothing else.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.429
I got a call from Look magazine, and I was
basically hired to shoot fashion, and I was

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:12.499
the new generation.

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:14.249
I was in my mid-twenties.

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.969
The year was 1960.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:21.869
And then my boss in New York called me and
he said, "We'd like you to go Las Vegas with

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.369
our movie editor because Elizabeth Taylor,
who hasn't been photographed or had a story

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.770
done on her for about two or three years now,
has said she will give us an interview."

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.880
I sat quietly in the back of the room as the
journalist interviewed her, and I went up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.400
to her at the end and I took her hand and
I said, "Elizabeth, I am new with this magazine,"

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.969
looking straight here straight in the eye,
just like I am you, "could you imagine what

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.060
it would mean to me if you would give me an
opportunity to photograph you?"

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.749
I was holding her hand still.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.749
Pause.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:04.399
She probably thought she was never going to
be released, and then she said, "Okay, come

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.600
tomorrow night at 8:30."

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.480
To make a long story short, I did, and I got
pictures that ended up really starting my

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.580
career of photographing celebrities.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.110
I had the cover of Look magazine, my first
cover, and from then it was like an explosion

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.780
of possibilities.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.159
This camera is the one that I actually used
to photograph Marilyn Monroe, this very camera,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.549
this 500C.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.040
We went to visit her in her Hollywood home.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.700
It was this camera, myself, Marilyn, a wonderful
photo session that went on for about three

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.260
or four hours.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.319
I feel a great attachment to this.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.560
I have been very careful to hold on to my
images.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.000
Ever since then, I was always able to keep
my pictures, so that's why I have all these

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.370
books, fifteen in all at the moment, I believe.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.000
I am best known for my work around entertainment,
and these are work from the movies.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.330
They are different times, different places.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.730
I have worked on one hundred and sixty films
in all, by our last count.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.049
For me, one of the most significant and important
areas of working with people is to know your

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.819
subject, feel sympathetic toward them.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.599
You have to feel that I care about you, and
I do.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.829
Boy do I ever!

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.849
Because I know that what you have in you is
going to make a great image, and honestly,

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.159
you can have any lens in the world or any
type of camera, but if you don't have a subject

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:40.439
who's connecting with you, your chances are
substantially reduced of getting a good image.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.890
I learned from a lot of different sources
and resources, certainly, and photography

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.700
in the early days and later on with computers.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.739
I asked a lot of people a lot of questions,
and I had a lot of wonderful people help me.

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.920
And frankly, years ago, somebody gave me a
lesson that I've really held on to, and I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.499
feel this way very strongly: do the same for
somebody else.

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:10.130
When you receive something good, just pass
it along, and I hope that you get out of this

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.909
something special, and I am trying to pass
it along to you.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.140
I care about it.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.900
I hope you do.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:30.160
