00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.972
Welcome to the Smoke Learning Channel.

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:15.952
Starting with this video, you are about to 
start a journey into the exploration

00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:19.154
of the painting capabilities of Autodesk Smoke.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.540
We will first start off by looking at the 
types of paint tools available and their uses.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.102
We'll briefly touch on their inner workings and
 finally you can choose which tool

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:35.284
you would like to focus on through the links on
 YouTube and downloads through iTunes.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:42.243
Smoke provides you with two types of painting tools
 in two different locations within the application.

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:47.446
There is Desktop Paint and there is ConnectFX paint.

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:52.917
Starting off with the  Desktop paint, 
this tool is located in the tools tab.

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:59.357
This paint tool allows you to work on individual
 sources independent of a timeline or sequence.

00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:06.043
So you can do something to a clip or make an 
element before editing it into the sequence.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:08.574
Some practical examples include...

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:10.314
Artistic painting...

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.523
Image retouching...

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:14.477
Motion graphics design...

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:16.899
Or animatable brush strokes.

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:22.045
Desktop Paint uses a raster-based or 
bitmap based painting engine.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.626
It is important to know this when deciding 
what paint tool to use for a specific job.

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:30.110
In the case of Desktop Paint,

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:34.148
when you paint a stroke, 
it is already committed on the image

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:38.559
and new media is produced instantly 
with no rendering required.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:45.038
Other raster based painting tools such as 
Photoshop and Corel-paint function in a similar way.

00:01:46.226 --> 00:01:49.619
The other paint tool in Smoke is 
the ConnectFX Paint.

00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:56.703
This paint tool is already incorporated into the 
sequence using the ConnectFX node based environment.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:02.878
This allows paint to have a live interaction with
 sources going in and out of the node.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.012
So you could tweak something before the 
ConnectFX paint node and the results will ripple

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.983
through the paint tools.

00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:11.922
Some examples include...

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:13.687
Artistic Painting...

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:15.827
Retouching images...

00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:18.808
Retouching Mattes and Alphas...

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:22.081
And creating elements for Motion Graphics design.

00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:26.345
ConnectFX paint uses a vector-based painting engine.

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:28.669
Similar to Desktop Paint,

00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:34.706
knowing what the paint tool is doing helps when
 deciding what paint tool to use for a specific job.

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:41.247
In the case of ConnectFX paint, the strokes are 
always redrawing themselves every frame.

00:02:42.017 --> 00:02:47.636
The strokes are live and non-destructive making it
 very useful within this flexible environment.

00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:52.375
This will become very clear as you go through 
the various videos.

00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:57.586
There is quite a lot of overlap between 
the paint tools so some videos

00:02:57.586 --> 00:03:02.864
might seem repetitive but the workflows will 
differ depending on the option you choose.

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:05.616
You can now select which paint tool...

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:10.055
you want to learn through the 
YouTube links and iTunes downloads.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.587
More videos will be added to the playlist 
as they become available.

00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.461
