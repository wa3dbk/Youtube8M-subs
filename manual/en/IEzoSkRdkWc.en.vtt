00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:16.809
Look, a neat Volvo S60. Grey, discreet, subdued.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:35.423
Not really. This one is Smurf blue. Actually, Rebel Blue. It's a Polestar.

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:45.505
2 years ago, this was a 500 PS manual concept car. This has 'just' 350 PS.

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:53.018
And an auto 'box. But it's the same sort of blue! So it still stands out.

00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:12.419
Then, an M3? No, too powerful with 431 PS. The 340i isn't around yet.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:25.604
So here's the 435i. As Gran Coupe, though.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:59.610
What a sound! Bit of a mismatch. But I love it.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:16.998
Inside it's nice too. The gear lever lights up in blue. Carbon on the dash.

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:30.244
Beautiful chairs, if a bit high. I love Volvo interior design.

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:54.426
It has a 3.0 straight-6. A T6 delivering 350 PS and 500 NM.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:03:07.552
Just one turbo though. Only linkable to an auto 'box.

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:19.575
Swift but not super-swift. The ride is quite nice though.

00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:28.631
It steers neutral despite being 4WD. More power can be sent to the rear.

00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:38.155
Playful yet controllable. The chassis is sporty yet comfortable.

00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:55.843
This BMW is more communicative. You get so much feedback here.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:10.257
Being RWD it's easier to drift. But do you really want to?

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:13.597
Though you can get this as xDrive too.

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:36.049
Looking at the figures, this is inferior. 306 PS and 400 Nm.

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:54.500
In reality, it's different. This is a twin-turbo and has more torque sooner.

00:04:58.384 --> 00:05:13.411
Also, this 8-speed automatic is quicker. Interior-wise, the Volvo wins.

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:19.975
The BMW looks alright and neat but it lacks some flair.

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:34.913
A priori, I would choose the Volvo. It's different and rarer.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:49.058
But, the BMW is just a bit better in several respects. It just drives better.

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:50.789
It's a bit cheaper, too.

00:05:58.047 --> 00:06:13.976
The base Polestar costs nearly as much as an M3. That's how we think now.
