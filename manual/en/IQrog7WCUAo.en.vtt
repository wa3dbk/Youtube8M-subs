Dr. Ulrich Kremer: Programming languages are
a basic means that people can communicate

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.230
to computers. My job is twofold, number one
I am trying to take an existing language and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.460
then translate that language into something
that a computer can actually execute, and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.000
the other aspect is, well, if you have new
problems, you might actually need new languages,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.110
so we have to design new languages, we have
to come up with new abstractions, and then

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.930
of course also implement these new abstractions
in translators. So, our idea is to basically

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.760
first of all come up with new programming
abstractions to use phones, plus to optimize

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.350
for power consumption, so we have developed
a new spatial notion in the programming language

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.719
where you can actually talk about services
that are available on such a dynamic network.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.430
One drive application we call it, applications
that showcase the potential of this new architecture.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.219
It is what we call amber alert. So, amber
alert is actually a system that tries to track

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.590
down abducted children. So, now how we can
use these dynamic networks of cellphones to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.500
do this, and the answer is you might want
to go out there and for a specific search

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.970
area, let's assume it's a part of a town and
then ask, can you please take a picture or

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.570
is there a camera out there that sees a red
car or a red sedan, and once that picture

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.380
is taken, this might actually be then sent
to a piece of software that is able to analyze

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.960
this image and then says, yes, there's an
interesting car at that intersection, and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.710
that information in turn can be shared with
other people on this intersection or of course

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.710
with the authorities. Initially we start with
Java and then just the thinking of, well,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.420
we need to be able to talk about space, that
was the initial start, so we actually have

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.920
now an infrastructure where we send programs
into that network and it might jump from one

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.290
cellphone to the next cellphone, does its
thing and comes back. The gliders, as you

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.149
see here, they are commercial products, we
can buy them. However, it turns out that they

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.930
are right now very hard to program for oceanographers.
The first insight was that the current programming

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.590
module is very hard to understand. So we came
up with a clean slate approach. In order to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.989
do this, we had to develop the language, and
we actually had to also put in a new board

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.739
into the existing system, and the design challenge
was that we didn't want to throw out the existing

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.419
infrastructure, but instead kind of tag on
our new infrastructure so that users who are

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.900
a little bit afraid of our infrastructure
can use the old one or slowly migrate to the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.150
new infrastructure. I have a small group of
undergrads whose only job it is basically

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.799
to sit down, and thinking about, well, if
I have, iPhone, if I have, Nokia, it's kind

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.510
of machine, it's phones, what to do with it,
and I came up with some interesting applications.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.459
It seems to me that students are very concerned
with getting home on time, so there's the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.709
bus application where they can have time to
find out where specific buses are, or how

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.519
busy the bus stops are, so on and so forth.
One aspect of all of this, particularly with

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.859
a programming language I can envision that
you can build a very limited programming language,

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.730
meaning a language that lets you say only
very simple things that are very safe to do,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.400
and this might be a tool to give to, probably
not to elementary school kids, but middle

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.919
school kids, so that they can actually write
their missions and we could go ahead and execute

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.949
them without being worried that they actually
lose our equipment. So, basically it's an

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.669
enabling technology to bring science into
things like middle school and high school

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:46.449
and get people excited about it and hopefully
get more interest in people taking kind of

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.129
math and physics and biology.
