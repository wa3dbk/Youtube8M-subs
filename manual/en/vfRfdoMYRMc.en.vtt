00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.500
Hey soccer fans, this is Matt from 
SoccerPro.com. Just wanted to let you know we got in the brand

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.850
new adidas F50 adizero and it is the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.220
Messi edition.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.300
Now this color is

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.929
sharp and you're definitely going to see it on the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.249
field. It's that hot bright silver and

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.070
shiny shiny metallic features that just run throughout it.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.529
Now you're also going to notice that bright

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.260
orange

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.400
all over the shoe and those black
adidas stripes are really going to make it pop.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.450
Now you're definitely going to see these

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.400
on Messi's feet this season in the Champions
league and at home in La Liga

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.260
as you go against Real Madrid, Chelsea and really anyone else at home and abroad

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.720
who's a rival.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.970
Now, the shoe itself is special because

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.130
as the Messi edition always is leather,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.700
this one is too.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.520
Now up on the front there you've got Goleo calf leather which is going to be extra durable

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.489
and give you the same touch as kangaroo.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.319
It's an adidas product that's something
that we were like here and it's definitely going to fit

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.210
and stretch to your foot.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.590
Now it's going to be

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.170
something interesting but

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.750
the best part of this shoe is really the adidas sprint web. You can see it as you move back along there in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.609
orange

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:16.350
and as you lace up the shoe, it's really going to support your foot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.399
and let the shoe really

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.770
fit to your heel a lot tighter. So you're not going to get any slippage and you're really going to be able to bite into

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.500
the ground as fast as Messi does no matter what direction you're going.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.100
The heel itself has got an internal external heel cup which is going to give you a little

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.520
bit of protection; going to help.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.780
You don't see a lot of that on speed boots nowadays. Some manufactures tend to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.390
pair it down but this one is going to give you the
protection that you might need particularly

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.280
if you're getting a little rough in there with the defenders.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.399
Moving on to the bottom, you've got an adidas sprint frame sole plate

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.939
which is something they've been doing for a while. It's pretty popular, lightweight and super strong,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.310
so you're not going to have to worry about the sole plate cracking or any kind of separation

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.570
issues between the upper and the sole plate.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.460
The cleats themselves are geometrically
patterned and they've got that little divot in the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.259
middle to give you that extra bite on the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.950
field and really no matter what
direction you go in,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.200
you're going to be able to get some traction. I tried a pair of these shoes. They're awesome,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.570
really did give me that kind of bite on firm ground surfaces.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.639
One caveat, not great for turf.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.260
The release is a little bit slow and turf is really going to some damage to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.239
these shoes

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.659
so if you're really going to be playing mostly on turf, you're really going to want to have a look at our

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.049
selection of adidas turf shoes.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:24.790

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.080
