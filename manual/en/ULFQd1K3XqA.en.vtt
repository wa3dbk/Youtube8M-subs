TAYLAN YILDIZ - LET'S NOT STAY APART

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:51.077
Your name is a big secret, I am keeping in my heart

00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:57.858
I want you all for myself, dreaming of no one else

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.021
Your name is a big secret, I am keeping in my heart

00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:10.074
I want you all for myself, dreaming of no one else

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:16.575
Life shall take you to me, let it be my excuse

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.779
This feels like hell, love, let's not stay apart...

00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:29.149
Life shall take you to me, let it be my excuse

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:34.785
This feels like hell, love, let's not stay apart...

Standing on opposite sides of a picture 

00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:13.290
Staying hand in hand with other people

00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:19.580
Standing on opposite sides of a picture 

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:26.050
Staying hand in hand with other people

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:32.200
The two of us on separate paths of life

00:02:32.405 --> 00:02:38.470
Going the wrong way, love, let's not stay apart...

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:44.930
The two of us on separate paths of life

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:51.540
Going the wrong way, love, let's not stay apart...

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:29.150
This feels like hell, love, let's not stay apart...

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:35.640
The two of us on separate paths of life

00:03:35.735 --> 00:03:41.570
Going the wrong way, love, let's not stay apart...

00:03:41.672 --> 00:03:48.150
Life shall take you to me, let it be my excuse

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.830
This feels like hell, love, let's not stay apart...
