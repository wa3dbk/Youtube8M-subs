Hi, I'm Tricia, and organic gardener.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.700
It's raining here, a perfect day for starting seeds!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.380
Today I'm going to demonstrate
a technique called soil blocking.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.490
Soil blocking is very common in Europe,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.770
and there are many benefits.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.300
For example, you don't have to spend money on trays, and you can reduce the risk of transplant shock.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.650
To make the soil blocks, you'll need a soil blocker,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.490
I like this one from Ladbrooke.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.860
And some good potting mix, and I use the Quickroot.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.500
The Peaceful Valley Quickroot is the perfect medium for starting with soil blocks.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.160
Wet part of the Quickroot to the consistency of stiff oatmeal,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.960
and then let it sit for about 1 - 2 hours.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.760
Don't moisten all your medium at one time,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.480
because you may need to add more dry medium later to get the right consistency.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.480
Now that the medium has been soaking for a couple of hours,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.760
I'm going to start making the blocks.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.920
This 2" blocker works great for most starts.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.240
Charge the blocker by pressing it into the soil 2 - 3 times.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.980
Don't worry about over-compacting the soil.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.360
Then just scrape off the excess soil from the bottom.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.020
Set the blocker in your flat, and push down the plunger, gently lifting up the blocker.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.020
Notice the little indentation in the soil block,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.240
that's where the seed is gonna go. And that's created by the little pins in the soil blocker.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.720
There's different sized seed pins,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.460
like this little one for seeds that are small,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.100
and then there's a larger one for seeds that needs to be planted with more depth.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.860
When you're ready to replace the pins in your soil blocker, it's easy.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.560
Your soil blocker will come with pins, but if you're going to replace the pins you'll replace them with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.320
this new style quick-release pin, for easier installation.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.560
If you're going to put the cubic pins in the soil blocker, you'll need a phillips head screwdriver

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.360
with a magnetic tip.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.840
For space considerations, or for quicker germination and ease of heating,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.440
some gardeners prefer to start seed in these little mini blocks.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.080
It's really easy to pot up with these soil blocks.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.760
Once your little blocks are ready to pot up, just pop them into a bigger block!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.840
Like so.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.900
When it comes to planting your seeds, make sure you only put one seed per block.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.340
You can either pinch the soil over the seed, or for most seeds they will germinate just fine

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.820
on the top of the block.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.100
You won't need to water your soil blocks for the first 3 days or so,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.420
but then you'll need to water often, but a little tiny bit.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.300
And I recommend using a fine mist nozzle like the Fogg-It Nozzle, or a hand sprayer.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.840
Make sure you water all sides of the block.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.780
The blocks on the edges will dry out faster.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960
If you'd like more information about soil blocking,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.760
Then I recommend this book, "Transplants and Soil Blocks."

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.720
So get your seeds started, and Grow Organic for Life!
