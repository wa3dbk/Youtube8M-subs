00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.900
Welcome to The Messenger review.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.120
It’s the legendary Trials of Osiris pulse
rifle, and in my case, it is the adept version.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.570
I’m going to explain why I love this weapon
so much, compare it to similar pulse rifles

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.370
such as red death and three little words,
and elaborate on its situational usefulness.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.700
First, let’s go over how you can get this
weapon: being a trials of Osiris weapon, brother

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.400
Vance will eventually sell the non-adept version
of this weapon and oh boy, when he does, PvP

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.600
will be hell.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.250
Or if you want the elemental version, you
must go 9-0 in trials and visit the lighthouse

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.390
for a chance of getting the adept messenger.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.140
Now let’s go over the stats.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.949
It has the highest impact of all the pulse
rifles but a pretty slow rate of fire.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.690
Range is excellent and stability and reload
are OK.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.920
Mag size of 24 isn’t a problem since you
can take down up to a major in PvE and 3 people

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.179
in PvP in one mag.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.359
Aim assist is a little bit on the low side,
but recoil direction is pretty good overall.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.309
In PvP, it does 38 crit and 26 to the body,
and if you proc headseeker, the crit damage

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.570
goes up to 41.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.900
And this is coming from a pulse rifle, so
if you do the math, there’s a very high

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.450
chance that each burst is going to do over
100 damage.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.660
If you compare this with the Red Death, it
has higher rate of fire and slightly lower

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.660
impact, but The Messenger blows Red Death
out of the water in range and stability.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.640
Also, the higher impact gives more leeway
for killing people in 2 bursts.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.430
It has pretty much same stats as Three Little
Words, but with better perks and sights.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.010
Now let’s go into perks.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.430
The first and second perk are third eye and
headseeker.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.000
Third Eye is universally helpful, especially
since this weapon is not as capable in close

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.130
quarters so you can see when someone’s sneaking
up to you and switch to your close range backup.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.870
Headseeker allows you to 1-burst things that
you normally wouldn’t be able to in PvE

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.360
and gives you even more room for error for
2-bursting people in PvP.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.730
Onto the tree of perks, you have the option
to choose between extended mag, which increases

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.739
your mag size to 33, flared magwell, which
increases your reload speed, and perfect balance.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.099
For PvE, I really recommend extended mag since
that allows you to take on bigger groups of

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.129
enemies without reloading, and for PvP, perfect
balance makes this a laser gun with 0 recoil

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.959
so I don’t see why you would choose anything
else.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.230
While three little words only had fitted stock,
the messenger’s perfect balance is superior

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.030
and makes the messenger have considerably
lower recoil than three little words.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.069
Of course, Red Death has no stability perk
at all.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.980
For sight, it’s mostly up to personal preference
but I recommend Red Dot OAS for clean sight

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.739
&amp; extra aim assist.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.359
However, the best thing about the perks is
that they are fixed, and no they cannot be

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.470
reforged, so if you get this gun, you are
guaranteed to have great perkset no matter

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.430
which version of the messenger you get.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.290
Now let’s get into how this gun performs
in PvE.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.989
As a pulse rifle, it lacks the raw power of
hand cannons, and if you know me, I love hand

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.700
cannons in PvE, especially fatebringer and
Hawkmoon.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.620
However, what it lacks in raw power it makes
up in utility.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.379
The range, accuracy and stability are insane
in this gun and allows you to use it more

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.279
like a scout rifle with insanely high impact.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.230
Bind that with Gunslinger's Trance and it
becomes a laser gun again.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.860
It can comfortably take out groups of enemies
in one mag and a major or two in one mag.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.420
Now, mine comes in void, and the elements
may change for you, but I’m going to review

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.290
my version of the messenger.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.590
The void damage is nice as for arc damage,
I have fatebringer, and for solar, I have

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.379
vision of confluence.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.189
I... don't like word of crota so that makes
the void messenger very handy especially since

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.379
there aren't many nice void primaries in this
game.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.829
Last thing to note about PvE, headseeker really
comes in handy when dealing with the Vex,

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.970
so start shooting at a little bit below the
crit spot so that the 2nd and 3rd shot in

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.299
the burst lands a crit and gets the extra
damage from headseeker.

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.480
For PvP...

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.340
It's OP.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.620
It's ridiculous.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.549
As soon as I got this my K/D actually jumped.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.549
Now how did that happen?

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.320
Well, I'm a defensive player and it turns
out that this weapon is well suited for this

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320
playstyle.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.120
More so than Hawkmoon, which was my previously
favourite primary.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.611
Like I said, the range, accuracy and stability
on this thing is insane, more so than Three

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:40.129
Little Words, especially when you put on perfect
balance, so you can 2-burst people from across

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:41.129
the map.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.009
Speaking of 2-burst, since it does 38 crit
and 41 with perfect balance, you can get 2-burst

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.740
kills even if you land one body shot and 2
crits in each burst.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.610
The extra damage and headseeker gives a LOT
of room for mistake whereas with Red Death,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.780
you need to land at least 5 headshots or they
won't die.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.990
Also, bring a good close-range backup like
a sidearm or a shotgun because with the low

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.009
fire-rate it's hard to hit a moving target
that's close to you.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.889
But as long as you keep the engagements on
mid-long range, you will win gunfights 100%

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.620
of the time and have very short TTK.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.580
That is why this is one of the weapons that
can beat Thorn.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.949
Even without Red Death's healing perk, the
Messenger can nail 2 bursts into Thorn user

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.960
from ranges they have trouble hitting back
and kill them near instantly.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.039
So if you're getting annoyed by Hawkmoon and
Thorn in the Trials, this is the weapon for

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.129
you.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.629
So it's definitely an awesome pulse rifle,
and definitely do try it out and upgrade ASAP

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:42.629
once you get this.

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.110
It's a PvP monster but It's also potent in
PvE.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.669
Hope you guys get lucky in trials!
