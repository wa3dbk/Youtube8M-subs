OUYA
Hi Internet

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.010
Bob Mills here, your OUYA games guy
coming back to explore some cool games with

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.010
you.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.080
Last week we visited Bomb Squad and Knightmare
Tower.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.730
This week, we've got a couple more
plus a bonus video game.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.829
We reached out to you guys on Facebook,
and the overwhelming response was, "More games!"

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.630
So we've got a bonus game for you.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.009
Speaking of outreach, let's go ahead and check
out some of the cool stuff we're hearing.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.750
"More games."

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.480
"More Stan."

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480
"Dubwars!

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.280
"More gameplay less talking."

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.969
"Stan is awesome."

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.300
"I want to punch Bob in the face."

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.640
I guess we should make me punching you in
the face.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
That'll be like a hit of all times.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
Think so?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.140
Yah it would be both more Stan and punch Bob
in the face.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.140
Yeah.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.170
We should make a game like that.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.170
Okay.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.320
Stan punching Bob in the face.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.170
You would use your controller...

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.170
Okay.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.680
I didn't mean it that way.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.700
No, you know, it's whatever man.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.730
So let's just jump right in.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.570
The first game I'd like to take a look at
is called Dubwars.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.020
So, Dubwars is a dubstep, rhythm based, dual-stick
shooting game.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.970
You command a translucent, sort of, micro-spaceship
traveling along a printed circuit board.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.300
And your laser is powered by the sounds of
the music that's playing.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.560
At high points in the game you might be firing
off a ton of lasers at once and then when

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.120
the song kind of calms down and hits a valley
that becomes a little more challenging.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.650
To a point where, at some quiet parts of a
song, you won't have any lasers shooting at

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.290
all and so therein lies the challenge.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.700
Next I'd like to take a look at Deep Dungeons
of Doom.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.070
This is a game by Bossa Studios.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.940
You are a dungeon crawler.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.250
Pretty cool 8-bit style game with some pretty
sweet animation, rhythm-based fighting with

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.560
some blocks and attacks involved, lots of
leveling up, items to find, different characters

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.170
to explore, just a pretty fun game.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.750
Lastly, let's check out Save the Puppies.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.570
You play a momma wiener dog whose saving her
puppies.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.270
Not only super cute, it's super fun too.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.200
Among eating hot dogs to grow in length, you
can also do other cute things like bark on

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.340
command and you can also collect bones, manipulate
cats and other dogs in the yard all to save

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.560
your puppies.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.670
There are some games you can check out on
OUYA when you get your console.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.710
If you haven't got it yet, just hang in there.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.750
We'll get it to you as soon as possible.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.480
We've been ramping up so a lot of OUYAs are
either arriving on doorsteps or are on their

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.480
way.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.940
If you have any questions or would like to
see a different game in the future episodes,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.150
let me know.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.209
Happy belated Mother's Day to all the moms
out there in the Internet, including my mom.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.459
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.020
Until next time, Internet.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.900
OUYA!
