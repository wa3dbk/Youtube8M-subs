00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.493
Meet Scarbee Funk Guitarist, your personal session guitar player.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:26.066
At your service any time you need the funk, ready to play the rhythm track you want, exactly the way you want it, with the quality you'd expect from Native Instruments and Scarbee.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.085
The sound is incredibly authentic and it's a lot of fun to use. 

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:41.345
Each preset maps sampled guitar chords to the lower part of your keyboard and rhythmic patterns to the higher part.

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:45.287
Trigger the groove and add fills with the right hand...

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:51.256
While you control chord progressions with the left hand.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.117
You're only using 2 midi notes, so programming and editing guitar lines in your host sequencer is simple.

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:09.274
You get a virtually limitless selection of grooves, all neatly organized into chord and riff presets. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.700
The chord progressions are based on classic funk tracks, so it's easy to recreate classic, soul, funk, disco, pop, and R&amp;B guitar tracks.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.474
And with pro-quality effects on board, you have everything you need to get your guitar tracks radio ready.

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:37.025
But while the ready-made grooves of Scarbee Funk Guitarist provide blazing fast results, the true power of this instrument lies in its editability.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.589
You have control over any element in detail...

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:51.930
And with the help of some smart Scarbee magic, such as automatic stroke and velocity alteration and fully automated chord detection, even the grooves you built from scratch will sound like real hand played guitar lines.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.120
So whether you're sketching out a quick rhythm track, wrestling with demonic chord progressions, or struggling with inhuman rhythms, this guitarist can handle it.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.490
May the funk be with you.
