00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.029
Look guys...

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.369
unless you're keen for drama to unfold, most of us wouldn't invite our corporate

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.619
friends and our greenie friends to the same dinner party.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.619
Without a doubt, your best mate's banging on about how well his mining bonds are doing on the stock market

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.070
which, of course ruffles the feathers of your buddy whose life work is saving the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.070
wilderness from those earth plunderers.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.950
But, Barry and Gretchen do share some common
ground. Each of them will see value

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.950
in our eco driving techniques that not
only save cash but also help save the environment

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.589
We conducted research over twelve
months recruiting more than thirteen

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.690
hundred Queensland drivers, who adopted the practices into their day to day

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.820
driving

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.630
the results showed the committed
individuals and even the skeptics could benefit

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.220
Look I was pretty skeptical, my old man was

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.400
always going on about driving
economically but I always thought it was

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.960
a bit of hoopla and for me the biggest thing that stood out was actually seeing the numbers

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.990
on the page of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.990
what you can potentially save

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.240
Now its to the point where its just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.130
second nature - its only a few small changes

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.410
that don't actually affect you in any real manner

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.840
then you can save

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.200
a lot of fuel

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.969
I was open and I was definitely keen to learn how I could save

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.939
uh... on the fuel costs. I was a bit horrified how expensive petrol was

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.939
and how much fuel I seemed to be using

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.159
I'm more economical with the fuel and I just feel that I'm doing more for

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.859
the environment by being more conscious about how I drive

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.260
So if you want to keep the peace between your
friends tell them about eco driving

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.230
you can save money

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110
and help the environment.What have you got to lose?
