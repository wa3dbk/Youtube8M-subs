00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:12.100
Music

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.200
(rocket engine sound)

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.700
Peter Ma: "What now?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.500
That's the big question.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
but, the answer is always the same: The future."

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.710
David Santez: "A return to the moon.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.400
Docking with an asteroid.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.130
A new perspective on the solar

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.500
system beyond low-earth orbit. "

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.400
Tonya Laffinghouse: "The heavy-lift rocket

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.870
that NASA Space Launch System Program

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.870
is developing,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.500
can help make all that possible."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Peter Ma: "It's in the design stage now.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.920
It's main purpose is to

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.610
carry explorers and entirely new

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.880
science missions beyond Earth orbit,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.240
supporting researchers from across

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.420
the globe. It'll back up the commercial

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.330
crew and cargo capabilities being

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.980
developed for the ISS."

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.800
Peter Ma: "Over 280,000 pounds of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.820
equipment, people, and cargo,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.420
breaking new ground when it comes

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.710
to how much we can get out of orbit.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.309
Our current capabilities

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.720
will be absolutely shattered."

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
Tonya Laffinghouse:  "How? Well,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.150
simple design, evolutionary

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.100
technology, and  even more cost-effective

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.339
approaches involving legacy systems

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.070
will allow the program to work in

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310
completely new and increasingly

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.780
effective ways."

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.530
David Santez: "The 'what'

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.330
and the 'how' are almost

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.610
always the easiest questions

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.830
to answer. But it all starts

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.490
with the 'why', right? In this

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.360
case, the 'why' and the 'what'

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
are the same. The future."

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Peter Ma: "The frontier has

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.760
always been America's story.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.460
Some settle, but a few of us

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.550
keep on blazing forward. We have to;

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.810
it's in our DNA. probably

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490
because we know that the future

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.150
can teach us more than the present."

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.360
David Santez: "Exploration means

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.920
never slowing down. Seeing new

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.380
sights increases our understanding

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.800
of the universe around us, as well

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.700
as our faith in what we already know."

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.300
Dawn Turner: "In forty years all our

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.600
children are going to remember about

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.900
Apollo is the story. The unity.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.600
The accomplishment."

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
David Santez: "The future frontier."

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.700
David Santez: "Never-before-possible

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.300
perspectives. New interactions with geography.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.580
New ways to bring the world

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.070
together through transportation and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.510
communications."

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.340
Shayne Bement: The challenge of people

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.100
leaving the earth and moon system is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.320
small compared to the doors it will open

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.990
It is really hard to imagine

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.600
were cellphones, the internet

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.930
and communications in general

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.300
would be without the space race

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.300
Tonya Laffinghouse: "We just can't stand still."

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.500
Dawn Turner: "What do we do now?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500
We head towards the future."

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.620
Andrew Colson: "Why? Because we've got

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.410
to get there. How? By going further,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.200
by breaking new ground."
