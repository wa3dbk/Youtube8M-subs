JOHN NASH WAS ONE OF THE MOST
BRILLIANT MINDS OF HIS GENERATION

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.250
Welcome to Princeton.
Who among you will be the next Einstein?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.250
Find the truly original idea and it's
the only way I'll ever distinguish myself.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
It's the only way I'll ever matter.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
HE SAW THE WORLD

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.250
- Where is Nash?
- Out there working for his original idea.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.250
IN WAYS THAT NO ONE COULD IMAGINE

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
This flies in the face of 150 years of theory.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.500
Congratulations, John.
It's the achievement of a lifetime.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.500
FROM PRODUCER BRIAN GRAZER
AND DIRECTOR RON HOWARD

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,
if I can ask you to dinner?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.750
You do eat, don't you?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.750
- How big is the universe?
- Infinite.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.250
- How do you know for sure?
- I don't, I just believe it.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
It's the same as love I guess.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
THE EXTRAORDINARY GIFT

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.250
What can I do for the department of defense?

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.750
THAT SET HIM APART

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500
You are the best natural code breaker
I have ever seen.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
You've done your country a great service son.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.750
WOULD PUSH HIS MIND

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.250
- Get in.
- What's wrong with you?

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.250
BEYOND ITS LIMITS

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
Somebody...
Help me!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
John, open the door.
Talk to me, tell me what happened.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.750
It didn't happen.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500
This is no place of no war.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.250
- I'm not leaving...
- Stop!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.750
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.750
I need to believe that something
extraordinary is possible.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
UNIVERSAL PICTURES, DREAMWORKS PICTURES
AND IMAGINE ENTERTAINMENT PRESENT

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.500
You have to help me.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.000
ONE MAN'S JOURNEY TO THE
GREATEST DISCOVERY OF ALL

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.750
You wanna know what's real?
This is real.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.250
ACADEMY AWARD WINNER

ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE
ED HARRIS

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.250
AND JENNIFER CONNELLY

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.750
Perhaps it is good to have a beautiful mind,

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:10.750
but an even greater gift is to
discover a beautiful heart.

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.260
A BEAUTIFUL MIND
