00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.290
Hey BladeOps you are looking at the new Bear Grylls

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.770
survival knife this is newly redesigned
I believe the new one is called the bear

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.540
Grylls

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.230
ultimate pro survival knife and the
previous version was just call the bear

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.150
Grylls ultimate survival knife so there's quite a few changes to it 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.380
the sheath and the knife itself we'll go ahead and talk about them and show you the knife 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.570
so here's a good look at the knife in
the sheath

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.750
and you can see the nylon back 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.410
that is removable and it has the belt loop there

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.850
down here where the knife fits in this is all 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.530
a kind of rubberized overmold sheath very nice 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.149
a lot of grip and traction there if you hold the blade

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.960
shake it around theres no rattle it is a solid feeling sheath 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.700
it is pretty heavy of 15 ounces when
I weighed it all together exactly as it is 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.579
right here

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.260
 but it has some nice features this
is the firestarter

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.420
firesteel that fits in the front of the knife there you can see it has a little 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000
retention ramp there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.689
and also on the fire steel has an O-ring 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.880
to help it fit down in that channel so 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.290
that's a pretty nice feature that
comes along with the knife

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.140
and it's always good to have when you
are doing survival bushcraft

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
or anything out doors it does have this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.759
 drag through carbide sharpener on
the back

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.659
and I'll zoom in there you can see right

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.970
there you can see an arrow 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.930
that shows you that you need to pull the knife through this way so that's a cool

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.670
feature

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.860
another really important feature on the sheath is you can 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.170
insert the knife this way with the blade
pointing to the right

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.759
and that fits in nicely or you can turn
around and point the blade pointing to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.590
your left

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.759
that's important feature depending on if
you're gonna put your knife on your

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.270
right

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.759
or left side of your belt if you're going to put it on your gear and if you're right 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.180
or left-handed so that's a nice well
built sheath 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.159
it has Bears logo right there on the front and also it 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.680
had a little pocket up top with a ribbon

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.680
you go and pull that out and that pulls out your 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.080
Bear Grylls prirorities of survival pocket guide 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.800
so the ribbon helps you pull it out I imagine you can put some other stuff in that pocket 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.330
but that's meant for the pocket survival guide 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.550
go ahead and push it down there 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.930
so there you go a little pocket in the back and there is the Bear Grylls 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.920
Ultimate Pro survival knife sheath set
that aside

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.099
and here it is the new Bear Grylls

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.230
survival knife you'll notice the blade is a plain blade now 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.519
no serrations it is definitely a full ting 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.080
blade 10 inches overall of the 9CR19MOV steel

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.330
has this integrated

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.819
full steel pommel I can almost act like a hammer 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.790
could be useful in survival situations
also has this lanyard

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.390
with a survival whistle on the back and
you can see the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.550
handle material there it's a rubber overmold over the TP this is kind of a 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.690
plastic polymer material

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.110
with the rubber grip it's really grippy it has this deep finger groove up 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.700
front

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
it's a nice grip I notice that the
ridges are gimping on the back 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.690
they were a little slick but plenty
of traction with the rubber over mold 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.360
has a lashing point here and then these two up front 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.959
see there those are all the way through look like they're aluminum lined 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.620
it also has a little bit a room for your
finger your index finger

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.620
on the choil if you're going to do some detail tasks

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.430
and you can also see on the back of the blade they have left some coding off of the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.879
spine and that'll come in handy 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.330
when you pull out your fire starter and hold it like this 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.980
and you can strike the firestarter with
that portion of the blade 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.709
if you've ever notice before if you have a coating on your blade it makes it a lot 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.689
more difficult

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.409
so that section will come in handy when using your fire starter

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.549
overall I definitely liking the
improvements on the Bear Grylls

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.939
Ultimate Pro Survival Knife I'd love to know what you have to say about the new design 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.950
