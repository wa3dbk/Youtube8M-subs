00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:04.817
For this dish, the ingredients are, sliced
ginger

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:08.448
chopped garlic, cut spring onions, tiger
prawns

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:12.807
yee mee and eggs. For the tiger prawns

00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:19.807
we will cut them into two use and then
clean out the digestive tract.

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:24.938
Start the fire on low. Let the wok heat up
a little

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:27.948
then pour in one big spoon of oil.

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:31.658
Add in the chopped garlic, sliced ginger

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:35.378
and cook it a little. We're not going to
brown them.

00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:38.818
Add one large bowl of water

00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:42.758
into the wok. Sprinkle some pepper then
cover the wok

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:46.668
then wait till it boils. Ah!

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:52.478
Now it's time to put in the tiger prawns.
If you want the soup to be even sweeter

00:00:52.478 --> 00:00:56.998
in taste, you can add in a pork cube.

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:00.818
Right after we put in the prawns, we
can now add in the noodles.

00:01:00.818 --> 00:01:04.218
We're going to let the noodles soak up
the soup and soften a little

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:10.727
so put the cover back on for just a
little bit.

00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:14.698
It's almost done now so we can add in
the eggs now. The eggs will help thicken the

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:15.088
soup

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.657
and turn the soup into a thick sauce for
the noodles.

00:01:18.657 --> 00:01:21.727
After the eggs, sprinkle the spring onions

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:25.318
This would be the last to go in because
we don't want the greens

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:29.388
to turn brown. It looks so good already!

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:33.537
I'm getting hungry now but not yet!

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:37.437
We still got to cook it little, just maybe,
about five minutes more.

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:44.437
And now lunch is served.
