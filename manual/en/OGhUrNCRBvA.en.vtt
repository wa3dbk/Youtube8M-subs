00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.030
Another addition to Ted's Blog America's Best Bike Rides

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.070
this is Day 8 Week two of Ted's mission

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.120
to lose 25 pounds in 90 days, I think so far

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.140
successfully I have lost 5 pounds and then managed to gain 3 pounds back

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.180
so Net of 2 pound minus

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.210
and I'm felling pretty good I'm exercising right now

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.260
and I have been on the stationary bike for about a half hour now

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.290
my pulse is a lot more consistent and lower than it was last week when I was exercising

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.340
so I feel like I am getting to be a littlbe

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.370
in better shape, a little healthier

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.390
I think um..the great events from last week

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.430
we were able to spend two nights in Michael McCormacks

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.470
studio in San Francisco where he's been using our America's Best Bike Ride

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.520
Videos to show his class

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.550
and offer a little more enteratainment value for the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.640
class as they ride and exercise on their spin bikes and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.710
he says that that's been very good as far as feedback

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.800
very good positive feedback from people in the class

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.850
It's an added value that he probably never even thought of

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.910
you know, never even knew it was out there, we're lucky to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.940
have found each other and I think that you're going to be able to see

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.980
his youtube video and he can talk about

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.020
how it's been a big positive step in 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.050
making his class what we think now is probably the best

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.080
Spinning Class in America. I don't think there is any class that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.130
offers as much value as Michael's and that's something that

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.160
other spinning class instructors I hope will take into account

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.210
when looking for a similar product, Think about using ours

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.240
and you know, it's been used, 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.270
Michael loves it. You can hear him say it in his own words

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.310
Michael is a two 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.350
time Iron Man Champion and with that kind of

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.390
training knowledge and abilities and years and years of experience

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.430
in the industry I think that says a lot for our product

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.470
and we want to offer people that exercise

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.510
at home or trainers that have thier studios

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.580
basically have value and entertainment

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.640
added into thir workout schedule

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.710
you know I've been riding for about an hour watching the Mount Tam to Olema video

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.770
and boy I'l tell you I'm trying to keep up 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.800
and keep a good pace going the whole time and It's making me

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.820
sweat big time! I've got a lot of resepect for people

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.850
that ride bikes and do stationary bike exercises inside their

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.860
home because it just gets your cardio going

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.920
and um...I think if your

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.930
able to do this 3 or 4 times a week for half an hour 45 minutes

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.980
or an hour you are going to see the benefits. You are going to feel healthier

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.010
and be able to walk with a little more brisk in your step

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.070
and your head's gonna be a little more clear

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.100
You're also going to start losing some weight

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.140
with the right diet program added into your exercise program

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.190
I don't see how you can't see the results and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.230
those two things combined I think will make you think that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.290
exercise is the way to go

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.340
Like I said I'd like to see everybody

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.380
using America's Best Bike Rides videos when the're working out inside their house on their stationary 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
bikes so hopefully you'll take a look at our video. 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.520
Video products and add them to your

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.580
DVD collection and hopefully use them

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.640
to your great entertainment

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.980
Well thank you America. Day 8 Signing off!!
