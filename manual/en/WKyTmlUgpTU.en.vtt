00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:01.349
- Hey everyone, my name is Tyler,

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.754
and if you don't know me by now,

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.943
spoiler alert, I'm gay.

00:00:06.943 --> 00:00:08.767
Shocker, I know.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:09.951
But I always get comments from people

00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.272
that are like, "I think you're gay."

00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:13.181
and, "God really loves you,

00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:14.666
"pray to God that he makes you straight

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.525
"so that you can go to Heaven."

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:18.080
Things like that, and I'm always like,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.722
you know, how the fuck did these people

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:21.035
learn how to use the internet?

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:22.618
Because I thought that I had escaped them

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:25.565
from real life when I
went on the internet.

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:28.399
But apparently, they're getting smarter.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.838
And luckily these people have never tried

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:31.417
to come up to me and
tell me that I should try

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:33.704
to pray my gay away in person,

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.923
luckily for them, not
so much luckily for me,

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:38.186
because if they were to do that,

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:40.741
I would cut a bitch, and shank a hoe.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:43.479
Because, to me, and
this is just my opinion,

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.663
I'm not trying to make you
believe what I believe,

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:48.216
but I'm just saying,
because it's my channel,

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.619
I'm allowed to say this,
so don't attack me,

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.244
because I'm going to say it anyway,

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:54.025
and if you want to complain,

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:54.903
I'll just block you.

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:57.724
So, this is just what I'm going to say.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.056
To me, personally,
asking God through prayer

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:03.240
to take my gay away,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.240
is literally asking the
impossible from the pretend.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.239
It's just like, I'll take care of me being

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.062
a good person throughout my whole life,

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:13.745
you take care of you being a good person

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.266
throughout your whole life,

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.712
and if we happen to meet up in Heaven

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:19.289
in 100 years, great,
and completely separate

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.425
from the whole praying away the gay issue,

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.709
is the fact that I don't want

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.105
to not be gay, I love who I am,

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.336
and just because you're uncomfortable

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.375
with it because of some book

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.028
that may or may not have
mentioned it kind of,

00:01:32.028 --> 00:01:35.267
in passing, thousands of years ago

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.787
doesn't mean that I don't
want to be who I am.

00:01:37.787 --> 00:01:39.923
So, I appreciate your concern,

00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:41.467
but kindly fuck off.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.988
So my question today, comment below,

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:45.587
what is something that you
hate when people tell you

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:47.724
to do, because when people tell me

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:48.884
to pray my gay away, I just want

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:51.670
to be like, "You're an idiot."

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.482
What is something that makes
you give that response?

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:54.783
Comment below, I'm going
to pick my favorites

00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:56.884
and put them in my next video.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:58.022
But that is all I have for you guys today,

00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:58.962
right now I'm going to leave you

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:00.445
with some of my favorite
comments from last time

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.714
when I asked you what are
some of your favorite things

00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:04.298
that you're currently loving,

00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:05.958
because last time I
showed you all the things

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.162
that are my favorite things of August,

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:09.952
so you should check that out,

00:02:09.952 --> 00:02:13.212
and, okay, have a good life, goodbye.
