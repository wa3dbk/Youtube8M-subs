00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.969
When working on any electronics in order to
protect your investment, you should purchase

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.449
and use an ESD wrist strap.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.539
This is useful when working on any electronics
from TV boards to computer parts.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.250
It protects the equipment from your own static
charge.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.589
You may not know this, but you actually have
a static charge.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.080
For example, walking across carpet can generate
up to 3500 volts.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.930
Here is a look at our anti-static wrist strap.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.120
It comes with a flexible strap, so once you
get it set to the right size, you can slide

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.370
it onto your wrist.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.320
It should fit snug, but not too tight.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.100
This way it makes good contact with you and
helps to dissipate any static in there.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.370
These have a built in safety feature with
a 1 meg ohm resistor.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.290
So if something should happen you will not
go directly to ground.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.641
If you accidentally touch something live and
this was directly connected to the wire, it

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:43.860
could be deadly as you would go straight to
ground with very little resistance.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280
These alligator clips are also removable.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.110
So if you wanted to hook it up to something
else for example if you had a ground station

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.360
at your bench and you wanted to plug right
in, you can do that.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.200
Otherwise you can use the alligator clip to
plug onto the chassis or whatever you are

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.520
working on or to a ground line.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.950
