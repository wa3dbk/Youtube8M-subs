00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.453
Have you ever seen static electricity
cause a spark of light?

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:14.538
What is that spark?

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:15.920
What about lightning,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.135
the Northern Lights,

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:19.352
or the tail of a comet?

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.255
All of those things, and many others,

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:27.191
in fact 99.9% of the universe,
are made of plasma.

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.318
Plasma is a state of matter

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:32.650
drastically different 
from the more familiar forms.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.258
Take ice, for example.

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:38.383
Ice, a solid, 
melts to become water, a liquid,

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:42.841
which, when heated, 
vaporizes into steam, a gas.

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.298
Continued heating of the steam
at a high enough temperature

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:49.550
causes the water molecules 
in it to separate

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.879
into freely roaming hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.352
With a little more heat,
the ionization process occurs

00:00:57.352 --> 00:01:00.849
and the negatively charged electrons
escape the atoms,

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.423
leaving behind positively charged ions.

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:09.783
This mixture of freely roaming negative
and positive charges is plasma,

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:14.752
and at a high enough temperature,
any gas can be made into one.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:18.772
These freely moving charged particles
behave very differently

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:21.565
from the particles 
in other types of matter.

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:25.263
When a doorknob, a solid,
has static electricity on it,

00:01:25.263 --> 00:01:28.125
it doesn't look or behave any differently.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.940
And with the exception of a compass
or other magnetic object,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.503
we rarely see matter 
respond to a magnetic field.

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:40.033
But put a plasma in an electric field
or magnetic field,

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.416
and you'll get a very different reaction.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:44.368
Because plasmas are charged,

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:46.324
electric fields accelerate them,

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:50.628
and magnetic fields steer them
in circular orbits.

00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:52.918
And when the particles 
within plasma collide,

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.381
or accelerated 
by electricity or magnetism,

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.119
light is generated,

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.396
which is what we see 
when we look at plasmas

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:03.166
like the Aurora Borealis.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.699
Plasmas aren't just beautiful,
celestial phenomena, though.

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:12.735
Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas
with a very high voltage across it.

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:14.785
The resulting electric field

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:19.969
pushes some of the electrons off the atoms
and accelerates them to high speeds

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.786
causing the ionization of other atoms.

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:26.974
Imbedded impurities 
in the tiny cube of gas

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:30.855
cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:34.769
in the form of ultraviolet radiation.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.759
Attached to each tiny cube,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.199
a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:45.046
when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it.

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:49.284
Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes,

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:53.397
each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics.

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:55.870
You may be looking at one now.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.535
This is called a plasma TV.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.773
Plasmas also have implications
for health care.

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:05.756
Plasma chemists create 
highly specific plasmas

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.029
that can destroy 
or alter targeted chemicals,

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:14.620
thereby killing pathogenic organisms
on food or hospital surfaces.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.064
Plasmas are all around us,

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:20.337
in forms that are both spectacular
and practical.

00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:22.623
And in the future, plasma could be used

00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:25.709
to permanently rid 
landfills of their waste,

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.790
efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.674
and provide us with a potentially
unlimited supply

00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:35.307
of renewable clean energy.
