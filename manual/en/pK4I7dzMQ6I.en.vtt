00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.890
This video shows how to restore your computer
using a system image in Windows 8.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.890
A system image is a file containing a snapshot of
all of the data on a hard drive at any given time.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.330
If your hard drive fails or is corrupt, you
can restore your files and settings to the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.810
point when you created the system image.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.669
To create a system image, you will need a
storage device such as an external hard drive

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.750
or DVDs.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.890
For this example we will use an external hard
drive.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.890
From the Start Screen, press the Windows and
W keys to search in Settings.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:59.260
Begin typing File Recovery, and select Windows
7 File Recovery from the list of results.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.449
Click Create a system image.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.720
Choose the storage device you would like to
use, and then click Next.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.890
Select the drives you want to include in the
image, and then click Next.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.780
Make sure that you have enough blank space
on your storage device to create the system

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.270
image.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.549
Confirm the settings, and then click Start
backup.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.189
Continue to follow the on-screen instructions
until the image is complete.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.820
Processing time will vary based on how much
data you are backing up. Donâ€™t disrupt the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.420
process even if it takes over an hour to complete.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.729
When the system image has been created, you
will be asked to create a system repair disc

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.590
that can be used to boot the computer in case
of startup problems.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.430
It is not necessary to create the repair disc
to complete the system image process. If you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.430
would like to create a repair disc, click
Yes and follow the onscreen instructions.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.160
If you have already created a system repair
disc or do not want to create one now, click

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.300
No to proceed.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.510
The system image has been created.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.510
Click Close.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.220
Connect the storage device containing the
system image to the computer.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.480
From the Startup screen, click Settings, then
select the Power button.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.590
While holding down the shift key, click Restart
to reboot the computer to open the Advanced

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.210
Startup menu.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.670
When the computer restarts to the Advanced
Startup Menu, click Troubleshoot, and then

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.760
select Advanced options.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.030
Click System Image Recovery.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.030
Enter the user account and password, and then
click Continue.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.860
Select Use the latest available system image,
and then click Next.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.250
Click Next.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.630
Click Finish, and then click Yes.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.140
Windows begins to restore the computer.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.250
Follow the on-screen instructions to completely
restore the computer. Processing time varies

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.980
and could take up to a few hours to complete.
Do not interrupt the process.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.480
When the system image is restored, your computer
automatically restarts.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.480
