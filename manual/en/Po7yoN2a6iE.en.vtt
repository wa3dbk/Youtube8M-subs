00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Método Abellán. Cajón flamenco

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
Initiation level. Soleá, soleá por bulería, alegrías and bulería

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.220
Complete bulería rhythm

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.660
To conclude

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.320
We must accentuate

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.200
Between one and two first

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
But we won't do it at the beginning

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.920
We will always do it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.440
When we repeat

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.500
Sounding like this

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.300
We must know

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.960
From now on we will start on two

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.560
We won't do one

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.540
We will just count and start on two

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060
We will have something like

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.980
Here we finish with

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.440
The soleá

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.200
Soleá por bulerías

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.560
Alegría

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320
And bulería part
