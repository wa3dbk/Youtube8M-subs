00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.430
A massive asteroid, capable of wiping out
an entire country, is on a near-collision

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.670
route towards Earth.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.089
The 1000-metre wide mammoth asteroid has sparked
fears of an unprecedented disaster, as it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.580
travels at a speed of more than 36,000km/h.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.430
Small meteorites pass by Earth regularly,
but one of this size is an occurrence that

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.410
only happens once in 5000 years.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.110
The impact would reportedly trigger earthquakes,
tsunamis and devastating changes in climate.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:41.379
If the asteroid, called 2014-YB35, did collide
with Earth, it would unleash an explosive

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.559
force equivalent to more than 15,000 tonnes.

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.800
"Smaller scale events like Tunguska are absolutely
a real risk, largely they are undiscovered

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.719
and so we are unprepared," Bill Napier, professor
of astronomy at the University of Buckinghamshire,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.140
told the Daily Express.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.280
"With something like YB35, we are looking
at a scale of global destruction, something

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.610
that would pose a risk to the continuation
of the planet," he continued.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.540
If an asteroid this big was to hit Earth,
it is possible that plumes and debris thrown

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.430
into the atmosphere would change the climate
and potentially make the planet uninhabitable.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.730
"The real risk is from comets, which even
if the Earth passes through the tail, can

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.710
generate a massive plume of smoke with hugely
significant consequences," Napier said.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.460
NASA has said they expect the YB35 to pass
within about four million kilometres on Friday.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.560
The rock was detected by the Catalina Sky
Survey last year and has been closely watched

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.060
this week.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.840
Astronomers have named June 30 as Asteroid
Day to highlight the dangers of potentially

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.490
dangerous asteroids.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.250
"It just takes one asteroid to completely
destroy life, not just humanity, but all species,"

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.260
said initiative co-founder Grigorij Richters
told the Daily Express.
