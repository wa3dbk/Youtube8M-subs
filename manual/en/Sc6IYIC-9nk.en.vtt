00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.560
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to replace your engines

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.210
timing belt and water pump. In this step we're
going talk about the proper way to install

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.400
your cam shaft sprockets. And what we have
here, are the naked cams here, and here. There's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.269
no sprockets on them. This is a cam shaft
sprocket. As you can see, this says, 2.4 liter

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.650
front, and arrows are pointing up. Now this
sprocket will actually work on a 2 liter too.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.610
For cost cutting measures, Chrysler uses the
same sprocket, just put it on a different

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.000
direction. Make sure to put them on the right
way. It has an alignment pin here, and as

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.590
you can see, there's a dowel here on the bottom.
What you're going to do is, slip on the rear

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:02.700
one. They're a pretty tight machine fit, you're
going to have to wiggle them into position,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.180
just like so. Once you have a wiggled in position,
you can go ahead and slip the bolt in, and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:36.370
run it down, hand tight. Alright. And now
for the next sprocket, make sure you got the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.430
2.4 liter in the upwards direction, our alignment
pin and our alignment hole, I'm going to go

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:56.460
ahead and slip that one on as well,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.210
right there. And go ahead and start our next
bolt, slip it in just like so, and run it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:32.140
down. Now let me use a 10 millimeter socket
on this bolt here, to hold our pulley in position,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:03:26.700
while I tighten down the bolt. Alright, and
right there. You're going to go ahead, and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.010
repeat that exact procedure for the back sprocket
as well. That is the proper service procedure,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.309
for installing your cam shaft sprockets.
