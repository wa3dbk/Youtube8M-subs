Hi, welcome back to Expert Village; how to
make a professional looking video. There are

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.790
a couple of things that we've talked about.
And we left off I believe, the last thing

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.630
we left off with was scripts and storyboards,
and how it makes it easy when you have your

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.109
things scripted and storyboarded for recording
purposes. Now that we're ready to record,

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.890
we have all this knowledge under our belt,
here's one thing I wanted to point out to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.320
you. In camera editing and framing, it's very,
very important. So for example, you see these

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.200
lights behind me, so that we want to demonstrate
framing. And so basically what we did, we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.230
moved the lights in position that best represents
the shot. That's really the thing you have

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.780
to take in consideration when you turn that
camera on. You've heard it before, if there's

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.440
a pole sticking out of somebody's head, move
that person to the left or to the right. In

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.510
this case, to give this depth of the shot,
we moved it and recorded it. So the main thing

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.150
that I want you to do before you start to
turn that camera on, now that you have all

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.030
this knowledge, is remember composition and
framing. Take your time, don't turn the camera

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.700
on and shoot to fast, unless somebody?s paying
you to do that really quickly. But take your

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.700
time, set up the shot. That's why TV and movies
look so great, because they take their time

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.659
and they really, really plan out their shots.
Now that you have that information, turn the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.850
camera on and start recording. But before,
remember one thing, look back at your storyboard,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.660
because in your storyboard, if you have an
establishing shot showing, for example, you're

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.691
going to show somebody walk into a building
and then after they walk into the building,

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.060
you're going to show them go to the front
desk. Keep that in mind and shoot it that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.451
way. But you can actually shoot it in your
camera. So, you have your establishing shot

00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:57.079
of the building outside of the building, you
shoot the person going in; stop the camera.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.900
Then when you pick up the camera again and
shoot that person is now walking into the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.479
building. And then when they walk into the
building to the front desk, you can turn the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.720
camera off, set up your shot, show them entering
into that front desk. And if you do that based

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.110
on your storyboard in a linear fashion, it
goes on tape that way, and guess what, when

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.920
you bring it into the computer you have less
editing to do. It's called "in camera editing".

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.310
There's a lot of techniques that you can look
up on-line, but keep in mind, if you plan

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.981
your shots out, when you record them on tape
it makes it easier when you edit. Basically

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:40.790
the recording process when you get to it is
everything is framed, everything is lit, your

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.330
sound is checked out, you've done your sound
test, everything is ready to go, your actors

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.519
are all in place, and you record. Now that
you've learned everything about how to frame,

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.440
compose and record, well within your camera,
let?s take a look on how to bring all that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.439
stuff into your computer.
