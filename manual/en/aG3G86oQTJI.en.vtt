00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.300
This is the Lindo ZST electric guitar

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.500
The Lindo designed maple headstock is where
you'll find the 6 die-cast chrome machine heads,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.000
chrome strings guides and access to the truss rod for neck adjustment

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500
the maple C-shape neck allows for swift chord changes and a comfortable feel

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.000
and combined with the rosewood fretboard
gives a punchy, plucky sound which then mellows to great sustain

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.500
The gloss black solid body is bass wood which has a solid balanced sound,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
but it is also lightweight making this a great guitar for gigging

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The belly cut at the back along with the contoured top add to the playing comfort

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.000
It comes fitted with 3 single coil pick-ups, 1 in the neck position, 1 in the middle position and 1 at the bridge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which is angled to provide a sharp treble response and balance of tone across the strings

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
There is a 5-way pickup selector switch, and 
1 volume and 2 tone controls

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This combination means that with this guitar you can create an incredible array of sounds that suit all styles of music

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.900
To further enhance the sound abilities there is a chrome tremolo system, allowing you to bend the pitch of the strings by using the whammy bar,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.060
which is also removable

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.000
The 6 individual chrome saddles are fully adjustable allowing you to tailor the set up of your guitar, and set the intonation
