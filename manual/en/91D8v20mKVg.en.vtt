00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.160
This video is brought to you by Sailrite.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.779
in this video were going to make a shower
curtain out of Surlast fabric

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.730
and were also going to use the large curtain
grommets.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.210
Since our current needs to be seventy five
inches high and the materials only sixty inches

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:23.060
were going to add a panel to the top portion
of the curtain here to extend its height

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.230
were going to use a semi flat felled seam
here that's the top stitch and on the bottom

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
side

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.240
this is the underside or the inside of the
shower curtain.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.000
So that is a semi flat felled seam to join
the panel to make extra height.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.980
At the head here were the grommets will be
placed,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.510
we simply cut a strip of material here and
hemmed the edges

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.850
and then sewed it to the top to create reinforcement
for the curtain grommets.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.530
The grommet should be placed in at least a
four inch header and two layers is sufficient

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.450
for reinforcement.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.590
Then on all three of the other edges we will
just create a double hem to complete those.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
These are the curtain grommets and inside
the curtain grommet box

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170
there is a template that you could use to
trace where each one of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.180
these grommets will be placed in your curtain.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.140
Grommets are typically space anywhere from
seven inches to eight inches apart weâ€™ve

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.390
already measured the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.530
top edge of our shower curtain here and now
were using the template to mark each location

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.770
for the cutouts for each one of the curtain
grommets.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.470
Once all the locations are marked then simply
time to cut out the material.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.299
We will use scissors here and just cut a hole
in center and then cut around our traced edge.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.390
Do that for each one of the grommet positions.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.460
Each set of grommets as a prong side and a
raised side.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.380
This is the prongs side or the Teeth side
of the grommet.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.770
The opposite side is the raised side, here.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.549
The raised side goes on the right side of
the fabric so positioned it in to the hole

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.549
that you cut

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.579
then position one of the prong grommets over
the top and then just simply snap in place.

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.469
The curtain grommet is now installed. No special
tools are required!

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.359
Here we are doing it again, we placed the
raised side on the right side of the fabric

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.700
and the prong side on the wrong side of the
fabric and then press firmly until they snap

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.719
and it is installed.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.549
This color of Curtin grommet that were using
today is called brushed silver.

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.019
There are many other colors available at the
Sailrite website. Be sure to check those out

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.459
as well.

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.459
This size grommet will accommodate rods up
to one and three eights inch diameter.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.269
Once the holes were cut out of the head of
your curtain, installation in super fast.

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.919
Here we are showing it in fast forward.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.180
Now that our shower curtain is complete let's
take it to the shower and install it on the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
rod.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.309
Again the curtain grommets will accommodate
rods up to one in three eights inch in diameter.

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.559
There it is complete, looks great!

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.260
These curtain grommets are great for shower
curtains but also great for window treatment

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.260
applications

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.680
where you want to hang a curtain on a head
rod.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.139
I am Eric Grant with Sailrite, thanks for
