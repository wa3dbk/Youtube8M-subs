Hi there! It's time for a domino tutorial.
So, let's just get into this. I'll start placing

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:20.020
dominoes like so and just try to get everything
as accurate as possible. So, if you look closely,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:33.519
you'll have something like this...and put
a little pressure with your thumb like this.

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:44.690
Alright, then you'll place a domino like this
here. And this is what you have made. Doesn't

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.899
seem interesting, but let's just continue
on as if that wasn't underwhelming. So let

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.500
me just start setting up some dominoes here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:42.920
Alrighty, let's
see what this looks like. That's that.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:53.930
Some things you might not know: is that you can
make a couple of these and they can make a

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:07.330
really long chain. That's one there. That's
one there. And let me just get both of them

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:17.349
in shot and this is what two of them look
like. And one final thing you can do with

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:47.299
these. Are turn them ninety degrees. Like
so. Like that. And this is what happens: Alright,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:56.569
I've had a lot of practice with this and I've
developed another tip for making this reliable.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.239
As you can see, the space between the green
and the yellow domino is nothing, and if you

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:13.730
do this, the domino falls, but observe the
little rocking domino here. If I do this,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.269
it moves really high up, especially on the
left side. Also, if you are a little to the

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.999
left here, like if you are not really accurate
and the red domino is more on the green domino,

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:33.930
it will go the wrong way. That was the reason
why I said we should have the gap here, between

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.579
the green and the yellow domino so that it
guarantees that the red domino will go that

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.719
way. There's a problem, though: if you hit
too hard, you cannot guarantee that the red

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:52.249
domino will not turn too much especially after
having a lot of dominoes fall on this. I've

00:03:52.249 --> 00:04:11.859
been working on a large scale of these things
going on and I find that if you can 
separate the green and yellow domino the most,

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:18.069
you'll have a very reliable stunt here. So
if you bring it out all the way like that,

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:29.470
but not too much that the red can keep the
green from touching the bottom here, like

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.610
about this much (about the thickness of a
domino) not less, but exactly the thickness

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:44.190
of a domino. The red domino barely moves,
but it moves just enough that the blue domino

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.919
falls over. In fact, if you watch in slow
motion, it appears that this bob up pretty

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.210
high and this guy stays in place for a few
seconds and in slow motion falls down. Which

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.180
is why I'm going to name this one the fainting
domino, or Fainters. I'm just going to call

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.000
these fainters.
