00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.990
Narrator: Demonstrating the Amazon Kindle
App with VoiceOver on an iPad

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.990
In this short video we'll be looking at the
new accessible Kindle App running on an iPad.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.840
Now the new Kindle App is compatible with
VoiceOver so for people who can't see the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.410
screen VoiceOver can read their eBooks for
them.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.410
I can turn VoiceOver on by tapping the Home
button three times and selecting VoiceOver

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.220
from the menu.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.720
VoiceOver:

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.620
VoiceOver. iBooks. Double tap to open. Landscape.
Home button to the right.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.170
Narrator:

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.360
Now with VoiceOver on I can navigate to the
Kindle App.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.610
VoiceOver:

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.400
Kindle. Double tap to open. Kindle. Search
button.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.730
Narrator:

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.730
A double tap anywhere on screen to open up
the app and that opens up into my bookcase.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.480
Now the very first time that you use the Kindle
App you'll need to register your Kindle Amazon

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.740
account but you only have to do this once
and any books that you've already purchased

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.750
will then be available for immediate download
to your iPad so that you can read them.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.130
Now I'm reading The Wind in the Willows at
the moment so I can use my finger to navigate

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.380
to The Wind in the Willows.
VoiceOver:

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.670
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The Wind
in the Willows. Graham Kenneth. Downloaded.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.469
Double tap to open book. Swipe up or down
to select a custom action.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.560
Narrator:

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.039
A double tap anywhere on screen will open
the book.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.289
VoiceOver:

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.679
Menu off. Double tap for menu. Swipe two fingers
down for continuous reading. Tap. Tap and

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.369
hold to select text.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.219
'Well, well,' said the Rat, 'I suppose we
ought to be moving. I wonder which of us had

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.119
better pack the luncheon basket?' He did not
speak as if he was frightfully eager for the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.380
treat.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.639
Narrator:

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:59.609
A single tap with two fingers will pause the
text to speech. Now you notice that as soon

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.659
as we went into the page VoiceOver started
reading the book from where we left off.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.000
Now a two finger single tap again will resume
reading.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.320
VoiceOver:

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.330
. . . the rat let him. Packing the basket
was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.750
the basket. It never is. But the Mole was
bent on enjoying everything, and although

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.090
just when he had got . . .

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.540
Narrator:

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.830
Now, if I want to start reading from the top
of the page again I just need to do a two

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.380
finger swipe upwards.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.900
VoiceOver:

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.390
'Well, well,' said the Rat, 'I suppose we
ought to be moving. I wonder which of us had

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.300
better pack the luncheon basket?' He did not
speak as if he was frightfully eager for the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.560
treat. 'O, please let me,'

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.090
Narrator:

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.880
And a two finger tap again pauses.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.880
Now, if I use two fingers to rotate on the
screen I can bring up the rotor which enables

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
us to select Words, Characters.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.350
Now I've selected Words.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.740
VoiceOver:

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.910
Lines. Headings. Words.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.310
Narrator:

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.850
Start at the top of the screen again.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.260
VoiceOver:

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.010
'Well, well,' said the Rat,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.750
Narrator:

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.120
Using a single finger swiping downwards I
can read word by word.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
VoiceOver:

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.140
Well. Well. Said. The. Rat.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.150
Narrator:

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.680
A double tap on the screen will bring up the
menu.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.500
VoiceOver:

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.840
Menu on. Return to book.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.260
Narrator:

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.930
By swiping from right to left I can move through
the menu options at the top of the page.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.250
VoiceOver:

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.130
The Wind in the Willows. Search button. Go
to button.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.730
Narrator:

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.340
Now I want to navigate to a particular page
so I'm going to double tap to select the Go

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.070
to menu.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.380
VoiceOver:

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.340
Go to. Heading.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.770
Narrator:

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.770
And by swiping with a single finger from left
to right I can navigate down to page.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.120
VoiceOver:

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.640
Cover. Beginning. Page.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.150
Narrator:

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.900
A double tap will select.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.710
VoiceOver:

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.070
Alert. Comma. Text field is editing. Character
mode. Enter value for page.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.640
Narrator:

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.250
I can put in the page number I want to navigate
to.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.930
VoiceOver:

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.600
Six.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.310
Narrator:
Double tap selects.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.990
VoiceOver:

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.670
Seven.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.340
Narrator:

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.160
And if I select ok.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.780
VoiceOver:

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.019
Ok. Button.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:16.639
Narrator:

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.989
And double tap. We go immediately to page
67.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.660
VoiceOver:

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.569
. . . down, a mere blank transparency on the
night, that the sense of home and the little

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.419
curtained world within walls -- the larger
stressful world of outside Nature shut out

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.539
and forgotten -- most . . .

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.090
Narrator:

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.689
As before, as soon as we navigated to the
page VoiceOver started reading immediately

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:38.620
from the top.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.969
Now, I'm going to bring the menu up again
with a double tap.

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:42.229
VoiceOver:

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:42.969
Menu on.

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:43.460
Narrator:

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.129
And navigate back to home.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.990
VoiceOver:

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.340
Home. Button. Search button.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.590
Narrator:

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.490
And that takes us back to our bookshelf.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.770
Now that's just a very brief look at the accessible
Kindle App working with Voiceover.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.659
The app will also work with a braille display
and even if text to speech has been turned

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:09.590
off in any of the books that you've purchased
that won't matter if you are using the accessible

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.189
Kindle App, it will actually read them.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:19.189
I hope you found this very short video useful.
