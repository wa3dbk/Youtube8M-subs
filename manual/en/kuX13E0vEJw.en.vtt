It's Karen. And this week, I want to talk
to you about how I come up with ideas. To

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:23.200
be inspired by the angels, you can look around you and you can see your signs and they can

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.700
be inspiration but I've made over a hundred
videos for you already and sometimes I go,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.470
"What am I going to talk about?"

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:42.700
And so, this time was exactly that situation.
And I sat down here and I closed my eyes and

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.220
I began to breathe. When you're in a situation where you have to make a decision and you

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:59.900
don't know what to do, that is the absolute
perfect time to close your eyes, to breathe,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.329
and to go inside for your guidance. And that's what I did.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:22.700
You know what? I just - do that three times and it just brings you to a place of peace. And then instead of focusing

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.200
my eye or when I close my eyes, my focus on the television screen here which is what I

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.649
do when I'm going to get symbols and signs from the angels.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:48.700
Go down here. Close your eyes and focus down on your heart. And then keep breathing. Breathing

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.619
is so important when you're connecting with spirit and getting your guidance from your

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:03.000
angels. It is like the blood flow. You need
to be breathing. Don't hold your breathe.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.539
I don't know how to emphasize that enough. I used to hold my breath.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:20.500
And so, just breathe. Close your eyes and
see just what comes to pass in your mind by

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:28.100
focusing on your heart. And in this way, the
inspiration is coming from your heart, from

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.959
love, from the angels, from God, not from
up here.

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.700
And so, my message from the angels on what to do as my video for this week was to explain

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.200
to you how I go inside to get inspiration
when I'm not quite sure on a decision.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:01.500
And so, I hope you are inspired to do the
same process this week. Just stop and pause

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.400
no matter where you are, whether you're at
home, at work, driving a car, just stopping

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.200
and pausing and breathing and putting your attention in your heart will help you find

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.920
the answers that you're looking for.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.800
Have a wonderful week. And if you like this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.870

you do. Bye.
