00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:22.509
I don’t even know what to call this game.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.329
I mean, the title is Clash of Elementalists,
but...I guess I just don’t know how to describe

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.329
it.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:30.439
I mean, obviously, it’s a fighter.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.609
But it’s a fighter where the characters
are all these really, really ridiculously

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.329
good-looking male models.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.059
‘Cause I got news for you.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.510
None of them can turn left.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.440
Anyway, call it what you will.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.960
But Clash of Elementalists just released for
both the Nintendo 3DS and DSi.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.589
You can find it in the eShop and on DSiWare.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.030
And again, it’s a fighting game, but...it’s
kind of a strange one.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.310
In fact, it feels like something I would’ve
played on the Nintendo 64.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.070
Both in a good way and a bad way.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.619
So Clash of Elementalists puts you in the
middle of a, uh...a clash of elementalists.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.530
Actually, it’s more of a dispute than anything
else, ‘cause there’s only freaking four

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
of them.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.560
Anyway, each elementalist is an anime girl...funny
how that works out.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.869
And of course, each one uses a different element.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.189
Either fire, earth, air or water.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.790
A good camera is not an element, so...no one
uses one of those.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.610
And the 
weird thing for me is that...I mean, this

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.860
is a 3D fighter.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.820
The fights take place in these open arenas...but
you don’t really have control of the camera.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.290
In fact, the camera doesn’t move at all.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.700
It’s not automatic, it doesn’t follow
your opponent...the only way to focus on your

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.250
target is to do it manually, by pushing a
button.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.719
Then they move again.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:10.009
So you get into this clunky rhythm that, again,
feels like something from the N64 era.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.700
Constantly positioning the camera before doing
anything else.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.000
It’s been almost 20 years since games went
3D—being able to see these three-dimensional

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.420
worlds should not be a problem anymore.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.510
Fortunately, that N64 feel is also part of
the charm.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.739
See, this is actually a really simple fighter.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.231
You have two attacks, you can combine them
for a more powerful attack...it’s a real

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.730
throwback to older fighting games.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.030
Simple approach, but with a bit of strategy,
as well.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.849
Using the right attacks at the right time
is crucial, as is managing your attack power,

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.019
which drains with each flurry of offense.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.590
But you know, the fun this game offers is
almost in spite of itself.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.840
I mean, the camera is only the beginning.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.629
Even the controls are just really weird.

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.380
A, B and Y are used sparsely, if at all, and
yet you attack with the shoulder buttons.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.150
On the one hand, this is a five-dollar downloadable
fighter with an old-school feel.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.569
On the other, a low price doesn’t excuse
the bad design decisions.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.370
Clash of Elementalists isn’t a bad game
at all, but its awkward controls and camera

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.629
do everything they can to convince you otherwise.
