00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.290
Hello Boys and Girls

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.530
This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.870
called "The Lost Sheep"

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.060
Today's Memory Verse is from Matthew 28:20

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.840
The message for today's story is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.110
Have you ever been in a store or at a park,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.080
and when you looked up you couldn’t see your parents?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.080
Did you feel lost?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.680
Did you cry?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.030
You probably felt like the sheep in a story Jesus once told.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.260
Once a shepherd owned 100 sheep.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
He took good care of his sheep.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.300
Every day he led them to green, grassy fields

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.300
where they could find plenty to eat.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
Every day he took them to clear, cool water

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500
where they could get enough to drink.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.910
Every day he chased away wild animals that might hurt his sheep.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.520
And every night he led them to a safe place.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.030
Before he went to bed the shepherd counted his sheep to make sure they were all there.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.040
One

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.580
Two

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.270
Three

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.540
Forty-five

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.980
Forty-six

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.190
Forty-seven

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.680
Seventy-two

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.000
Seventy-three

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.490
Seventy-four

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.020
Ninety-eight

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.510
Ninety-nine

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.510
One hundred

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.290
The shepherd counted hjs sheep each night because he loved his sheep,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.050
and the sheep felt safe in the shepherd's care.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.860
[Sheep bleating] 
But one night when the shepherd counted his sheep

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.410
A look of worry came over his face

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.150
Something wasn't right

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
He counted again

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.520
Ninety-seven... ninety-eight... ninety-nine...

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.800
And he counted one more time to be sure

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.110
Ninety-seven... ninety-eight... ninety-nine...

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.380
Something was definitely wrong

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.380
One of his sheep was missing

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.740
The shepherd didn’t stop to think about how hungry he was.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.230
He didn’t worry about his sore feet.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.820
He didn’t say,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.150
“I’ll go look for that lost sheep tomorrow,"

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.650
"When it’s not so dark, and
when I’m not tired.”

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.240
He didn’t say,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.620
“I still have 99 sheep here."

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.480
I don’t really need the one that’s missing.”

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.480
Not at all!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.040
The shepherd loved every one of his sheep,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.950
So he stopped everything he was doing

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.440
to look for the sheep that was lost

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.520
Looking for a lost sheep at night isn’t easy.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.740
The shepherd bumped into rocks.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.640
Ouch!

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.670
He scratched himself on prickly bushes.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.670
Ooh!

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.710
But far away he could hear the sound of a frightened sheep crying.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.080
Baa!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.460
Baa!

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.850
The poor sheep knew it was lost.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.090
It knew it wouldn’t be safe until it was back with the shepherd.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.370
The shepherd followed the sound.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.800
Baa! Baa!

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.090
He could tell he was getting closer and closer.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.580
And then, by the light of the moon,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.280
he could see his sheep caught in a thorny bush.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.300
Gently the shepherd pulled apart the bush.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.220
He didn’t care about the prickles that poked and scratched his hands.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.260
He just wanted to set his sheep free so he could take it safely home.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.010
And then, once it was free,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.940
the shepherd gently put the sheep over his shoulders and carried it home.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.860
The sheep was heavy, but the shepherd didn’t mind.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.510
He was happy he had found his sheep.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.510
And the sheep was happy too.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.870
It knew it was safe again now that the shepherd had found it.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.580
Jesus is our shepherd and we are His sheep.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.800
He loves every person.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.090
And He wants us to be kind to every person too.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.700
He will take good care of us just as the shepherd took good care of his sheep.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.290
And someday

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.220
Jesus will come and take us home to heaven
