Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial
Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.390
This is a staple drill at least in my training
it is. This is where we take the side kick

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.240
and we drill the body shield with it. Before
we do it here is a key point. Remember the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.199
side kick comes straight in. And we are going
to go right into the target. Here is the challenge,

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.699
from my guarding stance which is kind of like
a three quarter turn. In order to throw a

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.599
side kick I have got to really turn the body.
That can be a telegraph and if you are my

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.410
opponent and I say move and move and now I
am going to hit you with a side kick you kind

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.570
of can see it coming. So I'm going to make
sure I hide that step and we are going to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.190
hide that step by throwing a jab in your face.
Now notice when I distract you with this jab

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.730
look what happened to that foot. It went sideways
and I'm almost in a side horse stance to allow

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.990
me to come in with a really good side kick.
So when I do side kick on the target I typically

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.440
a jab side kick. Let's take a look at it.
Joining me from Pro Star Mixed Martial Arts

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.090
is Mr. Joe Brignoli. Take a step back here.
Alright here we go. Jab side kick. Right now

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.359
I cannot reach the target. I have to step.
I always want to make sure I have good footwork

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.749
going in. I am going to step and jab, turning
the foot sideways which lines me up then to

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:21.430
come in, tight fold, and fire the side kick
directly in. Let's take a look again. He is

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.020
holding it into his body, he is at a good
stable fighting stance and he is going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.930
breathe out every time he gets hit so he doesn't
get the wind knocked out of him. I will do

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.079
about five and we'll just increase the speed
each time. Jab, side kick digging that heel

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:46.969
in, digging that heel in.
Common mistakes are starting too far away.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:54.929
This makes the kick more of a long pushing
motion. The closer you are the more explosive

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.899
you have to be, the closer you are the tighter
you have to fold that knee up. So I like to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.969
move in a little bit tighter each time to
make it harder for myself to force me to pull

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:17.370
tight and to force me to explode.
I'm always moving so I don't want to just

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.341
stand here and kick. I'm moving and moving
and driving that heel straight in. That is

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.220
side kick on the shield. I'm John Graden.
Thank you.
