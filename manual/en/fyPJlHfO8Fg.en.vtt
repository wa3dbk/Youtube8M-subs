00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.030
Appearing at the Toy Fair for the
second time is Tonkin Replicas

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
so let's find out a bit more about the
company.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100
Tonkin group of companies

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.820
has three primary companies Tonkin
Replicas Inc in Seattle Washington

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.670
which I own 100% of,  we have TRIMs or Tonkin

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.930
in Cantonese which was Tonkin Replicas
Incorporated Manufacturing Services

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.799
that's owned 50% by myself and 50%
by my wife who is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.360
Hong Kong Chinese and we have Tonkin
Replicas Europe which is owned

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.130
50% by Tonkin Replicas Inc

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.200
and 50 percent by IMC

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.700
which is run by Joep Hansen.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.740
And how does Tonkin look
back over 2014?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.910
2014 was all about integration of

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.030
what we're doing.  We have between the
three companies

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.430
six different mother languages and we've
taken on quite a few

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.820
new OEMS - Caterpillar being the
largest in global distribution but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
Kobelco and Link-Belt and Terex

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.560
also being in there so we spend most of our
time smoothing out our

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.740
international supply chain and finishing
a lot of our

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.990
products that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.630
we had started but also preparing for
what is upcoming

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.520
for Caterpillar for next year and other
large OEMs such as

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.590
Terex and Kobelco etc.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.609
For Caterpillar we are targeting working with
only the best companies such as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:05.359
Caterpillar,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.759
but when we build with Caterpillar or a
company like Caterpillar

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.510
our goal is to build everything that they
have

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.220
when we get the opportunity to and if
we're allowed to.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.519
In order to do that in diecast you
required,  you have to build inside of groups.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.090
It is the only efficient way to build in a
diecast

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.580
model when you're building in massive quantities of new tooling.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.950
That's why the collectors have to be a
little bit patient with us because

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.010
in groups we start out with a lot of wheel
loaders, and everybody says Tonkin is doing a lot of wheel loaders.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.810
Be patient, we have done all the wheel loaders
that Cat will allow us to do

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.530
and we will move forward to another group 
in this year and we can't talk quite yet

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.069
about what that group is but

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.900
every year we will be moving into a
different group until we finish every

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.470
piece of equipment that Caterpillar has

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.209
that we are allowed to build by Caterpillar.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.220
The Caterpillar 568 forestry models were on
display

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.300
and the 555 Wheel Skidder was announced.
Also looking good were the new wheel

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.910
scrapers so how does Tonkin work with
an OEM such as Caterpillar.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.720
With all of the OEMs the first
thing that we need establish is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.890
what their standards are.  They are not our
standards we are building to the OEM

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.470
standards.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.300
Nooteboom is a good example, they have very
demanding standards

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.000
because of the way that they pitch the
product.  Quality and detail is very

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.720
important to them.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.160
For companies such as Caterpillar you
cannot just build anything you want in Caterpillar.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.060
Caterpillar has the final say

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.349
as to what gets built and they also

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.200
ask licensees to build within a certain
price point

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.160
depending on the model of course they have
everything from a small excavator up to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.170
global mining but

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.269
there they don't want the models to be

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.760
too expensive for a main line licensee

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.379
and they don't want them to be toy
quality either so there requesting that

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.110
you build within a certain price point.
Most OEMs have certain standards

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.680
and expectations that they're
looking to build and each one is a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.440
little bit unique.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.830
Tonkin is moving both fast and heavily
to expand its range

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.819
so how does it react to feedback on its
models?

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.860
With the exception of the trucks
we've had the construction

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.200
licenses for a fairly short period
of time so

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.819
with any licensee
that you're bringing on it

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.450
is important to build and develop
what their standards are,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.620
and you're always improving what
you're doing.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.100
It's important to continue to get better
and better and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.169
to refine the processes as you go.  We absolutely
listen to a lot of

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.860
collector feedback and we love the
reviews on Cranes Etc

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.820
and we made some changes to a few of our models based on those reviews.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.710
It takes us a long time to see the changes
in the market due to tooling changes, then it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.690
goes through packaging then

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.310
approval. Caterpillar might have three
or four levels of approval

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.630
before it gets the market but we will

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.050
absolutely take that into account and if
people are patient

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.370
they can see 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.470
improvements come along based on their
own comments.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.570
Of course Tonkin has had a long history of
making US trucks

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.320
but they are in 1:53 scale rather than the 1:50
scale that's common

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.680
for construction and European trucks.  So are
there any plans to change this?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.450
In the US we tackled a number of
scales will 1:87, 1:64, 1:53 and then later

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.100
1:30 and we started

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.080
though originally with 1:53 mostly
because when Jack Tonkin started

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.710
out making diecast models

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.180
there was no one else really building
scale model trucks and he decided he wanted

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.250
the model about this big,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.720
and about this big, which engineers
took literally, was 1:53 scale and

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.100
we've we built out since then over
decades

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.080
a large truck line that is based on 1:53.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.370
The other scales we have either acquired or
taken on through partnerships

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.720
over time and the 1:30 scale trucks that we
started were actually

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.620
requested by Mark Piggott - he was the CEO of

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.860
Paccar at the time because that's what he
wanted.  He was an industrial design

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.890
engineer at Stanford

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.210
he's a guy that knows what he wants in
terms of quality and size and

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.920
standards, and as the customer the customer has the ultimate say.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.070
It will be in interesting choice for us
coming up because

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.240
with Caterpillar their primary scale is
1:50,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.740
our partnership with Tekno with the
European cabs,

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.789
and the 1:50 trailers we are building
ourselves

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.150
are in 1:50.  Kobelco and Link-Belt are in

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.400
1:50 and so we have some interesting
decisions to make in

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.580
terms of how we continue to integrate
which we are a big believer in.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.039
Integrating - our goal as company is to make
sure that we can service

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.069
international customers anywhere in the
globe. To do that

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.259
you're better off standardizing

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.379
what you're doing so we have some
careful decisions to make as to how to

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.999
do that

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:55.069
and what to do in that regard.  Those
details haven't been

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.060
set - we might need to check back
on that

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.160
at the next Nuremberg Show!

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.190
And finally looking forward to 2015 and
beyond

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.949
what will Tonkin's focus be?

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.240
I think what we're trying to do as a
company is it is important for us as the

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.729
globe is getting smaller and smaller, to be
able to service the

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:19.009
international companies, the
international OEMs

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.580
such as Caterpillar that have a global
presence. They're not just in Europe and

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.770
not just in the US and not just in

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.099
Asia.   I think we are the only
company that has

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:30.800
a large facility in North America,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.810
in Europe and in Asia, where we can
do our own engineering and we can

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.439
distribute worldwide.  The kind of
customers that we are targeting

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:42.009
are those global companies.

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.370
New for next year we we have Terex, we have Link-Belt products coming,

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.330
we have some Kobelco,  and we
recently signed a license with Manitowoc.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.229
So Tonkin Replicas is certainly signed
up with some big names.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.610
Two Nooteboom ballast carriers are in the
works as is another trailer

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.319
and the MCO-PX trailers are now finish.
Also coming a couple of Terex cranes

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.629
although you can be sure they won't
appear in these jazzy colour schemes!
