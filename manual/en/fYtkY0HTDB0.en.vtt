00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
AAAAAAAAAAA!!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
AAAAAAAAAAA!!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Well done, Abhi. You are indeed your father’s son. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Grand-uncle Shalya.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That you dare speak my father’s name with your treacherous tongue

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
shows your true nature, snake!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
once you drank wine in King Yudish’s great hall;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
now you hold his brother in chains.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You are nothing but Duryodhana’s pet now.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What I am is a man of my word.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I am a man of honor!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I AM A WARRIOR!

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.110
What you are, Grand-Uncle,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is a FOOL; tricked… into fighting your own kin.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
How are you doing this…?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And my Uncle Bhima always taught me…

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
…We Pandavas do not suffer fools!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
BHIMA THE INVINCIBLE WILL NEVER BE CHAINED!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND MY THIRST FOR VENGEANCE SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED ON THIS DAY!
