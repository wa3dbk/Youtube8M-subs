00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.500
This episode of Tekzilla is brought to you
by T-Mobile.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.920
We received an email from Rick, who asked:
‘a friend recently asked me to help remove

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.410
data from a failed drive before he returned
it to the manufacturer.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.710
Normally, I would let DBAN chew on the drive
for a few days, but in this case, the drive

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.360
would not even spin.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.030
Since the physical drive still needs to be
returned I sandwiched the drive between two

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.690
huge magnets for several days.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.270
Since it doesn’t function, I have no way
of knowing how effective that was.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.140
Other than physical destruction, do you have
any suggestions on how to ensure data has

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.630
been removed from a non working drive?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.950
Any insights would be appreciated.’

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.500
Signed Rick from Snoqualmie, WA

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.890
Hey, I just want to make sure that you did
check this drive in another machine, to make

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.200
sure this drive is dead and not say, the mother
board, the ???? port or power supply connected

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.760
to the drive… just saying.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.540
And if you did, the drive is dead and you’re
probably safe.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.240
Here’s the thing… degaussing is about
the only non-invasive way to erase data from

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.240
a dead drive.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.422
Strapping a magnet to it is probably a bad
idea, ok?

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.720
I just wouldn’t trust it.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.530
There’s layers to this.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.170
First of all, you should be doing the movement
over the platter area, to try to, basically,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.320
what you are trying to do is confuse the heck
out of the magnetic information on the platter.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.960
And just doing it right here may not do it,
unless it’s a giant magnet.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.990
There is this awesome website, if you suddenly
decided you need serious magnets… kjmagnetics.com

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.370
is an amazing website.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.030
And it’s like, I would like to erase hard
drives from degaus tapes, which magnet should

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.170
I use?

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.850
Magnetic tapes can be erased with a strong
magnet; we used to think a sufficiently strong,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.450
large magnet would scramble the data on a
hard drive.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.810
Some recent experiments we’ve conducted
seem to disagree.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.009
See our blog article on the subject for more
details we don’t recommend this method if

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.439
you must be sure the data is gone, physical
destruction of the drive is the safest choice.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.289
And kjmangetics, they sell really neat magnets,
they sell the kind of magnets that you probably

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.360
shouldn’t be, people like you and I should
not be allowed.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.650
Remember Fight Club, there is that sequence
where they are running through the video store.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.000
It is kind of like, they did a whole thing
where they pulled our some really massive

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.579
magnets, they have implanted medical devices,
be careful.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.719
That’s all I’m saying.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.730
It will rip your pacemaker out of your chest;
don’t mess with your grand parents this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.730
way.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.700
Don’t be pinning things to your pins in
your legs.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.829
Here’s the thing, they basically are no
longer fans of degaussing for magnets, and

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:36.900
they took some pretty huge magnets.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.730
I know they are over the top dedicated degaussing
stations that should work but modern hard

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.810
drives are a lot harder to screw up with magnets
than older models, even if you are talking

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.349
about stuff like, check this out, the surface
field 4667 gauss, they were playing around

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.980
with some really big magnets.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.359
Actually, if you want to have some, with kjmagnetics,
awesome website, magnets so strong that if

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.840
you get your fingers between it and the magnet
and it slams down onto the metal bar, I’ve

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.019
seen magnets so powerful they cannot be shipped
by plane and they come in a crazy, like giant

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.120
case to keep them from permanently attaching
themselves to delivery vehicles.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.079
Seriously, if the drive is dead, your friend’s
data is probably safe.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.659
Just make sure it is dead and degaussing,
at least degaussing with magnets you have

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.670
in your house is probably off the list.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.049
I agree.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.120
Got an email question from Ethan, he writes
in: ‘Hello Tekzilla team!

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.510
I’m in need of a basic audio recording program
that will work on Windows XP and 7.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.029
I’d be recording mostly from a microphone
and ‘stereo mix.’

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.699
Do you know of anything free out there that
does the job?

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.019
Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazingly-terrific
extra-outstanding totally-awesome work!

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.349
Awesome, nice compliment.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.239
Doesn’t Windows already have a sound recorder
out?

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.099
Actually for a joke I went and looked and
yeah, it is still there.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.099
That’s funny.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.620
It is incredibly basic, amazingly basic we’ll
say.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.639
And then I immediately turn and think of what’s
my favorite free app out there for audio editing

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.430
and I’d say look no further than Audacity.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.600
Basically it supports a variety of recording
types, format output, conversions, editing,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.070
multi-track so you can do your stereo sound
recording and it’s just a nice tool, if

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.800
you’ve never messed with it.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.100
I use Audacity quite a bit to create my own
ring tones.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.210
If I’ve got a piece of audio and you want
to clip out a part of it and create, basically

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.660
output that as a ring tone.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.930
Style file, it’s about as easy a program
to use.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.740
If you can do any type of time line editing,
if you are familiar with that kind of editing

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.819
at all, you’re going to feel real at home
using this program.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.849
It is pretty cool.

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.770
It is one of those apps that I can’t believe
is a free app and I just love it so much.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.510
I wish there was a video editing app of similar
quality that would be as affordable, let’s

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.580
just say.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.150
If your hardware will support it, it will
record up to 16 tracks at a time.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.100
It is a pretty slick tool for free, check
it out audacity.sourceforge.net. and if you

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.700
want a great laugh, just go into Windows 7
and type in “sound recorder”, hit enter

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.840
and look at the app pop up, and look at the
incredible array of options you will have,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.300
what you can do with that program.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.689
Its funny, I got a good laugh out of it, it’s
ridiculously simple.

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.349
Hey, if you guys are doing something sound
wise, as far as recording in other apps besides

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.270
Audacity, let us know what it is you are using
and how you are using it.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.130
Drop us an email at tekzilla@revision3.com
, tweet us or drop us a note in our wonderful

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:47.539
forum, either Tekzille or HD Nation, we’ve
got two forums, no waiting.

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.280
More Tekzille coming right up but before we
do that, we’ve got to thank one of our sponsors,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280
Square Space.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
(I think they meant to say T-mobile)

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.099
T-mobiles 4G’s Hotspot is pretty slick,
if you’ve got one you can share the power

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.620
of America’s largest 4G network.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.139
Connect up to five high wi-fi enabled devices
to your internet for only $19.99 a month,

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.139
overage free.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.330
What does that mean?

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.860
You can’t run out of data, you’re not
going to get any surprise charges on your

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.990
bill, you can share high speed internet with
up to five wi-fi devices, such as laptops,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.219
tablets like the iPad music player, portable
gaming devices and more for only $19.99 a

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.080
month and that is overage free.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.700
So check out T-mobiles 4G mobile hotspot and
get blazing fast speeds on America’s largest

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.479
4G network, with no surprise fees.

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:37.120
I like it.
