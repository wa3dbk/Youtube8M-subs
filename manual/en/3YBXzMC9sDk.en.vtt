00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:20.533
I have a very deep affection towards this bust of a man

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:27.100
who looks at you with a quiet, focused gaze, and kind of smile

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.533
which radiates an ironic feeling.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.233
When the Metropolitan was lucky enough to get it in

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.200
1996 it was really a challenge

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.400
to find out who the sitter is.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
Itâ€™s a great mystery:

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.133
who he is, who made it.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.967
The wig and the armor are a clue.

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:54.000
The wig is very typically for the late seventeenth century.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
And if we look closer at the armory,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.567
it tells us a whole story

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.967
in details.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:07.133
The armory shows you Alexander the Great. And names came up.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:13.000
A colleague pointed me to a portrait of Alexander Menshikov,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
picked by Peter the Great to be the general field marshal

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.266
of all the Russians, in 1703.

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.333
He was very well known

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.467
for his ostentatious behavior.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.900
When Catherine I took over

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.867
he virtually ran the country. After the death

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.767
of Catherine he was sent to Siberia

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:40.000
The aristocracy tried to eliminate

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.100
his memory. There are only less than a dozen portraits.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.734
We know from descriptions that Alexander Menshikov had a very high forehead, very gazing,

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:54.433
strong eyes,

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:59.767
and especially these thin lips. The whole pictorial program

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.334
is so thought through.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:05.367
It must have been a collaboration

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:06.900
of the patron

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.300
together with the artist

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.734
to create a monument

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:15.166
that would last. The artist was able to

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.567
capture in wood, the personality

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:20.634
of the sitter.

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:23.667
Even if we canâ€™t name the artist,

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:27.333
this is the beginning. Now we have all the time in

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:31.233
the world to find out the rest.
