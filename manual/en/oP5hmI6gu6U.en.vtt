00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:05.649
(upbeat music)

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:15.732
- Hi there.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.392
Today we're talking about
one of the most inexpensive

00:00:18.392 --> 00:00:21.745
plant-based protein foods around, beans.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:23.980
More specifically, I'll be showing you how

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.642
to prepare dried beans in the kitchen.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:29.463
Now, canned beans are a good pantry staple

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.880
to have on hand, but there are actually

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.010
a lot of benefits to cooking
up your own dried beans.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.961
Such as one, they are one
of the most inexpensive

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.683
proteins you can buy at pennies per pound.

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:43.162
And two, by cooking your own beans,

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.540
you can help control
the sodium in your diet,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.095
as most canned beans have a
fair amount of added salt,

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:52.868
unless you look for low sodium
or no salt added varieties

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:55.245
which can help reduce the sodium.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:58.922
You may have heard the
word legumes before.

00:00:58.922 --> 00:01:00.447
So just to clarify,

00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:03.148
legumes are a group of
vegetables that include beans,

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:06.501
as well as peas, as in black eyed peas,

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.797
split peas, and lentils.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:10.401
But for the rest of this video

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:13.103
I'm referring to beans like black beans,

00:01:13.103 --> 00:01:16.172
pintos, kidney beans, white, garbanzo,

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:20.032
or chickpeas, navy, and pink beans.

00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:22.551
So, why are beans any way?

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:25.385
Beans are actually a rare protein source,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.114
naturally low in fat, they
have no saturated fat,

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:30.413
and no cholesterol.

00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:33.379
Compared to meat, poultry, fish, dairy,

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.123
and eggs, which do contain saturated fat

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:37.403
and cholesterol.

00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:38.724
And because they are plants,

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.344
beans are considered both a vegetable,

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:44.291
and protein source, when
it comes to food groups.

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:47.745
Now, a one half cup
serving of cooked beans,

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:51.056
peas, or lentils, can
replace a two ounce serving

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:54.712
of meat, poultry, or fish
when it comes to protein.

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:56.195
So a great budget tip

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.452
is to eat more meatless meals.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.645
Eating one, or two meatless meals a week,

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:03.165
featuring plant based foods, like beans,

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.720
fiber rich whole grains,
fruits, and vegetables,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.954
is less expensive than having meat,

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.413
or poultry, at every meal.

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:14.583
Okay, so let's cook up some beans.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:18.037
Now one pound, or two cups of dried beans,

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.291
makes about six cups of cooked beans

00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.527
which is the equivalent of four cans

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:24.010
of canned beans.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.216
So here I have two cups of
dried pinto beans to cook.

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:31.162
First, I'm going to rinse them
in the colander in the sink

00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:32.828
and then check for any inedible bits,

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:36.125
like small stones, or pebbles.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.228
Let's do that really quick.

00:02:39.228 --> 00:02:41.686
We'll rinse them.

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:44.862
And then we're gonna look for the stones.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:46.480
There we go.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.228
To see if we can find any.

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:51.215
Beans often grow in rocky and sandy soil,

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:52.860
so that's why you might find a few

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.525
of these little stones.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.863
So before we cook the beans

00:02:56.863 --> 00:02:58.773
we need to soak the beans.

00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:00.662
Soaking beans helps soften them

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:01.494
and helps to decrease the

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:03.080
hard to digest sugars

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.640
which can cause stomach
discomfort and gas.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.286
So we definitely don't want to skip

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:09.723
this important step.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:12.548
Now, there are two ways to soak the beans.

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:13.807
The long soak method,

00:03:13.807 --> 00:03:15.290
and the quick soak method,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.586
which I'm going to show you today.

00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:18.865
Just a review.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.304
The long soak way, you would put the beans

00:03:21.304 --> 00:03:24.027
in a container with
three times as much water

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:25.246
as the beans.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.912
Cover, and soak them for

00:03:26.912 --> 00:03:29.918
eight to 12 hours at room temperature.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.543
Then you drain them,

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:32.844
rinse with cold water,

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:35.668
and put in a pot with
fresh water for cooking.

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:37.172
Soaking the beans overnight

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.265
is a great timesaver.

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.417
Just remember to plan ahead.

00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.266
Now, the quick soak method

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:44.749
takes much less time.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.086
An hour, compared to a day of soaking.

00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:49.971
But requires a little extra work from you.

00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:53.181
So I'm going to put my
two cups of dried beans

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:56.844
in this large pot of water right here.

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.400
It has 10 cups of water already.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:03.239
There we go.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.891
Okay, now they're on the stove

00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.250
and I'm going to turn this on high.

00:04:12.624 --> 00:04:14.307
There we go.

00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:15.344
The rule here is to use

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:16.401
five cups of water

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:18.391
for every one cup of beans.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.561
Okay, now that I have it on the stove

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.592
I'm gonna bring this to a boil, okay?

00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:25.036
Three minutes has gone by

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:28.306
and now I'm going to cover my beans

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.739
and turn this off.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.218
Remove them from the stove.

00:04:34.218 --> 00:04:36.026
And let them sit and soak

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.428
for about an hour.

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:40.192
Then we'll be ready to cook up our beans.

00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:42.264
So it's been about an hour

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.478
and you can see a lot of foamy stuff

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:46.205
on top of the beans.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.729
We're going to get rid of all that

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.308
by draining the beans into
my colander, like this.

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.154
Let's just be careful not to splash.

00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:01.409
Get them all out in here.

00:05:01.646 --> 00:05:03.536
There you go.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.791
Because then we are going to

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:07.539
rinse out the pot,

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.165
because we'll need it again.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:13.416
Let me do that very quickly here.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.764
All the foamy stuff out.

00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:19.241
Very well.

00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.943
Okay, and now I'm going to

00:05:21.943 --> 00:05:24.651
add in the beans back in.

00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:27.124
Like that.

00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:29.927
And I'm going to add water to the beans.

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:33.016
We need enough to cover them

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.312
for about two inches

00:05:35.312 --> 00:05:39.131
above the level of the beans.

00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:40.412
Here we go.

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:44.298
Now the pot goes onto the stove.

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:49.256
And I'll bring the stove
back up onto high heat.

00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:50.894
Okay.

00:05:50.894 --> 00:05:53.292
We're going to let these
boil over high heat,

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:56.278
and if you'd like, you
can skim any extra foam

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:58.433
that rises to the top here

00:05:58.433 --> 00:06:01.893
with a spoon, or a
slotted spoon, like this.

00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:04.716
There we go.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:07.900
Very well.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.350
Okay.

00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:10.664
Now that these are,

00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:12.451
they're at a full boil,

00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:15.234
I'm going to reduce
the heat to low, cover,

00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:18.674
and let them simmer for about an hour.

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.975
I'll occasionally check the water level,

00:06:22.975 --> 00:06:24.275
and if it gets too low,

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:26.755
meaning if it's not
fully covering the beans,

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:28.745
I'll add more in.

00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:31.204
Now cooking times can be
a little bit different

00:06:31.204 --> 00:06:33.907
depending on the type,
and age of the beans.

00:06:33.907 --> 00:06:36.304
But generally it takes about an hour.

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:39.411
To test for doneness, just taste a bean

00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.215
and see if it tastes soft
enough to your liking.

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:44.268
If you're cooking beans
to be used in soups,

00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:45.731
you will want them to be tender,

00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:47.275
but not too soft.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:48.513
If you're cooking beans to be used

00:06:48.513 --> 00:06:50.687
for bean dips, or hummus,

00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.716
you'll want them to be fairly soft.

00:06:53.716 --> 00:06:56.560
So here are my fully cooked beans.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.531
Don't they look great?

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.115
Now, to store cooked beans

00:07:00.115 --> 00:07:01.721
that you're going to use within a week,

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.326
put them in a sealed container

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:04.849
in the refrigerator.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:05.945
They'll stay fresh for about

00:07:05.945 --> 00:07:07.369
three to four days.

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:08.811
You can also freeze beans in a

00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:10.659
sealed plastic container

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:13.300
and keep up to three
months in the freezer.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.841
If you have leftover dried beans

00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:17.303
that you haven't cooked yet,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.356
keep them in an airtight container,

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:20.371
like this one,

00:07:20.371 --> 00:07:22.443
and store in cool dry places.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:24.840
They last about a year in your pantry.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.873
So now I encourage you to

00:07:26.873 --> 00:07:27.969
go buy a bag of your

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.494
favorite type of dried beans

00:07:29.494 --> 00:07:31.201
and get cooking in the kitchen.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.170
A terrific food for tight budgets

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.999
and heart healthy diets.

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.625
Thanks for watching.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:39.882
(upbeat music)
