00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.880
Most of the time, auto white balance will
be all you need to get good color.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.300
There will be times, though, when auto white
balance might let you down.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.050
Maybe you're shooting in shade, or on a cloudy
day, or perhaps you're in a very difficult

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470
white balance situation, like I'm in right
now.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.670
We've got a mixed lighting situation here.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.620
We've got daylight lights mixed with tungsten
lights.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.870
And the practical upshot is those flowers
back there, which are supposed to be white,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.940
are looking very yellowish, or orangish, and
that's going to confuse the white balance

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.030
on the camera.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.540
We haven't looked at live view yet, but I'm
going to go ahead and turn it on now.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.860
Don't worry, you're going to get a whole chapter
on live view later in this course, but this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.600
is going to be easier for you to understand
if you can watch what's happening in camera.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.200
You can see right off the bat that my white
flowers don't look white, even to the camera;

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.150
they've got a real yellowish orange look to
them.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.290
I'm going to go ahead and take a picture here,
because I want to store this bad white balance

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.420
scene that we've got here.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.730
Now, I could change to a white balance preset.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.030
I could change to tungsten, or daylight, or
something like that, but none of those are

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.640
actually going to be right for this particular
lighting instance.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.630
What I need to do here is a completely manual
white balance.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.971
This is always going to be the most accurate
way to get white balance for any scene, but

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.840
especially for one like this, that's confusing
the auto white balance mechanism.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.930
So, the manual white balance process starts
by pointing at something that is a neutral

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.930
gray, or a white.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.210
So I'm going to ask Lauren to put this big
piece of white foam core in the scene, and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.380
if Lauren is not hanging around your scene,
that's okay; you can get someone else to do

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
this.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.280
You just need a piece of white paper; something
white, or get a neutral gray.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.530
It needs to fill most of the frame.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.960
Most importantly, it needs to be back there
in the light.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.630
Notice, she is not putting it right here in
front of the camera.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.619
It needs to have the light on it that's causing
the problem.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.099
Now I need to take a picture of it.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:17.470
I'm going to switch to Manual focus right
now, because that bare white card, the autofocus

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.370
is not going to be able to focus on, and I'm
just going to take a picture.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.050
So now I have a picture of my white card.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.340
I'm going to switch back to Auto focus.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.340
Lauren, you can take the card out of there.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.340
Thank you!

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.049
I'm going to use that as a reference for the
camera to generate a correct white balance

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.049
off of.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.519
I'm going to go into my menuing system here
now.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.459
And in the second page of the shooting menu,
you'll find two white balance related entries.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.499
Actually, you'll find three, but we're only
going to use two of them.

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.829
White balance, which you can see, is currently
set to auto white balance.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.549
With this command, I can do the exact same
thing that I would do if I simply push the

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.889
white balance button up here, and chose a
new white balance.

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.290
And down here, Custom White Balance; this
is what I want right now.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.290
I'm going to hit Set.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.700
Now, when I do, it shows me the last image
that I took, which in this case, is my white

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
card.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.959
If I had taken some more images in the meantime,
I would need to navigate back to this image.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.769
You notice here that this is the sign for
manual white balance, and next to it, it says

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:10.769
Set.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.459
So, by pressing the Set button, I'm going
to tell the camera to calculate white balance

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.470
off of this image.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.889
So I'm going to do that now, and it's telling
me to be sure to -- or it's asking me to confirm,

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.329
do I want to use white balance data from this
image?

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.180
I'm going to say Yes.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.499
Then it's reminding me to set white balance
to the custom setting.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.989
So I'll say, thank you for reminding me about
that, and I'll just go do that right now with

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.480
this very menu command.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.359
I'll come up here and change from Auto white
balance over to Custom white balance.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.090
So I hit Set there, and say OK.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.980
And now, right away in live view, I can see
that things are very different.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.430
My white flowers are back to being white.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.450
So I'm going to take a shot here.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.900
Now let's go back and compare.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.790
Here is my image shot with a custom white
balance, here is the image shot with auto

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.530
White Balance, and you can see there is a
big difference between the two; a huge color

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.530
shift here.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.400
So this is a much better white balance for
my white flowers.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.099
But, you might be saying, I like the other
image better, because it's got all that nice

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.519
warmth to it.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.519
That's fine!

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.440
From an aesthetic standpoint, you might like
having more warmth in your image.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.540
I would argue that it's better, though, to
shoot for accuracy.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.220
You can always warm and cool an image later
in your image editor.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.870
It's very difficult to correct a bad white
balance, especially if it's a scene with lots

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.710
of different colors in it, and especially
if you're shooting JPEG.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.919
Now, if you're shooting RAW, you can always
change white balance after the fact.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.410
It would be very easy to correct this RAW
file in my image editor.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.860
That said, if I get white balance right in
camera, it's going to save me a lot of image

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.949
editing time later.

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.600
So I would press upon you to always go for
accurate white balance in camera, both because

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.280
it's difficult to correct later, and it's
a timesaver.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.800
If you get it right in camera, it's less editing
that you need to do later.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.800
One of the most important things to know about
working with white balance is that the really

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.569
hard part of the work is not what's done in
camera; it's what you do with your eye when

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:07.569
you're looking at the scene.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.030
You need to learn to recognize when you are
facing a scene that might need some white

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.460
balance attention.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.520
The problem is that your eye is constantly
correcting color.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.860
So even though these flowers look very red
and yellow, a less subtle lighting shift may

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.050
be more difficult to detect, because my eye
is really going to impress upon me that they

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.229
are white.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.780
So it takes some practice to learn to really
get in the habit of recognizing, oh, I think

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.669
the flesh tones in this image are too cool,
because I'm shooting in shade, or I think

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.880
this tungsten light is lending an orange cast
to my image.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.090
So good white balance starts with paying attention
to the colors in your scene, learning to recognize

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.270
when you might need to compensate for bad
color, and then turning to the white balance

00:05:51.270 --> 00:06:02.599
capabilities of your 5D.
