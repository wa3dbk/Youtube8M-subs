00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.860
In every man's life, there comes a time, when you need to go to the hairdresser

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.660
Right now I'm at hair salon in Tokyo, and I'm going to show you how Japanese hairdressing stantard looks like.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.280
I'm a hairdresser for 5 years.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.220
The most important thing for clients in Japan is being kawaii.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.840
Generally hair salons in Japan offer very very high standard of services.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.580
I mean

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.700
If you imagine highest standard that you can get in Europe - here - it's normal.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.880
Of course the other side of the coin, is that it's rather expensive in Tokyo.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.960
Here 50$, 60$, which is 5-6 thounsand yen, is normal price.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:06.980
The most important parts are decoration of the place, magazines, drinks, hospitality (omotenashi) and customer service.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:18.900
Popular haircut now is longer hair with modeled bangs.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.900
In colors there are two trends. One from the West - grey, khaki, platinium.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.660
Second one is just black hair.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.340
I'm never stressed...

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.700
of my new haircut...

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.500
because when I take off my glasses, I'm practically blind...

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.380
so.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.080
Hairdressers in Japan are slightly...

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.840
slower than what we are used to in Europe. I mean they work

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.920
very carefully, slow. You can get impatient from time to time, but that's how it looks here.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.020
Everything is being done with huge ceremonial.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.320
So...

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.720
if someone doesn't have patience, it's probably going to be hard for them to go through this.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:22.120
Hair of Japanese men are completely different than the foreginers. They are strong and full of volume.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.460
How much the client is going to pay, if she'll want everything first-rated?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.500
About 20 thousand yen (~160$)

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.220
Models, actresses and magazines are setting out the trends

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.340
AKB48 made side bangs popular and characteristic.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.400
Craze for fair hair firmed with popularity of Kyara Paamyu Pamyu.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.160
Now probably..

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.640
the friend is doing the long-lasting hairstyle for me.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.020
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340
Japanese men are nation which cares for personal appearance..

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.120
is sensitive for fashion trends, and also these associated to hairstyles

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.140
Through this fact existing of vast quantities of very high quality hairdressing salons in Tokyo is possible,

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.860
because there are hundreds of them, if not thousands.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.240
If we're speaking of upscale.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.780
It's awesome.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.600
It feels like they put much attention to the whole process of cumstomers visit. Not just to get him high quality service.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.120
It's also interesting when it comes to learning hairdressers, because there isn't any "barber school".

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:01.020
If anyone wants to become a hairdresser, they need to come to the salon for a intership, and very often they must provide models to themselves on their own.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.280
Usually in the fashion districts of Tokyo

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:16.860
Young hairdressers are just standing at the streets, offering their services for free, but of course clients are aware that it will be free of charge, but if it's a guy that's just starting it may not be perfect yet.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.500
It's supposedly the most trendy chair for washing the head in Japan.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.340
If we are thinking about such a system of the learning of the hairdressing it seems a bit strange to us but it is fitting very well into the cultural context of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.520
how Japanese men acqiure their professional abilities.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.920
Because on the one hand we have a Japanese business culture in which it's not important what you studied. You are just going to work and you are developed

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.340
by the company, to be the person that they need.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.820
On the other hand we have traditional image

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.300
easily explained for the practice of how the Japanese master is explaining his knowledge to his pupils

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.620
that is in such a traditional model let us say the Japanese master of for example an archery, kendo or other disciplines.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.140
The master isn't explaining anything. He's showing how to properly do something, and the students role is to imitate him.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.100
Nowadays, Japan is suffering a bit, because it isn't the most effective educational system, but that is a tradition in here.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.280
 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.140
 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.860
And this is how I look after

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.280
it took an hour or one and a half, and it's a Japanese style

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.740
Suggested by the Japanese stylist

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.540
I never had haircut like this, never had so long done hairstyle.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.900
I never had perm.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.080
And for me the stylist never arranged every hair individually.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.500
So it is experience of upscale Japanese hairdressing.
