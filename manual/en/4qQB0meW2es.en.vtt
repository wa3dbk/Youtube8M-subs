00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.630
So, here we are playing the transition from
the lower octave, the C to the upper octave

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.259
D. And you might want to throw in every now
and then an F, and go back to the D to make

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.370
sure you're playing all the notes around the
transition so you always are able to get that

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:33.089
transition cleanly; that's a pretty tricky
spot. Might want to play as many rifts as

00:00:33.089 --> 00:02:04.929
possible like this one. And now we're going
to play Summertime in tempo. And my name is

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:05.799
David Zasloff.
