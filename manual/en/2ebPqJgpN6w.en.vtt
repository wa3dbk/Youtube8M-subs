00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.840
We start our practice of the Wudang Longevity 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.840
Qigong

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.940
We stand in a ready position

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.280
We step out to your left. A bit wider than shoulder width apart

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.000
Looking out into the distance like a silk chord from the sky

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.989
pulling the head up.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.700
Let the arms rise to shoulder height

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.960
Hands rise above the head

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.100
Turn the palms down - the hands descend down the front

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.130
about the naval height. The thumbs have touched the waist

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.140
hands come around the belt channel

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.290
The hands come down the outside of the legs

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.000
You pause with one breath, fingers point to the ground

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.960
As we breathe in, the arms rise up

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.200
Out breath, think of the points in the palms of the hands

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.740
In breath to the top of the head

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.740
out breath the hands come down the front

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.630
in breath around the waist

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.090
Out breath

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.650
down the outside of the legs

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.870
Hands relax. Fingers to the ground

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.350
as we let the Chi rise up our back lifting our
arms

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.360
Out breath

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.080
to the palms of our hands

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.040
In breath to the top of the head

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.230
Out breath

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.950
the hands descend down the front

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.579
Bring the Chi down

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.409
In breath around the waist

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.610
Out breath coming down

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.700
Now for the second part

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.380
Just relax the fingers

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.390
As you breathe in raise your arms to the front - about waist height

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.260
Out breath scoop the hands out

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.500
As you breathe in

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.120
bring the hands around the ears

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.270
Out breath

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.110
pushing out

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.989
In breath bring the hands back towards the forehead

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.569
Out breath the hands come down the front

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.739
Not to touch the body just let the hands come down

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.470
You pause at the breath

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.280
relax your hands

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.220
Again. In breath

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.350
Out breath scooping

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.620
As you breathe in, bringing the good energy from the distance

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.370
Breath out

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.880
the bad energy, the negativity go out to the distance

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.120
In breath we come back

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.810
Out breath we come down

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.020
Pause with the breath

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.250
relax

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.090
Once again

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.380
Out breath we scoop the hands

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.390
In

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.380
and out

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:12.380
Around the ears. Feel the warmth of the hands around the ears

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.340
Out breath come down the front part of the body

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.889
just pausing

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.319
Now for the third section you raise your arms

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.280
You move to your right, pivoting on your left heel. Turn your toe 90 degrees

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.180
Out breath we come forward pushing from the back leg

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.959
In breath. Pushing the front leg back. Around the ears

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:45.080
Out breath - push the back leg forward

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.630
In breath coming back

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.620
Out breath come down

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.219
Left hand on top

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.369
sit back as you breathe in

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:01.669
Out breath we come forward

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.834
In

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.730
and out

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.500
Just one more time now

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.460
As you breathe in bring in the good energy from the distance

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.547
Around the ears

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.040
Breath out - the negativity go out

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.440
And sit back

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.860
Just pivot. Turn the left toe to face the front

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.253
The body faces the front

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.900
Breathe in the arms come down
