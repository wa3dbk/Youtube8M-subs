Hi this is Nev Lapwood, SnowboardAddiction.com
This tutorial is designed to teach you how

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:17.541
to carve.

00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:21.130
There's 2 main ways to turn a snowboard.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.580
Sliding and carving.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.130
Sliding turns is the most common way of riding.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.060
It allows you to control your speed and slow
down through each turn.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.530
There's a lot of friction between your board
and the snow while sliding a turn and you'll

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.800
often see snow being pushed away from your
board.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.910
Carving refers to turning your snowboard using
only the edge shape of your board.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.430
When carving you keep a lot of speed through
your turns and there isn't much snow flying

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.430
out from under your board.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.850
It's like slicing the snow with a sharp knife.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.850
It's used for bombing runs with high-speed
clean turns, however it's also essential in

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.110
freestyle to set up for jumps and riding pipe.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.050
Carving is not something you do over the whole
resort.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
You'll look like an idiot trying to carve
every run on the mountain.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.250
In my own snowboarding I'm sliding turns roughly
90% of the time and carving maybe 10%.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.630
The following steps will help you when learning
to carve.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.550
Step 1: Edge Stacking
You can do this inside to get the feeling

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.760
of positioning your weight over your edges
for carving.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.430
Start by holding on to something for balance.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.830
For your toe edge, get low by bending your
knees and ankles &amp; push your shins into the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.000
tongues of your boots.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.950
This stacks your weight over the toe edge
of your board.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.670
In this position shifting your hips forward
will create edge as if you're carving.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.280
Try creating edge angle on your toe edge without
holding onto anything then do a jump forward

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.630
to stop yourself from falling over.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.250
For your heel edge, get low, bending your
knees and ankles &amp; sink your hips down towards

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.020
your high-backs.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.450
This stacks your weight over the heel edge.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.810
From here lifting your toes creates edge angle
for carving.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.200
Try without holding anything then do a jump
backwards to catch yourself from falling over.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.940
A key point on your heel edge is to keep your
knees bent while creating edge angle.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.280
Do not straighten your legs.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.560
Practicing these 2 positions is going to help
you find balance over your edge for carving.
