Hi! I'm Mauro Uliassi

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and today I'll show you a classic dish of the tradition of Marche 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a dish that I love so much beacuse it belongs to my childhood memories 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when I used to live with my aunt Elena to whom Cappelletti are dedicated 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, what are we doing?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We're rolling a classic dough for our pasta 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this is the traditional way to roll it out with the rolling pin 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
pasta is made of a 70% 00 super fine flour type 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
30% wheat flour
