00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hi guys, welcome once again to Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.660
Chinese New Year is approaching

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For Chinese families,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.400
it is very important to have a bowl of soup

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.200
to complete the dinner

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.400
Today, I'm going to show you

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
how to prepare

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.800
'Lotus root soup with peanuts'

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This soup is delicious

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
It's healthy and simple to prepare as well

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's significant for the Chinese New Year

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.600
Now, let me show you the ingredients

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to explain to you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.500
why this soup is significant

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
for the Chinese New Year

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.600
For this recipe,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.400
I'm using one litre of water

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
For the soup base,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400
I have some pork ribs

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.300
If you do not take pork

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
or prefers different type of meat

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600
like chicken or my favourite, anchovies

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800
just use it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's fine

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400
Normally, for this soup,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.800
we usually use pork

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.900
Just to add some flavours

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to the soup base,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.600
I'm also using 2 pieces of dried squids

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
To add some sweetness,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.600
we have some red dates here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.400
Remember to remove the seeds

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
Now, we move on to the star ingredients

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600
of the soup

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200
That is the peanuts which represents wealth

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.800
and lotus roots which represents abundance

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600
That is why this soup

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
is always very popular

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
during Chinese New Year

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Now, let's begin cooking

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.420
We'll start by boiling this pot of water

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.080
I have the pork ribs here

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.000
Using just a bit of hot water,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm going to rinse these pork ribs

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
After a few seconds,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.000
we're going to pour the water away

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.660
As for the lotus roots,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
this is what I am going to do

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.400
I'm just going to cut them into slices

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.800
I will usually cut the skin away

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200
because there is still some dirt

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
I find it easier to cut the skin away

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
when they are in small slices like this

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.600
as the lotus roots have weird and awkward shapes,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.400
It's usually very difficult to cut the skin away

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.000
I usually cut them into little slices first

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400
and then work on them

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.800
Just soak them in a bowl of water

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.680
and give them a quick rinse

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600
Finally, the water is starting to boil

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.800
Using chopsticks, I'm going to put the pork in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
followed by the dried squids

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.400
along with the red dates

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800
to add some sweetness

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.200
and peanuts for wealth,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.000
lots of wealth

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.200
and of course, abundance

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.600
by adding the lotus roots

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.000
There you go

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.220
After this, there is really nothing much to do

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.900
We're going to let this boil

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600
Once it starts boiling,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.600
we're going to lower the heat

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.600
and let it simmer

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
for at least one and a half to three hours

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.600
It's really up to you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800
I like to boil my soup

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.200
for at least about two and a half hours

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.600
because by then, the soup will be really infused

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.400
with the sweetness of the pork ribs

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.200
and the saltiness of the dried squids

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.000
Hmmm... so nice

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.600
Especially when the weather is so cold

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.400
right now in Germany,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200
this bowl of soup is really delicious

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.100
It's marvelous

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.800
I'm going to let it simmer for two hours, at least

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.800
Then, I'll come back

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.600
and show you how it is like later

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.800
It's already two and a half hours

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.600
and the soup is ready

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.600
While boiling the soup,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.200
you may taste it from time to time

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.200
If you find that it's not salty enough

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.200
for your liking,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.800
feel free to add some salt

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.800
However, try to cut down on the salt

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.400
because the dried squids

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.200
already have some saltiness in them

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.600
So, let's look at the soup now

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.000
I have a very delicious bowl

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.000
of lotus root and peanuts soup

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.400
I can't wait to dig in

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.800
It's really cold at the moment here in Germany

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.200
So, let's try

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.200
Let's take a sniff first

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.400
I can smell the peanuts in the soup

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.000
Quite strong

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.400
Hmmm.....

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.000
It's so comforting to have a nice bowl of soup

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.640
especially when it has so many different

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.600
kinds of ingredients like peanuts,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.800
pork together with these red dates

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.400
which carry some sweetness

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.000
It's just so soothing,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.800
reminds me of home

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400
I'm going to finish my bowl of soup here

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
