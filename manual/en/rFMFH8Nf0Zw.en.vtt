00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:04.897
(piano music)

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:06.932
Voiceover: Rembrandt is in this room with us.

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:09.027
I'm looking at him, he's looking at me.

00:00:09.027 --> 00:00:10.755
Voiceover: He's incredibly present

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.102
in this self-portrait from 1660.

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:14.748
We're here in the National Gallery of Art

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.179
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.790
Voiceover: Rembrandt made the self-portrait

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.436
a subject in a way that it had never been.

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:23.324
His images of himself are so intimate,

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:26.034
they are so carefully observed.

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:29.759
In a sense, he teaches me how to look closely.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.269
Voiceover: And how even to look at onself

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.058
with an honesty and directness that he

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:37.262
is looking at himself with in a mirror.

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:39.466
Voiceover: We're in a room filled with Rembrandts,

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.987
and if you look at the other portraits,

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:43.652
for instance, look at the portrait of a Young Man,

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.432
you get a sense of the social distance that would have

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:49.681
existed in the studio when Rembrandt was painting,

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:52.020
and this man sat with a kind of reserve,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.244
and there was a social propriety.

00:00:54.244 --> 00:00:55.403
Voiceover: The young man that we see here

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:57.347
likely commissioned the portrait and was

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:59.571
paying Rembrandt to make something for him,

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:01.585
so there was definitely a heirarchy there.

00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:03.106
And he's distanced, too.

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.265
There's all this foreground space in front

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.802
of the figure that is absent here.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.467
His left elbow is in our space.

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:12.135
Voiceover: Maybe it's because Rembrandt

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:15.488
doesn't need to flatter this sitter and in fact,

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:18.816
his purpose seems to be just the opposite,

00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:22.371
to find every imperfection, every wrinkle.

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:25.565
It expresses the life that this face has lived.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.427
But Rembrandt's self-portraits through

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.100
his career were really of different types.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.828
There were the examples where he's

00:01:31.828 --> 00:01:34.836
showing himself as a young man, very well dressed.

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:36.562
There are times when he's in costume

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.882
with Saskia, his wife, on his knee,

00:01:38.882 --> 00:01:41.376
but then later in self-portraits like this,

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:44.029
you really see this introspective look.

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.107
Voiceover: And you feel the way that Rembrandt

00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:49.204
layered this thick paint on the face,

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:51.821
and the rest is very loosely brushed,

00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:55.108
but the face has like a sense of being really worked,

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:58.031
the light moving across it from light to dark,

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:00.891
and light again, and then picking up folds

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:02.927
and picking up the hair on his face.

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:05.103
Voiceover: But it's also the muscles and the changes,

00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:08.747
the subtle shifts in the architecture of that face

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:11.996
that is being brought out by those brush strokes.

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:14.461
I want to figure out how he's done it.

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.332
Voiceover: If you think about the Caravaggesque

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:18.574
use of dramatic lighting, so you go from

00:02:18.574 --> 00:02:21.723
an area of stark illumination to an area of shadow,

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:25.376
usually that area is demarcated in a very clear way.

00:02:25.376 --> 00:02:27.858
Here in Rembrandt, there's a movement in and out

00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:31.155
of light that I think adds to that emotion.

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:33.190
Voiceover: And look at the coloration as well.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.003
I'm seeing greens and yellows, and blues,

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.661
and reds, and browns...
Voiceover: And grays...

00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.844
Voiceover: So the intimacy is two parts.

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:42.916
It's because of Rembrandt's own careful

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:45.158
observation about what's he's seeing,

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:47.134
but it's also about the fact that we can feel

00:02:47.134 --> 00:02:51.219
his hand moving the brush across the surface,

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.217
and so there's a kind of double intimacy.

00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:54.971
Voiceover: Well, we do know that this was especially

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.437
a vulnerable moment in Rembrandt's career.

00:02:57.437 --> 00:02:59.822
He had been a very famous, sought-after

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:02.044
portrait-painter in Amsterdam,

00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:04.798
but had reached too far financially,

00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:07.947
he had gone into debt and just a year or two

00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:10.386
before this painting, he had declared bankruptcy

00:03:10.386 --> 00:03:13.203
and had to sell his assets to pay his creditors.

00:03:13.203 --> 00:03:14.668
Voiceover: His wife that he loved very much,

00:03:14.668 --> 00:03:16.909
Saskia, had died, but I think that you can

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.844
step into the biographical a little too much

00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:21.516
and weave this painting through

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:23.281
the pain of those experiences.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.883
Clearly, this is a man who has lived

00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:26.898
a very complex and rich life.

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:28.689
Voiceover: As people do (laughs) by the time

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.748
they reach the age that Rembrandt has,

00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:33.115
so we really don't need to read the biography

00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:35.787
to know that by the time you reach 53,

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:38.028
that one is wiser, one has experienced,

00:03:38.028 --> 00:03:40.386
one has lived through the death of loved ones.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.538
That's what life is.

00:03:41.538 --> 00:03:42.879
Voiceover: And that's what Rembrandt

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.120
has taken as his subject here.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.355
