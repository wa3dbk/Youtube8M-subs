tennessee pastor named sam morris of the
old pat baptist church

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.080
he had to take it a certain at about the
mass shootings and he says that the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.979
reason for the nazis

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.389
because schools teach evolution

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.539
and schools teach quote how to be a homo

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.289
this is the type of thing that we're
hearing in many churches across the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.160
country

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.569
sermon will not be pleasant

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.829
you will not be copied

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.210
but it will be pursued

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.390
will be clear

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.890
will be practical

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.780
mom

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.450
the news

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.639
i quickly have learned private room

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:48.130
about america

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.020
parapro

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.930
what's your initial reaction to this
kind where does he get this case anyway

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.210
uh... my initial reaction is that he's
completely mythic

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.960
and uh...

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.649
you know what

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.660
unfortunately i think they're thousands
of people across the country saying this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.080
exact same thing in in churches all over
let's listen to some of the key points

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.610
here

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.190
let's see if we can get them

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.490
politically

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.009
on your deadline if you have the right
on target and then

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.210
always have known neanderthal in all of
that in the pictures in alabama where

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.079
where

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.619
but they wouldn't you

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.810
but when i got a high school math part
of our knowledge kingdom file of couple

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.880
all the junk

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.100
yeah about evolution

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.420
okay let evolution in teaching through
the bottom line is a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.260
that you're an animal

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.549
application

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.759
so you're damn right you cannot but you
know

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.640
in there

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.630
uh... but you'll probably get tired of
the report on the road

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.049
the gardener animalistic behavior that
came out for me in are culinary or her

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.139
animal

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.860
and you're not

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.050
solana your balance well we can pick it
up

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.930
incase your battery about your parents

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.759
we get to you cannot be a hollow
discussing this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.080
he feels will very well grounded in a
reasonable in his opinion i think this

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.739
guy's proof of evolution nancy we've
evolved much for everything

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.790
this man the square we started from

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.469
in a more primitive state he has a new
level though the idea that at if

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.070
evolution says

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.439
that we've evolved from from animals we
will then act like animals and that

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.759
shooting people in being gay undisguised
acting like an animal let me say about

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.949
following this

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.729
god hates gay people so much

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.759
that in spite of never mentioning

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:45.039
homosexuality in the ten commandments he
would have a shorter mow down our budget

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:51.579
innocent kids just to show how upset he
was that someone in a different school

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.839
somewhere else in the country is trying
to teach children to be respectful

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.409
to homosexuality

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.989
and the children of homosexuals

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.209
as they should be to everybody else does
that that that make sense of how it is

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.089

sherlock holmes and stuff he wants you

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.790

different god but the one i think most

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:17.730
