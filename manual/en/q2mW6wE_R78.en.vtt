00:00:06.815 --> 00:00:10.957
TIM: WHY DID YOU GET INTO TRAP?
NORA: I'M THE 
 TOMBOY OF THE FAMILY ANYWAYS-- PULL! (BANG)

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:20.490
NORA: SO I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AROUND OUTSIDE HUNTING WITH MY DAD, AND I 
 JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A REALLY COOL THING TO DO. (PULL! BANG)

00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:31.888
THE VERY FIRST TIME I EVER SAW IT I WAS DOVE HUNTING WITH MY DAD AND THEY HAD 
 A BIG SPOOL WITH A TRAP ON IT THAT YOU PULED WITH A SPRING (PULL! BANG)

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:40.637
BUT AT THE TIME NOT KNOWING IT WAS A MAN'S  SPORT AND THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF WOMEN WHO 
 HAD DONE IT. SO THAT WAS KIND OF A LITTLE MORE INCENTIVE FOR ME TO DO IT ALSO. 

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.039
I WASN'T REALY SUPPOSED TO (BANG)

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:52.807
RANDY: SHE'S WON EVERYTHING THERE IS TO WIN MANY TIMES OVER, SHE'S WON TITLES THAT 
 MEN HAVEN'T WON. (BANG) I END UP DOING A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT HER.

00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:58.612
SHE'S A VERY MODEST CHAMPION (PULL! BANG)

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:10.472
TIM: I JUST PICKED UP ON SOMETHING YOU SAY THAT THING IS OSCILLATING IN THERE---
NORA: IT'S OSCILLATING 
 INSIDE THE TRAP HOUSE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS AN INTERRUPTER.

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:14.070
TIM: WELL THAT MAKES THINGS HARD
NORA: IT'S HARDER (LAUGHTER)

00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:27.253
(BANG)
RANDY: WHEN YOU COMPARE WOMEN TO MEN THERES NOT MANY SPORTS WHERE A 
 WOMAN CAN COMPETE EQUALLY. AND NORA HAS DONE THAT AND SUPERSEDED THAT.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.736
(PULL! BANG)
TIM: TELL US HOW MANY CHAMPIONSHIPS YU HAVE WON. AND WHERE.

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:48.480
NORA: 1975 WAS MY FIRST REGISTERED SHOOT, AND UP UNTIL NOW THE 
 MAJIOR CHAMPIONSHIP, CALLED THE 'GREAT AMERICAN' I'VE WON 150+ FOR THAT.

00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:55.450
TIM: I SAW A BIG HONKIN' RING THAT 
 LOOKS LIKE AN NBA RING OR SOMETHING.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.180
NORA: THIS IS KINDA LIKE LIKE THE SUPERBOWL OF TRAPSHOOTING THATS WHAT THE RING 
 OF FOR. THEY GIVE ONE OF THESE AWAY TO WHOEVER WINS THE

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:09.280
SINGLES, DOUBLES, HANDICAP, ALL-AROUND WHICH IS 400 TARGETS, THE 
 OVERALL WHICH IS 1,000 TARGETS. (PULL! BANG)

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:25.130
AND THE REASON I GOT THIS WAS IN DOUBLES AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN WAS A GUY FROM COLORADO, 
 RAY STAFFORD WHICH IS KNON TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTERS, ESPECIALLY DOUBLES, IN THE COUNTRY

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:36.280
SO HE WAS IN A NO WIN SITUATION, IF HE WON HE WAS SUPPOSED TO AND IF I WON, WELL, 
 IT'S A GIRL SO. I MEAN WITH THE RING AND WHO I HAD TO SHOOT OFF TO WIN THIS

00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:46.400
I'M THE ONLY WOMAN TO EVER WIN ONE OF THESE SO 
 THAT MAKES IT MORE SPECIAL TO HAVE THIS. (PULL! BANG)

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.750
TIM: YOU EVER SEE THESE GUYS LIKE--- OR ARE THEY PRETTY GRACIOUS?
RANDY: WELL I THINK MOST 
 MEN IF THEY LOSE TO A WOMAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EMBARRASSMENT ABOUT THAT.

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:10.520
BUT NOT THIS ONE (BANG) YOU KNOW IF SHE BEATS THEM IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE SHE 
 IS THE BEST. SHE IS DIFFERANT THAN MOST LADIES WHO SHOOT THE GAME.

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:19.280
I MAKE IT A REGULAR PRACTICE TO NOT WORRY ABOUT HER BEATING 
 ME. IT HAPPENS ENOUGH THAT I CAN HANDLE IT (LAUGHTER)

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:25.520
TIM: THERE IS SOMETHING OVER HERE THAT LOOKS LIKE THE STANLY CUP AND IT 
 LOOKS LIKE IT'S OLD.
NORA: THAT IS THE FRANCIS AND CLYDE KING TROPHY

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:33.170
THE LADY THAT WINS THE HIGH OVERALL LIKE I SAID THATS 1,000 TARGETS 
 COMBINED. IF YOU WIN IT 5 TIMES YOU GET TO RETIRE IT.

00:03:33.862 --> 00:03:38.750
BETWEEN THE RING AND THAT, THATS PROBABLY THE 
 BIGGEST THINGS THAT I EVER WON. (BANG)

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:46.730
IN 1999 I WAS INDUCTED INTO THE TRAPSHOOTING HALL OF FAME AND WAS THE 
 YOUNGEST TO BE IN IT ALSO. AND THAT WAS A REAL HONOR.

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:52.270
ANNIE OAKLEY IS IN THAT AND THATS PRETTY COOL. (PULL! BANG) 

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:58.990
TIM: I HAD NO IDEA, SHE'S A CHAMPION'S CHAMPION. WHEN SHE LAYS 
 THE GUN DOWN FOR COMPETITION DOES SHE DO ANY OUTDOOR STUFF?

00:03:58.986 --> 00:04:08.880
RANDY: SHE TRAPS WITH ME. SHES NOT READY TO SET HER OWN LINE BUT SHE'S RIGHT THERE WITH 
 ME. AND SHE LOVES TO TURKEY HUNT IN THE SPRING. THATS HER FAVORITE THING TO DO.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:13.450
TIM: SHE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN 
 AND SHE COMPETES AGAINST EVERYBODY. (PULL! BANG)

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.960
RANDY: I ALWAYS JOKE WITH HER THAT SHE HAS A ONE NAME, 
 NAME. LIKE CHER, STING AND THEN THERES NORA. (PULL! BANG)
