00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.270
Shigeru Miyamoto has been quoted as saying
he wasn’t a big fan of F-Zero GX, the GameCube

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.760
classic many consider the best F-Zero release
to date.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.730
Whether that has anything to do with the series’
absence on Wii...who knows?

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.610
All I do know is that if you’re looking
for an F-Zero game on Wii, this is probably

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.610
your best bet.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.290
It’s a video game based on the 2008 film
adaptation of Speed Racer.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.762
You’re probably expecting it to suck, too.

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:55.150
But lo and behold, this is one of the better
movie games you’ll ever play in your life.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.660
Kinda takes away the sting of not having a
new F-Zero game since the indictment of Martha

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.760
Stewart...only not really.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.520
Go Speed Racer!

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.220
Released in 2008 by Warner Bros.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
Interactive, Speed Racer: The Video Game was
developed by a New Zealand company without

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.190
much of a track record.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.340
That makes the quality of this game even more
surprising.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.430
Yeah, it’s a blatant F-Zero ripoff.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.990
So much so that if he could, Captain Falcon
would file a lawsuit faster than you could

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.360
say, “Falcon Punch!”

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.180
But honestly, who cares?

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.630
I mean, to hell with originality.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:46.020
For a movie game, this is as good as it gets.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.551
Speed Racer is a racer with more than a dozen
vehicles flying by at speeds so fast, they

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:55.300
boggle the imagination of everyone except
Samurai Goroh.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.030
Sorry for the F-Zero references, but I mean,
come on...Speed Racer really is F-Zero without

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.030
the F-Zero.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.360
That’s a good thing, because it fills a
glaring hole in the Wii’s library.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.330
Aside from its quality, I think the most surprising
thing about Speed Racer is its controls...and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.160
the fact that they aren’t terrible.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.311
The game was released in 2008, back when developers
forced motion into their games and didn’t

00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.640
even consider adding an alternative.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.520
So you play with tilt...and listen, I despite
tilt steering.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.420
But it’s actually pretty adequate in Speed
Racer, and that’s because the tracks are

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.450
more forgiving than those in F-Zero.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.540
They kind of lead you into the turns, so steering
is a lot smoother.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.440
If you’re looking for differences, well...there
are Car-Fu mechanics that let you attack other

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.450
cars and earn additional points.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.750
You can also enter a crazy alternate dimension
when you save up your boosts.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.500
On the negative side, it’s not as pretty
or fast as GX, and the multiplayer is limited

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500
to split-screen.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.060
There’s not much here you haven’t seen
before, but that’s kind of the point.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.840
Fans wanted to see this on Wii, albeit in
a different form, but never got it.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.060
So that’s where Speed Racer fits in.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.650
If you’re really desperate for an F-Zero-like
experience on your Wii...this is a perfectly

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.280
solid little racer.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.700
Besides...it’s not like you have a choice,
right?
