theme

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.860
well let's move on to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.869
plans C

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.900
on buying our car the thing is that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.939
this plan was made after we left

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.570
the Rusco place. We  were on our way back

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.900
and there's a new place in Canlaon

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.510
now it's called SMC

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.199
and they just started here and we've
been down there and looked at a couple

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.460
vehicles down there so Bhem decided

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
that she and Mama and Papa would go down there

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.820
and see if they could get a vehicle down there

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.780
so Loy Loy and I got off

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.250
in Maluco and came on up here

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.370
So the thing is that this story

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.229
goes they went in and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.229
they got a car. imagine, but.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.260
they had it delivered here

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.270
by Loy Loy, Loy Loy drove it here and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.270
it  was not what I expect it had no mud tires,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.540
it had four-wheel-drive it did not have
lift up

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.250
and it was a

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.570
low truck so we got a vehicle

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.890
but it wasn't what we needed. So

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.570
the problem first started with this car

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.840
when we tried to bring it up,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
our pathway one that I've been working
on the one you've seen

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.950
all the time OK. We found out

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.250
when we did that, four-wheel-drive

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.040
was not working. So needless to say

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.670
it's been raining and it's been very slick. and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.050
we got it up here but it was

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.420
real problem. So we got it down in it to our

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.750
house here and with the four-wheel-drive

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.000
not working we got stuck. So

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.080
they came in got vehicle and took it
back

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.600
and they you have been working

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.390
on repairing the four-wheel-drive since

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.019
that happen. So we have not got our
vehicle back

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.590
they've given us a loaner. But we can't work on
our vehicle

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.940
until we get it back and I can't give
you any video

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.940
either of the vehicle unil we get it back. So

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.640
We got a vehicle. What vehicle ?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.680
We'll find out a little later when you
keep on viewing

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.060
I guess you'll be a little surprised.
