Hi this is Gary with MacMost Now.

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:06.930
On today's episode let's take a look into
2013 and try to figure out what Apple has

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.460
in store for us.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.990
On the Mac side of things in 2013 we probably
won't get any major changes to the MacBook

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.800
Pros or the iMac since they were just refreshed.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.439
But hopefully we will see retina displays
spread to other Macs say like the MacBook

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.769
Air and hopefully the iMac as well.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.770
A 27" iMac with a retina display would be
amazing but also is going to be a huge retina

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.830
display to produce so it will be interesting
to see if Apple can pull it off.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.750
One machine that has been neglected over the
last several years has been the MacPro.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.620
We haven't seen a design update since the
G5 tower days.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.820
Inside and out it really needs some new features
like say thunderbolt ports and such.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.250
Well, Tim Cook promised us that in 2013 we
are going to get a new MacPro perhaps a new

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.850
design completely.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.020
It seems with thunderbolt you don't really
need all the internal card slots anymore.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.460
So it will be interesting to see what Apple
comes up with and how soon in the year they

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.920
come out with it.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.970
On the Mac side we are also used to getting
a new operating system every year.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.290
So it will be interesting to see if there
is a new cat in our future, Mac OS 10.9, and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.360
if there is what it is called and when it
will be released.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.100
Also looking at Macs it was promised that
in 2013 one Mac line will be manufactured

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.050
in the United States.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.050
Which one will it be?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.890
Will it be a certain type of iMac or perhaps
it will be the MacPro.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.350
That makes the most sense since most of the
MacPros will have some sort of customization

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.100
and it's probably easier to do customization
in a factory in the United States where every

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.570
machine is a little bit different than the
other one.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
Also MacPros are probably going to be a lot
bigger and heavier so it will be easier to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.460
ship to locations in the United States if
they are manufactured here.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.590
On the iOS side of things it is likely that
we will get a new iPhone this next year.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.370
Whether it will be an iPhone 6 or an iPhone
5S remains to be seen.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.980
We will probably also get a new iPad.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.049
A fifth generation iPad and we will have to
see what new features are in store for us

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.049
with that.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.729
It is a little easier to predict a new iPad
Mini with a retina display since it is the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.830
obvious feature to add to it.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.590
Now, iTunes on both Macs and iOS may get some
new services.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.140
There has been lots of rumors over the last
few years of Apple starting some sort of streaming

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.920
music service where you pay a set fee and
you can listen to the entire iTunes Library

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.490
of music or perhaps a radio station kind of
thing like Pandora.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.610
In addition we might see something on Apple
TV where you can subscribe to live television

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.610
stations.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.990
So Apple TV could become a viable competitor
to cable and satellite where you can actually

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.710
watch the major networks live via an App in
your Apple TV.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.410
We will have to see whether Apple can pull
off any of those in this next year.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.140
Of course, there is still the rumor hanging
out there that Apple is going to come out

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.569
with some sort of television.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.390
Something like Apple TV but with the actual
screen itself.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.390
This has been a rumor for years now and it
will be interesting to see if it actually

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.790
comes true in 2013.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.120
So there is a look at what we might expect
in 2013 from Apple.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.860
Hope you found this interesting.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.110
Leave your comments about what you think will
happen in this next year in the Apple world

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.860
at this post at MacMost.com.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:32.010
Until next time this is Gary with MacMost
Now.
