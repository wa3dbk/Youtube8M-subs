00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:29.000
Bird lived in a perfect tree.
"I love my tree," she said.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.910
"It's in a nice quiet park.
And I can see the ocean."

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.000
One day Bird was sleeping.
Boom! Bonk!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"What made that sound?" asked Bird.
Bird looked up, but she didn't see anything.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.010
Bird went back to sleep.
Boom! Bonk!

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.010
"Ouch!" said Bird.
Bird looked up again.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.320
But she still didn't see anything.
Bird went back to sleep again.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Crash! Bonk! Boom!
"Acorns!" cried Bird.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.049
"Where did these come from?"
Bird looked up and saw a chipmunk.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.320
"Sorry," said the chipmunk.
"Oh, that's okay," said Bird.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.320
"What are you doing with all these acorns?"
"I'm moving in," said the chipmunk.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.960
"You're moving in?" asked Bird.
"Yes," said the chipmunk.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.960
"I'm moving in to this hole.
My name is Kip.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm your new neighbor!"
