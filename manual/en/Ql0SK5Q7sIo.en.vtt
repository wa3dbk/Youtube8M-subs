00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.280
The idea is to use the whole body to
throw the medicine ball

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.320
and to be explosive.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.900
The swing needs to mirror the medicine ball throw.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.880
The idea is to set up the same way as you did when

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.880
as you did when you threw the medicine ball

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.920
and swing as fast as possible while staying relaxed.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.520
On the backhand side it is the same concept, throw the medicine ball

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.750
as fast as possible using the whole body

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.370
keeping your shoulders level. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.679
Make sure the technique of the throw

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.220
is solid. The technique of the stroke

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.109
needs to mimic the technique of the throw.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.860
The swing needs to be fast.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.340
The same concept applies to the serve.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.710
Usually you want to throw four to six times
and then swing 4 to 6 times.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.160
You wanna be explosive, and you
wanna go as fast as you can.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.800
Right after throwing the medicine ball you swing as fast as possible

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.020
staying relaxed.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.429
The idea is to use the whole body.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.500
Here you can use a kids' racquet or you can use a badminton racket, anything that is

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.530
very, very light

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.480
The idea is you want to fool the body a
little bit.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.220
You want to swing faster than normal
with the light racquet and then tried to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.930
do the same thing with your normal racquet. 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.040
It is important to have all the balls together so that you can

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.500
repeat those swings one after the other one.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.160
The same concept can be applied

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.980
to every stroke.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.700
5 or 6 really fast forehands with a very very light racquet and then

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.260
5 or 6 maximum

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.660
speeds swings.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.960
Here is an example with the backhand, as fast as possible

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.060
trying to stay relaxed and trying to keep the technique solid.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.220
You start with the backhand. See there is a weight on the racquet.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.380
6 really fast swings

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.210
with a heavy racquet follow by 6
shadow swings

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.750
with the normal racquet

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.720
and followed by 6 swings

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.880
hitting the ball.  All swings have to

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.860
be very fast trying to stay relaxed

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.930
and trying to make sure the technique
doesn't suffer.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.340
Same thing on the forehand side:

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.360
heavy racquet first,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.340
shadow swinging

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.280
with normal racquet

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.180
and finally hitting the ball
