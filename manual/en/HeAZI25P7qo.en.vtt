00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:13.444
Welcome to the second part of hair &amp; fur

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.149
Create a sphere and scale them like a human face

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.595
Yes i know, a real model is a bit different but is an example

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:38.766
create a line with a considerable number of points

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:45.256
more points we add more is the possibility to manage after

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.960
center the pivot at the center of the Head

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.790
Copy the spline

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.200
We do it in more and more ways

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.760
Ops! I left pivot

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.560
More spline add much interesting have the effect

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.240
Click to attack (spline rollout)

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.840
Attach all spline in one

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.760
after, choose sub-object vertex

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
Delete , for example front spline (with vertex or segment sub-object)

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.920
Left only the upper part

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.520
Do it slowly, is very important for final result

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.960
Manage the Y value to move spline closer to surface

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.400
Manage spline to create a bit movement

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.280
After comb spline choose modificator hair &amp; fur

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320
Change "tip" color to blonde (yes is an example)

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.400
Black root and Yellow tip

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.120
Change hair count from 150 to 5000

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440
and render it (only perpective view and camera)

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.600
Spline managing allows us to change any time we want

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.880
If we choose to bring them back we'll just move points

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240
or scale them....

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.400
For example to raise a tuft

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.160
select segment and move them up

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.320
Is possible to do hair braids or any tipe of hairstyle

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.200
Next tyme we use it on a real model. Thank you!
