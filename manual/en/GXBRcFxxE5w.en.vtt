Daneboe Exposed!

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.280
I-I swore I would never do this, but...

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.180
okay.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.080
*vines come out of his head?*

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.720
See? That's why I never take it off.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.760
No joke, we have, like, a billion nicknames for Cuddles.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.660
Uh, we call her...

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.400
And Sweety, because that's what she is.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.600
*reading question angrily*

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440
*this goes on for a while*

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.340
*smh Dane*

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.040
NEVER!!! I will never answer your question! Never!

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.260
I don't know. I don't know where Ninja Baby w-

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.280
*sucker punch*

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.240
No, you're awesome!

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.620
You bet. Subscribed!

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.460
You bet, let's just fire up the Daneco Cloner 5000,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.440
Bam!

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.280
There we, ah-- aw man, I am-- I regret--

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.280
*inaudible* Why-- why do you guys do this? Why? I don't even understand.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.280
Urrgh, I'm gonna have to go with Luke Skywalker.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.380
Well, then, I'd be forced to do things.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.220
Like,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.420
Cra-- crazy things, li-- like one of these, w-- watch.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.780
*Dane proceeds to thrust a burger out of his crotch*

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.120
See that? That--

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.100
*screams of terror coming from background*

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.440
That comes with great costs.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.940
That--

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.660
*explosion*

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.220
You don't want that to happen, if--

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920
So just don't do stuff, and I won't do things.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.420
Okay?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.600
*WHYYYYY*

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.960
Words...to live by.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.140
Ah, oh, oh crap, um...it's too late...

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.020
I'm already here...

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.540
But I think I'm ok, I don't think there are any velociraptors around here or anything...

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.780
So, it's cool.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.020
*fart*

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.780
*sniff* Oh no.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.660
No, this can't be!

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.940
Oh no, it's a veloci-crap-tor!

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.400
Oh, I get it. HAND-burgers. That's...

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.900
Funny.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.960
Funny. *2x*

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.960
*takes an encouraging bite*

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.580
*maybe not*

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.380
And delicious.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.240
So you talking deer or money?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
*meow*

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.220
Absolutely, man. I love you, it's awesome that--

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.280
THANKS.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.160
*proceeds to get murdered by Slenderman*

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.360
I'd say begin with something small and work your way up.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.960
Start with something you really want to learn how to do

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.360
and build a idea for a video around that.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.320
Like the demon face warp tutorial.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.080
I built an entire video just around that one effect.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.400
It did really well and I ended up doing a bunch more because of it.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.200
That's a good example of starting with something small and building something bigger around it.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.520
Fine. Cause that's-- If that's the way you want it. Fine!

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.080
*crash*

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.340
Heck yeah bro! *nobody says that anymore dane smh*

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.140
Check this out!

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.040
*swoosh*

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.180
M-- crazy, right?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.920
Aw, thank you so m-- AGHHH! *explosion*

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.840
And you're still never gonna! Ha!

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.920
Muhaha!

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800
I don't know why I laughed like that...

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.700
It kinda hurt, actually *giggles*

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.760
*esion ynnuf sekam* !aH

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.500
For me, Panic! at the Disco. All the way.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.760
I've got the answer for that one.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.180
Being a YouTuber.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.180
Perfect. Sounds f-- Oh, you even have a counter down th--

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.220
*ummm...*

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.780
*there is nothing else to be seen here*

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.660
Whoa. That was colorful.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.000
*sighs*

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.600
*I leave you with one more thing.*
