00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.600
From Guillermo del Toro, the Latino Peter
Jackson, comes a completely original sci-fi

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.090
universe that doesn't rely on any pre-existing
franchise.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.109
... as long as you don't count Transformers,

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.810
Ultra Man,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.510
Power Rangers,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.860
Godzilla,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.160
Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.500
that stupid Hugh Jackman robot boxing movie,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.410
or every anime ever made.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.950
Pacific Rim.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.190
When giant aliens emerge from this iTunes
visualizer at the bottom of the ocean, the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.190
entire world's resources will be spent on
building giant robots to punch them in the face.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.190
But these machines are only as good as their
two pilots, who for no reason at all must

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.770
be connected by an overly-complicated neural
bridge to ensure drift compatibility,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.200
a system so advanced only family members can
do it.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.950
"You are drift compatible."

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.329
Or just two random strangers.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.989
"We are drift compatible."

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.049
Or just one guy by himself.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.929
This makes no sense - but it sure looks cool!

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.899
Meet Raleigh Becket, a hot-shot pilot struggling
to maintain his American accent

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.310
"All those years I spent living in the past,
I never really thought about the future."

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.209
And his co-pilot, Mako Mori, a girl so bad
at speaking English

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.189
"I've studied your fighting techniques and
strategy."

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.600
sometimes she just gives up mid-sentence.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.020
"You promised me!"

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.539
Watch as these two awkwardly flirt in the
classic will-they-won't-they relationship.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.299
Then, for the first time in movie history...
WON'T.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.159
Suit up with these bad ass fighting robots.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.279
"Crimson Typoon."

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.389
"Cherno Alpha."

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:50.599
"Striker Eureka."

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.719
And this one named after a stripper.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.200
"Gipsy Danger."

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.819
Who comes fully-equipped with

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.789
ineffective elbow rockets,

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.380
painfully slow plasma canons,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.590
and an incredibly powerful sword they forgot
they had until about two thirds of the way

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.599
through the movie.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.610
... Probably should've busted that out at
the beginning of the movie. Don't you think?

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.250
Ride along with a Marshal, an ex-pilot
forced to take cancer-causing future Altoids

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.950
but no amount of future cancer can stop him
from giving the most awesome speech since

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.190
Independence Day.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.190
"Today we face the monsters that are at our
door and bring the fight to them. Today we

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.800
are canceling the apocalypse!"

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.000
[cheering]

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.600
Hell yeah!

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.950
So relive the summer's guiltiest pleasure
that's either the most awesome dumb movie

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.600
ever made

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.540
or the dumbest awesome movie ever made.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.540
So awesome!

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.860
So dumb!

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.540
Starring...

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.040
things your inner 9-year-old will love

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.750
giant robots

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.530
giant monsters

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.700
giant robots punching giant monsters

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.280
using shipping crates as brass knuckles

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.700
using a freighter like a baseball bat

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.690
bo staff fighting

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.230
colors!

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.570
a doggy!

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.020
aw, that's got three arms!

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.240
pew pew pew!

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.980
whoa!

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.480
and that one part...

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.170
where he's all like "Ugh"...

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.830
and the Kaiju's all "Rarr!"

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.790
Awesome Dumb Robot Movie

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.550
ummm...

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.870
Pacific Rim

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.610
Let's be honest: that movie was super dumb.
But I still cannot wait for the sequel.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.510
Thanks for watching.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.100

"Only YOU can prevent forest fires."

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.490
"60% of the time, it works every time!"

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.990
"I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked
in here with me."

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.200
"I am a banana!"
