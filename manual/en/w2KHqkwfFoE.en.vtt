00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.840
Narrator: It's no secret that The College
of Wooster Men's Basketball team is one of

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.820
the best Division III Programs in the country.
What is a secret is what makes them so good.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.730
For this year's group, the answer may be the
Rubik's Cube. Although the 3D puzzle game's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
popularity reached its peak in the 1980s,
six Wooster student athletes have rediscovered

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.480
the Rubik's Cube, and are having a blast solving
it.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.529
Matt: I actually learned how to do the Rubik's
Cube in high school, and my freshman year

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.850
I brought it to the team. I was doing it on
a road trip. Some of the guys took an interest

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.579
to it, and now it's a good hobby for the team.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.000
Narrator: With academics and athletics taking
up the majority time, the Rubik's Cube has

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.830
become a way for the teammates to wind down
and bond. But, just like they strive to win

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.230
on the court, that same competitive spirit
often times spills over to the Rubik's cube,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.870
where each player has his own trick to solving
the puzzle.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.400
Nathan: Trick? If you know your algorithms,
then you should be okay.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.680
Ian: There's a lot of different patterns,
so it takes a while to learn. Basically, one

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.420
step at a time and just keep practicing that
step over and over and until you can add them

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
all together.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.030
Narrator: The Rubik's Cube is just one of
the many things that make Wooster's Men's

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.380
Basketball Program a special one. Since 2000,
the Fighting Scots have put together a remarkable

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.999
stretch that has made them the winningest
basketball program in the country during that

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.549
span. The team also plays in front of one
of the largest home crowds in Division III,

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.369
with some games reaching over 3,000 in attendance.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.240
Nathan: There's a lot of big universities
out there that, you just don't get that same

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.320
kind of atmosphere. And I really like the
small community, and I like the winning tradition

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
that we had here. So I just wanted to be a
part of something big like that.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Narrator: While their on the court talent
is unquestioned, there is much more to these

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.960
Wooster Student Athletes. Beyond their interest
in the Rubik's Cube, each of these six is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350
unique in his academic pursuits.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.279
I'm a major in Math, and a minor in Education.

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.929
I'm majoring in Philosophy.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.240
My major is History.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.539
I'm majoring in Communication Studies.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.469
I'm majoring in Business Economics.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.999
I'm a History major, and an Education minor.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.610
Narrator: It's a tall task to excel in both
in the classroom and on the court, but Wooster's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360
Men's Basketball Program continues to solve
that puzzle.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.190
Ian: Oh, it's been awesome. I couldn't ask
for a better situation both academically and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.260
with athletics. I love it here.
