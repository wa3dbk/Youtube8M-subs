00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.779
All right, today on our 2014 Mazda CX-5, we&amp;#39;re
going to install part number 118563.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.940
To start off our install, we&amp;#39;re going
to have to open up the back hatch and get

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.190
access to the wiring behind the tail lights,
so we&amp;#39;re going to have to remove some

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.020
interior body panels to do this.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.199
First off, we&amp;#39;ll remove the floor coverings
to get down to the spare tire.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.010
Next we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and remove yourthreshold.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.019
Next we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and remove the foam
inserts around the spare tire.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.500
Now to remove the threshold, there will be
two plastic fasteners, one on each end, we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.710
have to remove.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.120
Working from the bottom and prying from the
sides, we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and work it free,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.570
then we can go ahead and loosen up the side
panels.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:01:02.079
There will be a 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:25.060
small 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:52.869
plastic fastener we 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:35.830
have to remove, we&amp;#39;ll do 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:06:27.830
this on both sides.
