00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:25.240
Well, this begs an obvious question.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.289
A couple, actually.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.289
Like...hey.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.060
Why didn't you...yankee doodle, wrap it up,
if you know what I'm saying.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.579
'Cause now you're buying stuff like this,
you poor bastard.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.160
When there's plenty of pornography for everyone.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.780
But above all else...

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.460
I mean, how smart is a panda?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.680
Like, really?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.039
So here we are.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.570
Hot on the heels of Lola's Math Train, in
which Lola ran a math train, it's Lola's ABC

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.570
Party.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.050
Because that's a nice life lesson for kids.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.730
Go operate a train after you've been raging
at a party.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.730
That's real safe.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.140
Look at Lola, raging.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.719
Anyway, Lola the Panda is a series of games.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.620
As in, there are more than one.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.009
We've already reviewed Lola's Math Train,
so.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.081
I mean, why not, right?

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.500
Not like I have anything else to do.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.180
Other than...be generally disgruntled, most
of the time.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.380
As with the previous game, Lola's ABC Party
was released on mobile platforms well before

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.100
coming to the eShop.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.970
And I've said before, I think it makes a lot
more sense for these games to be in the App

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.970
Store than the eShop.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
But nonetheless, if you have a 3DS, and you
also have a childâ€”planned or otherwiseâ€”this

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.360
might be a good thing to have, to silence
them.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.560
When you...run out of sedatives.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.250
Children are the worst.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.460
So, uh...there's not really any modes or anything.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.509
You start the game, Lola asks you what you
want to do first.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.120
Uh, how 'bout shut the f*ck up and let me
do my job, Lola?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.350
Yeah, I'll take it from here.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.640
Species gets endangered, and thinks they can
do whatever they want.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.130
Anyway...I don't know.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.009
I've lost my train of thought.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.200
My math train, Lola.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380
What do you think of that?

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.380
Panda.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.380
Oh!

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380
Uh...there are three options.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.540
You can either prepare the cake, prepare the
ice cream or prepare the balloons.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.950
These must be things that parents do.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.860
See, I can't relate to that.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.320
I mean, who makes a cake when you can just
go get an ice cream cake at the Dairy Queen?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.569
I swear, people procreate, and...they just
forget everything.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.910
They're like Robin Williams in Hook.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.360
Only there's less Julia Roberts.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:43.730
And in my world...dude, it's all Julia Roberts.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.240
Of course, preparing all these things really
means doing the same things.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.069
Basic minigames.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.769
Educational stuff, for little kids.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.900
And by "little," I mean...really little.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.730
Like, I don't even know how little.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.160
Maybe...I don't know, two?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.560
Or too little to be funny, I know that.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.560
Or self-sufficient.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.580
Which, what's even the point, then?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.000
Kind of like this game.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.290
The kids do these minigames, then the preparations
for the party...and then it's over.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.700
Ten minutes later, it's all over.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.330
Gotta be some serious deja vu for the parents,
though.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.460
It was just ten minutes.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.819
Now...children.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.650
For the rest of your life.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.980
Alright, to be serious for a minute...I mean,
I don't know.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.590
I guess it teaches kids...letters?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.230
Spelling?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.879
Pronunciation?

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.709
How to make ice cream?

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.569
This is a vanilla sundae topped with panda
blood, incidentally.

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.569
And mint.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.670
So I mean, they do the minigames, then...afterward,
they get to decorate the cake and ice cream

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.670
and stuff.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.670
Like rewards.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.670
Or whatever.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.269
I don't know, I can actually read, so.

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.129
Not to be a dick about it.

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.640
And these balloons suck.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.580
Alright, I don't see much point in continuing
here.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.700
Uh, if you're a parent and you share a 3DS
with your kids...I mean, sure.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.140
This is a really well-made educational game.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.200
I don't really know what you're looking for
in a game like this, but...you know.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.260
Reading and writing, and all that.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.890
Children, and stuff.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.650
Pastel colors.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.819
Decades of resentment.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.510
It's Lola's ABC Party, for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.660
Get back here, you little bastard
