00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
Hey guys, welcome to Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.100
Fruits are very good for our health

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.600
That's why I want to introduce to you a Malaysian fruit salad

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.300
Now, this is what we called 'Rojak buah petis'

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.620
'Rojak' brings the meaning of 'mixture'

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
'Buah' means fruits

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.800
'Petis' is a kind of shrimp paste that we used here

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm going to show you that later

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.000
All in all, this recipe is a little bit spicy because there's some chili in it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.600
It's salty because of the shrimp paste

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.900
There's a whole load of fruits that we are going to use

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.400
Besides fruits, we will also use vegetables

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.100
For example, cucumber or even water spinach

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
If you like, you may also add some fried tofu into this dish

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
So, it's pretty delicious

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.400
You would want to see what the ingredients are, to prepare this fruit salad

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400
So, let's begin

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's look at the fruits that we'll be using today

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.400
So, I have some pineapples here, 1 green apple and also chayote

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.800
So, this is how it looks like

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.700
It's a bit crunchy...it's hard

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.700
Okay...

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.400
Ummm... tastes a little bit like apple but it's different

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.600
You got to try it if you can get hold of it

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
and also cucumber

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.000
So, in additional, you may also add young mangoes

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.200
or as I'd mentioned earlier, tofu...fried tofu or also water spinach

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.600
Now, let's move on here

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.900
I have some 'belacan' or shrimp paste

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Then, a bit of water, some nuts

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
For garnishing, I have some hazelnuts here or you may use peanuts, if you like

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.800
and also sesame seeds

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Now, this is the shrimp paste that I told you earlier... 'petis'

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.800
'Petis udang'... so, this is the liquid form of shrimp paste but it has sugar in it

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.700
So, it's a little bit sweet

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.500
Then, I have some 'kicap lemak manis'

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.900
'Kicap lemak manis' is a type of soy sauce...sweet soy sauce

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.100
It's thick but it's not the sweet soy sauce that I used in other videos

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.600
It has lesser content of sugar and it's usually found in Indonesia

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:18.200
So, you can use the normal sweet soy sauce or this type which has lesser content of sugar

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.100
Just substitute any type that you can find

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.280
Then, I have some dried chilies and also sugar

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
Let's begin by toasting the nuts that I have and also the sesame seeds here

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300
So, without any oil, this pan had been heated up

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.700
I'm just going to put them in

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.600
I've toasted the nuts here and also the sesame seeds

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.160
You'll smell this very fragrant smell and that means it's ready

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.800
So, I'm going to take them out and leave them aside here

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.700
The next ingredient that we'll toast is the 'belacan' or this hard shrimp paste

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.600
If you'd seen other videos, you'll know the rules

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.480
We're going to toast this until it's fragrant...until there's slight smoke coming up

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.400
That means it's ready

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.460
We're going to take it out and then leave it aside

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.300
We'll then need to blend these dried chilies which had been soaked cleaned

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
I'd also deseeded these chilies to ensure that they would not be too spicy

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.200
If you like it to be spicier, leave the seeds on

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.200
or you can also use these small chilies as well...known as 'cili padi'

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.600
That will make your salad really spicy

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.500
So, be careful

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.700
We're blending this now

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.500
We have to also add the toasted 'belacan' into this blended chili

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.300
Then, continue blending

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.400
The next step is to add the thick soy sauce and then, this shrimp paste that we have

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.820
This 'petis udang' which is in liquid form

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.000
To the sauce, I'm also going to add about 2 tablespoons of water and also the blended ingredients

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.300
Cook until the sauce thickens

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.000
Remember, we had sugar earlier

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.400
This is to just add some taste to the sauce

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.300
The sauce that we used is already sweet

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.100
The shrimp paste that we used is also sweet

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.300
So, remember to just taste and  then, add as much sugar as you want

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.600
If you like, you may also add some salt to it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.800
So, just remember to keep tasting until you get the right taste

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.400
It should not be too sweet

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.800
It's supposed to have a balance of sweetness and saltiness

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.700
While we wait for the sauce to thicken, I'm going to prepare these fruits

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.100
I'm going to cut them into smaller pieces first

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.600
So, here is the cucumber

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.200
The sauce is now thick

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.200
So, I'm going to transfer it into a bowl and let it cool

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.300
Now, we have everything prepared here

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.180
I have the fruits cut here and then, the sauce is ready

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.100
As for the sauce, you can always cool it down to room temperature

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.800
or leave it in the refrigerator which will even be much tastier

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.700
So now, we're going to assemble everything

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.300
Everything goes into this big salad bowl

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.800
Mix them thoroughly

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.400
Then, it's time to just scoop them out onto a plate or a bowl, if you like

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.500
It is also now that you can just garnish with the sesame seeds and also peanuts

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600
Now that it's ready, of course the next step is to try it

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.400
So...

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Lovely combination of saltiness, a very light hint of spiciness because I'd deseeded the chilies...and sweetness

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.600
Hmmm...

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.400
I'm going to take another one

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.200
Hmm... Let's see what I have

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.400
Pineapple...that will be interesting

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.300
Hmmm...

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.600
Lovely... lovely

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.400
Crunchiness from the peanuts and the sesame seeds

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.200
Give this a try

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:19.100
