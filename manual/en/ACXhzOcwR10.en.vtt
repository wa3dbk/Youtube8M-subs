Hi, I'm Heather.
I work for Virgin Media.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.280
Today I'm going to show you
how to install and use F-Secure Safe

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.920
on your Android smartphone.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.880
It's important to do this as devices
that run Android or Windows

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.280
are just as vulnerable
to internet nasties as your PC.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.920
So, first check that you are online
and go to virginmedia.com

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320
And then click My Virgin Media.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.520
And sign in with
your account username and password.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.400
If you've forgotten it, just click here.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.600
Sign in.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.760
And go to My Apps.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.040
Go to Internet Security.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.920
Click Overview and this will take you
to the Security page,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.200
where you can find out more information
about F-Secure Safe.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.600
Click Get Security and this
will take you to F-Secure's website,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.400
our internet security partner,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.800
where you can sign up and install
the software and then click Continue.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.160
You'll be creating an account
with F-Secure.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.920
Just fill in your details,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.680
and by the way, it's best to use
an email address that you use regularly,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.200
as after the end of the 12-month period,
you will be sent a reminder

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.000
to inform you
that your protection is due to expire.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.240
And once you're done, click Next.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400
Now you've registered,
you can add up to five devices

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.920
that you'd like to protect
with F-Secure Safe.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.520
Don't worry,
you can come back here at any time

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.240
by going to My Virgin Media
to add more devices.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.720
You can choose between
PCs, Macs, tablets and smartphones.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.240
To install on an Android smartphone,
just click on Install under Mobile.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600
And click on Another Device.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.920
This will ask you to
give your advice a name.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.280
I'm going to type in Heather's phone.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.720
And then click Add.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.920
You need to enter your mobile number,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.360
but remember to add +44
and drop the zero.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.960
And then click Send.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.360
And you should now receive
a text message.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960
When the text arrives

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.400
you'll be able to follow the link to
download F-Secure Safe on your mobile.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.000
So next, just open the link in the text
and open URL.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.480
And then swipe down
to view your downloads.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.200
And then Install.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.920
This may take a few moments to install.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.240
And then click Open.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.280
And then Accept.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.200
And Activate.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.360
And Activate again.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.760
If you haven't got a screen lock
on your phone,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.520
F-Secure will ask you to
set this up.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.760
It will now ask you for a security code.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.120
It needs to be at least
five digits long.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.080
Please make a note of this
as you'll need it later.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.720
You now have the option to add
a trusted number.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.080
If the SIM card in your device
has changed,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.520
a notification
will be sent to this number

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.960
or you can skip this and access it later
from the anti-theft settings menu.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.280
And then you will be asked
if you wish to scan your device

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.000
and we recommend you do.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.560
This can take a few moments

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.600
while it scans any potential
harmful files on your phone.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.200
Now the scan's complete,
just click Done.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.680
And then press the Home button
on the menu.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.920
Mobile security offers browsing
protection and virus scanning

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.680
and it is all accessible
from the menu down here.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.760
An additional feature of the mobile
version is remote anti-theft

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.920
and this allows you to wipe,
locate or lock your phone

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.880
in case of loss or theft.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.680
To turn this on, click Anti-Theft.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.000
And then on to Settings.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.600
Input your five-digit code
that we created earlier.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.080
And click OK.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.000
Make sure Anti-Theft enabled is ticked,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.640
so then you'll be able to send a message
to locate, lock or wipe your phone.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.240
Now this is all enabled,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.960
you will be able to send yourself
special text messages

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.080
to your phone from any other phone,

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.920
either to lock, locate or wipe.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.640
To do this, text...

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.520
..followed by the security number
that you set up earlier.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.000
Here we've covered how to set up
and use F-Secure Safe

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.520
on your Android smartphone.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.480
If you are interested in seeing
how it works on other devices,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.000
check out our videos.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.920
You can find out more information

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.360
in F-Secure's handy user guide
on their website.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.200
I hope this was helpful.
