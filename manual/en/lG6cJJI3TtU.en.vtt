00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.010
This is the male twelve-wired bird of paradise.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.280
He's calling to try and attract a female to
his courtship display pole in the low-land

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.240
swamp forest.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.860
Males usually have one pole in the forest
that they're very faithful to and really only

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.720
display from that one spot.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.340
Here he's doing a practice display, he's acting
like there's a female there and going through

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.840
the motions of his display.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.930
And there, notice that when he puts his breast
shield out and he pecks up, that's what he'd

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.010
be doing if a female was there.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.370
The twelve-wire bird-of-paradise, he gets
his named from these clusters of twelve wires

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.690
that is sticking off his rear end.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.720
The real question is what does he do with
those wires?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.551
And here we have a female who landed on the
branch below him.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.740
And what the male's got to do, he's to get
her interested.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.570
He's trying to give her plenty of opportunity
to not get too close and she's sitting there,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.470
sitting there, and he's like 'alright so you're
not going.'

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.640
And he immediately spins around and presents
his backside, those very feathers that give

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
him his name, moving them back and forth as
he's doing his dance across the face of the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.830
female.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.140
It's difficult to see in the video, but what's
really clear from Tim's stills is how those

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.470
wires are making contact with the female and
are really an important part of this display.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.360
We don't know what he females finds attractive
about the wires, we just have to assume that

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.780
they do find them attractive because they've
selected males to have that ornament.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840
Looks like he's having another go at it here.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.760
When the female's ready to mate she stays
at the top of the pole and the male will come

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.860
up and start pecking at her a little bit more
- pecking at her back or her nape.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.250
This female wasn't ready to mate so he goes
into his dance again.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000
But she leaves (laughter).

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.729
This is a great example of how courtship frequently
ends in birds-of-paradise.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.430
The display can progress all the way to the
point where the male is making contact and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910
the female is scrutinizing him up close.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.140
But ultimately she decides for whatever reason
not to mate.
