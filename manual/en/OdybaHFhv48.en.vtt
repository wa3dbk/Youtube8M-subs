Hi guys! This is just going to be a
product review; and I actually did this

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.500
video in reviewing the Mane 'n Tail
products back in the summer time when I

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310
first started using the entire product
line; and thought it was amazing and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.300
decided to do a product review like two
weeks after actually using it; and I

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
actually stopped using it and started --
and finally found my staple products and

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.860
my go-to products. I was actually
watching one of my videos - the Monistat

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
video for my MN challenge -- and I was
looking at my hair length and when I

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.130
brought it [my hair] to the front it was all even...

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.660
and for the past couple videos, I've been
talking about my hair and it's been

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.610
really UNEVEN; and I've talked about it on
Hairlista and a couple of haircare forums

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.820
that my hair is growing in an
upside down U-shape. My hair is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.210
actually -- these two sides come to about
here; and the rest of my hair comes to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.110
about here, so it's about a two inch
difference with my hair in the back; and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.500
it's like literally like an upside down
U. For June and July, I did not use any

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.150
growth aids at all; and the only thing I
was using was Mane 'n Tail and I

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.920
started thinking "Well that has to be it!
That has to be why my hair is, all of a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.860
sudden, growing in two different stages
right now!" I have the shampoo and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.360
conditioner, and I actually got these at
Walgreens for $3.99 for this gigantic

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.790
bottle. They had a sale going on. This is the consistency, so it's very -- it's

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.640
it's not too sticky, it's not too runny.
Kind of looks weird like this. It kind of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.430
looks like a liquid soap, actually. The
conditioner has a little bit of a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.890
yellow aspect, but it's still the same
consistency. It's a little I guess --

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.440
a little stickier; it's not as watery. It
was literally just the shampoo

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.170
conditioner and a couple other products
I was using from [them]. Until over the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590
summer, and that was it... literally
just washing, conditioning with this for

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.159
two months straight, and that was it. And
it does grow your hair; but for whatever

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.790
reason for me, it just didn't grow all
over my head, so it just grew on the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.739
outsides and not the middle of my hair.
My main thing was just to talk about the shampoo

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.510
and conditioner, because it has it made a
significant difference with my hair; and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.720
I wish I recognized it early on instead
of-- you know, like six months later!
