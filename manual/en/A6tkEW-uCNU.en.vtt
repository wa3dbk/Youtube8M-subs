&gt;&gt; The Gremblin: Modok,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.368
&gt;&gt; Modok: Okay, my little rotten chestnut.

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:25.904
I'll tell you all about
the Island of Secret Defenders.

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:34.187
&gt;&gt; Deadpool: Note to self, never make
hurricanes in a bucket on Tuesdays again.

00:00:34.187 --> 00:00:35.862
Ok, where am I?

00:00:35.862 --> 00:00:36.909
&gt;&gt; Hulk: Good day.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.759
You're on the island of Secret Defenders,

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:49.015
&gt;&gt; Deadpool: Okay, I'll bite.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.736
Why do they call you The Secret Defenders?

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:54.538
&gt;&gt; [NOISE]

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:56.842
&gt;&gt; Borg: What my associate
is trying to communicate,

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.758
is that they don't call us that.

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.454
We're called The Defenders.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.516
But alas, no one calls us.

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:04.073
At all.

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:06.237
&gt;&gt; Deadpool: Uh-huh.

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:08.752
Eenie, meanie, miney.

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:10.595

[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Deadpool: [LAUGH]

00:01:14.393 --> 00:01:16.020
Look at your faces!

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.277
Iâ€™m fine.
&gt;&gt; The Gremblin: Can you tell me a story

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.593
that makes sense, please?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.696
&gt;&gt; Modok: Okay, okay, but
then right to sleep you go.

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:27.668
Ah, thisâ€™ll do the trick.

00:01:27.668 --> 00:01:32.175
Your friendly neighborhood Spider Man
had a costume that was red.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.831
Well half of it anyway.

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:39.226
And if you ever fought him,
you would want that smart mouth dead!

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:44.361
But all of the great Avengers
wouldn't give web head a chance.

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.365
They never let spidey join them.

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:50.186
As they would ruin evil plans.

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:51.601
Heh?

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:57.225
Then one dastardly winter's eve,
the Avengers were tied up tight.

00:01:57.225 --> 00:02:03.957
Spidey, with your snarky wit,
won't you please help us tonight?

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.921
Then the Avengers loved him.

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:09.082
He helped them smash all night long.

00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:14.133
Spidey with the mostly red costume,
you're the hero of this song.

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:19.872
&gt;&gt; The Gremblin: Then what happened?

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.817
&gt;&gt; Modok: Oh, cripes kid the story's over.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:22.445
I don't know.

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:23.702
Use your imagination.

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.906
And get up this time if you're
gonna use the restroom.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:27.362
Don't just do it in the bed.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.463
&gt;&gt; Captain America: Avengers assemble.

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:31.650
&gt;&gt; Modok: What?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.987
&gt;&gt; Captain America: You're not taking
over Christmas this year Grinch.

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:38.479
&gt;&gt; Modok: Huh?
I'm not the, ow!

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.552
Ow, ow!

&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Modok: Ooh, that shield's got a point.

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:42.654
