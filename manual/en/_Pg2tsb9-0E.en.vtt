00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.880
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou AkA Tarou bringing

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.219
you this week's WoW Report Episode 19, Sunday
August 29th! For more FREE WoW guides, check

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.769
out my website at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.090
In this Tarou weekly WoW Report, the Auction
House is still pretty unstable with prices

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.610
all over the place so, I'll move straight
on to Cataclysm news. Make sure to post your

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.710
questions on my Twitter, Facebook, or below
in the comment section. As always, Blizzard

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.840
news and a Q&amp;A session will be included so
let's get started.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.829
In Cataclysm Beta news, some more screenshots
were released throughout the past week and

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.210
they all look very cool. I'm especially liking
this one. It brings back a lot of old school

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.949
memories doing BRD and Molten Core.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.190
Moving on to other Cataclysm beta news, another
Q&amp;A page was released and this time the focus

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.520
is on Azshara. The Q&amp;A answers a lot of questions
and it looks like the zone is ideal for Horde

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.350
levels 10-20. Goblin players are encouraged
to level here so they can get an expanded

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.899
look at the Goblin story line and shred some
light on already established characters. I

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.050
bet a lot of you haven't even stepped foot
in this zone considering it was ideal to skip

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.280
it while leveling in Wrath and even somewhat
in the Burning Crusade. They've really done

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.930
a remarkable job making it look pretty awesome
and I definitely can't wait to get a chance

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.500
to level in the zone. I suggest everyone who
rolls a Goblin or any character for that matter

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.940
to check this zone out when they hit level
10-ish.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.830
Ok, checking out some other Cataclysm beta
news, the stats section has been updated to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.750
include extra info that should help you decide
what stats you may need. Hovering over 'Hit

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.420
Chance' now displays the miss chance for your
level up to boss level. My 70 has a 4.89%

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.640
chance of missing while fighting a boss or
level 73. Definitely some helpful info for

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.070
any player.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.090
Another change we'll see in Cataclysm is Armor
Specialization. Players will also have more

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.120
reason to stick to their armor type so they
can gain different bonuses like 5% Intellect,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.300
Strength, Agility, or Stamina which is pretty
cool but, may annoy some players who constantly

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.030
find better stats on different armor types.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.650
Alright, moving along. Everyone should be
happy to know that Dual Talent Specialization

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.780
has been reduced to 100g. Yep only 100g down
from 1000g. Now I don't know if this carry

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.720
over into the live version of Cataclysm but
it is 90% likely it will.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.070
Keep in mind tons of details and numbers are
still being ironed out and anything can change

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.910
before the final Cataclysm expansion ships.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.060
If you still haven't been invited to beta,
there are contests going on all over and the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.160
latest one I found gives New Zealand and Australian
guilds a chance at 10 beta invitations for

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.870
their guild by simply submitting screenshots
of their guild's greatest triumphs and proudest

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.270
achievements. Five guilds will be selected
each week for five weeks so in all, 25 guilds

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.140
will be rewarded. Good luck to all who enter.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.950
In other Blizzard news, Blizzcon attendees
and anyone who orders a Blizzcon virtual ticket

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.500
will receive a 'Deathy' the murloc who is
decked out as Deathwing and doing his best

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.680
to shake fear into the heart's of Azeroth's
crustacean population.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.270
As with every week's report, I will have tons
of links, contest info, and screenshots of

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.550
everything on my website's blog for this week's
WoW report.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.900
Finally, I'd like to end this Tarou Weekly
WoW Report answering a few questions you guys

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.880
and girls have asked me over the last week.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.690
Q1. Will old school PvP titles be removed
in Cataclysm?

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.330
A1. Well, I don't know for sure but checking
my level 70 Mage I can tell you he still holds

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.830
the General title. I honestly don't see why
they would remove them and if they do, me

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.730
and a lot of people who worked hard to obtain
them will be pretty ticked. Instead, I think

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.590
they may use different titles so people aren't
confused.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.621
Q2. What does the Auction House look like
in Cataclysm?

00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:48.200
A2. In Orgrimmar there are several different
Auction Houses but my favorite so far is this

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.090
one ran by Goblins. It looks really nice and
hopefully they'll also update the Auction

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.180
House pane itself as well.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.540
Q3. Are the mount achievements removed in
Cataclysm?

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.420
A3. So far it doesn't look like they will
be removed. You'll probably still be able

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.780
to go back when you're 85 and breeze through
some achievements to get that mount you just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.459
couldn't seem to get during Wrath. While I'm
purely speculating, I think the designers

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.200
realized that this is a great way to get players
to head back to old content and complete some

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.760
achievements at the same time. Again though,
nothing is final and they could always remove

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760
them.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.740
So that's it for this week of Tarou's Weekly
WoW Report and I hope you liked it.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.590
Personally, I'm looking forward to leveling
my Goblin in Azshara. The place looks pretty

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.319
awesome and should bring back some classic
nostalgia.
