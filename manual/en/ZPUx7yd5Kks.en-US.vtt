Hi, Eric with Sennheiser. I'm here at Crutchfield
with the industries best and brightest, learning

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.389
about the brand new RS220 digital wireless
headphone system. Let's take a closer look.

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.960
The RS220 is based on the legendary HD600
platform, so the sound quality is exquisite,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.240
audiophile-grade quality. Audio comes from
this transmitter and charging dock via DSSS

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.460
that operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum.
What you get is full bandwidth audio without

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.160
any compression. It also gives you very low
latency when watching movies and other high

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.000
definition video sources. To charge the headphones,
simply place them on the charging dock. In

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.210
fact, you get 8 hours of full bandwidth audio
without wires. Now this transmitter also has

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.980
an impressive input/output array on the rear
side. Let's take a closer look. Here you have

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.960
analog inputs, digital coax inputs, and optical
inputs. Each input is mirrored by an output.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.110
This allows you to feed other audio sources
such as sound bars. You can select your source

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.660
right from the front panel of transmitter
or with the selectable switch on the headphones

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.180
themselves. The headphone itself has several
necessary controls for your listening enjoyment.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.180
On/off. Balance. Volume up and down. And of
course the input selector switch we just talked

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.700
about. This headphone will reach from the
transmitter up to 300 feet line-of-sight,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.300
but in practical usage, you may experience
30-100 feet even through walls and ceilings.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.240
Fantastic. You're untethered from your audio
source, no compromises. A very full accessory

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
kit is included to allow you to connect to
various audio sources and also power circuits

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.040
around the globe. Included are power supplies
for Europe, North America and Asia. As well

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.130
as an audio connect cable here in the RCA
format, a coax digital audio cable, the power

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.560
supply and an adapter convert RCA to a stereo
mini plug. There you have it. The Sennheiser

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.140
RS 220 digital wireless audio without compromise.
Thanks for checking it out.
