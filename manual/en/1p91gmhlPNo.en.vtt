00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.560
hey everyone now in this video I'll be explaining
car engines ,

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.350
now I know that for a lot of my subscribers,
this

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.800
will probably be just mostly review, but I
want to have a starting point where if someone

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.840
comes in new they can have a good way of getting
to seeing how cars work.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.470
so this is that way.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.690
And so were are going to talk about engines
and how they work.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.420
so first I'm just going to go through pretty
much

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.790
all the components within the engine and
then I'll talk about how they work together.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.850
so just starting at the top, we've got fuel
injectors which spray fuel into your intake

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.410
manifold
Here we got a camshaft that's

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.820
responsible for opening valves that allow
air to go in or out of the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
cylinder.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.290
We've got rocker arms which connect camshaft
to the valves.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.250
We've got these valves here which
open/close allowing air to come in or go out

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.310
depending on which side.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.790
We've got the cylinder here,
so depending on what kind of engine you

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.050
have the V eight, V six that's how many cylinders
you have, six cylinders for V six and 8 for

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.100
a V eight
so we got piston here this is what

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.079
moves up and down and when you turn this vertical
motion into

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.579
rotational motion in order to move your car
we've got connecting rod which connects

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.109
the piston to the crankshaft
we've got the crankshaft which is connected

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.459
to
all the different Pistons within the engine

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.469
and so they all supply the torque to this
rod.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.729
And then we've got a spark plug
which ignites the air/fuel mixture which you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.430
put in
so this video we're gogin to be looking at

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.920
a four
stroke gasoline engine pretty much most common

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.249
here in America
so that's why I chose it

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.479
so are how does all this work well you've
got

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.540
four strokes
so I got to go through each these, so I can

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.909
explain
what's happening here.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.251
so your first stroke is intake, so when you
have your intake stroke this valve here, your

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:44.270
exhaust is going to be closed.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.239
This camshaft here, is going to be rotated
enough so that this valve is pushed open,

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.999
there is a little spring here that compresses
and opens this valve.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:57.239
When it is compressed, when that's pressed
down, this piston is going to be at the top

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:03.209
and it going to be moving down so that piston
moves down its gonna pull and air fuel mixture

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.680
into this cylinder, so that the air fuel mixture
comes in from the fuel injector and the air

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.430
coming in from you're intake , so that's gonna
be the first step.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.900
Pulling in the air-fuel mixture into this
cylinder chamber.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
so that this piston will be all the way doen
here, at the bottom.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.790
NOw your next step is compression.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.151
So for compression, both of these valves will
be closed.This Camshaft will be rotated in

00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:33.129
a manner that neither of these are open, so
you can see there is a little lobe here, and

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.810
it rotates about this centre duct, so it only
open when the camshaft is pointed toward those

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.099
otherwise they're gonna remain closed.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.750
so both of these valves are closed, and our
piston is down here at the bottom.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.569
Now the next step is compression , that piston
is gonna move back up and as it moves back

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.349
up its gonna compress the air and the fuel
that are then put into inside of the cylinder.Now

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.109
finally the power stroke, once that piston
gets all the way to the top, a spark ignites

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.579
and you have a little explosion that occurs
and heres that fire spread and it forces that

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.319
piston back down into to the bottom.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.459
Now you've got just exhaust gases in here,
you've burnt up the oxygen, there is no oxygen

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.569
remaining but if you've burnt it perfectly
and so you want to get rid of that air so

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.450
this cam shaft here will rotate and pushing
this rocker arm, so this will open up this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.290
valve and as the cylinder, as the piston come
back up it pushes out the exhaust gas out

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.320
of this exhaust, the headers here, so thats
the final step.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.122
So lets once again go through those real,
quickly intake, you're pulling in the air

00:03:46.122 --> 00:03:50.840
and the fuel, that cylinder, that pistoon
moves down, compression, you're just squeseing

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.060
all that air and fuel mixture into a very
small space.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.189
Power stroke, you ignite that air fuel mixture
that pushes the piston down providing a torque

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.930
on that crankshaft and then exhaust, you wanna
get that air squeesed back out, so the piston

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.060
come back up and pushes out the remaining
exhaust, and then the cycle just repeats itself.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.380
and goes on and on and on.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.319
SO lets look at the big picture, so here,
we've got a basic two cylinder engine connected

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.500
to the crankshaft, so what happens after you've
supplied that torque to the crankshaft.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.620
Well that torque helps rotate the flywhell
which is connected to the crankshaft, and

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.389
that flywheel maintains a momentum the keeps
the engine running smooth and it is attached

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.520
to a clutch.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.250
If you buy a brand new car or a torque inverter
if you buy and automatic car , now that then

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.310
passes to a transmission depending on automatic
or manual transmission, and then so you have

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.889
gears in there, to change up the speeds, and
the torque passing through and then ultimately

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.849
you pass that torque to the drive shaft.

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.510
Now the drive shaft sends the torque to a
differential which puts the torque between

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.210
the left and the right tyres now this can
go either in the front or the back.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.660
In this drawing here, i've got it going to
the rear wheels, so these rear wheels are

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.070
driving and so that ultimately that torque
passes to these two wheels , they rotate and

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.810
the car moves forward, so thats the general
idea of a car engine and how it moves you

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.440
now i've got topics on all of these in much
bigger details and different types so you

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.849
can go in and look at those and understand
all these much better, so this is a great

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.460
starting point to see the general picture
of it all works and then from there you can

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.789
get into more detail of, say, a clutch or
torque inverter, differen transmissions, and

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.940
you know, flywheel, the engine, different
types of the engines, suspension setups everything,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.420
so it is a great starting point, if you understand
all this. and probably the next video that

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.599
you should watch, after this, would be diesel
versus gasoline and that would explain in

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.129
detail and how diesel engine differs from
a gasoline engine.
