00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.720
Hello, Polynesians, how are you? I am Karen and the truth is that I already had a lot of time that I wanted

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.039
to teach you to do something useful that you could use at any time and also

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.320
who would like it and the truth who does not love to put butter on everything, meat,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.460
when we make our breakfast, some fried egg or also bread at breakfast, or

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.660
also hot cakes, really, butter we use for many things, so I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.320
I will teach you 10 recipes of how you can transform your normal butter into flavor butter

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.800
and each one has different uses. I hope you like this video because it  actually

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.559
I loved it and these butters are delicious. For all butters that

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.359
I will teach you, you will use 150g of unsalted butter. Look very well for butter that is

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.039
and not margarine, the first one that we will prepare it is one of fine herbs which I think

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.340
it is the most common and has multiple uses, what we will need is butter a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.320
room temperature, salt to taste, 1/4 cup of basil, a clove of garlic, parsley,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.800
dill and rosemary. The first thing we are going to do it is put the butter in the bowl and add

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.760
ingredients. You mix it, for this, you can use a blender or a processor

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.340
of food, you can help with a balloon whisk. before they have to finely chop all your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.860
ingredients. The herbs that you use for this butter they can be fresh or dried.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.260
Use ones you get easily and you can also replace them or add another one

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
that you like, for example chives or tarragon. When you see that everything is perfectly

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.720
mixed, you will take cling paper, stretch it very well and in the center you will place the butter

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.160
prepared. Then you will cover it and entangle it in this way to give it this kind of shape

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.430
and ready! Now you have fine herb butter. This you can use when you prepare

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.890
beef fillet, fish, sauces or baked potatoes. I love it! Since you know preparation

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.970
detailed preparation for a butter salty flavor, I will give you the ingredients of another 4 more,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.840
next preparation it is a garlic one. For this, we will need 2 tablespoons of garlic powder, you can replace it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.900
for 2 cloves of minced garlic, remember that the herbs can be fresh or dried,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.320
a little fresh scallion, basil, remember that herbs can be fresh or dried.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.800
The 3rd one it is mustard, you're going to need 4 tablespoons of mustard, you can just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.190
Mix with a spatula, fork or spoon, you do not need a blender, it's excellent for

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.480
to prepare grilled chicken or sauces

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.520
4th preparation it is a chipotle  (smoked hot chilli pepper used in Mexican cooking.), you are going to use 4 tablespoons

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.780
of chipotle sauces, in this case I had a chipotle with tamarind and it is one that

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.569
I'll use it but with this I want you to realize that you can use any chipotle sauce,

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.860
remember to use a bowl or deep dish to mix all your butter.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.460
The fifth one is Cheddar cheese, this is very delicius, you will need 30gr of real cheddar cheese, do not

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.730
buy those that are already packaged, usually this type of cheddar cheese

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.880
You find it at the supermarket in bulk. For this, you will have to cut cheese in small

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.069
bits and use a blender or food processor, mix it well and cover it with

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.120
cling paper. I'll give you a sixth preparation, recently my brothers and I went to the cheese route

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.490
and it came, and in one of the places we got to taste an exquisite sauce that it is called

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.410
mix of chillies, so that you realize that you can use any type

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.840
of sauce, obviously sauce that you use has to have preservatives to prepare

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.980
a butter of flavor. So you know, if you have any favorite salsa, use it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.709
and make butter. And these are the 4 recipes of salty butters, now I will teach you

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.220
to prepare 5 types of sweet butters. For the 1st we will do is one of strawberries

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.740
natural You will need half a cup of clean and dry strawberries. if strawberries are a little watery

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.480
It will be much better, teaspoons of sugar and 150g of butter at room temperature.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.000
For this, cut the strawberry into small pieces and put it in the blender or

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.900
in a food processor to mix it perfectly and wrap it in vitafilm paper.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.980
The 2nd preparation is a mango one, I love it! For this, I will use mango jam, in which I will have to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.100
use 2 tablespoons and I will also put natural mango, because I want to feel

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.700
mango bits. Put them in blender and wrap it in cling paper, with this recipe,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.530
you give yourself idea that you can prepare fruit butter of any flavor. You can also

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.930
use your favorite jam, even if, do not use sugar because jam

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.680
has sugar

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.240
The 3rd preparation it is of lemon. What you will need it is a trickle of vanilla

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.000
and a fresh lemon. You will put everything in a bowl and you will add juice of half of

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.090
a lemon, to add aroma we will put the vanilla and zest of the same lemon.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.130
Mix it very well with a balloon type beater (remember that butter should be

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.380
at room temperature) to make it easier to mix all the ingredients.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.900
The last preparation it will be sweet spices, you'll need a teaspoon of cinnamon powder, a pinch

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.780
of cloves, half a teaspoon of nutmeg. Mix all powders perfectly

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.420
and add them to your butter, beat very well until there is a homogeneous mixture and wrap it,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.920
You can use this butter when you prepare pancakes or cakes, you will see that they will have

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.880
a unique and delicious flavor. All these sweet butters recipes, you can use them

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.990
for your hot cakes, waffles, for when you only crave a slice of bread with milk,

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.710
You can put one of these butters and it will be delicious. all these butters

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.710
They last approx. 20 days. Natural fruits last 10 to 15 days because they do not contain

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.300
conservatives and keep them in your refrigerator.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.500
