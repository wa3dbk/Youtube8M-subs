00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.610
This video shows you how to scan with your
HP printer in Windows 8 using the software

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.000
that was provided with your printer.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.470
In this video we will use a mouse to select
items. If you are using a touch-screen computer

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.810
you will tap the selection whenever the video
says click.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.730
Your HP printer comes with software that you
can use to perform a variety of tasks, including

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.000
scanning. You can also download the latest
software for your printer from HP.com/support.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.149
Because installing the printer software is
unique for each model, we will not provide

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.000
those instructions here.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.389
On your computer, right-click the lower left
corner of the computer screen 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.389
to open the menu.

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:55.959
Click Search.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:59.519
Click Apps, if not already selected.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.629
Type HP and the model number of your printer.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.250
Click the icon with your model number listed
to open the HP Software.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.229
Under the scan section, click “Scan a Document
or Photo”.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.950
There are other scan options available, but
for the purpose of this video we will use

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.740
these example instructions.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.740
When the scan dialog opens, adjust any settings
you want to change, and then click Scan.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.159
When the scanned image opens, you can preview
the final image before saving. Adjust any

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.960
desired settings and then click Save.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.500
In the “Save As” prompt, choose where
you want to save the file and then click Save.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.700
The software will then scan the image with
your chosen settings and save the file.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.960
When the scan is complete, the folder where
you saved the file will open.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.500
To view the saved image, double-click the
file from the folder.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.200
