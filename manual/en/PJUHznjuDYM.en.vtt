"Not Too Old"

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:31.583
Hm. Beep beep!

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.124
Hi Max.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.542
What are you doing, playing with this car?

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.680
Playing with it? I'm too old for
playing with kid stuff like that. I'm

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:46.732
just, cleaning up my bedroom, throwing
out things I don't need anymore.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.500
Hold on! I'm not too old! Let me have it!

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.458
You want some old thing... like this??

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:54.667
Uh-huh!!

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.375
Oh come on, really??

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.875
I got this when I was like three!
You're too big for it aren't you??

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.208
I'm a big boy, Mom says so.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.633
All right then I guess this matter's solved.
(React) We're

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.999
both too old to be playing with cars.
Run along now.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Wait can I just...?

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.167
Thanks for stopping by!

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:11.917
Hmm...

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:14.958
Don't worry little guy, I'm
not getting rid of you!

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:19.269
I know! Will you let me take that car apart?
I can pretend

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:22.167
to be a mechanic, like a
grownup, come on give it!

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:22.875
No way!

00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.667
Do you still want it?

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:31.583
Yeah! Uh, No! It's just You can't take it apart.
You don't have the right tools for the job.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:35.500
You can't be a mechanic without tools, so
you'll have to think of something else.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.667
I know what to do, I'll be right back!

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:42.917
Now where can I hide you? Ooo!!

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.458
OK I'm ready! So where did it go?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.625
I don't know! I lost it! It was
right here, and then it was gone!

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.667
There it is!! I'll get it!

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.000
Hi-YAH!!!

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:06.917
I don't think a hammer's the
best tool for you to use.

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:10.399
You can't go around pounding people!
That really hurt!

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:14.040
Sorry, it was an accident.
I'll never hit you with a

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:17.691
hammer again. Really! I'll go
find another tool to use!!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.542
Look! I definitely know how
to use this one. Let me see!!

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.750
Hey!

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.298
Hang on there, you seem to be much
better with the hand saw, but you need

00:02:34.323 --> 00:02:37.607
some more practice, so why don't you
stay here and work, I'll be back!

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.708
What does he want me to practice on?

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:51.292
Max!! You gotta see this!!!

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.401
I sawed your skateboard in half!
I think I'm ready

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:58.732
to work on your old car now!...
Hm. Where is he?

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.250
Where are you?...

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.875
Oh hi Kid! I've been looking all over for you!

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.292
Can I have the car now? Huh?

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.500
The car?? What do you mean?? Oh that!!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.125
Listen! Did you hear that??
You won't believe this!!

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:38.555
I was walking around, and I
wound up in the attic. Just

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.357
then, a ghost came. He told
me to give the car to him.

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:46.167
Why would he want it? Doesn't
he know it's for babies?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.417
Well, I forgot to say he was a baby.

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:17.042
Oh well. I guess I'll find
something else to take apart.

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:26.250
Uh, have you seen my hammer and saw around?

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:31.833
Who cares?! So I've got a toy car! It doesn't
matter, I'll play what I want! All right??!!

00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:35.250
So I'm seven years old!! Big deal!!!

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:42.417
Beep beep!
