00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.140
Plenty of lovely, new carbon at Tirreno-Adriatico
- &nbsp;as well as one stalwart of the pro peloton

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
– the Giant TCR, a model that’s been around
since the days of Once.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.070
This one’s got a Team Blanco twist for 2013,
Dura Ace groupset throughout, the wheels are

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.270
Shimano, too.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.240
Something special we spotted on Lars Peter
Nordhaug’s machine – have you seen it

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.460
yet?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.580
All will be explained - first here’s team
mechanic Tim Dejonghe to talk us through this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.039
lovely bike.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.519
So we’re using the TCR and we also have
sprinters working with the Propel.

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.420
All of our riders are very happy with the
bikes.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.089
One of the new features we have is the 11
speed Shimano.

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.390
The big changes between the 11 and 10 speed
they are the cables.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.969
&nbsp;The thinner cables are easier to put through
the frames and also don’t have this particular

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.219
cable for this particular part.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.789
Now you can use any cable that fits your length
frame, so if you want to use short or long

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.120
cable you can do whatever you want.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.329
It says team prototype on them but what that
means from Vittoria if somebody started selling

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.549
them to somebody else, they can find it back
because they are made for a team, so somebody

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.460
from a team is selling our tubes, so that’s
why it’s on there.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.890
It’s a normal standard one you can buy in
the shops.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.090
We have guys who are using 23s, we have guys
who are using 25s, it’s a preference of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.090
each rider.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.659
These are the standard Shimano brake blocks
we are using.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.320
They are very happy with them.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.469
They give us a long time using, even in the
rain so they are much better than the old

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.469
cork system.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.190
He’s using the Pro compact handlebars.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.810
More and more people are starting to use it
because you can put your top lower but the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.109
bottom of your handlebars is still high, so
that’s why they’re doing it.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.720
We’re using the Shimano C50s or C35s.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.549
We even have some guys using the 75s but that’s
mainly the sprinters using those.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:01.409
We have a few frames, XS, S, M, M/L, L and
XL – so six sizes of frames.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.229
Our bikes, we just tested them for Paris-Nice
for the time-trial uphill.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.229
6.8kg our bikes were – even for the Propel.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.760
Thanks for the explanation, Tim.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.319
Now who was paying close attention?

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.450
See that little black box on the chainset.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.180
It’s a new powermeter from Pioneer, the
catchily named SGY Pm900.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.290
The riders had it just two days when we filmed
it.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.620
So far it’s amazing.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.340
It’s very accurate, but now I’m trying
to figure out more and more and learn more

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.810
and more about the program, but so far it
works very good.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.939
It’s a lot of function, it’s so much to
learn.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:52.970
I can see the power in each crank, where I
put my power in each pedal stroke, where I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.620
put my power in each pedal stroke, both right
and left leg, so that will help in the future

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.570
to develop a good, efficient pedal stroke.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.180
Stay tuned to GCN for more tech news from
the pro ranks at Tirreno and all the other

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.410
top races this season.
