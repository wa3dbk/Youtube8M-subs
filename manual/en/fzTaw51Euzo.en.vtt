00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.520
[Narrator]
When Dawson and Leanne Clark built their home

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.750
in Round Rock,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.140
they also built a garden of family memories
with their children Drew and Amy,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.260
and their dogs, Jenny and Abby.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.910
They wanted to give their outdoor rooms the
same attention they gave the ones inside.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.620
[Dawson Clark]
We moved in in November of 2003

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.090
and at the time...when we bought the house
it was nothing I mean,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.620
the native trees were here and there was no
grass.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.570
And we had worked with a landscape firm in
Temple where we moved from,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.290
some good friends of ours, named Mike and
Kay Lynch owned a firm up there called Earthscapes.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.390
[Narrator]
Mike and Kay also designed a split-level deck

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.420
around the trees.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.010
[Dawson]
And in spring and fall of course when the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.970
weather's at its prime here in Central Texas

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.780
we grill almost every night we eat on the
deck

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.570
we spend time outside and just have loved
experiencing the garden

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.399
and being outdoors in that way.

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.790
And then from there Leanne and the kids

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.459
and I began just inserting things

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.810
and like every gardener we tried some things
in one place that didn't work

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.380
and we've moved things around and done all
kinds of things since then.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.009
It's been a real adventure; we've loved every
minute of it.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:44.229
[Narrator]
As the garden matured, it dictated some of

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.170
the changes.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.539
The landscape architect that did the initial
design commented when she was here the very

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.520
first time she visited the site,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.939
that we would be amazed at how quickly these
native elms would grow once the garden began

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.549
to be fertilized and irrigated

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.720
and that's certainly been true.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.560
When we planted the garden there were many
areas that were in full sun

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.110
so we initially planted a lot of sun-loving
plants

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.570
and we are slowly but surely losing a big
portion of those sunny areas

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.820
and they're being transformed to areas with
a lot of shade.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.310
[Narrator]
But as a result, there's a spot for hostas,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.860
including some Dawson once carried in a suitcase
from a colleague's garden in Pennsylvania.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.800
Because of their story I dug them from the
garden in Temple

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.370
and brought them with me here and they have
absolutely loved the garden here in Round

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.370
Rock,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.260
so there's just something about the soil here
that they love.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.480
It's been an interesting challenge to keep
things in the right spots based on the light

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.130
needs.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:16.900
But that's okay but most gardeners are always
digging

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.570
and moving and replacing plants

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.330
so it's been fun to do that and really has
given me an opportunity to take the hostas

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.520
that I love so much

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.900
and to kind of spread them around a little
further.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.990
[Narrator]
Along with planting, the family pitched in

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.410
all hands for toolbox projects.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.569
My son Drew has been really kind of my right
hand guy in the garden for the major projects;

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.970
we built the fountain.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:52.069
I had scavenged some limestone from it was
abandoned from a construction site in the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.069
neighborhood

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.310
so we broke up that stone and created a pathway
around that fountain

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.120
which we've really loved,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.950
and it's just so nice to sit on the deck and
listen to the water splashing over the edge

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.010
of that fountain; in fact,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.600
the neighbors even can hear it

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.730
and they talk about how much they enjoy sitting
outside

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.850
and listening to our fountain splashing in
the backyard.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.150
[Narrator]
Everyone in the family enjoys Dawson and Drew's

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.860
arbor and porch swing.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:34.740
Father and son also built the pathway for
the garden shed.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:44.810
[Dawson]
We built all of that together we really had

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.110
a good time doing it.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.290
He's going to be a senior in high school next
year

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:54.789
and will be leaving so it's been nice to have
those things together and to enjoy them.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.830
[Narrator]
The stepping-stones that Drew and Amy made

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.870
a few years ago made family history too.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.979
Dawson picked up their creativity with his
mushrooms out of stones.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.590
The garden's also connected to family with
the 1800s ice cream table

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.979
that Leanne's grandparents found and restored
in the pharmacy

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.479
and soda shop they owned from the 1930s to
the 50s.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.990
Dawson's grandmother, Leatrice, contributed
daylilies that grew in her garden 50 years

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.229
ago.

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:41.710
For the Clarks, layers of collected history
turned a new backyard into a family time capsule.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.319
You know some people are lake people

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.949
and some people are big sports families

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.599
and they play all the sports and things like
that

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.870
and really our family has just been kind of
a garden family.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.620
I mean, don't get me wrong, my son still loves
to play sports

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.580
and he loves basketball with his buddies,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.879
but the thing we have done through our married
life

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:10.610
and have really enjoyed doing on our weekends
is just to kind of piddle around in the garden

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.819
outdoors.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.939
When we moved here and had this completely
blank slate to start from it really was a

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:19.939
wonderful challenge

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.289
and a great experience for us to just put
this together.
