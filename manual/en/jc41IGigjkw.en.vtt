00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.360
Viswamithra and the princes

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.260
then proceeded to Mithila.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760
This city was ruled by King Janaka.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.740
He had a daughter named Sita.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.460
King janaka had declared,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.300
that whoever managed to

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.540
lift the divine Rudra's bow and string it

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.680
would get his daughter Sita's hand in marriage.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.000
The bow was brought

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.000
on an eight wheeled chariot.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.080
Many strong warriors had tried

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.420
lifting the bow but failed.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.180
Viswamithra asked Rama to lift the bow.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.380
Rama lifted the bow with ease.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.160
Placing one end against his toe

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440
he put forth his might

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.900
and bent the bow to string it.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.120
Then the bow broke into two parts.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.920
King Janaka was speechlessly joyed.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.960
He blessed Rama

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.040
and announced in the court

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.520
that his beautiful daughter Sita

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.340
would wed the brave prince.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.740
King Janaka sent messengers to Ayodhya

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.600
to convey the happy news

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.640
to king Dasaratha and to invite him

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.700
for the wedding of their children.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820
King Dasaratha was delighted

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.120
to hear this news

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.840
and reached Mithila

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.320
along with his wives, his ministers

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.600
sage Vasishta and others

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780
to take part in the wedding.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.020
Janaka arranged for a grand wedding.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.160
Rama married Sita

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.400
and at the same time.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.700
Lakshmana marired Sita's sister Urmila.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.680
Bharatha and Shatrugana married.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720
Sita's cousins Mandavi and Shruthakrithi.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.880
A grand feast had been arranged

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.440
for all the citizens.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.700
The newly wed couples

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.700
were blessed by one and all.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.700
Dasaratha returned to Ayodhya

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.620
with his sons and daughters-in-law.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.100
King Dasaratha was growing older.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.160
So, he wanted to crown Rama as the king.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.120
Dasaratha therefore consulted his ministers about this.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.020
They unanimously welcomed the suggestion.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.260
But, there was one woman

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.700
who grieverd to hear about Rama's coronation.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.200
It was Manthara.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.020
She was Kaikeyi's maid servant.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.660
She resolved to stop the coronation somehow or the other.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.300
She was the first to give the news

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.260
of the coronation to Kaikeyi.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.840
At first , Kaikeyi was overjoyed to hear

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.460
that Rama was to become the king.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.020
She loved Rama very much

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.120
but Manthara poisoned her mind.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.400
She told kaikeyi that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.040
if Rama became the king,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.820
then he would make bharatha his servant

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.020
and Kaikeyi would be nothing more

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.600
than a glorified maid of Queen Kausalya.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.240
Queen Kaikeyi who loved

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.580
Rama very much

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.700
now stood in fear of her own Position.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.460
Her mind was poisoned.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.060
Kaikeyi and Manthara hatched an evil plan.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.220
Dasaratha went to Kaikeyi's apartments

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.180
to convey personally the

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.440
glad news of Rama's coronation.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.520
But what a strange sight met his eyes!

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.080
Kaikeyi had thrown away all her ornaments.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.440
He asked her what the matter was

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.600
Kaikeyi recalled the day.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.140
when she had saved the life of Dasaratha

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.420
from the demons  in a fierce battle.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.460
At that time,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.280
Dasaratha had promised two boons to her

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.900
which she could ask of him anytime.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.260
And she wanted them now.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.180
The first boon was to

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.460
crown Bharatha as the crown prince

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.360
and the second one

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.020
to send Rama to the forest for 14 years.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.560
Dasaratha could hardly believe his ears,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.540
he turned pale and speechless.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.400
He pleaded with Kaikeyi

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.220
to ask for anything else.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.400
But she wouldn't change.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.720
Slowly it sank into Dasaratha

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.380
that he would have to oblige Kaikeyi with her two boons.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.220
Soon Rama was summoned

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.160
into Kaikey's chambers

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.740
and she told Rama

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.780
everything about her boons.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.240
Rama listened to her patiently.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.160
Rama believed that it was

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.720
more important to obey a mother's wish

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.580
and honour a father's committment

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.780
than anything else.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.600
So he agreed to go to the forest.
