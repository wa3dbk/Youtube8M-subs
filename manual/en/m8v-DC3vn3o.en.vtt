00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.610
Hello Cubing World! As some of you may have noticed

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.160
we haven't had a video in a while on
this channel. But we're certainly getting the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.549
ball moving again so

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.039
look forward to more videos in the
coming weeks. But I hope this video finds you

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.789
all having a good holiday season

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.929
or, if you're watching this video in the
future, a good other kind of season.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.189
Today, I just want to talk a little
bit about what makes the cubing community

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.370
special. Now, this is something I've been thinking about recently, because

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.989
I know that I have and I think most you
probably have

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.809
a feeling that there's something really
special about cubing, and

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.949
you know, I've been trying to think about what that might be, and so

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.320
what I started was taking a look

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.429
at what the cubing community. What we have is an activity,

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.829
the activity of solving Rubik's cubes, and it's a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.230
fun addictive activity, that we all come
together

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.809
through an online community to, you know,
talk about and share.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.100
And we do it through Facebook and
YouTube, and forums and all sorts of stuff like that.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.100
We've got thousands and thousands of
people who share this interest in this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.040
activity, you know, talking about it, and that's really cool

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.149
and, you know, people are sharing ideas and techniques and all sorts of stuff.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.400
And then, at the same time, we have people meeting at competitions to see each other,

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.619
and to hang out, and to make new friends, and to, you know, share stuff

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.729
about cubing and all that other stuff as
well, and

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.500
you know, for the most part, everyone's
really nice,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.180
and, in general, you know, it's a really
welcoming and friendly community

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.210
that's really easy for people to get
into and, you know, right now,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.409
we're bigger than we used to be we're not
massive, but, you know,

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.920
its growing, we're going pretty quickly.
And I think that's really cool.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.950
And so, you know, the thing is, all that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.200
stuff I just listed, it's all really
great, but I don't think that

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.520
it's really special to cubing. Because you
can find plenty of other communities

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.700
centered around hobbies, that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.890
you know, have a really fun activity or
exist online,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.920
or, you know, where people come together
to do it, or where people are really

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.440
friendly and welcoming. You know, that's
not specific to cubing.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.270
And I started to get a little discouraged as
I was thinking about this, because

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.489
you know, it seemed like, you know, cubing doesn't really offer anything that you can't get

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.800
from any other hobby.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280
You know, other than, of course, just the one action of

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
you know, solving Rubik's cubes and other
puzzles. But

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.500
then I kind of realized something. I realize
that what makes the cubing community special

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.019
is the same thing that makes my home
special or my friends special

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.110
or my family special. And that's the fact
that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.640
those things are mine. And, you know,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.800
the cubing community, I think the reason
why it should be special to each of us

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.800
is that it belongs to each of us and we are all collectively responsible for it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.300
and, you know, we all are invested in it,
and we all want to get something out of it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.010
And so, I think that that's a really cool
thing,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.180
because, not only is cubing, as a whole, a
really cool thing, but it's a really cool

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.480
thing that we have all come together to
create.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.900
And I think that that is, you know,
what makes all that other great stuff so great.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.160
You know, all that stuff I listed before, the good attributes of the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.660
cubing community, I think that those
things are specially good, because we can

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690
come together and say that we created
this.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.030
You know, and it doesn't just belong to, you know, Feliks and Mats, and the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.840
fast people, or the super influential people, or the people with YouTube channels,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.650
it really belongs to all of us. And, you know,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.690
as individuals, we have our good moments
and our bad moments,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.900
as a community, we also have our good
moments and our bad moments, but

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.709
I think all of us who are truly invested
in cubing, really want to see it succeed.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.890
And, you know, really take great pride in it, and

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.060
you know, I think that that's what makes
it special,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.090
but I think it's a good thing to think
about moving forward into 2015

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.560
into, you know, the future of cubing, when
it's really something that's

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.500
growing very quickly. I think it's
an important thing to think about, because

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.510
it's good for all of us to acknowledge our role

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.230
in cubing. You know, even if you're, you know, some guy who no one's ever heard of,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
who's just sitting at home, solving Rubik's cubes, you have a role in the cubing community,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.700
and you have some impact on it.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.030
And I think that that's really cool, but
also kind of scary,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.380
because we are all responsible for the
community and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.919
you know, we all should strive to have a
positive effect on it.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.979
And so, I think that it's good for all of
us,

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.070
you know, to think about, you know, what
effect do I have on the community.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.970
And I think that if you have a positive
effect,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.000
then you'll feel good about that. And, you know, we all want the community to be

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.539
something that we can feel good about.

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.700
And so, I think we should all, you know, be
happy about where we are. Not trying to say that

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.490
you know, it's in a bad place, but at the
same time

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.210
I think that it's good to acknowledge
that we all

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.430
you know, collectively, you know, have a role

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.370
in making the community what it is. So I hope I've given you guys something to think about,

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.710
and thanks for watching, and have
happy holidays!
