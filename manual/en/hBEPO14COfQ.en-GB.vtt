Hi everyone. This is Bubbly J. In this video
I am going to show you how to braid your hair

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.880
in 2 quick styles.
Lets get started.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.349
We start by brushing the hair to the back

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.669
and sectioning it into 2 parts.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:46.300
Comb the section out nicely and start braiding.
We braid it right to the end and secure it

00:00:46.300 --> 00:01:00.550
with rubber band.
You do the same for the other side.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.740
We bring one of the ponytail up and secure
it with a "U"pin. You'll have to use 2 "U"

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.190
pins for this hairstyle.
One upwards and one downwards.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.560
If your hair is heavy, you may need a few
more.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.990
Because your hair is long you'll have to bring
the braid down and secure it with "U" pins.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.090
You do the same for the other side.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:44.729
And you go tuck this in in the space between
the braids. Make sure to put a "U" in into

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:54.649
the area you have tucked in.
And thats it for the first style.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.170
Lets move on to the second style.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.649
For the second style, we are gonna part her
hair to the side and brush it out. We are

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:15.540
gonna take a thick section of hair from underneath
and start to braid it up.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.280
If you dont want to do a normal braid, you
can also do a fishtail braid.This braid is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:32.710
going to act as a hair band to keep the hair
to the back.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.060
Secure with a rubber band.
You release the hair above and comb it out

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.940
again.
We then take the braid we just made and bring

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.840
it across and release the rubber band.
We then secure the braid with a bobby pin.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710
With this we are done with the two braided
hairstyles.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:28.390
This is Bubbly J. Thank you for watching.
