Hello, nerd here. 
After more than a year,
I think I'm definitely overdue for a new setup

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.799
video, so let's do one now. As you'll no-doubt
notice, I've gotten rid of lots of old equipment

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.380
recently and totally rearranged the PC desk
area, which has given me a lot of space to

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.570
work with. I also moved a couple of Spice
&amp; Wolf wall scrolls over to the back wall,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.380
which is nice, although the other wall is
still a bit of a mess right now so that's

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.230
going to need some attention. The side desk
is now home to my ever-growing music collection,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.309
as well as my amplifier (which is unfortunately
in need of repair), my 3TB external hard disk

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.870
and the microphone that I've been using for
the last year. On the main desk, I've got

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.449
two 27" 1440p monitors and the Surface Pro
that I reviewed last month. It's a much neater

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.639
layout than before, which I really happy with.
Down below, I've got my headphones (both pairs)

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:00.749
and the old Mac Pro which I recently sold
to build a new PC. Video on that soon. Right

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:06.530
across from that is my backup PC and my rather
iffy attempt at cable management. The Wacom

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.299
tablet is directly below the desk for easy
access and next to that is where I keep my

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.479
phone, my Nexus 7 and the 11" MacBook Air.
I finally got around to clearing out that

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.219
awfully cluttered drawer and it's now being
used to store lenses and various other things.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.390
The BluRay collection, on the other hand,
is exactly as it's always been, so not much

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.600
to see there. So that's what my desk area
looks like as of May 2013. And now to take

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.299
a look around the rest of the room. The TV
is still the same Samsung plasma from last

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.929
year and the drawers are all still very full,
but I have spent a bit of time cleaning them

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.770
up. As for the wardrobes, they have definitely
received a lot of attention. I've gotten rid

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.130
of huge amounts of old cables and components,
so everything's really nice and neat now,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.130
which it most definitely had not been before.
I've also moved the 21.5" iMac over to the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.240
digital piano and turned the back wall into
my wall of supercell posters, although I only

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.560
have space for two more. And there's my setup
as of May 2013. I hope you enjoyed it and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
until next time, Live Long and Prosper and
El Psy Congroo!
