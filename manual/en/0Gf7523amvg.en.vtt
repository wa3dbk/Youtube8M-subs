00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.370
My name is Dr. Stefan Prada.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.650
I’m one of the spine surgeons at Laser Spine
Institute.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.180
At this time, I’d like to discuss the cervical
artificial disc replacement.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.411
The cervical artificial disc has many benefits
to it.

00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:28.740
It is indicated for use in people with radiculopathy
with or without neck pain.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.080
Radiculopathy would include pain, numbness,
or weakness in the arms.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.860
The cervical artificial disc replacement is
a newer technology.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.010
It has many benefits of the standard, traditional
anterior cervical fusion.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.430
In some instances, the fusion is necessary.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.580
However, the benefits of the artificial disc
is that it preserves the motion — the normal

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.440
motion — at that level of the spine.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.080
Whereas a fusion will eliminate motion of
the disc, where you’re fusing, the cervical

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.440
artificial disc continues to preserve normal
motion.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.890
It can be used above or below a previous fusion.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.970
This video will show artificial disc replacement.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.850
It is placed through the front of the neck.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.260
A bur is used to remove bone spurs, or osteophytes,
from the front of the vertebra.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.030
The entire disc space is then cleared of any
disc material.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.390
The transverse centering tool is then used
to mark the midline of the vertebra.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.780
The midline is marked with two pin holes — one
above and one below the disc space.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.810
The anchor post is then drilled, using an
alignment guide.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.630
One drill hole is placed above and one below
the disc space.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:07.420
Anchor posts are then inserted with a driver
— one above and one below the disc space.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:18.280
An anchor distractor is then placed over these
posts and locked into position.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.550
An intradiscal distractor is then placed in
the vertebra space to widen it.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.390
The anchor distractor holds the space open.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.950
A bur is then used to smooth and prepare the
bone edges for the Bryan artificial disc.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:44.340
All spurs are removed and the bone surfaces
are smoothed and flattened.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.180
A milling handpiece is then inserted into
the space created.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.310
This device will make dome-shaped holes in
the vertebra bone above and below the disc

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.430
space.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.490
The Bryan cervical artificial disc is then
inserted completely assembled.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.780
The distraction is removed, and the disc placed
appropriately.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:21.599
The motion is preserved as noted in the image.
