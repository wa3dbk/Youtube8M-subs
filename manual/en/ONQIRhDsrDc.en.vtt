00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.700
Hello, I'm Kay McGrath, welcome to Saving
Our Skin. Here we look at outdoor workers,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.260
focusing on the importance of the
prevention and early detection of skin

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.100
cancer. You'll hear about workplace
health and safety requirements of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.129
employers and employees, what you can do
to be protected in the workplace and

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.670
important early detection messages. Now
it's over to Lisa Norman. Employees who

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.890
work outdoors for all or part of the day
are at risk of skin cancer. That is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.610
because sun exposure can lead to skin
damage which is permanent, irreversible

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.060
and increases with each exposure. Outdoor
workers, both full-time and part-time,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.960
have a higher than average risk of
developing skin cancer and this is from

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.640
the long period spent working in the Sun
all year round over many years of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.420
working life. Numbers don't lie and it's
estimated that 1.2 million outdoor

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.080
workers across Australia face an
increased risk of developing skin cancer.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.319
Unfortunately Queensland has the highest
rates in the world with one in two

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.630
Queenslanders being diagnosed at some
point during their lives. Outdoor workers

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.759
are at greater risk from basal cell
carcinoma or BCC and squamous cell

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.679
carcinoma or SCC. In Australia it's
estimated that around 200 melanomas and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.100
34,000 non-melanoma skin cancers per
year are caused by occupational exposure.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.890
So what is skin cancer? Skin cancer
occurs when the skin cells are damaged

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.600
by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun
and change into malignant or cancerous

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.320
lesions. The three main types of skin
cancer are basal cell carcinoma, squamous

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.700
cell carcinoma and melanoma. Basal cell
carcinoma or BCC is the most common skin

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.040
cancer, accounting for 75 percent of all
skin cancers. It looks like a small

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.630
rounded lump with the pearly edge which
may bleed or look like a sore that won't

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.010
heal. BCC's mainly occur in exposed areas
such as the head, neck, upper trunk and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.840
limbs. So outdoor workers are at a higher
risk of bccs and may develop several

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.500
over a lifetime. Squamous cell carcinomas
or SCC's account for twenty percent of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.920
all skin cancers and grow more rapidly
than bccs. They appear as a flat scaly

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.230
area which gradually thickens. Bleeding
and ulceration may occur and the area

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.090
may feel tender. SCC's usually occur on
the head, neck, hands, forearms, trunk and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.120
lower limbs, which are areas that outdoor
work is frequently exposed to the Sun.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.230
Melanoma accounts for only five percent
of all skin cancer cases but is

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.180
responsible for eighty percent of all
skin cancer deaths. It's the most

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.010
dangerous form of skin cancer and can
appear at any age and on any area of the

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.440
body, not only those exposed to the Sun.
The first sign of a melanoma is usually

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.820
a change in a freckle or mole or the
appearance of a new spot on normal skin.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.020
If left untreated, BCC's SCCS and
melanomas can all become potentially

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.940
fatal in as little as six weeks.
How can you ensure you're protected

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.590
against the dangers of ultraviolet
radiation? Prevention: it's your best form

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.220
of protection. Under the workplace health
and safety act 1995, employers, workers

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.720
and the self-employed have a legal
obligation to maintain a safe working

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.130
environment and reduce the risk of all
types of injuries and hazards to health

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.890
while at work. To work safely in the Sun
everyone should follow workplace sun

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.140
protection policies and practices, attend
training and use supplied protective

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.880
equipment as instructed. Cancer Council
Queensland recommends that all

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.020
workplaces have a comprehensive sun
protection program in place that

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.790
includes the following steps: conduct a
risk assessment in consultation with

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.180
staff to identify those who have a high
risk of exposure to UV radiation, provide

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.640
shade for shelter from direct sunlight
or relocate work to shaded areas,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.110
reschedule work that requires
exposure to direct Sun to times with

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.370
less UV intensity - before 10am and after
3pm, wear protective clothing and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.800
equipment - for example collared long
sleeve shirts, trousers or long-sleeve

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.910
overalls, broad-brimmed or bucket hats or
hard hat brim attachments, sunglasses

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:23.110
that comply with this standard and broad
spectrum SPF 30 plus sunscreen. Provide

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.430
training for the workplace to increase
knowledge of the effects of UV radiation

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.960
the importance of the sun protection
strategies and the benefits of early

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.420
detection and skin self-examination.
Cancer Council Queenland can help you

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.860
with this by providing trained community
speakers to present skin cancer

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.970
prevention and early detection
information. For bookings or more

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.120
information call the Cancer Council
helpline on 13 11 20. Document sun

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.770
protection strategies in a written
policy - this should include a process to

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.910
monitor compliance and should outline
all protective measures necessary for

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.630
adequate sun protection. So after seeing
these

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.830
six steps you now know how to minimize
your risk of skin cancer in the

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:18.290
workplace. And finally some important Q&amp;A.
How dangerous is melanoma? Melanoma can

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.060
become potentially fatal within six
weeks. Know the warning signs and the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.440
normal look of your skin, so you can
detect it early. So how important is

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.590
early detection? Prevention is vital but
early detection can save your life. The

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.130
majority of skin cancers can be
successfully treated and cured if

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.070
detected early enough. What are some
health and safety requirements?

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.740
Occupational health and safety
legislation requires employers to

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.420
monitor the health of employees. In
regards to skin cancer, this involves

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.000
encouraging employees to examine their
own skin. Any tips on self-examination

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.430
and what do I look for? It's important to
be familiar with how your skin normally

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.650
looks so you can identify a new spot or
an existing one that has changed.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.710
Remember to check everywhere including
between your toes and underneath

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.630
fingernails and get someone to check
your scalp. What do i do if i find a

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.040
suspicious-looking spot? Any new or
existing spot that has changed shape

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.260
size or color should be investigated
further. Keep regular appointments with

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.790
your GP or skin cancer specialist and
seek medical advice if you notice

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.880
something irregular. Now you know your
roles and responsibilities in the

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.040
workplace when it comes to skin cancer
prevention and early detection. Remember

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.870
that prevention and early detection is
the best protection. For more information

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.960

Council helpline on 13 11 20 or visit
