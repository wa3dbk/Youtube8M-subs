Hello, my name is Michael DeSanti.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.710 line:15%
I graduated IIN in 2010.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.760
And I started my company,

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.540
Authentic Self Healing shortly after.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.550
And now I'm a full time health and wellness coach

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.920
at a wellness in Verona, New Jersey where I work

8
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.200
alongside two chiropractors, an accupuncturist,

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.760
massage therapy and it's a place we've created

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.137
for health and healing so no matter who comes in,

11
00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:28.880
they could be treated.

12
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.130
A typical day for me is, I walk into my center,

13
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.670
say good morning to all my, all the employees.

14
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.589
I see on average, about six seven eight people a day.

15
00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.820
I work an hour a day with each of them.

16
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.350
One client that really stands out in my mind.

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.830
When I met her, she was obese and depressed and diabetic.

18
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.330
I remember her saying to me, and I don't like vegetables.

19
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.560
And in the year and a half that we've been working together,

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.760
she's lost maybe 80 pounds.

21
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.090
And now she posts pictures on Facebook of smoothies

22
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.720
that she makes and homemade food that she makes.

23
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.880
And she's one of those people that just makes

24
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.112
our center come alive.

25
00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:12.560
(upbeat guitar music)

26
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.970
You know, coaching men is, has been

27
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.230
a really fulfilling thing for me.

28
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.941
If you could factor health and a healthy lifestyle and

29
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:25.790
weight and happiness into a man's perspective

30
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.940
of accomplishment, you could see amazing things happen.

31
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.250
I've seen the power of nutrition and diet and lifestyle

32
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.360
ever since I was a young guy.

33
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.410
When I was 17, my mother was diagnosed with cancer.

34
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.980
She had a mastectomy, but what she ended up doing was,

35
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.700
meeting a massage therapist.

36
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.530
And every time she would come back from these massages,

37
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.900
she would be so inspired.

38
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.840
She'd be like, hey did you know sugar feeds cancer?

39
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.240
We appealed and changed the environment in her body

40
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.050
through food and through nourishment and through lifestyle.

41
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.470
And that was 1997.

42
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.450
And it's now 2014 and my mother's alive and well and

43
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.890
the cancer's never come back.

44
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.110
The ability to relate to men, to women that

45
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.110
you know, if they're suppressing something that's really

46
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.700
making them happy, we wanna get that involved in their life.

47
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.970
And if you give them nothing but hope and inspiration and

48
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.600
a little bit of guidance, then you've given them

49
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.186
something that's absolutely invaluable.

50
00:02:22.186 --> 00:02:25.353
(upbeat guitar music)
