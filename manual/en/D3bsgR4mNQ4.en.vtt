00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.210
2014 Lincoln MKZ -- TestDriveNow.com Video
Review: We know the company's storied history,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.770
so the question today is where is Lincoln's
future?

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.280
Well, I can confidently state that if it looks
as good as the new MKZ things are going to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.430
be more than okay.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.850
Though the MKZ debuted last year in a slow
rollout, this 2014 model is the first one

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.050
that'll really gain traction in the marketplace.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.090
And I've been anticipating this week-long
test drive for a while, hoping that the renaissance

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.079
of Ford's luxury brand would take off in the
right direction.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.620
And I'm glad to report that it most certainly
has.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.749
It all starts with a sensuously penned body
-- the first created by a dedicated team from

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.269
the new Lincoln Design Studio.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.519
No matter at which angle your eyes catch it,
the MKZ warrants a stare.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.780
It's uptown sophisticated, conservatively
athletic, a tad retro and proudly American

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.670
all at once.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.440
Opt in for the $495 Ruby Red paint and the
swaggering 19" polished aluminum wheels with

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.880
painted pockets and you've got yourself a
fantastic looking ride.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.280
And though the MKZ shares much in common with
the Ford Fusion -- a beautifully designed

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.690
car in its own right -- it's a pleasure to
see that it possesses its own, individualized

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.090
style.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.620
Unlike its Ford-branded cousin the Fusion,
the MKZ can still be ordered with good old

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.780
fashioned V6 power.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.340
But here in this example is the company's
successful 2.0-liter turbo.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.480
And it still provides the luxury car buyer
with a heaping dose of refined power not to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.410
mention better MPGs. ...22mpg city/31mpg highway
on regualr to be exact.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.620
Front or all-wheel drive and even a hybrid,
the MKZ gives you choices.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.560
Fittingly, my tester is an AWD model with
Pirelli high performance all-season rubber

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.000
doing the work.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.479
A set of winter tires would be a must for
me but I can't complain how the MKZ handled

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.290
its snowy travels.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.890
And when I did catch some dry pavement, the
MKZ stuck confidently in the corners and felt

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.350
eager to exercise the 4-cylinder's lively
270 pound-feet of torque and 240 horsepower.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.230
There's a feeling of substantial heft from
behind the wheel but it's not from the MKZ

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.020
being overweight -- this model weighs a relatively
tidy 3,874 pounds.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.370
Instead it's that solid, dynamic quality perceived
in a touring sedan that's been well built.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.130
Lincoln Drive Control orchestrates the continuously
controlled damping shocks, electric assist

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.990
steering, engine, 6-speed automatic transmission
and other variables to automatically deliver

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.170
the optimum combination for tailored drivability.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:14.930
Active Noise Control also works to keep the
cabin quiet.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.030
No matter which type of driving situation
awaits you, the MKZ does an excellent job

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.770
at all of them.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.310
A smorgasbord of options allows for a cabin
with a custom appearance and mine packs in

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.040
the big $5,375 Preferred equipment group,
moonroof and technology package creating a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.630
highly connected, intuitively modern traveling
space absolutely bulging with high-end electronic

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.400
features and customization.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.870
The long running center console also provides
an amount of storage space you won't find

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.390
anywhere else.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.810
It's everything I could ask for in terms of
cutting edge safety, high-tech and comfort

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.130
-- well done Lincoln.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.190
The rear seats of the MKZ provide some excellent
talking points.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.650
For one, you can see there's plenty of legroom
for at least 2 more adults.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.360
My car has these optional inflatable seatbelts
for better protection in an accident.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.530
The outboard seats are heated.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.260
Down here below this hood there are 2 power
points; one of them being a traditional A/C

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.260
outlet.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.220
And get a load of this really cool LED light
built into the headliner.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:39.470
But the MKZ's generous 16 cubic feet of trunk
space is greater than that of a Mercedes E-Class.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.720
Starting price of this particular model is
about $39,000.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.470
After options it comes in at $48,500.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:55.449
Put the MKZ on your short list of must drive
luxury sedans.
