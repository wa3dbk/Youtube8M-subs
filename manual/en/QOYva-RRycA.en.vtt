00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.639
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.510
 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.129
Hi everyone.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.799
This is Killzone Shadowfall's multi-player. Now I've already taken a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.070
look

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.210
at the single player game. Do have a look on the channel for the review of that,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.439
but obviously the multiplayer is a very
different beast.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.529
With the multi-player they've kind of made some changes here to the previous Killzone formula.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.419
It is a first person shooter still.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.710
But the idea of earning XP to unlock weaponry

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.920
has been done away with. Now guns do
gain

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.060
upgrades as it were, but it's based on the
number of kills

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.000
and then you can unlock things like scopes but all of the weaponry the base

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.550
weapons are available

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.810
right from the word go. The idea now

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.260
with Killzone is to kind of have attainments and achievements

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.530
to set particular kind of scores by doing

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.840
particular actions and then you unlock effectively like badges for it.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.220
So for instance you might have to kill 50 people with

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.970
an assault rifle then kill 20 people with a grenade

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
and then kill 10 people with a blade and that
will get you a particular

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.500
achievement as it were. Now all of this
actually makes for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.560
quite a fun game because now gone is the trudge of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.840
trying to unlock the next weapon and so
on to get to the good stuff. Now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.430
grab the chain gun and just let rip. This is much more of a skill-based game

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.490
then something like Call of Duty where
you know best gun wins

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.790
a lot of the time. Now, you're going to
have to think

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.430
while you're playing. All of the various
different classes as it were of which there's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.780
three of, there's the scout,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.260
the assault guy and the support guy and
essentially

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.810
they all fulfil different roles and they have different power-ups like drones

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.619
shields and so on and you're going to have
to use these well with your team if

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:48.619
you're going to win.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.270
Overall, fantastic maps, great graphics

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.850
and ultimately a better Call of Duty experience

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.000
than Call of Duty. The maps are incredibly
varied and they

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.240
really do boast the best graphics in a
multiplayer shooter

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.360
I have ever seen. Amazing gameplay.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.920
It really is. Killzone's multiplayer is
well worth checking out

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.569
just for the variety if nothing else. I
had so much fun with this game.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.719
