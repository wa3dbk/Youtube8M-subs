Hi Besties\par

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.060
and hi Somewhat Simple Besties\par
You're looking great since the last time I

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.500
saw you.\par
Have you lost weight?\par

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:20.560
Since this is my only chance to see you Somewhat
Simple Besties before Christmas\par

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.070
I'm going to give you your present a tad early.\par
Here are 3 great ways to get some free traffic

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.410
for your \par
blogs,\par

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.540
products\par
and Web sites this holiday season.\par

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.110
One.\par
Make your pins on Pinterest go viral.\par

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.180
But Renae, how can I ensure that my pins will
go viral?\par

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.180
That's easy.\par
Join an already viral Pinterest board.\par

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.000
All of my current daily watchers have already
come together and made several Pinterest boards

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.610
go viral.\par
So all you have to do is add your pins to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.940
the already viral pinterest boards\par
voila\par

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.650
Your pins will go viral much more quickly.\par
Wait. How can I get access to these boards?\par

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.989
They are located on my Pinterest profile.\par
They are like community boards. Everyone can

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.650
pin to them and everyone follows them.\par
I have over 175 collab boards on there and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.850
each one is for a different subject.\par
So you can be sure to find one for you.\par

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.760
So it doesn't matter if you're a blog trying
to get traffic to your blog \par

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.816
or an etsy shop\par
or you're trying to sell a book\par

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:06.816
or cupcakes\par
or whatever\par

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:11.440
This way you don't have to worry about getting
all the Pinterest followers. They're already

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.350
there.\par
Wait. I still don't know how to get my pins

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.970
on those boards?\par
Renae!\par

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.210
Ok. Calm down. I have another You Tube video
that explains all this as well.\par

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.970
I'll have a link for it below the video.\par
2. \par

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.080
Join Facebook Ladders\par
you heard me\par

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.930
These are networking channels for Facebook.\par
Try to find ladders that consist of your target

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.360
market.\par
Then tag your page\par

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.710
and like other's pages that you like too.\par
But Renae, how do we find these Facebook ladders

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.660
with our target markets?\par
do I have to do everything for you.\par

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.970
Alright. Fine. It is Christmas after all.\par
I have a list of over 100 Facebook ladders

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.869
for you.\par
Look them over, go to their pages, and see

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
which ones you like the best.\par
A note of caution. You aren't trying to gain

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.493
an empty fan base.\par
It's important to network with those who can

00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:50.920
be potential clients\par
potential customers\par

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.710
potential friends\par
potential spouses\par

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.330
wait ...\par
forget that last one.\par

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.130
3. \par
And this one might sound a little crazy.\par

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.650
But I've done it and know that it works.\par
Forget trying to network in masses.\par

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.960
Think of one person whose big, who has a lot
of connections.\par

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.800
One who,\par
if they give you a shout out it would bring

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.869
you tons of traffic.\par
Now, email that person.\par

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.379
Make sure your email is completely personal.\par
This is not the time to be a commercial sounding

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.209
fool.\par
Tell them you're trying to get your name out

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.299
there.\par
and tell them you're willing to do actual

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.550
work just for a simple shout out.\par
It has to be real work though.\par

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.519
You can't just tweet their site and expect
the same in return.\par

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.209
Can you see the unbalanced equation there?\par
Offer to write a guest post for their blog\par

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.779
or if you can't write use whatever talent
you have and offer something special for their

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:33.730
groupies.\par
If you're a graphic artist you can offer to

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
make some awesome-sauce graphics with your
mentor's logo in the corner.\par

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.669
And they can distribute your graphics. They
don't do any of the work. You do all of the

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.879
work. They get an exclusive for their groupies,
their readers, their viewers, whatever you

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.120
want to call them.\par
But you get a shout out.\par

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.749
Ah! I'm out of time.\par
