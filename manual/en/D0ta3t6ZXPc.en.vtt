00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.969
Alright so start off by taking salt and rubbing
it into a cucumber, this will remove what's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.779
known as Aku which is a little bit of bitterness
and will make your cucumber much more sweeter.

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.579
So just rub it in and then leave the cucumber
to sit for about two to three minutes so the

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.949
salt has time to remove the Aku, and then
you wash your cucumber in an abundance of

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.660
water, this is probably too much water, but
just underneath the tap will do fine.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.850
Once you're done washing your cucumber you
pick it up out of the water, now with your

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.930
knife you trace out the underbelly of the
whale, making two trace cuts half centimeter

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.609
deep, that's 1/5 an inch and make sure it's
an angle that cuts down where you expect the

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.329
dorsal fins of the whale to be.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.630
For reference check out the diagram on the
top left corner of your screen to understand

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.949
what I'm talking about, otherwise things will
become more apparent once I remove the skin

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.710
of the cucumber.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.270
Then once you're done cutting out trace cuts
what you do is remove the skin off the cucumber

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.550
very carefully, staying inside the trace cuts
you made earlier, and removing very-very little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.550
skin.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.340
You want to make very thin cuts, so take your
time there is no need to rush this, just make

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.080
sure you get it perfectly done.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.240
Alright so while I'm doing this I just want
to let you guys know this video is being filmed

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.110
on GoPro, and I just want your feedback, what
do you guys think of it, do you guys want

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.110
me to do more like this, less like this -- let
me know in the comment section below, I really

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.560
appreciate the feedback.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.390
Thank you so much.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.420
Okay perfect, now you can see the trace that
I did before, two straight lines going down

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.860
at a 45째 angle on both sides to allow for
the pectoral fins.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.241
Now I am going to cut out the pectoral fins,
leaving a section still attached to the body,

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:11.209
so the two cuts on both sides just like so
and then you place your knife flat against

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.480
the surface of the cucumber on the curved
side of the fins and then you just cut, leaving

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.700
them still attached on both sides so that
you can bend them out -- just like so, do

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
the other side, too.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.570
Once that's done just bend them out to see
if they work, just like so -- there we go.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:47.350
And just so you can see a better angle, this
side, this is on the belly of the whale and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.440
these are pectoral fins.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.720
Okay now you lift up one of the pectoral fins,
place it down against the cutting board and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.170
you place your knife at a 45째 angle, and
then you cut through but not all the way through

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.840
because you don't want to cut through the
other pectoral fin on the other side, or flipper

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.940
as you may call them, too.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.990
So just make sure you take your time and find
a way for the knife to go around without cutting

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.230
through the pectoral fin.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.780
Again, as close as possible and then lifting
up the pectoral fin on the other side and

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.530
doing your remaining cuts to make sure you
don't cut through.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.830
Okay, there we go, now just test this stays
upright and doesn't fall forward or anything

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.140
-- perfect.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.460
Now lift it up again and cut the eye slots
which are the big white spots on the walls

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.099
of the whale next to the eye, just make two
incisions again like so and then a flat one

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.420
just removing it, and it should pop out just
like this -- perfect.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.380
Now do the other side just exactly the same,
two cuts going in a half centimeter each,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:08.319
1/4 of an inch, and then a flat horizontal
cut just lifting up -- great.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.730
Now one cut on the back of the whale to insert
the dorsal fin, you just simply make a cut

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.489
going quite deep, about two or three centimeters
and then cut the dorsal fin off the piece

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.050
of cucumber just like so, then you insert
your fin into the cut you made earlier and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.831
twist it, making the gap bigger, just slide
it into the dorsal fin just like that, and

00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:35.289
when you release it, it tightens around it
and stays perfectly in place.

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.050
Alright so now you take a block of cucumber
and cut into it a simple whale tail design,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.729
you want to go about one centimeter deep,
that's 2/5 of an inch, and the design you

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.331
can check it out on the top left corner of
your screen right now or just look at what

00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.159
I'm doing right here.

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:57.999
Once you're done tracing out the whale's tail
what you do is take your knife and you cut

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:04.479
two very shallow cuts at both tips of the
whale tail just like so and make sure you

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.380
don't go through the trace you just made.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.749
Now you take it, put it on the board and lift
up the tips of the whale tail and cut in at

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.210
a 45째 edge, creating a v-shape into it.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.009
Lifting up the other side now, and again a
45째 angle shape, joining up with the other

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.860
cut you just made, creating a v-shape into
the cucumber.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.979
Now you separate this from the rest of the
cucumber, now you cut the rest of the trace

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:43.360
away on both sides, so just one side like
this first and then the other side, and now

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.639
just cut off a little bit excess at the tip
on the backend, but not too much because you

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.240
need some of it so it stays upright once you
create the base.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.449
Now just place it how you want it to stand
and cut horizontally with the board to create

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.069
the base so it will stand up perfectly -- now
it stands up.

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.479
You keep this cucumber whale in a tub of water
for about a day and it will stay fresh, and

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.619
actually if you keep in a water tub for a
day what will happen is the tail will actually

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:19.009
curl up and look even better as you can see
in this picture right now -- so that's awesome,

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.169
give that a try.
