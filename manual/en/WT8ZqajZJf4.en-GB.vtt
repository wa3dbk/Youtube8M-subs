00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.310
How to make a Spanish sentence with KLOO. Making a
sentence is really easy. Start by playing

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.960
a red card, and then just look for the colored
arrows. For a blue arrow, play a blue card.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.440
To make our sentence longer, we can now play
a purple card for the purple arrow. The amazing

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.400
thing about playing KLOO is that your sentence
will always make grammatical sense, no matter

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.180
how many cards you play. Now, we can play
a yellow or a green card. We chose a yellow

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.280
card. Here's a double arrow card. You have
to be able to play the next card in order

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.910
to play it. Just keep playing as far as you
can.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:19.190
In most games of KLOO, you score a point per
card. So in this case, seven points. And what

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.920
happens if you don't have all the cards? Let's
see. Start with a red card, you can play a

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.790
blue card and a yellow card. But with no green
or purple cards, that's as far as we can go.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.530
Three points for this turn.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.100
With KLOO cards, you can learn in under one
minute how to make a grammatically correct

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.750
sentence in Spanish. And with each
deck of KLOO cards, you can create tens of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000
thousands of useful Spanish sentences and phrases.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.219
That's it, have fun!
