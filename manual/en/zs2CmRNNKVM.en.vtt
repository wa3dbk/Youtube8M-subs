00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:06.430
Hi, I'm Robin with Treesmon.com. We're making
a video for expert Village today on how to

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.680
embellish your t-shirts and sweatshirt with
jewels. This is the t-shirt that I was in

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.949
the store that I wanted and all it had was
the jewels around the neck of the t-shirt.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:28.019
This is what I am going to show you how to
do. This is a v-neck t-shirt and I took a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.630
measuring tape, measured it and every half
inch, I just put a little dot with a pen just

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.040
very lightly. That is going to be where I
am going to place my jewels. I have alternated

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.380
the pattern with a big rectangle and a small
rectangle. I have already done this side.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:01:01.390
I am going to show you how I glue those on.
First of all, I don't use the tip of the glue.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:10.700
I use a toothpick. It's too hard to control
what comes out of the glue tip and sometimes

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.370
you get too much and it gets all over the
place. So, I just use a toothpick. Unscrew

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:27.580
the top. Make sure that I put the top on some
surface, like a plastic bag or something because

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.310
it does drop some of the glue and you don't
want it to get all over things. So put it

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:52.720
on a protective surface. Take your glue and
dip the toothpick in the glue. Put the glue

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:05.110
on the back, make sure you get to every corner
and edge and place it right on the t-shirt.
