00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.410
Here we go, come on Jame we'll be quick

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.670
bare chested in this weather isn't a good idea.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.060
did you know that James

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.959
trained both schwarzenegger

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.620
and Stallone both how to be tough in sub-zero temperatures.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.679
Janes that's it yeah lean on the fence.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:15.570
Perfect.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.439
All i'm going to do is just

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.500
repeat what we did indoors

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.270
but out here without walls

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.829
naked flash first, i'm going to be quick because i don't want to

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.229
freeze James, he's quite a nice chap really.

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.500
It's difficult to get the camera to focus.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.149
Janey can you put the light on James, for a moment

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.250
thank you.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.080
Great now i can focus, i can't focus hang on.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.250
Put the light on James please.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.360
Right i'm focused, okay.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.650
and now take a picture, right there

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.780
we go.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.970
bare flash

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.240
very stark, very harsh.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.120
It's kind of spiky isn't it?

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.750
There's no real shadow behind James but

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.730
that's because there's nothing really behind James to shadow onto.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.050
Polystyrene cup

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.080
pop it on the top and see what happens

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.080
right light on James please Janey so i can get the focus to work

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.940
thank you.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.360
Right and next shot,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.140
hmm a much much softer light, but

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.970
as you can see it's very very dark

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.510
my suspicions about the thickness of the cup i think are proved accurate.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.150
Because the light is escaping the cup and going out in all sorts of directions,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.330
there's no white walls to plant some of
it back but there's no light walls to bounce some of it back.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.780
That is a very very dark image indeed.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.520
I'm not going to mess around with the paper, because the paper

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.470
and the film canister were almost identical.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.630
What i am gonna do

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.220
is just pop the canister on, there we go and see what we get from that.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.430
Right light on James please Janey.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
there we go, go it, the light is going onto James

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.360
because the auto focus can't see enough in this light

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.890
to pick up a focus

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.110
That looks to me to be better although

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.700
James you do look horribly dopey in that one.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.720
The light is softer it's nicer underneath his chin it's not so much burnt out

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.559
now its just got a

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.329
nicer more natural look to it

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.349
with our little film canister.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.050
That's because the film canister is circular, but

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.910
it's shattering the light but it's also allowing enough light to pass through in the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.540
direction of James.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.799
Finally let's just try

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.009
our business card,

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.859
right here it is. your shirts undone mike

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.459
does that matter?

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.819
you see i'm tough as hell too.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.339
We're the butch brothers aye James.

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.409
Right there we go, shirts done up

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.249
okay card

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.789
at an angle in front of the flash just like we had it indoors

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.399
Light on James please Janey so i can focus,

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.439
so we can focus on, got him.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.939
Just want to check my

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.079
there we go.

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.439
my focus is right, compose the shot

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.439
fire the flash,

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.019
you can't even see him.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.529
Do you know what you can't even see him at all. Let me see if i can do it again just one more time.

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.329
Nice one James, focus it right I've got to be very careful here.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.959
just take a look back to me janey

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.859
I've locked the focus by holding the button i'm holding the card at forty five degrees

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.909
and very very carefully

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.909
bringing it up to my eye

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.750
there's the tiniest merest

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.039
faintest

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:36.119
ghost-est hint of a James there, why is that when

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.329
we had such a beautiful result indoors?

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.039
there's nothing to bounce the light off is there?

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.980
there is no light transmitting through this, there are no white walls

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.150
for the light to hit and shatter

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.099
and wrap around James

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.890
what's happening is the lights coming
out of the flash and it's hitting onto this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.770
card

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.579
leaving at ninety degrees

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.079
and keeping going

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.799
off into forever.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.619
Now you might be thinking mike that's absolute nonsense

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:02.380
because you think it's because

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.189
there was some lights indoors

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:12.159
Let's just check that one out shall we.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.669
Come on James. come back in the warm James.

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.849
Right what we're going to do is i'm going to prove to you that it

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.949
has nothing to do with the lights that are on in here and that that exposure was purely with the flash. James have a seat,

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.069
this time

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.399
can you just sit the other way around i just want people to understand

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:33.509
i'm not just showing them the same picture all over again.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.480
Right that's cool,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.849
that's good

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:36.750
So i'm going to turn,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.740
we're gonna have to put the top light on that means everything's going to go blue,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.280
Jane has

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.160
white balanced the camera

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.080
for the lights that are in here, go and watch the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.940
white balanced film i'm not going to explain it now,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.800
what i'm going to do is retake the credit card picture

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.670
in here

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.339
but without these lights on.

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:54.529
I'm going o kill that one,

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.659
come over here

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.590
and kill

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.369
this one, so janes

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:03.300
going to have to pop the top light on as i do it,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.490
here we go,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.649
now then

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.050
let's line up James back in the same place

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.050
shine the light at James quickly janey so i can focus, got him, okay.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.759
Nice stuff,

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.079
get my card

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.469
forty five degrees just as it should be, now it's going to be slightly different because

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.370
Jane is standing up next to me now,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.810
can you sit down again janey so that you're in the same place, that's better.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.139
So we've got the same lighting conditions

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.020
I've got it focused on James

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.480
just got a different composition

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.419
there we go,

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.539
well done mate, you look very miserable though, cool

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.189
you see what i mean,

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.779
It's the same shot, there is no other available light in here other than the little bit skimming off that top light.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.489
as you can probably tell,

00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:55.240
that's not really having much to do with it, is it?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.129
It's all about the environment, the light is hitting this and shattering and

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.499
rattling around the room

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.259
and it's this environment bit that

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.859
you have to understand, you can diffuse till you're blue in the face but

00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:08.070
your in an environment

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.400
where you can't control the light

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.530
then you're hiding to nothing.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.809
for example

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.979
this method wouldn't work in the hall of a castle, say you're a guest at a wedding

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.669
great big dance hall with a high ceiling and no walls near you,

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.520
you would have the same effect as you did outside. you're better off to use something like

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.279
my little canister diffuser which I've lost, it's lying around in the garden somewhere.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.490
Have a play with this.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.789
play with light, try it in different circumstances

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.380
then you'll start to understand that there is no harden fast rule,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.169
about the way things have to be done. It's all about

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.009
learning how light works and

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.759
how it rattles around

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.459
then you can begin to control it to get
the results that you want.
