Japacon TV

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.365
Starting with Lucas Licensing, Kotobukiya has acquired many licenses from such companies as Warner Brothers and Walt Disney.

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:53.095
In all of those, the most troublesome part they experienced was creating figures of The Matrix.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:01:05.245
When we tried to create The Matrix figures, we were not allowed to see images of The Matrix, only scripts.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:10.025
We read the scripts in a closed room.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:23.130
It was difficult because there were only words. Creating a figure only from the scripts was tough.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.375
Kotobukiya created figures of The Matrix with their imaginations.

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:31.770
Keanu Reeves, the actor who played the protagonist, supervised the figure series.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.720
Keanu was the supervisor.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.930
Knocking the door and going into the room, there was Keanu sitting at the end of the table, and he praised how it was done.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.550
He made notes on the supervision sheet that had many pictures, but he said that it was terrific.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.560
He gave us his autograph too.

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:05.595
What is the difference between licensing in Japan and in the U.S.?

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:10.780
In the U.S., the focus is on the minimum guarantee.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:24.885
They start with things like, “If we give you the license, how much royalties will Kotobukiya be able to make in the market in three years? Explain your plans.”

00:02:24.885 --> 00:02:29.510
They won’t accept plans for a single product.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.605
It has to be plans for a series for creating a market.

00:02:37.605 --> 00:02:46.225
Foreign people see Japan as a toy kingdom, and if we create one product, they think 100,000 will sell.

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:50.495
Expectations toward Japan are too high.

00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:57.870
Licensors in Japan look at the market and set a reasonable price for royalties.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.490
In terms of that, however, overseas is unscrupulous.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:14.430
In order to get more awareness, Kotobukiya holds figure exhibitions at the world’s largest shopping mall, Dubai Mall, in France, and other places in the world.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.725
And in the U.S., we recently started a new attempt to get more attention.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:29.855
DC Comics and Marvel Comics are the two largest American comic publishers.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.775
They are like Shogakukan and Shueisha in Japan.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.680
DC Comics has characters like Batman and Superman.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.065
Marvel Comics has characters like Iron Man and Spider-Man.

00:03:41.065 --> 00:03:48.400
Kotobukiya has acquired licensing from these two companies.

00:03:49.525 --> 00:03:56.710
Kotobukiya cooperated with the two big American comic companies, and to add more impact to figures, they attempted a fusion with Japanese style.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:06.690
Kotobukiya released a figure of Darth Maul from “Star Wars: Episode 1” that has a style of the Japanese “Ukiyo-e” and “Kabuki.”

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.980
This seized the hearts of Americans and became a big hit!

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.235
So, what is the Japanese style Kotobukiya took in this time around...?

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:23.610
Almost every American figure has a realistic face.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:35.895
We had illustrator Shunya Yamashita change it to an anime face, and it sold!

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.620
About 80,000 items have been sold in the DC Comic Bishoujo series! About 80,000 items have also been sold in the Marvel Comics Bishoujo series!

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.695
Please make figures of GNU and I and let us debut overseas! 

00:04:51.695 --> 00:04:56.125
Good idea! What country do you like, Daiba-chan and GNU-chan?

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.960
I like France!

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.995
Great! I was just thinking of France.

00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:06.015
Let’s go to France together then!

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:12.060
GNU! We will make our world debut!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.935
Bonjour! Let’s start learning French now!

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:30.515
Kotobukiya, which promised us a world debut, has certainly shown achievements and built up trust overseas, as well as obtained licensing from the two largest American comic companies.

00:05:30.515 --> 00:05:40.325
And by adding their own characteristics of Japanese-style fusion, they increased the value of their brand.
