00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.869
Now top gundog trainer Howard Kirby is going
to show off a useful piece of kit for summer

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.570
gundog training.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.619
It's a device that's specially designed for
teaching steadiness in your dog.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.400
First, however, you have to catch a dove.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950
Which is not easy.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.289
As Howard's helper will show.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.980
Not easy at all.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.460
There, done it.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.769
Using a pigeon or a dove in training is sort
of the intermediate stages of training as

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.670
you make the transition from dummies to live
game you are trying to ensure your dog is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.239
sitting to the flush.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.239
So by using a planted pigeon we can simulate
that very easily and get a regular flush,

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.050
contact flush with a nice sit.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.600
So it is sort of intermediate age.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.850
The dog would maybe be 12 to 14 months old
by the time we get to that stage.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.010
What could go wrong in that training exercise?

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.210
If you haven't done your training correctly
what could go wrong is the dog rushes in and

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.790
tries to chase the dove and that is what we
are there to do.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.910
So if you have done your training behind that
all, the basic training we have done with

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.240
tennis balls and dry fire situations will
prepare the dog to sit to your whistle.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.900
He should be sitting to your whistle on command.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.009
And when the gun went bang that is the signal
for the dog to sit.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.530
Yes, so we train the dogs to sit to two queues
the stop whistle and the bang of the gun which

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.790
ever comes first he should sit to.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.340
And also the flush of the birds, so it is
actually three.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.450
So he is sort of on autopilot.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.759
So by the time he is fully trained, soon as
that bird or rabbit moves he puts himself

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.759
on his bottom.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.270
If he is hunting and a shot is fired he puts
himself on his bottom.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.170
If he is hunting and somebody blows the stop
whistle, his boss blows the stop whistle,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.170
bang.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.369
One of those three things will put him in
a sit position.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.799
Just show me that piece of kit there.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.630
Ok, this is the machine, it's a machine that
just very gently holds the bird in a cradle

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.061
and we press the button remotely and the cradle
springs back open and releases the dove and

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.310
it flies home to our dove cot.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.030
Once it gets back to the dove cot it goes
back in and lives happily ever after.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.590
The dove is not harmed in any way at all.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.880
No not at all.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.519
