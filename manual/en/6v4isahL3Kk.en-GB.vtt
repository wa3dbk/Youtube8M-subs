Namaskar!
Welcome to Nishmadhulika.com

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:12.419
Today, we’re going to make Mangosteen sharbat.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:21.474
You can easily find them in south India and goa and it is mostly used there only.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.356
Its violet in colour same size as a lemon.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:37.145
Its skin is peeled off to used throughout the year.

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:51.414
Mangosteen is sour in taste and is used to give sourness to food. Its sharbat is also very tasty.

00:00:52.137 --> 00:01:05.245
We can make fresh juice of mangosteen by keeping the fruit in water and putting in the mixer add sugar and grind it.

00:01:06.244 --> 00:01:17.588
If we want to make concentrated sharbat then we can instantly drink the sharbat anytime we want to, we don’t have to do a lot of work in that.

00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:22.077
Let’s make Mangosteen sharbat.

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:27.910
Ingredients-

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:48.585
1 cup Mangosteen (cleaned and kept in the water for 2 hours)

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:54.716
2 cups/500grams of sugar.

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:57.839
2 tsp black rock salt.

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:01.802
1 tsp roasted cumin powder.

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:05.251
1/2 tsp black pepper powder.

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:24.057
Firstly, we have grinded the Mangosteen in the same water mixture that we used before when kept for 2 hours.

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.897
We have the Mangosteen paste now.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.876
Make the syrup now.

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:36.903
Put the sugar in a container to boil with ¾ cups of water.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:41.229
We will stir the solution until sugar is dissolved in the water.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:53.575
The sugar has dissolved now. The syrup is ready now.

00:02:53.988 --> 00:03:20.142
Add Mangosteen paste in it and then black pepper, black rock salt and roasted cumin powder in it.

00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:24.923
Let it boil for 3-4 minutes.

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:39.099
We boiled the syrup and the paste for 7-8 minutes to make a thick concentrated sharbat.

00:03:41.057 --> 00:03:58.262
We”ll check by sticking some syrup to your fingers.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:07.742
As you can a thin string and we want it to be sticky.

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:20.741
After it cools down sieve it.

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:46.842
To serve put some ice in a glass.

00:04:49.701 --> 00:05:03.741
2-3 tbsp concentrate sharbat add water and mix it.

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:10.413
The Mangosteen sharbat is ready.

00:05:10.606 --> 00:05:17.208
You can fill it in a bottle and use it for 2-3 months.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:39.332
If you want to keep it outside use some preservatives like sodium benzoate and you can consume it till 6 months.

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:53.713
The natural drinks are better than artificial drinks. Artificial drinks fail before it.

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:58.013
You can make you sharbat, drink it and enjoy it.

00:05:58.313 --> 00:06:01.059
