00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
poker carlson a Fox News is gonna talk
about some

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.790
recent executive orders from Obama now
what those executive orders are is there

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.280
very

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.790
vanilla and moderate but they basically
tell all the federal agencies that hey

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.490
you should prepare for global warming in
a couple different ways and come up a

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.379
different plans

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.830
so we're prepared well

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.260
Tucker Carlson things that outrageous
how dare you wanna be prepared for bad

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.250
things have happened

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.849
or the stroke of a pen the present issue
an executive order that gives him

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.769
sweeping control of climate change
policy

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.590
the order appoint a task force officials
to advise the administration on how to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.149
respond the severe storms

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.800
wildfires droughts and quote other
potential impacts

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.260
up climate change by any bells the
director global warming

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.500
policy up the competitive enterprise
Institute thanks a lot

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.170
for joining us this morning myron so the
idea is that the president can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.949
single-handedly prevent

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.020
hurricanes was a point I well

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.340
its really a way to expand the size in

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.379
scope of the federal government's
involvement in

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.640
controlling and managing our lives a the
president is created in New

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.450
interagency Council that involves every
federal department to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.729
to plot the future for us and also a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.049
a local state and tribal government

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.720
a task force to advise the president on
how the federal government ought to be

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.450
funding

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.280
state local and tribal efforts to to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.640
managing control our lives so if this is
so more big government I would say I'm

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.460
struck by that by the certainty of the
tone from

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
from this announcement the their little
catechism States the earth is getting

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.060
warmer because a buildup of greenhouse
gases but there are many legitimate

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.509
scientists who believe

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.890
the Earth may in fact be getting cooler
because I've solar activity there is not

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.899
a consensus

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.899
that the president's theory is iron-clad
and correct there's no consensus

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.100
and the earth may be getting cooler it
may be getting cooler

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.600
Wow almost climate scientist missed it
meant how did they not see that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.220
well let's take a look at talkers
claimed and see if he's right headline

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.750
from ABC news in 2009 quote

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.980
this decade warmest on records

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.280
this decade warmest on record doesn't
really seem like they agree with you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.870
talker

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.230
wells we got here quote the first decade
of this century is by far the warmest

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.220
since instrumental records began say the
UK Met Office

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.780
and world to me deal Meteorological
Organization but I know they they have a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.099
liberal bias so you wanna trust and
those

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.840
damn experts but headline for National
Geographic January 9th 2013

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.340
quote 2012 the hottest year on record
for continental United States

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.060
or just getting started

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.400
how about the 2009 survey published by
the American Geophysical Union

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.569
which asked climate scientists if global
warming is real

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.340
so what were the numbers ninety-seven
percent

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.440
say yes it's real yes it's largely
manmade

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.650
ninety-seven percent only climate

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.510
scientists when asked so the experts on
specifically miss

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.150
specifically this that's not a consensus
I'm pretty sure that's a consensus

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.560
but my two favorite you ready for this
geochemist and National Science Board

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.489
member James Lawrence PAP our old in a
meta-analysis some 13,000 950

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.590
peer-reviewed studies

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.510
on climate change in fact thats all the
peer-reviewed science on climate change

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.459
from the year 1991 in till 2012

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.799
so we're looking at over 20

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.950
years own peer-reviewed studies here

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.950
so all those over 13,000 950

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.090
studies how many a said climate change

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.739
isn't real 24

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.739
sure the graph up

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.370
I at

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.049
fill you in on the radio me who is looks
like it's it's it's a it's a

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.130
a pie progress pie chart

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.419
there's a KK will see little sliver

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.889
that is the studies that don't agree

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.840
and about ninety nine point 8 percentage
Rd

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.380
overwhelming juggle the chart is all

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.340
this study that's a yes global warming
is happening yes it's largely manmade

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.870
look this is again this isn't it an
argument that's going on now amongst the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.699
experts

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.250
and then of course there's the
historical temperature graph AKA the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.770
hockey stick graph

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.720
word show is the average temperature in
the world

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.780
going up and down but relatively steady
its relatively

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.310
relatively speaking on about the same
line the same course and in the second

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.130
bid to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.380
we start actually using fossil fuels
which are using

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.979
you know gas in our cars and oil the

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.100
line shoot straight up that's why they
call the hockey stick graph

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.240
so G I wonder if global warming is
happening

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.440
who you believe all on the scientists

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.800
or talker work in coral Sen
