00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.510
Infinity Kappa car speakers.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.960
These are Infinity's high-performance line
of car speaker, and there are some really

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.730
compelling reasons that make them so.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.550
First, it's a low-impedance designed speaker
which simply means that it's built to coax

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.880
a little bit more power out of your stereo
or your amplifier than most other speakers

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.030
would, and that extra power, of course, helps
the speaker sound even better.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.770
As for the way it's built, we start with a
hi-roll rubber surround.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.760
That gives the woofer cone more freedom of
movement, allowing it to do its job more easily.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.109
The cone itself is made of a woven glass fiber
material that's both lightweight and strong.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.809
Being lightweight, again, helps with the freedom
of movement.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.210
It can be really responsive to the music,
but the strength of the material makes sure

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.829
the cone keeps its shape so the sound stays
accurate.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.010
On top of that we have the tweeter structure.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.680
It's built with a pivoting design, so that
you can adjust it based on where you have

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.820
to mount the speaker in your car.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.670
If the speaker's low in the door, you want
to point it upwards so that the tweeters are

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.780
aimed at you.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.300
If your speaker location's a little higher,
then you have the luxury of just aiming it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.240
into the cabin or still at you.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.700
But the purpose for this is to help with stereo
imaging.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.130
It makes the music sound more open and expansive
in the cabin of the car.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.950
And on top of the tweeter is a 3 dB attenuator
switch.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.140
That allows you to fine-tune the tweeter output
for your particular setup.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.790
If you're running on lower power, you might
want to activate that 3 dB attenuator — cut

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.830
the highs a little bit so that they're not
overpowering the sound.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.020
But if you have a lot of power or a couple
of subs behind you, then you're gonna want

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.040
to turn that off and let, just open up the
tweeter and let it deliver everything it can

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040
for you.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.509
Then we move on to the crossover.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.811
Now you don't normally get an external crossover
on a coaxial speaker, but because these are

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.672
built to be high-performance they kind of
need it.

00:02:14.672 --> 00:02:16.242
What the crossover does is make sure the right
frequencies are going to the right part of

00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:19.040
the speaker — lows to the woofer, highs
to the tweeter — and that is really there

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.380
just to ensure good sound.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.380
Now, power handling.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.630
These speakers really come to life if you
can put them on an external amplifier.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.450
Like this 6 3/4" speaker can handle up to
75 watts RMS, and if you put that kind of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.090
power behind it you won't be sorry.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.090
It's gonna sound great.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.530
Alright, let's talk about the components.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.220
They feature all of the technology built into
the coaxials that I talked about, just in

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.220
separate pieces.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.860
The tweeter: it's built to handle all that
power in order to deliver smooth, crystal

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.860
clear highs.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.820
But you might notice it's a little bit big.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.000
You're probably not going to get it to fit
in the factory tweeter location in your vehicle,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but that's okay.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Infinity has you covered there.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.470
They include all kinds of mounting hardware
in the box so that you can get this guy wherever

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.350
you need it to be in your vehicle.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.330
Now for the crossover.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.910
You'll see here, inside this really nice looking
box there's nothing off the shelf.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.120
These are all Infinity components.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.100
And again, that's all part of the plan to
give you great sound.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.990
You'll see even the same attenuator button
that we saw in the coaxials so that you can

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.849
roll off the highs a little bit if you need
to, or if you like it nice and bright, keep

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:24.849
them in there.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:35.370
