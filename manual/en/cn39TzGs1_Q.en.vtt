Hi, this is Stephanie from Tomato's House
of Rock and I'm going to show you how to comp

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.180
in funk.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.540
So, again, just to go over it, comp actually
means accompany.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.950
So this is what you want to be playing when
somebody else is taking a solo, or if you're

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.119
just building up your jam together with everybody.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.150
Funk is a pretty broad title so there are
actually a lot of different styles and rhythms

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.540
that I think really fall under this umbrella
of funk.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.031
So we're just going to look at one pattern
that should take your really far in many of

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.820
these different styles.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.390
Let's do it in the C minor pentatonic.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.219
So, there's a pattern here.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.899
If we were to just start with a C minor, just
play an old triad, we would have these notes.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.499
Then if I wanted to slide into the major,
I could just get that effect real easy.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.589
Do it up here so it's a little less muddy
for you.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.240
Yeah, so that would be the first position
that we're going to have for this.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.220
Then, all we're going to do is move our three
and five; they're both going to go up a step.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.160
So, now we've really got E and G, even though
we slid into that E. Now we're just going

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.570
to go up to F and then we're going to take
it even one higher.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.040
So we have F and A and now we're going to
go up one more.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.990
We're going to go up to G and then B flat,
because since we're in that C minor zone,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.870
that's why we need the B flat in there.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.790
So all three of them would be, then we'll
do them coming down as well, so it'll be coming

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.810
up and then going back down again.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.570
Adding in a side note, use it at your own
discretion.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.570
It can definitely get over you, so pick the
moment that feels right to use it.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.490
So we've got that pattern.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.310
Then to really give it that funk feel, what
we're going to do is now add in our thumb

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.129
on C, which is the one, every other.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:21.049
So in between every cord we play, we're going
to also play the C. So we would have...

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.690
Because this one is a little bit more complicated,
I'm going to do it one more time so you can

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.239
really see what's going on.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.270
Okay, now let's hear what it sounds like sped
up a little bit.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.870
So we would have...

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.030
So just from that alone, again, it's already
starting to create a little bit of that funk

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.030
feel.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.739
Really, from there, you can make so many different
variations on either the rhythm or even the

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.670
order that you're playing it in.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.749
So maybe...

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:04.579
So there I was doing the G and the B flat
twice.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:15.690
Maybe you do two of these before you go back
to the C. So you could have...

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.690
So there's a lot of variation.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.230
But if you get this feeling under your fingers
of just the two notes, back to the C, two

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.060
notes, back to the C, you're going to be in
really good shape to come up with your own

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.359
rhythms that feel really good.

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:47.939
So let's hear what it sounds like with some
music.
