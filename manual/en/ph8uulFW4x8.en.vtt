00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.640
Hello everyone! I made a video on filling
in eyebrows previously, today I’ll show

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.330
you one of the many ways to shape your eyebrow
if you have never shaped it before. You’ll

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.299
need a few items for this. Any pen or cream
type product that you can draw with, for example

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.039
a white eyeliner, a normal brown eyeliner,
or even your concealer coupled with an eyeliner

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.119
brush. If you don’t have an eyeliner brush,
you can even use an old liquid eyeliner as

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.319
your brush.
You’ll also need a spoolie, I have here

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:38.319
a recycled mascara wand that I brush my eyebrow
with. A pair of scissors. A pair of tweezer

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.120
or razor, and a ruler.
I’m going to show you two style of eyebrow

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.810
trimming today, the first is an arched and
angled one.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.810
Step 0: Load up the eyeliner brush with concealer
first.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.850
Step 1: Define the locus of the start of your
eyebrow. Most guides suggest drawing a vertical

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.000
line from the side of your nose.
(compare) But if you would like your nose

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.159
bridge to look more narrow, you can use any
point between the tip of your nose and the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.390
side of your nose to define the start of your
brow.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.619
I will be using the mid point in this tutorial.
With a ruler, line it against the mid point

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.399
and make a marking with the concealer. Don’t
worry if it’s messy, as long as the inside

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.399
of the line is straight.
Step 2: Define the locus of the arch of your

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.030
brow. Look straight ahead.
Place the ruler on the side of your nose and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.090
adjust it until it aligns with the side of
your iris. I had to look away to find the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.100
mirror so please don’t follow what I did
here.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.709
With the eyeliner brush, make another marking
here.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.189
Step 3: Define the locus of the end of your
brow. Align the side of your nose to the end

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.779
of your eyes with the ruler. Make the last
marking here.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:01.689
So now we have 3 lines on our eyebrow. You
just have to decide on 3 points before you

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.779
draw the outline of your desired eyebrow.
To make it easier for you to visualize, let’s

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:12.680
call these lines 1, 2 and 3.
We’ll add in an additional 2 lines, let’s

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.530
call them A and B. A is the upper limit of
your original eyebrow.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.060
B is the lower limit of your original eyebrow.
For a natural looking brow that wouldn’t

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.160
require much drawing, use your original eyebrow
as a guide. First I’ll define the points.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.670
1A is the intersection between line 1 and
A, while 2A is the intersection between line

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.620
2 and A, so on and so forth. Point 3 will
be any point along the line three, it should

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.620
be below point 2A, and within your own brows.
Then, join the dots together! I drew the line

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.550
slightly above my current eyebrow because
that’s where the upper limit of my original

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.180
untrimmed eyebrow lies.
For the lower boundaries, find out where point

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.340
1B is.
Then, draw a line parallel to the line above

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.800
until it touches line 2.
Lastly, connect it to the end of your eyebrow.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.470
Wasn’t that hard right? You can feel free
to adjust the borders to your liking before

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.490
moving on.
Next, we just have to tweeze all the hair

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.010
that falls out of the box. If you’re uncomfortable
with tweezing or worried that you’ll over

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.190
tweeze, use a razor to shave them off. Depending
on how thin the boundaries are, remove hair

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.490
that lies on and out of the line we defined.
After you’re done, remove it before filling

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.500
in your eyebrow. I used Vaseline to rub them
off.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.360
Next, using your spoolie to brush your brows
downwards. The point here is to not cut off

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.490
too much eyebrow, so we only trim off those
that may stick out on its own when your brows

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.360
are messy. Brush it back in place and see
if there are any other flyaway strands. Snip

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.170
it off too.
Filling in your eyebrow should be easy now

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.950
since the shape is already out. If you need
to extend your eyebrows,you can use your eyebrow

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.880
pencil or brush as a guide to help you find
those points again.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.910
Now, if you would like to trim your eyebrows
into the Korean style eyebrow, carry out the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.720
same method to define the three lines first.
Make sure the lines are long enough.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.350
Here is the illustration for the different
points.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.440
There are two way you can achieve this.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.750
The figure on the left will use the highest
point of your brow as the reference.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.040
Draw a horizontal line from here until it
intersects with the first line.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.040
The figure on the right will use the point
1A as the reference to find 2A also by drawing

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.630
a horizontal line.
Decide on where you want your eyebrows to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.070
end by picking a point along line 3.
Draw a horizontal line from point 3 until

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.639
it intersects line 1 , and join up the remaining
gap.

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.370
The one of the left will maximize the lid
space as the brow will appear higher above

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.620
your eyes, making it suitable for people who
want more lid space. The one of the right

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.419
will shrink the lid space, so it’s suitable
for people whose eyebrow is too far up originally.

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:11.419
I’m using the guide on the left to sketch
out my desired eyebrow.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.740
Again, tweeze or shave outside the borders.
Once you’re done, remove it with your makeup

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.410
remover, and repeat the cutting process.
To fill in your brows, just follow the previous

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.750
few steps and fill in your brow accordingly.
Just make sure you’re using the same reference

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.680
point to determine the placement of the other
lines and boundaries. Check back to see if

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.860
follows the guide we drew earlier on.
For the inner half of the brow, make sure

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.310
to fill out any empty spaces with your brow
product to conform your eyebrows to the shape

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.430
we drew.
Make sure to blend out any harsh lines at

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.080
the start of your brow for a more natural
look.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.080
So this is how you can shape and fill in your
eyebrows! Well, this is just a general guide

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.680
line and is by no means the golden rule that
you must follow. Please treat this is a first

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.240
try to the many iterations that you may make
to see what suits you best. Please use a razor

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.010
in place of a tweezer if you are worried of
making mistakes, shaved hair appear faster

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:21.010
than plucked hair.
I hope you found this video useful! As always,

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.460
if you’ve tried this method out, let me
know what you think at the following places.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.780
