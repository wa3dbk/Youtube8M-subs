00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There was a time where the different cognac
houses needed to find some distinction between the different companies.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
HINE, when they started to think what kind
of logo they could have, they tried to remember

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
where the family was coming from.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.000
They were in Dorset, and in front of the estate
owned by the family, there was a pub.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.000
With a deer as a logo.

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:44.000
So they decided to choose the deer, but -- because
they are British -- they turned back the head of the deer,

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:50.000
which means â€žDon't forget where you come
from". So it's part of humor.

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:54.000
This is the evolution, yes? This is the evolution.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
HINE is permanently seeking the excellence.
And we never change. And this is also -- I think so --

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:09.000
part of the reason why HINE is
what it is today.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.000
Quality of the glass is something, which is
very important to us. It gives us this transparency.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:21.000
It looks sometimes very simple, but the expression
at the end is an expression of elegance,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.000
of luxury in some way, and if you keep the bottle
in your hand, there is nothing aggressive.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:39.000
It's engraved by two, three workers who are
capable to do so. It's minimum one week.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.900
We try also to use more contemporary material,
if it's possible. This is the case with the new Antique XO.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Well I guess the proportion is right. It still
looks kind of compact.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.000
The strength of the brand is that it's very
powerful.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And this is the metal you were talking about?
Yes.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.800
It was not a revolution, but we were I would
say, forerunner in the way we put a metal

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
label on the front. Which is very elegant,
is what we think.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:24.500
This is the only cognac house I think that
has Eames chairs, which is the ultimate design classic of all time.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.800
We can't produce a lot, and this is one of
the points regarding the identity of HINE,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
as we are looking after the highest level
of excellence.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.500
It's clear that we are not running after the
volume for the volume.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.030
We are the only cognac house, which is honored
to hold the famous Royal Warrant of her majesty Elisabeth 2nd.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.000
If you want to make this excellence level,
we can't produce too much, because otherwise

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:03.000
it would be too difficult for us. And we prefer
to stay at the level where we are in terms of volume,

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:10.100
because we know that we are capable to deliver
the quality and to provide it in due time.
