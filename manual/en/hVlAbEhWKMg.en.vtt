00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.719
We are bringing you the Smurf, today.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.750
Not the la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.250
Not that Smurf.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.580
Dance move the Smurf.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.250
We don't see it too often, but it has a very
familiar groove.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.439
Groove, you say?

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.419
Is that what I said?

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.419
Groove?

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.560
This is part of our groove series.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.980
Up, down, bounce, and drop.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.690
We are doing the Smurf with the down groove,
because you can always change any dance you

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.750
want to a different groove.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.940
We're going to do it down.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.210
Let's relax our knees.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.610
We're going to start our knees bent about
shoulder width apart.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.610
Wherever you're comfortable.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.700
If you're too close it's a little hard to
move that way.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220
You're going to bounce, accenting down.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.580
You're going to go down, down, down, down,
down, down, down, down.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.190
This is the essence of any down groove, no
matter where it goes.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.309
No matter where it moves.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.590
Hey, I'm going to be a rapper when I grow
up, down, down, down, down.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.290
Now, Smurf uses arms.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.149
You can do anything you want with any down
groove.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.420
Smurf has arms.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.030
We want to use them kind of like we're swimming.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.360
Side-to-side, though.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690
You'll go left and right more than forward.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.850
Starting with the right arm, down, down, down,
down, twist the arms.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.369
Down, down, down, you'll keep connecting all
the moves.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.479
So it's one nice groove.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.310
Ha, down, down, down.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.780
Kool Moe D does this dance.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.630
He goes, 'I used to live downtown, one twenty
ninth street,' ha.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:02:02.840
Let's try it with some music, DJ.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:19.010
There you have it, y'all.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.750
Hit the Smurf.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.819
Hit the Smurf.
