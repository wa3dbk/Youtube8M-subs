JENNIFER:
Archival Oil
painting mediums

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.979
are wonderful because

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.681
they allow you to
manipulate and change

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.984
the consistency of
your Archival Oils paint

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:21.288
in a variety of ways.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.357
As you can see, Archival Oils
on its own

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.626
has a wonderful
buttery consistency,

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.060
but to alter its texture

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.896
and to enhance
your painting experience,

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.399
consider the lean
or the fat medium.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.068
Lean medium is an odourless
alkyd based

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.470
fast drying liquid medium,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.872
used to reduce
paint viscosity.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.909
It's used whenever
you want a flowing paint,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.582
perfect for underpainting
and thinner paint techniques.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:51.018
Your Archival Oils mixture
will remain workable,

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.120
but it usually
tacks up within a day,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.522
so it's great for
layering techniques.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.759
It helps increase transparency
so it's a good medium to use

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:04.965
for glazing.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:06.466
The fat medium
is an odourless,

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.102
syrupy, heavy bodied
liquid medium.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.471
Like the lean medium,
it is alkyd based,

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:14.641
so it promotes faster,
more thorough drying of oils,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.110
and tacks up in about a day.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.713
The fat medium
increases gloss and flow

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.015
for smooth,
enamel like effects.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.017
Both the lean
and the fat medium

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.253
can be used interchangeably,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.688
and can be mixed
with each other,

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:30.657
and at any stage of
your Archival Oils painting,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.527
because Archival Oils were
designed to be flexible.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:34.962
These paints and mediums

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:37.764
free you from the classical
fat over lean rules,

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.200
and allow you to explore
a whole new range

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.902
of painting techniques
and styles,

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:45.605
without the fear of
your painting cracking.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.843
(♪♪♪)

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.746
JENNIFER:
All of the Archival Oil mediums
are based on isopar,

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.649
which is a healthier
alternative than using

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.952
traditional mineral spear
or turpentine based solutions.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.055
As always when in the studio,
use your common sense,

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:05.692
so make sure that your mediums
are covered when not in use,

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.428
and also only pour out
just what you need

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.030
for a painting session.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.665
When you use
the lean medium

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.433
and the fat medium,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.836
you'll find that you're
going to produce absolutely

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:19.673
beautiful paintings
with stunning results.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.176
