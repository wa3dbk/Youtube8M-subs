00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.750
alright interesting story on uh... at
the drones which which we've been

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.569
talking about have been very critical of
the drone program of the u_s_ there's an

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.790
and why you student who's been tweeting
every reported u_s_ drone strike his

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.189
name is josh begley you can follow him
on twitter at twitter dot com slash

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.519
drummond st now he has been just simply
tweeting since two thousand two whenever

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.340
there is a known u_s_ drone strike now
if you look at this tweets

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.910
there's a disturbing trend which seems
to suggest that the u_s_ may be using

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.630
something called the doubled path

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.710
tactic now what is the double tap tactic
lewis what that is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.120
it's known what's fascinating about this
is that in two thousand seven a report

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.190
came out from the homeland security
institute saying that the double tap is

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.720
a quote favorite tactic of hamas and the
f_b_i_ considers it a tactic employed by

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.280
terrorists and what this is is repeating
the same target multiple times you hit

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.190
once

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.910
first responders show up

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.330
a perimeter is established you know
people are there and then pretty soon

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.009
you had the same target again often
hitting a lot of those first responders

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.730
increasing the number of dead makes
sense so far as well

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.060
what it seems like if we look at the
reports of these drums strikes is that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.030
the u_s_ is using this tactic for
example we look at of mister begley

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.840
stream here june eighteenth two thousand
nine

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.280
to drone missiles killed one person

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.920
rescuers rushed to the scene tumour
struck killing eight

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.540
june twenty third two thousand nine five
days later

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.840
eighty more people were killed when
several u_s_ brown's targeted a funeral

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.020
in pakistan

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.610
and this goes on and on and i don't have
to read the whole list to you but

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.990
it's incredibly disturbing to me

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.240
that we have a situation here where
terrorist tactics identified by the u_s_

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.700
seem to be mimicked by u_s_ drone policy
overseas now again we've talked about

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.650
all baba and republicans this is pretty
much widespread

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.470
approval of this type of thing that
we've been critical of everybody who's

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.240
in favor of it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.060
we've got to have a more serious
discussion of this this have to become a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.940
bigger deal

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.900
the u_s_ is using tactics apparently

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.809
which by their own standards

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.329
are terrorist tactics

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.059
yeah i know when it's time we talked
about germs on a

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.279
i kind of defended drum strikes in the
use of germs but this this is pretty bad

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:27.849
i mean the idea is uh... is to get your
target with the first hit and uh...

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.369
if this is what's happening

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.410
and certainly not proud of that right in
other words of weakening

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.660
whether or not you agree with drugs
strikes me the argument can be made that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.440
by using drugs strikes instead of of
other methods

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.650
assuming you will carry out those

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.269
operations less civilians will die that
argument can be made that's a separate

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.599
argument from whether this is ok or not
and it's totally that argument goes out

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.170
the window doesn't it when you start
using a double tap method meant to kill

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.159
people better than in the area

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.309
right nominee i mean it's possible that
were comparing will you'll things insane

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:05.650
which one is less that exactly it is a
that's exactly what we're doing

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.339
so i don't know it seems to me like this
is the one issue where

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.979
there is bipartisan support for in the
u_s_ and we need and it's gonna be that

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.079
much more difficult because of that
actually investigated proverb no

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.959
question about it this has got to be a
bigger deal again you're not saying very

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.409
much of this to see this

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.790
a little bit of mainstream media but
this is going on that you really job
