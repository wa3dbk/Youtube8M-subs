00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.099

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.490
Hello and welcome to Teaching Miss Daisy with
me Dom bailey and my assistant

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.779
Daisy.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.199
Today we have a guest. This is Barbara,

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.490
welcome to the show.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.070
Barbara recently emailed the show with a very strange margarine myth,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.070
to help us bust it please welcome special guest emperor Napoleon the third.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.820
Lovely to have you here. 
Hello

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.200
This is Napoleon the first not Napoleon the third.
Any way Napoleon is also here to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.270
promote his latest book about baking. So
what's it called Napoleon?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.290
Baking with Napoleon.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.290
Of course.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.020
Ready for download now. Full of great margarine recipes. One of which we will be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.720
doing later on.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.260
But before we do,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.590
Barbara tell us your margarine myth.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.760
Margarine was invented to fatten turkeys.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.760
Margarine was invented to fatten turkeys?
Really?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.910
Well to discover the truth we're gonna
travel back in time

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.520
to 1869

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.710
Here we go...

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.810
So here we are.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.850
It's 1869. The cow Daisy
same as she's always been, doing what she

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.220
always does, making butter.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.500
Napoleon however needed a tasty everyday
alternative to butter to feed the people

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.770
of France and keep his armies marching on.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.369
He offered a price

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.789
to whoever could create such a spread.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.409
The person who won that price

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.229
Hippolyte MÃ¨ge-MouriÃ¨s

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:20.999
the man who created the first margarine
recipe.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:27.510
It's a true story. The End. Right.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.029
We need to get back to the present day.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.349
And we are back. Is everybody feeling OK?

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.459
Is everybody here? Daisy!? Good.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.409
That was quite a trip wasn't it.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:48.409
Now with the help of Napoleon and Daisy
we are going to make cupcakes.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.079
What are you doing?

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.999
I'm starving.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.429
What's he doing here?

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.659
31 take 52
