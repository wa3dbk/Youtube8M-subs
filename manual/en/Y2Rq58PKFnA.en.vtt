Whats up guys Lew here back with another unboxing video

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.360
This one, as you can tell, is quite large.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.400
I think I have an idea of what's inside but I'm not 100% positive.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.560
So we are gonna find out together. Without any more hesitation lets jump inside this big cardboard box.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.240
Now opening it might be a bit of a challenge.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.580
Hopefully not.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.620
Bubble stuff.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.180
Wow.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.560
I think you probably know what this is now.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.260
Oh my goodness this is huge.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.600
