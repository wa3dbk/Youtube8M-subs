Hi, my name is Aleksandra and today we are going to prepare potato pie.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.320
You will need to peel 1 kg or 5 big potatoes.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.860
After you peel potatoes place them in a bowl with cold water.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.700
Chop potatoes on small cubes.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.840
Chopped potatoes put back in the bowl with cold water.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.340
Wash the potatoes and remove all the water from it.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.180
Heat on the moderate temperature about 50 ml sunflower oil and add one big shopped onion.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Cover and fry for about 5 minutes until becomes golden.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.580
When the onion is golden add potato in the pan and stir it gently.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.160
Add 7 gr of salt and 3 gr of black pepper.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.960
Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes. Mix it every three minutes.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.220
Prepare 8 sheets of phyllo dough.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.700
Place on sheet of phyllo dough on top of another and spread over it one fourth of the potato.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.860
You should not add any salt nor oil because we have already everything mixed with potatoes.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.020
Roll it in and place in the baking tray.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Repeat this with the rest of the ingredients in order to get four rolls.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:30.380
Spread some oil on tops of the pie and bake it in the oven on 200 Â°C for 20 minutes.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.660
Prepare 30 gr of butter a pinch of salt and some hot water.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.420
Let the butter melt and spread it over the pie just few minutes before it is well done.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.340
Put the pie back in the oven for 2 minutes.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.680
