00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.790
Welcome to Madrid and welcome to the Estadio
Santiago Bernabeu, the home of course of ten

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.770
times European champions Real Madrid. Some
of the names to have graced this stadium in

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.920
the past 60 years include Alfredo di Stefano,
Emilio Butragueño, Luis Figo and Cristiano

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.679
Ronaldo to name just four. That means that
Los Merengues on their own would be enough

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.090
to make Spain's capital city a real footballing
hub, but Madrid has a lot more to offer as

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.039
a European footballing destination.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.060
This is the home of the Spanish champions
Atletico. Revived under the coaching of Diego

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.950
Simeone the cross-city rivalry has also been
reignited in recent years, especially since

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.610
Atleti won the Copa Del Rey at the Bernabeu
against Real Madrid themselves, in May 2013.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.250
Now El Real know all about trophies. They
have won 32 La Liga's, 19 Copas Del Rey and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.879
of course those ten European champion titles,
including the first five after Santiago Bernabeu

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.649
himself was intrinsic in the creation of the
competition back in 1955.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.449
However, here at the Estadio Vicente Calderon,
Atletico fans will tell you there is only

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.280
one place in Madrid for real atmosphere, here
on match night.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:21.360
Those fans and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.520
their passion was evident here at Neptuno
back in May as Atletico celebrated their first

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.369
title in 18 years. It's tradition that they
party when they win something here, just as

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.080
Real Madrid celebrate their titles at Cibeles
is. The famous trophies that Real have enjoyed

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.640
with their thousands of fans here include
the seventh European title in 1998, 32 years

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.960
after the last and the 2002 edition, sealed
by Zinedine Zidane's fantastic goal at Hampden

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.020
Park in Glasgow.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.479
It couldn't have been brought home any more
clearly than having a Champions League final

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.229
between the two teams. There was a lot of
talk - and some of it was kind of the classic

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.070
politician talk of what a great occasion this
is for the city of Madrid - showing that this

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.550
is at least for one night the capital of European
football. But while Atletico are not necessarily

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.950
a poor club, they are very much in the shadow
of Real Madrid in terms of budget. This is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.730
a club who Diego Simeone keeps on telling
us has a budget a fifth the size of Real Madrid

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.310
and that has helped to create a sense that
this is a place to come and watch football,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.959
even if you don't go to the Bernabeu. Some
football fans probably thought that anyway,

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.310
because it has always been a great experience
here at the Calderon. When Atletico's fans

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.780
are in voice it's exhilarating it really is.
But here is no doubt that the Champions League

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.170
final has reinforced that idea.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.319
These aren't the only two clubs in the capital
of course. Rayo Vallecano have built a cult

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.880
status in this noisy and intimate stadium,
with just three sides the eagle-eyed of you

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.780
will notice. Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas,
in front of which some of La Liga's biggest

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.989
recent names have emerged, including Álvaro
Negredo, Michu and Diego Costa.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.599
So whether you are here, here or here, you're
never far from the people's passion in Madrid.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:17.540
So it's adios from the Spanish capital. Click
