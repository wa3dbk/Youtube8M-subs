00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:09.800
Hi, I am Ed Kramarcik, PBA bowler and AMF
staff player since 1989 and today I want to

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.340
talk about the cosmetics of bowling. The lane,
what the dots mean and what the arrows, this

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.010
way when you come out and bowl, you will exactly
know where to stand and how to lay down the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.589
ball. A lot of people would come out to a
bowling alley and they have no clue what the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.629
dots mean and what the lane is asking for
as far as dots and arrows and I am going to

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.050
explain that to you. So we are going to go
over the cosmetics of the lane right now.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.110
You have the dots and you have the arrows,
the dots is where people setup, this is called

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
a setup area where you get ready to go and
bowl, so this is the approach. So standing

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:57.410
on the approach, each dot is 5 boards, so
if you wanted to stand 20 you would be standing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.350
right here on the middle dot because you have
10 boards from the ball return and yet each

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.409
one after that is 5 boards. So if you were
standing 20 you would be standing on the third

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.789
dot and if you stand on the third dot, now
you are standing 20. Well if you are standing

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:20.479
20, the lay down for any structure of bowlers,
any individual bowler is 7 boards. So if you

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.119
are standing 20, when the ball comes out of
your hand, as long as you walk straight up

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.350
the foul line it will be 7 boards so you will
be laying you ball down on 13 which is 3 boars

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.929
left of the second arrow which is the 10 board
and 3 is 13. Everybodyâ€™s structure is 7

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.520
boards to lay down, that is the basic rule
of thumb. It does change if you drift a little,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.149
you walk a little crooked as you are getting
to the foul line and release your ball. So

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.221
just remember that the third dot is the 20
board and if you want to play 13 you are going

00:01:54.221 --> 00:02:00.702
to stand 20 because of the 7 board lay down.
If we move to board 25 and you are going to

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:05.009
lay down then you are not going to be hitting
the spot that you are looking to hit which

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.920
was 13 before. Now I just move my feet left
to 25. so 25, my lay down is going to be 7

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.190
difference so that means that you are going
to be rolling the ball all over 18, 18 -7-25.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.390
If I want to play, 18 that is 3 boards left
of the third arrow because like I said the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.060
arrows and the dots cosmetically is the same,
it is only 5 boards a spot. So that is how

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.970
you know exactly your lay down for your ball
and where you want to play on your shot, give

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.180
it a try and I guarantee you that you will
have a lot more fun and shoot a lot more higher

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.940
games. Thank you.
