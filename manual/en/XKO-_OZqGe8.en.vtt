00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.880
Hi. I'm Chef Rainer Wickel and I'm here today
with expertvillage.com. Well, we've got our

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.560
onions frying in our butter and it looks like
they're a nice golden brown, and we've been

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.320
letting them cook for about five minutes,
being really careful to make sure that they

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.551
didn't burn, that they're just a nice brown.
And now we need to put in the rest of the

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:24.000
ingredients to finish up our base for our
red wine sauce. Now there are only three more

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.010
things that we need to put in there, and the
very first thing is we're going to be putting

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.710
four cloves of garlic in there. Now, the key
with the garlic is we want to make sure to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.999
get all the skin off the garlic before we
put it into the garlic press. I've already

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.969
peeled three of them here, but what you need
to do is just take your pearing knife, and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.979
what you want to do is you want to cut the
ends off of the garlic, because we don't want

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:58.789
that in our mixture. In on top of it, it makes
it a lot easier to go ahead and peel the garlic,

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.440
and you want to make sure that all the skin
is off the garlic, because otherwise you're

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.220
not going to be able to press it very well.
There we go. Now go ahead and grab your garlic

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.280
press and put the clove of garlic in there,
and then we're just going to squeeze it right

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:28.600
into the mixture. This is one reason why I
always have my pearing knife along, because

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.620
you never know when you're going to need it.
It's just really handy to have. Now, once

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.380
again, this is where the pearing knife comes
in handy; just go ahead and scrape it off.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:54.370
And now we need to do that with all four cloves.
And now remember, the reason that we're doing

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.000
this is this is just to flavour the actual
sauce. None of these ingredients are actually

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.070
going to be in the sauce because we're going
to be straining it. And now we have all our

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.090
garlic in there. And go ahead and stir that
all up. Now, this particular step right here,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
we're only going to be letting this fry for
maybe about a minute, it's not really going

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.569
to take too long. So, the next step is oregano,
and we're going to put about a tablespoon

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:35.129
of oregano in there, and just sprinkle it
over te top. And the last step is we need

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.560
to put about a quarter cup of tomato paste
in there, which is basically about a half

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:55.459
a can. So go ahead and put that in there.
And now go ahead and, once again, mix that

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:03.719
all together, because what we're doing right
now is we're just making our base so that

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:10.410
we're ready to put in the red wine. And now
we're just going to let that go ahead and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:20.790
cook for about one minute, and just let that
all bind together. And this is going to come

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.959
out almost like a paste; it's actually going
to be the base of our sauce. And this is how

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.000
we mix all the ingredients together to make
the base for our red wine sauce.
