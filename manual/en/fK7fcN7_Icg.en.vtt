Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter from
howtoblackhair.com in this video I will be

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.190
talking about whether or not dreadlocks or
locks grow faster or longer than any other

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.440
hair type or style so generally speaking people
want to know dry locks grow faster than growing

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.939
your hair out its natural state or relaxed
state I'll address that very day in this video

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.500
and also just give you a little bit of background
about locking your hair in general so when

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.880
someone is locking their hair they're putting
their hair through a process that does just

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.359
that very thing over time someone was locking
there hair what their hairs to become so interlocked

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.250
that they turned into a loc so that when you
actually wash your hair style your hair the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.219
style doesn’t get lose or the hair doesn't
become untangled and then could take a long

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.019
time for someone to lock their hair the amount
of times in between how long it actually takes

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.470
the loc depends from person-to-person and
even hair type to hair type so people lock

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.300
their hair have to go just as much patience
and time to finally get their hair to where

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.170
they wanted people like those who locks actually
brother hair faster or longer than someone

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.870
who doesn't have locs because you can see
the difference between the lengths and sometimes

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.990
you look at someone starting with locks and
then a year now or a year later they seem

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.600
to have really long hair so my take on the
whole locking and deadlocking thing or however

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.660
you want to call it my take one locking is
that I feel in my opinion it appears to be

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.540
that locked hair is growing faster than hair
that is not locked so you may say okay your

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.780
silly because when I'm looking a locks they
look longer than someone trying to grow their

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.880
hair and this is not working so there’s
a couple of things you just have to really

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.390
keep in mind about hair in general hair grows
at a constant rate give or take a little bit

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.440
off of the percentage so realistically speaking
just because someone locks their hair doesn't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.120
mean that it makes their hair grow faster
everyone has a constant hair growth rate so

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.700
why does it seem to be that last hair is longer
than someone else hair in my opinion this

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.850
may not be all or apply the same as you are
in my opinion if someone has been locking

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.030
there here for five years and someone has
been trying to grow their locked for five

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.310
years the person who has black hair will have
longer hair than the person is the reason

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.260
why is because every bit of hair that on the
person said that the locked is being contained

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.569
within itself so any shed tears are built
up into it you don't have to comb the bottom

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.130
or the ends of locks so it stays preserved
so it's easier to retain the length of the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.459
hair if you're just want everything together
that someone may have natural hair or relaxed

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.760
hair They constantly have to comb their strands
the constantly have to split their hands as

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.820
they deal with breakage so in a sense they're
trying to chase after the length and they

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.010
constantly have to combat issues that happens
to the ends of their hair so in my opinion

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.760
I do not think that will lock their hair actually
have faster hair growth I just think that

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.090
they're able to reach longer lengths because
they're keeping all of their hair together

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.760
it’s not necessary to trim the damaged ends
because it's all a lock but if you are not

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.460
locking your hair you have to constantly combat
issues with the ends of your hair so you weigh

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.300
in on this very topic in the description box
below to tell me what you think you think

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.640
people who lock their actually grow hair faster
than everyone else or do you think it's actually

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.340
easier for them to retain length so go and
go down to the comment box to let me know
