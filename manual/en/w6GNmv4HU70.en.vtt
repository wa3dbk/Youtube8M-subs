00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:15.268
This is an insanely important car for Jaguar.
Not just in the Netherlands, but worldwide.

00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:23.612
Jaguar wants to expand. They have to to survive
in the battle between car manufacturers.

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:29.794
They're still a size smaller than
the other premium brands.

00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:38.830
The challengers in the segment look at the German
3: Audi A4, Mercedes C-Class and BMW 3-Series.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:47.407
Jaguar had a model in this D-segment.
The X-Type was based on the Mondeo.

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:54.501
People held this against the car for
a long time, even though it's a good car.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.454
The XE is a completely different beast.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:11.179
Jaguar keeps comparing the F-Type and XE. They
share technology, but are very different cars.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:22.256
70% of the XE's body is aluminum. It doesn't make
it light as a feather, but it's no heavyweight.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.856
It's one of the lighter cars in its class.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:34.707
They will appeal to the real drivers in this segment.
A lot of effort was given to the suspension.

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:40.193
The car is very quiet as well.
They say the most quiet in its class.

00:01:40.193 --> 00:01:46.261
I've been driving different versions,
and it's nice and quiet inside.

00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:57.518
A couple of engines are very important
for the Dutch and Belgian markets.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:02.566
The diesels. You wouldn't expect that.
2 have 20% additional tax liability.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:10.663
Both are 2-liter diesels; 1 with 161 hp and 99 g CO2
emissions with manual transmission and small rims.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:17.822
That's well within the 20% category. Even the
178 hp diesel with automatic gearbox

00:02:17.822 --> 00:02:22.303
and small rims has 20% additional tax liability.

00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:27.672
We're driving a 178 hp diesel with
automatic gearbox and 'R' package.

00:02:27.672 --> 00:02:32.709
It doesn't have 20% additional tax liability,
but that's no party pooper.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.782
It's quick. 0-62 mph takes 7.8 seconds,
the top speed is 142 mph.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:44.839
On the highway we went downhill
to go faster. It can do that.

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:53.510
Also the 161 hp version is quick enough. 0-62
mph takes 8.3 seconds, the top speed is lower.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.354
Let's see. 141 mph, so that's
only 1 mph difference.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:28.178
If you want a stronger diesel: they've shown a
twin-turbo, but didn't say anything about that.

00:03:28.178 --> 00:03:41.021
Expect 200+ hp. Driving on gasoline is another
possibility. That's 25% additional tax liability.

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:48.118
There are 3 varieties: 2 2-liter turbo
4-cylinder engines with 197 and 237 hp.

00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:53.132
Then there's the V6 with supercharger.
That's a wonderful engine.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:59.998
It has a lot of torque. It catches on in the
lower regions, less so at higher rpm.

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:06.883
There's no reward for going red-line,
but it has 335 hp.

00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:17.147
The top speed is limited a lot to 155 mph. The
2-liter turbo with 237 hp is limited to 155 mph well.

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:23.030
A sprint from 0-62 mph takes
5.1 seconds in the 'S'. That's quick.

00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:52.844
The fun thing is, it's an automatic. Every time
I'm taking a corner in a higher gear,

00:04:52.844 --> 00:05:01.788
doing 45 mph in 4th instead of 3rd,
you exit better on its torque.

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:06.743
You notice that the XE's handling is very nice.

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:12.368
It's well balanced and very comfortable
when it has to be.

00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:18.889
It's a nice travel car and makes you feel
confident, even with 335 hp in wet conditions.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.676
It stays reliable.

00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:26.931
The wheel is nice as well. They did that well.

00:05:31.394 --> 00:05:35.178
What you think of the design is personal.

00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:42.790
I think it's pretty, though I have to get
used to the Jaguar family face.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:50.655
The X-Type and previous XJ had round
headlight and an outspoken classic styling.

00:05:50.655 --> 00:05:57.078
Now it looks more modern, which makes
it feel atypical for Jaguar.

00:05:57.078 --> 00:06:02.262
Maybe it still has to grow on me.
I think it looks nice,

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:06.204
but I would believe you if you told
me it's a different brand.

00:06:06.204 --> 00:06:10.527
Jaguar has to work on that.
They have their own style.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:20.247
The interior's finish is well done. Pretty materials.
We have leather upholstery, powered seats, etc.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:28.122
It looks cool. This is the new satnav
version, still with a touchscreen.

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:36.354
There are more buttons than with the previous
satnav generation, but it's still clumsy.

00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:50.730
We've switched from the 'S' to the diesel.
It doesn't let down. Yes, you lose 158 hp.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.383
For me that's usually a reason
to get grumpy, but it handles great.

00:06:56.383 --> 00:07:05.878
This is a nice diesel for this type of car.
It's a new engine family by Jaguar, an Ingenium.

00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:11.776
They used to have BMW engines at
Jaguar Land Rover, then Ford engines,

00:07:11.776 --> 00:07:19.261
now they develop their own. They've build
a new Â£500 million engine factory,

00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:22.844
so they're pretty serious about
taking this course of action.

00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:30.633
Then I still have to tell the Dutch viewers
the price. I don't know the Belgian price.

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:37.836
In the Netherlands it starts at 40,000 euros
for the 2-liter diesel (161 hp, manual).

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.417
It won't have a lot of features,
but it's still an OK base model.

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:54.300
