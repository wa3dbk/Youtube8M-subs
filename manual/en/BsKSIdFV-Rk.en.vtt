00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.520
Another really cool tie dyeing technique is
called pole wrapping, and as the name says,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.030
you'll pretty much be wrapping your fabric
around a pole.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.400
The effect that that makes is a zebra stripe
kind of effect and it looks really complicated,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.070
but actually it's really easy to make.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.000
You'll see how easy pretty soon.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.300
So you want to have your fabric wet as usual
and you need also, a PVC pipe.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.890
These are pretty easy to get and they come
in different sizes.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.470
You can get them wider, but mine is pretty
narrow, and the different sizes will make

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.980
the pattern appear differently.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.220
So you want to start placing your fabric on
the pole and as you roll it, you want to be

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.630
scrunching it.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.770
So what you're trying to do here is to roll
all your fabric around the pole, trying to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.840
avoid having one layer of fabric on top of
layer of fabric.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:07.110
So this is achieved really by as you roll
it, just continuing to scrunch it.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.580
Another section, scrunching it; another section,
scrunching it.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:27.610
So in the end you have your fabric all wrapped
around the pole and scrunched and you see

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.500
that all these pleats here, that's what's
going to make the zebra kind of stripes in

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.320
your fabric.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.860
If you were dunking this into a dye bath,
you also want to make sure that it remains

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.720
nice and scrunched like this, so you can wrap
it around with string or you can also just

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.710
use a couple of rubber bands throughout, just
to make sure it stays in this position.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.460
A little twine in the middle.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:11.099
Now I'm going to give it a final scrunch.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.700
After you're done you just dunk it in your
dye bath.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.599
You want to make sure that your dye bath is
deep enough for the fabric to be totally submerged

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.730
and you just leave it there for one hour.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.150
After that you can rinse it and see the pattern
that you made.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.069
So this is how you can make pole wrapping
tie dye.
