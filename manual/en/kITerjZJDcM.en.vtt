"Pharmacists Versus Health Food Store Employees: 
Who Gives Better Advice?"

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:08.845
Yes, as we’ve seen, studies have shown over and 
 over again that health food store employees, 

00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:11.420
on average, didn’t know what the heck they were talking about.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.190
But maybe nobody does when it comes to supplements.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.661
Two North American studies were recently published – 
one in Canada, one here in the States – 

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.865
comparing the advice gotten from health food stores 
compared to community pharmacies. 

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:27.433
In Canada, researchers went in and asked questions like, 

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:31.776
“Will ginseng give me more energy? 
Will beta-carotene help me fight cancer?” 

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:34.409
“Will shark cartilage help cure my cancer?”

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.809
What percentage of visits to 192 different health food stores 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.448
were researchers given advice considered accurate, 
or at least fairly accurate, 

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.119
based on the balance of available scientific evidence?

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:49.090
One hundred percent of the time? Half the time? 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.187
No! Seven percent of the time.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:59.333
Pharmacists did about ten times better. 

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:04.311
In the US study they got actors to walk 
 into pharmacies and health food stores 

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:09.781
feigning classic symptoms of Type I diabetes: 
excessive thirst and fatigue,

00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.780
 unexplained weight loss despite overeating, 
peeing like crazy all the time. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.650
They asked the health food and pharmacy staff 
what they thought they had, 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.956
what they should take, and whether they thought 
they should go see a doctor.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:29.497
Given that Type I diabetes can be fatal if 
 untreated, the answer to that last question 

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:32.931
is yes, they should indeed go see a doctor. 

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.269
And all eight out of the eight pharmacists 
 got that right. Good for them. 

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:43.210
But only half – six of the twelve health 
 food store employees – thought it necessary. 

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:47.750
And two of the six naysayers explicitly advised against going to a doctor, 

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:54.020
the rationale being that the physician would “just give 
 them Ritalin or miss the true diagnosis” 

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:58.030
which they felt was something like “mold infestation” 
or “adrenal exhaustion” 

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:06.370
which, luckily, they had just the right supplements for 
at a bargain for only up to $200 a month.
