00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:19.031
Jackfruit sabzi can be prepared in two ways either by boiling it or just cut it raw.

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:24.990
Today we will make raw jackfruit sabzi.

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:31.037
Let's see what all ingredients are required for making raw jackfruit sabzi.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.075
Jackfruit - 250 grams

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:38.047
Cumin powder - 1/2 tsp

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.240
Asafoetida - 1 pinch

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:43.482
Turmeric powder - 1/2 tsp

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.707
Coriander powder - 1 tsp

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.726
Green chilly - 1 (finely chopped)

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:55.143
Salt - 1/2 tsp (as per taste)

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.925
Garam masala - 1/4 tsp

00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:02.379
Mango powder - 1/2 tsp

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:06.787
Coriander leaves - 1 tbsp (finely chopped)

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.777
Oil - for making sabzi

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.979
Firstly cut jackfruit for making sabzi.

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:30.621
Put some oil on your hands nicely so that the jackfruit doesn't get glued to your hands.

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:35.110
Now cut jackfruit.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:46.232
For making sabzi always prefer using raw jackfruit.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:58.557
It takes time for peeling the jackfruit as we have to remove the skin from seeds as well.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:43.438
Even if you are boiling jackfruit remember to peel off the skin from seeds or else it will spoil the taste of sabzi.

00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:57.396
Now start making the sabzi.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:02:59.934
Now add asafoetida and cumin seeds in oil.

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:22.219
Add turmeric powder,coriander powder and green chilly when cumin seeds turn little brown in color.

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.348
Saute the masala for few minutes.

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:44.134
Also add red chilly powder as per your taste.

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:49.377
Now add chopped jackfruit in the masala.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:09.108
Keep stirring until jackfruit pieces get coated nicely with the masala.

00:04:11.036 --> 00:04:14.806
Stir for 2 minutes.

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:35.799
Now add salt in the sabzi and stir nicely.

00:04:44.877 --> 00:04:57.543
Now add little water and cook on low flame for 7-8 minutes.

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:07.251
Add 2 tbsp water and cook on low flame.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:14.884
Don't bring the flame to maximum as sabzi cooked on low flame are more tempting.

00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:34.203
Cover the pan and cook on low flame for better taste.

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:59.270
Cook sabzi for 1-2 more minutes.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:05.782
Sabzi is ready as jackfruit pieces have become tender.

00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:17.374
Now turn off the gas and add garam masala and mango powder.

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:38.055
Always prefer adding mango powder and garam masala at the end so that their aroma stays for long.

00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.901
Now add green coriander leaves.

00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:53.058
Luscious jackfruit sabzi is ready.

00:06:56.335 --> 00:07:00.653
We have made this sabzi from 250 grams jackfruit.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:14.460
This much quantity can be served to four family members as a side dish.
