00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.590
Welcome back to Takei's Take.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.000
Today's topic is crowd funding.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Crowd funding sounds like a bad pyramid scheme.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.600
But it's actually the term for raising money by collecting

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.000
small contributions from a large group of people.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.230
Open up your hearts and give these boys
some Benjamins.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.320
Seriously, give us your money. 
- This phenomenon

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.090
has been made possible by sites like
Kickstarter, IndieGoGo

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.900
Crowdfunder, Rocket Hub, and Angel List.
Everyday, people are raising the money

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:37.710
they need

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.300
to make their creative dreams come true.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.829
How does it work? Let's use Kickstarter
as an example

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.600
set a fundraising goal amount for your
product from a few hundred dollars

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.289
to a few hundred thousand dollars. You need to raise

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.479
every dollar of that goal in order to make
the money. 
- The last piece of the puzzle

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.000
it's going to be you. 
- We cannot do this without you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500
If you back this Kickstarter project you will be cool and everybody will like you.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.000
So let's do this thing!

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.729
If you fall short, you get nothing. But let's say your project does

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:14.170
raise

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.100
its funding goal, in that scenario, you get to keep all the money.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.270
After Kickstarter takes their five percent fee

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.549
for facilitating and Paypal takes their
three percent for processing credit cards

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.710
Crowd funding sites enable fundraisers to
offer perks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.500
The higher the donation amount, the cooler the reward.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.390
A company called

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.009
Pebble asked for one hundred thousand
dollars to build their

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.109
smartphone enabled timepieces.Thousands of people pledged over one hundred dollars

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.560
each. In the end, Pebble raised over 10

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.950
million dollars. As much as I love
supporting campaigns

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.539
I also love running them. My life's mission

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.610
has been to raise awareness about the
internment

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.230
of Japanese-Americans during World War Two. I helped create a musical

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.629
about to experience titled Allegiance.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.209
We turned to IndieGoGo for enhancement funding. We set our goal

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.920
at fifty thousand dollars. I personally offered to do a happy dance

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.500
if we were to hit one hundred thousand
dollars. Are you ready for this

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.580
and i'm happy to say, I danced.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.580
At the end of the campaign, we raised

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.040
one hundred fifty eight thousand dollars.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.500
We staged a magnificent production and our
show is now bound for broadway.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.540
To dive deeper into the subject

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.000
we invited YouTube celeb and
experienced crowd funder

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.680
Hannah Hart. So Hannah, I understand
you had a fantastic

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.810
success with your project. Tell us about it.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.629
Well, I ran a campaign called Hello Harto, which was an effort to reach out

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.819
to fans of my pre-existing YouTube channel
and show

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.650
and do a tour across America giving me
the opportunity to kind of give back

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.069
to them

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.189
and meet them and shoot with them in their homes. We got really excited with how well the

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.340
campaign had done

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.430
and decided to keep expanding the idea
to include

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.439
shooting another travel show entirely,
shooting in the homes of fans across

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.250
America, and then Canada, and then also
doing volunteer meet ups at local food

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.900
banks in every city we stopped at.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.860
How did you get people to find out about
your project? 
- I used Twitter,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.860
Instagram, YouTube, and Tumbler to reach out to

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.170
my existing audience and ask them to
help donate to the campaign.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.569
There are some people who might not be
able to deliver on their fundraising

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.480
project

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.219
or their perk promises. How do you deal with
that?

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.620
Create an excel sheet wherein you
determine just how much fulfilling your

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.349
perks will actually cost.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.579
We found a good chunk of the money
went to actually

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.700
just preparing the gifts that you
get when ask people to donate.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.140
I think it's very important to consider
the campaign that you're donating to.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.579
Do a lot of research to kind of
fact check and make sure that they are

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.689
who they say they are

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.189
or that they have a good plan for the
money. What kind of advice would you give

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.100
to potential crowd funders?

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.140
Well the advice I would give to
potential crowd funders is to really

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.330
consider your options.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.040
You know, I would say there's a benefit
to have website like Kickstarter because

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.590
it's a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.220
well known and people go to the Kickstarter
page. However, IndieGoGo is better for niche

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.390
markets. Let's say

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.900
you're appealing to people with a
specific need or you're tapping into

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
already existing group. 
- Well thank you very much for all this information

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.610
- Thank you for having me 
- I think we're all going to be engaging in creative projects.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.000
- Engage!
- Engage!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.200
Engage

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.710
Here's my take:

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.820
I know first-hand that crowdfunding is a
remarkable new way

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.870
to fund your dreams, cultivate an
audience,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.300
or get projects off the ground. And if
you're someone who's been sitting on

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.450
that dream project for twenty years.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.030
Well, this just might be your chance.
