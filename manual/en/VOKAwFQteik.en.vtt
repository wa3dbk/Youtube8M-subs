Hey this is Ed with AtticFoil.com
and this video is called "What's the payback?"

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.759
People always want to know, "Do energy improvements
really payoff?" And the answer is, "Yes."

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.470
The math proves it. In this video I'm gonna
show you exactly HOW energy improvements are

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.280
great investments. There's generally two methods
of energy savings on a home: air sealing and

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.890
methods to reduce heat gain and heat loss.
Air sealing is quite simple. Your home is

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.960
basically just a big box. Kinda think of it
as a refrigerator - you're trying to keep

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.960
the air inside the box. The best way to do
this is to seal the ducts, duct systems typically

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.570
leak anywhere from 5% to 20%. Testing has
shown that the older the homes, generally

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.460
the higher the duct leakage. It's not uncommon
to have older homes with 20%, 30%, 40% percent

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.320
duct leakage. If your sprinkler were blowing
30/ 40% of the water in the street, you would

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.149
have it fixed TODAY. But duct systems, because
you can't see them, people tend to ignore

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.590
them and don't get them fixed. House air sealing
is another thing. You want to caulk and seal

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 - seal up all the windows, cracks, crevices
 - as the wind blows on a house, just the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.409
natural pressure can cause a lot of natural
air changes. And once again, this is hot or

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.409
cold air that you're buying - you wanna keep
it inside the box. The other area is reducing

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.920
heat gain or heat loss. This is done by installing
a radiant barrier. A radiant barrier is your

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.859
first line of defense against radiant heat
flow. The second thing is attic ventilation.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.619
If you can keep your attic cooler and you're
running duct work through an attic (you're

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.009
running 50 degree air through a hot attic),
it's nice if the attic can be 100 or 105 degrees,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.630
rather than 120 or 150 degrees. More attic
insulation, attic insulation is your second

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.819
line on defense against conductive heat flow.
So most homes need anywhere from 12-15 inches

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.490
of attic insulation. And finally, window protection.
Windows are very inefficient no matter how

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.959
good they are, especially if they face West
and catch direct sunlight. The BEST window

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.970
still doesn't provide a lot of thermal protection.
So you want to install either solar screens

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.519
or a really good quality window film to keep
the heat from getting in. Another thing is

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.950
to focus on dollars, NOT a percentage of the
savings. People always ask me, "What percentage

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.269
will I decrease my electric bill?" Really,
the question is "How many dollars will I take

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.480
off my electric bill?" When it comes to estimating
savings and payback, it's really a question

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.730
of: Based on spending X, how much can you
save? Or how much will you save (Y)? Here's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.079
a simple example: If you make improvements
which average about $25 per month in savings

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:54.760
 - very easy to achieve - you're gonna have
an annual savings of about $300. Now, how

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.760
much is $300 really worth? Say you're in the
20% tax bracket. You pay your utility bills

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.859
with after-tax money. So in order to take
home $300, you'd have to earn about $375 in

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.310
order to keep $300. So the REAL value of $300
in savings is about $375 worth of income.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.250
Now, this is a GUARANTEED return. Energy rates
COULD drop down, but most people think over

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.969
the long haul, energy rates are gonna go up.
So your money is guaranteed a return on your

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:35.269
investment (ROI). And, as energy rates go
up, your ROI is gonna go up even more. So

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.269
how much would you be willing to invest for
a guaranteed savings of $375 per year? Let's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.480
take a look. At a 10% Return On Investment,
you can invest $3,750 to get that $375 payback.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.540
Or, at a low 5%, you could invest up to $7,500
to get that $375 payback. Now think about

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.769
all the improvements you can do for between
$3,500 and $7,500. That's a lot of radiant

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.260
barrier, insulation, duct sealing - you can
do a lot with that. And reducing an average

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.260
utility bill by $25 a month is a TOTAL No
Brainer. I mean, you can buy a $20 bucket

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.450
of Mastic, start sealing your ductwork and
a lot of times that will save you $20-$30

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.070
a month right there. It's pretty typical,
you can easily reduce your monthly utility

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.070
bill by $50 or $100. So, it's a great investment.
Now, what about tax credits? Currently there

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.460
are tax credits 30% of what you spend, up
to $1500 - you need to talk to your tax professional

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.030
to find out exactly what qualifies and what
doesn't. But in general most of the things

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.710
we're talking about do qualify for the 30%
tax credit. Here's an example, you take that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.710
$3,700 less an $1,100 tax credit - the REAL
cost is about $2,600. Now, the equivalent

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.720
return on investment AFTER the tax credit
 - if you spend $2600, you get a $375 return

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.720
on your investment. We're talking a 14% return
on investment on energy savings improvements.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.890
This is a GREAT return! Let's say "What if?"
What if these improvements resulted in a $50

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.890
or a $75 a month in savings? At $50 a month,
your annual savings would be close to $600.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:40.990
Your ROI on that, we're talking 23% or more
 - that is a GREAT return! Here's the deal,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.300
experience shows that energy improvements
REGULARLY have an ROI of over 30-40%. Even

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.680
on the low end of 10-15% it's a great investment.
So typically 15-40% that's gonna be money

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.330
well spent to improve the energy efficiency
of your home. Plus, if you go to sell your

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.330
home, energy efficient homes are worth more.
So, do you do it yourself or hire someone?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.990
Well, take a look at the money and whatever's
best for you, determine your ROI and decide

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.460
if that's a good investment. AtticFoil.com
