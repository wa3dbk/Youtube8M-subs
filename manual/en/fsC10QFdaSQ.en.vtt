Hey guys this is Austin. Usually the words
Mac and gaming don’t go in the same sentence

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.469
but is it possible? If you want a gaming computer
a Mac shouldn’t be your first choice but

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.340
what I want to know is can you game at all
on a MacBook? Take a look at the specs of

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.040
this 2015 13 inch MacBook Pro and it’s got
a decent Core i7 CPU but the integrated Iris

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.740
6100 graphics aren’t exactly made for hardcore
gaming. Last year I tried a few games on a

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.660
Mac Pro with much better specs and it did
reasonably well but how will the MacBook stack

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.029
up? The first problem is just finding games
that work on OS X. There are a few titles

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.100
in Origin and in the Mac App Store but your
choices are pretty limited. Luckily Steam

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.739
is also available and here there’s a pretty
decent selection with quite a few games from

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.320
my library that will work on Mac. First we
have Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Here it’s

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.270
totally playable on low at 720p on the MacBook
and just like on SteamOS The Pre-Sequel is

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.000
a solid port that’s basically identical
to the Windows version. Move over to Tomb

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.700
Raider and it’s not quite so nice. It’s
almost playable at 720p but we’re getting

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.770
pretty significant frame rate drops. Jump
over to Metro: Last Light Redux and things

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.950
are a bit smoother but we’re still dealing
with the occasional choppiness during the

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.200
more intense scenes. Things aren’t off to
a great start but how does the MacBook handle

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.749
less hardcore games? Minecraft is a staple
of basically every gaming platform on the

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:18.439
planet and the Mac is no exception. Performance
is just fine even at 1080p as long as you

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.579
notch the render distance back a bit. League
of Legends is the same story, this is a rock

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.389
solid version of the game for Mac that runs
no problem on max at 1080p. So a MacBook can

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.869
handle mainstream games fairly well but next
I wanted to see what we could do running Windows.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.220
Using Boot Camp I loaded a preview copy of
Windows 10 which opens a much bigger library

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.600
of PC games. Trying Tomb Raider again it’s
clear that Windows makes a big difference.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.099
We’re seeing much more playable frame rates
even with the graphics bumped up to medium

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.369
which got me curious, how much of a difference
is there? I ran the built-in benchmark on

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.409
medium at 720p and the Windows performance
was over double what it was on OS X, averaging

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.639
43 frames per second compared to just shy
of 20 running Yosemite. For a laptop with

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.399
integrated graphics this isn’t half bad
but let’s try a couple newer, more demanding

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.369
titles. Load up Grand Theft Auto 5 and it’s
totally playable on low at 720p...well as

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.350
long as you have a mouse anyway. The only
problem was a weird texture issue that made

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.380
some things semi-transparent but this seems
more like a GTA problem than the MacBook’s

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.340
fault. Shadow of Mordor is another great looking
game and here we’re able to get decent frame

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.440
rates on low, nothing to blow you away but
it’s entirely usable. If you want to play

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.800
more casual games a MacBook is fine but for
demanding titles it might not be a bad idea

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.410
to install Windows via Boot Camp, it’ll
give you way more options and things should

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.350
run a fair bit better. The addition of Metal
to OS X El Capitan should improve gaming performance

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.550
similar to DirectX 12 so it’ll be interesting
to revisit this next year. So is a MacBook

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.680
a good gaming PC? No, not even close. But
if you want to play the occasional game on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.020
a MacBook it’s totally possible.
