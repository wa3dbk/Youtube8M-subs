00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.690
I wanted to introduce you all to our

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.060
nursing program. we have two different
types of programs here at Harper.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.140
There is a certificate in practical nursing
and then the associate degree 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.259
in nursing.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.930
And those will allow you to go to the state
and apply for the licensure exam

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.550
which will allow you to either become
a licensed practical nurse or a registered

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
nurse for the State of Illinois. 
Nursing is caring. One of the most important qualities

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.560
to have is caring.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.619
And the values. I want to bring up a point
here at Harper.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.750
We have four very important values here at
Harper. They are respect,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.050
integrity,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.120
collaboration and excellence.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.420
This is one of four medical surgical rooms
so in these rooms you would find adults, psych patients.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.149
We would find geriatric patients, any kind
of medical surgical patient.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.539
So if this student needed to practice 
the skill of doing a dressing change

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.720
she would be working with this mannequin.
This mannequin is a high-fidelity mannequin.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.850
It actually talks, so I have a microphone behind
there. We talk to them.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.220
She actually breathes

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.340
and she actually has a heartbeat.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.350
She has a pulse,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100
and what's really interesting is you can see
her I.V.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.910
It's going.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.040
We can literally put fluids in her. We can
draw blood.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.430
We can do all kinds of wonderful procedures
on her.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.160
if we look at the monitor our patient is
doing okay. Her blood pressure is good.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.080
Her heart rate is good.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.390
We can change those. They will actually give
injections. They will actually throw them out here.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.000
They can actually give IV pushes, they can give meds. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It is really amazing what we can do with this
technology.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.979
Patient in the far bed,

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.790
cannot breathe on his own,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.470
so he's connected to a ventilator. So our 
students are taught

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.920
how to care for that patient because when they
go in the hospital and see that ventilator,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.700
will be know what to do? Probably not.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.390
But here they'll have an opportunity to
practice and learn all about it. 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.159
This room is where they get their supplies from just like
in a hospital they have to figure out what supplies they need.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.180
That machine is actually an electronic machine.
They have to put in a code, put their fingerprint on,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.609
and withdraw medications just like in a hospital.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.000
So Henry is going to be used tomorrow in a simulation,
a sickle cell anemia crisis.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.160
Students are scheduled to come
in and take care of him. I am getting

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.109
all the machines ready.

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:13.560
They can actually put medication through his 
G-tube, just like in a hospital, because we want

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.359
them to practice in train what they would 
see in the hospital.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.469
You guys can see that we have this incredible nursery.

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:27.299
We have twins, that are being warmed up. They were born today.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.979
They are going to learn how to cure for these twins,
how to resuscitate them, how to wipe them.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:38.859
We are actually in the labor and obstetric wards.
Believe it or not, this mannequin does deliver

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.049
and we can program her to deliver
a infant. if you look up on the monitor

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.889
I want you to see this she is contracting. Those little
lumps are contractions. And what do you think

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.009
the beep beep beep beep beeping sounds are?

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:54.210
Baby's heartbeat. I am very proud to work
at this school.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.240
Being able to bring students into a simulation,
having them work with the patient who is having

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.120
chest pain and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.550
letting them problem-solve and work in a very
safe environment,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.040
so that when they actually go to the hospitals
that take care of our community,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.870
that they have that confidence that they need
to go in and take care of that patient..
