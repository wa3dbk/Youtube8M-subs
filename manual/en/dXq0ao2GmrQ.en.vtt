00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.470
Whether you get dry-ice from the store, or
make it at home with a fire extinguisher,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.859
here are 5 things you could do with dry-ice,
but probably shouldn't.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.920
For this first experiment, I’m using this
bottle of fuel line antifreeze because it’s

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.410
99% isopropyl alcohol. Like other alcohols,
this stuff has to get tremendously cold before

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400
it’ll freeze. So if we mix in some chunks
of dry ice, you can see the ice boils violently

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.109
until the temperature cools down around
-109F/-78.5C. Now we’ve got a makeshift

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.859
"cryogenic napalm", so let’s see what happens
if we drop in a gummy worm. This sub zero

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.270
slurry is so cold, that it flash freezes the
worm completely solid in under 20 seconds.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.520
In fact it’s so hard now that if we try
hitting it with a hammer, the whole thing

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.090
shatters like it was made of glass. The sudden
transformation really is incredible, and you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.360
might just have to break one to believe it.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.510
Did you know you can use dry ice to make a
popsicle? Start by making a groove or an indentation

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
in a slab of dry-ice about half an inch deep.
Now try balancing a popsicle stick in the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.399
center of the groove, then fill it up with
your favorite drink. You’ll see that the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.020
instant it touches the dry ice, it will fog
over with a misty white vapor. Now because

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.470
dry ice is only freezing the liquid on the
bottom side, it’s going to take a few minutes

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.840
for the cold to penetrate all the way through,
so just sit back, and enjoy the magic happening

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.240
right before your eyes. In a little over 10
minutes, you should be able to give your popsicle

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.240
a little wiggle and pull it out of the mold,
but don’t lick it yet. This popsicle is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.240
about 5 times colder than normal and will
stick to your tongue. So dip it in a glass

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.060
of water to warm it up a bit first, then sit
back and enjoy your delicious homemade dry-icicle.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.119
Now check this out. We know that dry-ice is
a solid that sublimates straight into a gas.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.869
But what if we could turn it into a liquid?
If dry-ice can be liquified, does it become

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.799
"dry water"? Liquid CO2 can’t actually exist
in our atmosphere. But if we’re really really

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.200
careful, there is a way we can see it in it’s
liquid state. If we fill a special preform

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.840
with a few pieces of dry ice and seal it inside,
it will immediately begin pressurizing the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.329
container. Once the pressure gets up around
75 pounds per square inch, an amazing thing

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.560
begins to happen. The ice starts to melt,
and we can actually see what liquid carbon

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.409
dioxide looks like. Now we really need to
watch this carefully because as soon as the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.979
ice melts, the pressure can quickly rise to
well over 1000 PSI and blow the container.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.300
Before this one explodes, let’s watch what
happens to the fluid if we carefully release

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.970
the pressure and remove the cap. The liquid
is instantly transformed into dry-ice snow,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260
and you can see all the fluid has suddenly
disappeared. Now to show you why this demonstration

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.360
is so risky, let’s put one of these containers
in a cup filled with warm water, then get

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.650
really really far away. You can see exactly
how clear and beautiful liquid dry ice is,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.239
and at the same time, exactly how powerful
it can be as well. Hopefully this gives an

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.610
idea of why this should only be attempted
by professionals, if attempted at all.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.790
Here’s one you can try at home. Drop some
dry ice into a container of warm water to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.890
get a thick vapor flowing, then lean in close,
and suck in as quickly as you can. If you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.099
do it right, it’s going to look really really
cool. The white smoke is safe to breathe because

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.040
it’s just water vapor mixed with carbon
dioxide. So go creep someone out with your

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.269
new supernatural ability. Now if you want
to take it to the next level, try capturing

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.209
all the gas in a balloon. CO2 is what triggers
your reflex to exhale, and if you try breathing

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.280
it straight, it will force you to cough, tingle
your insides and leave you feeling a little

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.519
light headed.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.610
For this next experiment we need to be out
in the open and away from anything flammable.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.430
You can see I’ve drilled a hole into this
slab of dry ice and that’s where we’re

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.940
going to be dropping a coiled strand of magnesium
ribbon. Now watch what happens when we light

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.879
the magnesium with a blow torch, drop it down
in the hole, and seal it with another slab

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.459
of dry ice. It creates a vicious reaction
that burns brighter than the sun. Which you

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.940
can see is enough to light up my yard in the
middle of the night. Now the crazy thing about

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.599
this, is carbon dioxide usually puts out fires
because it starves the fire of oxygen. But

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.690
in this reaction the magnesium is so hungry
for it, that it rips oxygen right out of the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.280
frozen CO2, and leaves behind a pile of black
and white ash. The remains are mostly Magnesium

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.409
Oxide and Magnesium Nitride, but the black
ash contains a lot of elemental carbon, which,

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.480
interestingly enough, is the same stuff you
use for grilling.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.269
Well there are 5 crazy and dangerous experiments you could do with dry ice, but really

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.400
probably shouldn’t. That’s it for now.
If you liked these projects perhaps you’ll

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.370
like some of my others. Check them out at
www.thekingofrandom.com

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I get asked all the time where to get dry
ice, so I'm going to tell you.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you’re over 18, it could be as easy as your local grocery store. 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.530
All the big chains seem to carry it, and all you have to do is ask for it when you’re checking

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.820
out.  So it's as easy as that.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.240
I’ve also got a video right over here, showing how you could make it at home with a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.800
carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, so maybe
take a look at that one next.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.210
I am constantly working on new videos to show you, and I’ve just sat down and planned out the next

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.100
5 months worth. So "Sugar Rockets", the "Mini
Arc Furnace" and "Fight Club Soap Molds" are

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.970
all on the list, because I know you’ve been
patiently waiting for them.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.560
Thank you for always being one of the first
to watch my videos when they come out. I always

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.639
check to see if you like them, and what you
have to say. So keep doing that, and I will

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.509
keep making them.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.180
And I’ll be looking for you in the next
project video. See you then.
