00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.040
Sunder Pichai, heading Android at Google,
announced Android One at Google IO 2014 held

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.370
in late June. No doubt that apart from Android
L, Android One was the most exciting news

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.420
we had back then.&nbsp;
Android One is a new a program announced by

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.610
Google to provide the best android experience
for the masses who are looking for a smartphone

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.200
at a price less than Rs 10,000 or say less
than $150. This sub 10k smartphone market

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.440
is gigantic in most of the developing markets.
In India, more than 70% android devices sold

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.900
fall under this sub 10k price category and
India is the world’s second biggest telecom market!

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.590
So what exactly is Android One series?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.550
New OS by Google? Well, its rather a pure android
experience which is controlled by Google completely

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.040
and targeted for the masses. MicroMax, Spice
&amp; Karbonn are the first Android One partners

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.810
for pure manufacturing needs and on September
15th, Google along with these three manufacturers

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.040
launched their respective Android One devices at price bracket less than Rs. 6500.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.479
All three Android One devices have the exact same specifications and same experience, the only difference being the design.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.100
Micromax A1 is one of the three Android One devices now made available in India for Rs. 6499.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.640
It is powered by the MediaTek MT6582

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.990
quad core Cortex A7 chip clocked at 1.3GHz
along with 1GB RAM &amp; 4GB on-board storage.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.869
All android one devices have Android KitKat
4.4.4 out of the box and will receive all

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.549
android updates till next 2 years.&nbsp;
A1 has 4.5” FWVGA display which has decent

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.049
viewing angles. The brightness levels are
good enough indoors but A1 display struggles

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.329
under bright sunlight. Instead of touch keys, navigation keys are onscreen, just like Nexus devices.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.020
The bezel around the display is thick
but despite that A1 doesn’t feel like a big phone.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.759
On top we have a circular earpiece
grill just like the Nexus 5 and its accompanied

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.140
by a 2MP front camera. Just above the display,
we have couple of sensors and the LED notification

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.130
light is placed at right of the earpiece.&nbsp;
The right side of A1 has power &amp; volume control

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.470
keys. Bottom of the device has the micro USB
port and primary microphone, but it lacks

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.050
a secondary microphone for noise cancellation.
Keeping the left absolutely blank, company

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.750
has given 3.5mm audio jack on top right.&nbsp;
The A1 has smooth &amp; soft touch matt plastic back panel.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.600
The camera module is 5MP with
auto focus along with LED flash. The camera

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.190
bump reminds us of the Nokia Lumia 1020. Micromax
has given beautiful metallic finish to the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.520
camera bump and the same&nbsp;treatment is given
to the Micromax logo. Just like the earpiece,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.280
the speaker placed at the back also has a
circular grill. No doubt, Micromax has given

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.900
a distinctive identity to A1.
Tuned &amp; optimised by Google, the android 4.4.4

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.680
runs super smooth on A1. I couldn’t notice
a single noticeable frame drop while navigating

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.560
within UI while using the device for a month.
Social apps like Facebook &amp; twitter run quite

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.390
smooth. Even if we have multiple apps open
in the background, the device doesn’t slow

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.750
down. When it comes to pure user experience
at this price point, the Micromax A1 definitely

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.800
gets 5 stars.&nbsp;
Micromax A1 battery lasted for almost a day

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.150
with more than 2 hours of screen on time with
moderate use. Unfortunately we don’t have

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.640
quick charging in A1 and it takes almost 2
and a half hours to charge the 1700mAh removable

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.450
battery using the supplied 1 ampere output
wall charger.&nbsp;

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.260
When it comes to call quality A1 was great.
The earpiece output was not too high but still

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.569
loud enough to be audible in noisier places.
Despite the small size of the loudspeaker,

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.319
it provided decent output. But don’t expect
any spectacular speaker performance here.&nbsp;

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.069
All previous generations of MediaTek chipsets
used to perform quite poorly in audio quality

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.069
tests. But the MT6582 in A1 has shown lot
of improvements. The headphone amp had average

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.590
output to our test earphones like Creative
Aurvana 2 but failed to provide even decent

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.590
output to Bose QC20. Bundled earphone set
is quite basic too. Micromax A1 has provided

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.850
controlled highs and mids but lacked when
it comes to low frequencies.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.280
FM Radio is present on A1, and the app has
basic features like storing the scanned stations

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.060
and to record FM radio. A1 struggled capturing
FM signals indoor but was good enough outdoors.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.780
The quality of FM radio output to headphones
is above average with decent output.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.910
To our surprise, the A1 was able to play full
HD videos out of the box. But yes it failed

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.310
to handle the AC3 audio codec but played MP4
videos with stereo sound out of the box. The

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.750
default android video app has no support for
subtitles or any special features.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.410
In terms of benchmark scores, the Antutu score
was above 18 thousand which actually matches

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.530
the Moto G 2nd generation. This is definitely
a great performance by a device priced below

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.720
Rs 6500.&nbsp;
The Micromax A1 has a 5MP AF camera and a

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.540
2MP fixed focus front camera. Both cameras
provide decent quality images in daylight

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.060
and even in indoor environments with good
amount of light. The default camera app is

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.990
Google Camera which provides all camera features,
like HDR mode, Lens Blur, Panorama, Photo

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.169
Sphere and even Full HD video recording,&nbsp;

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.309
Here are some samples captured by the 5MP
main camera.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.220
A1 can also record Full HD, HD and 480p videos
at 30 FPS.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.980
We noticed frame drops in Full HD video recordings but 720p and 480p video
recordings were good enough.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.520
The audio recorded in videos is mono. The front camera can also
record 720p videos.&nbsp;

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.860
We were surprised when A1 handled intensive&nbsp;3D
graphics&nbsp;games like Real Racing 3 without

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.169
any noticeable stress. We experienced little
heating issues when we played Real Racing

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.080
3 at a stretch for 30 mins.&nbsp;But we didn’t
face any excessive heating of the&nbsp;device&nbsp;while

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.810
playing games.&nbsp;
Android One series is definitely a great initiative,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.330
where the entire hardware and software is
completely controlled by Google but at sub

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.500
10k price points. The biggest advantage with
android one series is smooth performance and

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.130
timely android updates for 2 years directly
by Google just like Nexus devices. Micromax

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.320
A1 is the first device of the Android One
series, which just proved that even at low

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.770
prices, android experience can be enjoyable
without any irritating lags!

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.970
We believe that this series of devices will
be a big success in most developing markets

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.490
including India. Thanks for watching the detailed
