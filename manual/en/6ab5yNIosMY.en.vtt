00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.160
Move over Montessori, there's a new coolest
school in town - well not any town nearby,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.360
but Australia's first Rodeo School has opened
in Mount Isa.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.920
The Isa Rodeo School is a prestigious academy
in the arts of bronco and bull riding and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.740
being a rodeo clown, meaning that the students
were specially selected based on their experience,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.540
knowledge and age - and willingness to jump
aboard an animal that is bucking wildly.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.370
The school was set up as the opening event
of the Mount Isa Rodeo, the largest rodeo

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.010
in the southern hemisphere which attracts
25,000 visitors every year, and of which the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.590
school has now planned to be an annual event.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.120
The opportunity to learn the ins and outs
of flailing about on the back of a bull attracted

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.689
pupils from thousands of kilometres away.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.440
I like to do it for a different sort of adrenalin,
something different that you don't usually

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.210
do every day.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.180
I didn't have too much experience before I
came here and when I came here I learned plenty

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.060
of different techniques and none that I'd
really known when I first started riding bulls,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.500
everything's new so I've just got to practise
that now.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.810
My uncle used to do a bit of bull riding and
I always looked up to him and I thought, I

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.790
want to do that! I asked him if I could practise
up at his place on his little bulls started

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.420
out at the star of the year. It was great, I learnt a
lot, mainly about keeping balance and picking

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.720
myself up back onto the bull and from falling.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.540
Aside from just staying balanced, the school
also taught the would-be cowboys and cowgirls

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.409
animal welfare procedures, safety and dismount
techniques.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.939
Unfortunately the guys up here don't have
a lot of opportunities to learn the skills

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.469
to ride bulls. They got the willpower to do it
and the want to do it but no opportunities

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.289
and that's what it's really all about, giving
these kids an opportunity to learn from the best.
