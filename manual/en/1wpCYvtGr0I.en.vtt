00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.900
I

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.699
also the wound up going orlando and beating
them whites on the home court

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.019
and apparently Paul here's meted out after
the game

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.989
anybody got a broom

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.850
so of course this is cause a tremendous controversy

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.570
I okay

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.859
and %uh

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.370
at at least one up on his web site as well

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.080
he says he was

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.840
that is

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.449
and that despite the white house

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.720
but it is web site was takin' in exit polls
that message

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.609
but isn't highly irrelevant who cares if the
post of the and posted

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:41.719
as the fact is

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.230
%uh they kicked orlando's ask that at the
lunch money and they're going back to boston

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.410
so that doesn't sit well with orlando of course

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.330
as always the question arises I love sports
fans and I and the guilt his of them on

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.030
orlando can't just lose the question is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.680
did it go

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.150
an answer is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.200
yes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.999
but a

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.329
there's Carter eighty four percent prefer
sure

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:07.939
the state trooper it does

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.979
I mean he looked like he was up

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.130
that's up it up

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.260
Paul or a barrel

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.870
and he misses but

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.110
cloud that's moved

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.270
on a time out

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.410
gglobal you for taking the time out

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.750
winds up and the time that the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.030
Paul the back court

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.570
ann lewis is three to four seconds

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.010
whole amateur move

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.730
at the end of the game in boston seals another
one

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.619
mandate top their veterans heart of a champion
an airborne these guys down

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.360
so to a large extent that goal and on that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.590
show yes

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.960
and I would not have run out

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.939
but the white house came back he played once
again that's what that's what a and he played

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:47.990
home

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.260
the ones that need to be addressed show

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.010
one one side or the other side has its own
been of on what they're going to get together

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.469
the question I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.160
but the pulpit

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.430
situation

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.820
this is really do anything his is going up
is automatically a commitment to continue

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.590
back in in boston a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.789
that it and I think what about the bulletin
boards weekend

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:13.650
really

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.560
but here's what I know that you're I think
that it does moderates of people because

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.809
a lot of people no matter how professional
that a matter of how high level they are

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:28.730
they get affected by their emotions that and
but don't you go on I find it unacceptable

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.690
it was me

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.819
that wouldn't effect me one bit is not what
we just saw little knowledge

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.549
that would somebody else says

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.419
entirely irrelevant

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.599
well I think that you know what get I know

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.839
like

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.889
others weeks

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.249
of west Los angeles

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.419
the that it

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.280
but since then that's how I compete and it
might get a clown level right

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.080
and I think

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.510
that we say the expectation that that's out

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.869
professional athletes should

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.930
abby but having a lot of times they're not

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.930
but there

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.000
someone a lackadaisical and they needed it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.419
the light a fire under the them that's why
those speeches by the coaches sometimes work

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.769
I mean randall world his record lows

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.349
so meetings but that is the most of it is
that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.749
so let's continue better but

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.650
my guess is that something you're all over
them
