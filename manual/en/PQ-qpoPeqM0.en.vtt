00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.259
All right.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.090
So you get off your bike and you see that
you have a flat tire.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.780
Basically the tire is not inflated with any
air.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780
You're wondering why.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.641
You have to basically take your tire off,
take your wheel off, and you're going to check

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.600
the tire and make sure that there aren't any
punctures in the tire.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.160
So just go around the tire, checking to see
if there's any glass or metal, especially

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.390
in New York City you see tons of glass that
may be protruding out of your tire.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
Then if you don't see any glass, what you're
gonna want to do is you're gonna want to take

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:49.730
off your tire, exposing the tube inside.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:00.960
Now, once you have the tube out you're be
able to see more of what the flat is all about.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:21.130
So this tube, we're gonna take a pump, pump
up the tube, and try to find the puncture.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.560
So it looks like there's a small little hole
in the tube, so usually what that is, is something

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.159
that went through the tire.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.100
So you want to check around the tire on the
inside.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.189
There may be something embedded in the actual
tire like a piece of glass.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.810
Just be very careful not to cut your fingers.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.060
Another type of flat demonstrated in this
tube here is a pinch flat and basically what

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.770
that means is you didn't have your tire inflated
to the proper pressure which is always labeled

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.479
right on the side of the tire on the sidewall,
so it will say something like between maybe

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.250
40 to 60 psi or 80 to 100 psi.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.390
You want to make sure that you have it up
to the specific psi or else you will get something

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.280
that's called a pinch flat which is right
here you'll see.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.450
It looks like a snake bite and what that means
is that the tire actually pushes against the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.920
rim when you go over something like a pothole
or a rock.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.520
Another type of flat is called a blowout and
basically what will happen is if your tire's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.900
not seated correctly, basically meaning that
if the tire is not on the rim properly, what

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.940
could happen is if you have it to a certain
psi and you go over a bump or even if you

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.980
don't go over a bump, the tube comes out of
the tire and off of the rim and explodes and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
it actually sounds like a shotgun.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.530
It can be pretty scary.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.200
And the last flat could have been something
that basically is stuck in your tire, like

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.730
there's a pretty substantial hole right here.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.520
It could have stuck in your tire and just
come right out.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.770
So you want to make sure that you check the
tire and make sure, even if there isn't something

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.510
there, there may be a big hole in the tire,
so you need to replace your tire and your

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.510
tube.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.400
All these different flats require different
fixes so we'll talk about that next.
