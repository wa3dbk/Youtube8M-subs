00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
- Hey guys!

00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:02.155
First of all, I’m not naked.

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:04.073
See? Got clothes on.

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.660
Second of all, clichéd phrase coming up,

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.373
but it’s July already?

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.123
No seriously though,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.085
like what the hell?

00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:20.215
And thirdly, it’s my June favorites video.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:21.883
I always like to start with books,

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:24.343
so books!

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:26.596
The first is ‘Remix,’ by Non Pratt.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:28.223
You may recall a couple months ago

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:32.935
one of my favorites was
‘Trouble’ by Non Pratt.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:35.188
This is her new book.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.815
It’s a story of two best friends

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:39.191
who go to a music festival together

00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:40.735
after they finish their GCSE’s, which is

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.363
your exam’s you take when you’re 16

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:44.321
if you’re not from the UK.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:47.158
It’s just ultimately
about female friendship.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.161
There’s obviously boy
drama, there’s family drama.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.623
Very good, and it pushes some interesting

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.375
boundaries that I won’t
talk about right now

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:59.253
because there is a video
planned all about that.

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:02.256
My other favorite that I
actually just finished today

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:05.051
is ‘The Opposite of
Loneliness’ by Marina Keegan.

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:07.178
It’s a book of short stories and essays.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.056
Marina was a student at
Yale University, and was

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:14.810
crazy talented and died in a car accident

00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:16.646
five days after she graduated.

00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:18.063
In her essay ‘The Opposite of Loneliness’

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:22.026
there is a line that
says, let me find it...

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:26.405
“We’re so young, we’re so
young, we’re 22 years old.

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:28.075
“We have so much time.”

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.871
(groans)

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:37.083
The skeptic in me wonders whether

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.295
if she hadn’t have died, would she

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:43.798
still be considered a
really talented writer

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.425
and would be published eventually.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.553
Okay, I’m really excited about this.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:50.263
It’s something that I have been working on

00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:53.975
for a long time, and
it’s finally happening.

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:58.813
And so my favorites
this month is my mercy.

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.858
You can go to my shop:
hannahwitton.bigcartel.com,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.861
link in the description, and have a gander

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:07.863
and see if you want anything.

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:10.907
So far there are two items on the shop

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.910
and I’m gonna show you them.

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.745
First one is this poster!

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.040
So I came up for the idea for this poster

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.625
and then my sister did the design

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.420
and it just says, “Do
I look like a slut*?”

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.338
And there’s a little
asterisk, and then this text

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.423
that you probably can’t read, it says:

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.428
“There’s not such thing as a slut.”

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:33.390
And I’m just so pleased
with how they turned out.

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.601
I really hope that you
like this, cause I do.

00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.605
The other thing is a
drunk advice tote bag,

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:44.566
which I do not have
physical items of currently

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:46.026
but it looks like this!

00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:49.113
I love it.

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:51.783
Harriet, who I will link to below,

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:55.120
she’s the one that designed the motion

00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.830
graphic thing at the beginning
of drunk advice episodes,

00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.581
and I was like, “Yo, Harriet.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:01.835
“Can we do some drunk advice mercy?”

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:03.670
And she was just like, “Hell yes.”

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.171
I’ve worked really hard on these,

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:08.466
and I just hope that it’s
something that you want.

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:11.093
Speaking of you guys,
another favorite this month

00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.053
is this!

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:14.763
Congratulations for surpassing
100,000 subscribers.

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:16.556
I got this a while ago, but I forgot

00:03:16.558 --> 00:03:18.810
to put it in a favorites,
and so I’m putting it

00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:21.103
in one now, and I just wanted to be like

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:22.563
“Thank you!”

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:24.815
So you know what happened in June?

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:26.483
Orange is the New Black.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:30.030
Poussey and Taystee...

00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:32.948
I have so much love
for them, so much love.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.786
I got to go to the London launch
for Orange is the New Black

00:03:36.788 --> 00:03:39.496
and we got to see two episodes
before they were released,

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:41.751
and they gave us a goody bag...

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:44.460
Full of Orange is the New Black stuff,

00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.378
and oh my god I love them.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.005
This is now just gonna seem like an ad

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:49.381
for Orange is the New
Black but I don’t even care

00:03:49.383 --> 00:03:51.466
because generally these
things are just my favorites.

00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:54.928
An Orange is the New Black yoga mat!

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.390
And it says...

00:03:57.683 --> 00:04:02.020
“In it for the long stretch.”

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:02.811
On it.

00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:05.523
And I love it, it’s great.

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:07.066
I’m a bit stuck.

00:04:07.068 --> 00:04:08.818
It’s a chicken!

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.278
Underwear.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.278
Litch Bitch.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.906
So one thing that kind of
related to the yoga mat

00:04:13.908 --> 00:04:18.411
segueing into another
favorite, is meditation.

00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:20.079
I know that sounds really weird,

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.165
but genuinely I have been trying

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:24.750
to practice mindful meditation

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.795
and doing like 10 minutes every day.

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:29.046
Mindfulness is basically all about living

00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:31.423
in the moment, and not worrying about

00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:33.341
the future, or worrying about the past,

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:36.011
and just being present
and, like, taking notice

00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:37.596
of the things that are around you.

00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:39.390
I’ve been using the app Headspace

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:41.935
and I’m coming towards
the end of my free trial,

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:44.770
and if any of you guys have used Headspace

00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.730
please let me know in
the comments if you think

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:49.566
it’s worth purchasing
the subscription to it.

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:51.610
Because I’m having a
really good time in it,

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.198
and I’ve generally noticed
that I’m so much more happy.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200
You may think that I’m a happy person

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:59.993
in general, but I am a constant worrier.

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:03.540
I’m just relaxed so much more because

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.835
when you fully, like, live in the moment

00:05:06.836 --> 00:05:09.628
you’re just so much
happier because you’re not

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.546
distracted by other thoughts.

00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:13.800
So if you saw on my Snapchat, oh,

00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.718
Snapchat, another favorite.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.636
I’ve gotten into Snapchat now.

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:22.183
You can follow me by taking a
picture of Snapchat, of this.

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:23.976
But yeah, i you do follow me on Snapchat

00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.645
you’ll have seen that I went
to a Taylor Swift concert

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:29.440
in Manchester and (exhales sharply)

00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:31.400
oh my god I’ve got a souvenir.

00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:32.985
Look, it still lights up.

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:34.778
It still lights up!

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.698
Taylor!

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.031
I just think she’s fantastic.

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:40.160
Two or three years ago I started to like

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:43.036
Taylor Swift ironically, and now I’m like,

00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:44.871
“I think she might be one
of my favorite celebrities.”

00:05:44.873 --> 00:05:46.081
(squeals)

00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:48.376
It was so good!

00:05:49.753 --> 00:05:51.795
I’ve got a website that’s
a favorite this month.

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:53.631
It’s called, ‘Reductress.’

00:05:53.633 --> 00:05:56.758
I’m just gonna read you
some of the article titles.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.678
“How to Make Your Vagina Smell
as Amazing as His Balls.”

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.890
“Fun Things to Say When He Enters You.”

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:05.686
“Five Sex Moves You Probably
Got From Your Parents.”

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:07.936
I love that website.

00:06:07.938 --> 00:06:08.980
I will link it below.

00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:11.023
Got a fashion favorite for you!

00:06:11.025 --> 00:06:13.901
It’s this thing that I’m
wearing that you can’t see,

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:15.110
but it’s a jumpsuit.

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.945
Picture!

00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:17.071
Oh, and what was that?

00:06:17.073 --> 00:06:19.490
Oh, that was me on the
white carpet for Magic Mike,

00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.908
which is another favorite.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.661
Just naked men really like dancing,

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:26.873
and so many things happened to my body

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:28.750
in that cinema.

00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:31.835
And on that note: thanks
for watching this video.

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.630
Please give it a thumbs up if you liked it

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:36.215
and let me know some of your
favorite things from this month

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:38.508
in the comments.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.595
I hope that you are all well

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:42.471
and I’ll see you soon.

00:06:42.473 --> 00:06:44.188
Bye!

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.260
(soft music)
