00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.970
I'd like to introduce you to my fabrics. There's a lovely collection of them.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.640
A bit of boho chic... A little bit of French...

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.890
A bit of country...

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.640
And this is a collection I think works
really well with my paints. And this is...

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.220
...what is called toile... a Toile de Jouy. All cotton. And what I love about this...

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.920
...is that it's a modern fabric.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.109
So you could team the two together so
you can have modern and French...

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.989
...together. I quite like that sort of little frisson of difference.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.740
I think it's terrific. I want to show you
why the French make double-width fabrics...

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.530
...and I've done some drawings in my
sketchbook. They do it because they put it...

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.660
on their walls.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.280
I don't know if any of you have ever been into a room which is covered in fabric...

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.170
...but it is so lovely.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.649
This is my French Hens one which I
really, really love and that's a really...

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.930
...perfect one for a sort of country look. This one has got a real country feel to it as well...

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.650
...it also could be French. I mean, anything really.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.700
These are two of my tickings. They have a
particular weave about them because they...

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
...were used for mattresses to stop the feathers coming through but it does make...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.680
...them have a lovely texture. Now I don't
have time to do what I used to do which...

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.180
...is I used to make my own curtains a lot. I used to hand sew them.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.170
And I now work with Julie, who is...

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.060
...just totally on my wavelength. She understands how I work. She's terrific.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.030
She's going to demonstrate how to
do simple curtain, a simple blind and...

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.120
...a simple cushion so you can do it for
yourself.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.509
A: So Julie, what I want to do is make
this really simple cushion
J: Lovely!

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.210
A: It's two sort of panels or squares of fabric and then put together and there's...

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.850
...no zips, there's no flaps. and there's no button
holes. I thought we could do something like...

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.780
...like this toile. Get a really nice little image from the middle.
J: So you want this one behind that one?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.079
J: And you want to see a bit of that bit.
A: Exactly!

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.750
J: We're going to make a cushion cover with...

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.420
...two pieces of fabric...

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.019
contrast.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.779
Measure the cushion pad.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.799
So, what I'm doing is... turn your two pieces of...

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:27.719
fabric...

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.790
...with the right side on the inside.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.579
Pin the...

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.379
...fabric together...

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.059
...with the right side of the fabric...

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.939
...on the inside.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:46.939
And then machine it together.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.509
Now you cut your corners.

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:57.429
Trim your corners.

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:01.289
You cut the hole in the middle to turn it...

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:08.289
...the right side.

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:24.369
And you need to push the corners out.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:26.629
And you make the back...

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:32.759
...the same.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.689
Pin them together.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.869
But you only sew...

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:44.869
...three sides.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:01.219
And then you pin the bottom.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.809
And that's the finished cushion!

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.689
A: Brilliant! Brilliant, Julie. Thank you so much.
