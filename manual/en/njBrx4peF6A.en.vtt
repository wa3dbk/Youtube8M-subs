Hi, I’m Thibarik from DBM team. 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 Readers, you are with us since 7 years and 1000 pages...

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.460
New readers or earlier ones...

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.860
The whole team thank you for following us, for supporting us. Sincerly.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560
This gives us a powerful incentive to continue.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.360
Hum... I'm not going to make a long speech...

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.300
This time, you, readers in all the world, 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.480
you will speak about your epic DBM moments..

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.920
Let's go !

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.760
 Hello, I’m Tomás Tapia de Cinco Saltos, from Argentine.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.520
 I think the best DBM moment is the battle between Vegetto and Broly because they are the most powerful ones..

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.280
Adrien, from Rennes, France. I didn’t see any DBZ movie before discovering Dragon Ball Multiverse.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.120
 And I was curious about characters like Broly or Bojack.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.900
 ...It’s already the 1000th page… Nice job guys!

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.260
Keep up the good work and thanks a lot for all you have done!

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.740
Hello, I’m JP, from Lyon, France.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.080
I loved the battle in which Trunks said that the destiny has the sense of humor

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.500
 because of Coola being the only one in his familiy he didn’t kill already…

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.600
I appreciate a lot the famous battle between Vegetto and Broly where they used all of their power.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.760
Finally, I appreciate the whole universe 13,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.040
particularly the moment where Vegeta become SSJ3. I wish you an excellent continuation.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.880
Hi, I'm Dario and I live in Catanzaro (Italy). My nickname is "Devil_Dario".

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:46.716
The scenes of DBM that I liked particularly are

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:52.456
 the one where SSJ3 Vegetto appeared, that couldn't be better,

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:56.756
and the battle between King Cold and Bardock, because it's very cool and superbly draw.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.720
That’s all!... Good bye everybody !

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.300
Hello, I’m Lazard, from Le Havre, France.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.140
For me, it’s the battle between Vegeta and Raichi.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.360
 Especially when we see the frost demon with augmentation form, I found it really cool.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.060
Also the battle between Vegetto and 21… or erm, “kzi”... I don’t know how we pronunce it.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.840
It’s a funny battle but with an important part of mystery.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.280
We would like to know more about this character… with a number for his name…

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:44.080
My DBM pals, how are you ? My nickname is Bani Azul Crema,  you can find me on Facebook.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.540
My 2 favorite battles are Vegetto against Broly, and...

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.040
I like also the battle between Cold and Bardock.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.560
 I’m from Toluca, state of Mexico, in Mexico. Thank you for listenng me, see you later, I’m waiting for your invitation!

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.200
Hello, I’m Goten-Kun, forme Seine et Marne (France).

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.580
 The DBM scene who marked me the most was Vegetto against XXI because he looked ordinar 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.060
but it was a twist in the story of the tournament with the elimination of Vegetto.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.760
From then on, it trumped the rules for everyone (everyone had a chance again); we don’t know who can win the tournament.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.920
It caused also vegetto’s rage. We all thought it would degenerate.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.940
 I think this event will have a lot of consequences, we’re waiting for the continuation, it will be interesting!

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:40.080
Hello everybody, Vegetaxe, from Sevilla, Spain. I appreciated the presentation of universe 9. 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.220
And the battles between Cell and Bojack,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.920
and between Vegeta from universe 13 and Raichi.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.620
Thank you to the story writer and the drawers.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.220
Hello, I'm Òscar Treminio Gomez from Malgrat de Mar, in Barcelona (Spain). 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:06.300
The most stunning scene in DBM was  when Cell pulled his head up in order to win his match against Dabra.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.300
I think it was really impressive. Thanks a lot. Good bye.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.960
I’m Grat Saiyaman ! Or Grenziger when I’m commenting the pages.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.560
I’m almost 36 and I live in Saint Chamont, in Loire (France).

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.320
We were asked about our favorite DBM moment.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.340
 I can’t say for a simple reason : it’s 1000 pages of happiness.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.320
You made me young again, you made me remember sensations of my youth.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.320
 I think of DBM as happiness only.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.920
So I just wanted to say : thank you for firing our imagination, and I hope to see you soon!

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:53.900
That's all. I want to thank all the readers who contributed to this video. It was a lot of fun to organize and put together.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.520
Now is the time to thank the team. It's a big team as you can suspect.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.280
There's around 100 persons who work on DBM, as you can see on this credits list.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.180
We try to thank them all by naming them here with a music backround. Let's Son Gohan do it.
