How to Avoid Cash-for-Gold Scams.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.130
When gold prices rise, selling your gold jewelry
might seem like an easy way to make extra

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.130
cash.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.960
But you have to be wary -- a lot of scammers
are out there to rip you off.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.320
You will need Estimate of your gold's value
Several offers Established, local buyers and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.460
license check.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.640
Step 1.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.509
Know that gold jewelry is bought based on
weight and purity.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.220
Have an estimate of the weight in troy ounces
of your item, minus any stones or non-gold

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.030
areas, and know the purity, such as 14 or
18 karat.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.079
Divide the number of karats by 24, the percentage
of pure gold, for the percentage of gold of

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.910
your piece.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.380
Step 2.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.480
Get an estimate of the value of your gold
by putting in the weight and purity numbers,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.670
along with the current price of gold, into
an online gold price calculator.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.489
Step 3.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.230
Consider an offer fair if you are offered
at least 50 percent of the gold value for

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.230
the jewelry.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.310
For example, if you've calculated that the
metal value of your piece was worth $120,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.000
consider a $60 offer valid.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.640
Reputable companies consistently offer around
50 percent, while disreputable companies consistently

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.180
offer much less.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.860
Step 4.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.080
Get multiple offers.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.940
Ask each buyer the weight, purity, and price
per gram they are using to calculate price.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.960
If a jeweler offers an extra high trade in
value toward purchase of new merchandise,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.530
make sure to get another offer first as you
may be able to secure a better cash buy price.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.680
It is possible the karat weight listed on
your piece is lower than marked.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.820
If several buyers note the lower purity, they
are probably correct.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.820
Step 5.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.130
Deal with established local buyers.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.720
Coin or bullion dealers often offer the best
prices.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.470
Never deal with mail-in companies, which typically
low-ball, counting on the fact that most people

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.490
are unlikely to solicit other offers.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.470
Don't let your jewelry out of your sight until
you sell it.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.250
Stones could be removed or switched.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.480
Step 6.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.480
Be wary of quotes you get over the phone.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.200
Many times, the price will be lower when you
get inside the store.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.739
Step 7.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.120
Get separate offers for each piece if you
only have a few.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.840
If you several, all items of the same karat
weight may be weighed as one lot.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840
Step 8.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.379
Watch out for prices quoted in pennyweights
instead of grams, which some buyers use to

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.379
make their offers sound higher.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.280
There are 20 pennyweights in a troy ounce,
so if one buyer is paying $12 per gram, the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.260
buyer using pennyweights would have to offer
$18.60 per pennyweight to match it.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Step 9.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.549
Ensure that prospective buyers are licensed
and comply with state and local laws.

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.459
Many states require a separate license from
the police department or sheriff's office

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.349
in order to legally buy items from the public.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.170
Buyers who fail to comply are more likely
to rip you off.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.209
Did you know The California gold rush began
on January 24, 1848, when James W. Marshall

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.989
found a gold nugget in the American River
while working at John Sutter's mill.
