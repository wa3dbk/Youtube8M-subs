00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.560
In this clip we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to replace your engines

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.910
timing belt and water pump. In this step we're
going to talk about the proper service procedure

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.110
for removal of the actual water pump from
the engine. Down inside here is where the

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.970
water pump is located. The water pump is actually,
this is the pulley for the water pump, and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.039
it's located all the way around here, and
it has five mounting bolts that hold it on,

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.960
now only four of them are still in there.
Through this hole, is where one of the mounting

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.160
bolts for the engine bracket went, we already
got that one taken care of. Now, when you

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.410
take this water pump off, there will be some
coolant that comes out, just being that the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.200
engine block still has some in it, it didn't
drain out through the radiator drain cock.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.980
So, you're going to want to place a bucket
underneath that to keep your floor clean,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.760
being as environmentally friendly as possible.
Take a ten millimeter socket with a swivel,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.140
that really helps out with getting into those
tight places and a small quarter inch ratchet.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.850
Just going to start on the first bolt you
see, there's no particular pattern when taking

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.620
it off, however when tightening it down you
are going to want to use a star pattern, and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:28.610
I'll show you that here in a moment. What
we're going to do to catch as much of that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.630
coolant that's going to drain out, as possible,
is just take and back off all the bolts a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.820
couple of turns. What that will do is let
the water pump come free from the engine a

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.729
little bit and that will give it a crack so
that coolant can drain out from the motor.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.780
Alright, now before you break this water pump
loose, like I said, make sure you have your

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.320
drain pan or bucket beneath it. Once we have
all of the bolts broken free a couple of turns,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.490
we're going to take a rubber mallet and thump
this water pump to break loose the gasket

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.640
connection between the pump and the block
of the engine, that will allow our coolant

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:31.780
to drain out. Alright, once you've made sure
you've gotten as much coolant out of the engine

00:02:31.780 --> 00:03:25.310
as you can, you can go ahead and spin out
your water pump bolts. Alright, and the last

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:46.720
one right there, and now you should be able
to just remove your pump, just like so. That

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.340
is the proper service procedure for draining
the coolant from the block of the engine and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.799
removing the water pump itself.
