Elda G. Ramirez, MSN, RN, FNP: All of a sudden
it was like, okay, head out to George R. Brown,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.810
we’re setting up another site. Go. It was
Friday it was raining and the evacuees were

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.099
coming. I had no idea what to expect, were
they sick, were they not sick, no idea. After

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.680
hours of setting up and making sure we had
all the supplies we needed, the first group

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.280
came in. I looked over to the triage area,
and I saw the first patient, she was this older

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.560
woman in a wheel chair and all of a sudden
I hear this agonizing scream and that was

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.379
it. That’s when it all started. The kids
and the old people were probably the toughest.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.639
Some of the old people, they didn’t even
know where they were. They had no idea what

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.710
was happening to them. It was the saddest
thing because I didn’t know if they had

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.650
family, if they didn’t have family. We were
trying to care for them and make sure that

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.550
they could get food and to the restrooms.
And then there was this baby, this little

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.710
baby. Who was maybe a week old, and it was
gorgeous and it was all wrapped up in these

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.309
little blankets and all of us just took turns
caring for him and carrying him and changing

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:52.400
diapers. And when the relatives finally came
to pick him up we were just like, at a loss

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.400
because he had become part of our little family.

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:06.529
The George R. Brown, wow, what an amazing experience. It went from this empty huge space,
like a tomb, to this living organism, it was

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:11.339
amazing. We set up everything from scratch.
Me and a couple of docs, we were the first

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:16.430
ones there. We were from really different
backgrounds, OBGYN, family practice, and I’m

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.430
emergency medicine. I’m used to things happening
really quickly and now. And it was just fantastic.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.550
We set everything up from women’s health,
to psych, to emergency care. UT totally came

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.939
through for us. It was awesome. Now, I don’t
want to sound spoiled, but everything that

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:37.689
I asked for, somehow, I got it. Now this doesn’t
happen to me in normal life. In this situation,

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.370
from tube feeding, to a place for evacuees to go to an AA Meetings. We had dental,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.830
vision, pharmacy, radiology, even a group
that did massages. The nursing response reminded

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.909
me of why I’m a nurse. Nurses came all the
way from Hawaii (now I’d like to go to Hawaii),

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:59.240
but California, even Massachusetts, but what
was coolest was the faculty and student response.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.180
They don’t have to come, they have jobs,
they have to study, thousands of providers

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.009
came ready to do, whatever. Some volunteers
just took care of other volunteers. I had

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.069
so many people asking me if I needed anything.
Did I need help, did I need to rest, it was

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.740
amazing, but let me tell you, I had 20 / 
30 year veteran physicians and nurses working

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.400
with baby docs and baby nurses, that almost
made me cry.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.990
Dr. L. Maximilian Buja: The Dean of the Tulane
School of Public Health called for assistance.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.330
Then we received calls for assistance for
the medical, nursing, dental, and graduate

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:40.629
students at Tulane and elsewhere in Louisiana.
To support the medical students, UT joined

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:46.819
with Baylor, UTMB in Galveston and Texas A&amp;M
to form an alliance that would support the

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.979
Tulane Medical School in a plan to cooperatively
continue to provide education, training, and

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:59.520
research opportunities for their medical students
and residents. UT began enrolling medical

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.279
students as visiting students. And initially
we found places for several dozen medical

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:10.869
residents as well as the medical students.
We offered similar assistance to dental students

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:17.059
but they were helped in other ways closer
to home. We did assist 68 students in public

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:23.369
health, nursing, and biomedical science as
provisional students. One student needed shoes

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:28.499
to wear to a meeting. An international couple
who had just arrived in this country had

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:33.979
only the clothes they were wearing. We
addressed those basic needs even as we grappled

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.069
with issues around what to do about tuition
and how to deal with the fact that these students

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:46.069
had no transcripts or other documentation.
Our UT students opened their arms to the displaced

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:51.949
students from Louisiana. All of us emphasized
that these circumstances were temporary and

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:57.550
we wanted to assist them in their goal of
getting back home as soon as possible. Almost

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:03.289
six months later, most of the students had
returned to their home institutions. But because

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:09.520
the Tulane Medical School has not yet re-opened
we are currently serving 125 visiting Tulane

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.550
Medical students and another 40 medical residents.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.569
Dr. James T. Willerson: I was greatly moved
by the entire effort, and I still am. Our

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:21.949
UT faculty, staff, and students rose to the
occasion to do things they had never been

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:28.639
asked to do before. The efforts to welcome
the displaced students, from Louisiana, and Mississippi,

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.930
and Alabama to our campus were unprecedented.
All six of our schools, our medical school,

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:41.930
our nursing school, our dental school, our
School of Public Health, and our graduate school,

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:49.130
and School of Health Information Sciences, as well
as our UT Harris County Psychiatric Center,

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:55.810
reached out to help in numerous ways. Our
UT personnel collected food and clothing for

00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:02.319
those in need. Thousands of volunteers from
all areas of health care, and lay volunteers too, came to help.

00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:09.069
Many of them just showed up from all over
Texas and the Texas Medical Center.

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:14.740
Some came from around the country
to help this University of Texas effort.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.399
Frankly, I’ve never seen anything like it before.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:27.060
I was moved by the kindness and the empathy and compassion, that I witnessed.
These are qualities that one hopes all doctors, nurses,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.050
dentists and other health care professionals
would have, but it was never better demonstrated than in this crisis.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:39.360
You know, we take so many things for granted,
in our daily lives,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:46.360
that an event such as Hurricane Katrina reminds
all of us of the frailty of our lives and

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:54.089
the need to fully live our lives in the service
of others. 

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.839
I’ve never been more proud of our University of Texas at Houston family.
