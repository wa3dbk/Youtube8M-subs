00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.540
Chicago is situated in the Great Lakes region
of the American Midwest,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.080
in the state of Illinois.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.590
Rising from the edges of Lake Michigan,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.340
Chicago began as a tiny trading post at the
mouth of the Chicago River,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.340
and has boomed into a modern global center
of commerce and culture.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.480
The Windy City has always been driven by an
unshakable optimism and can-do attitude.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.160
The Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed
half the city,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.570
was seized upon as an opportunity for the
metropolis to reinvent itself.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.890
What followed was the biggest building boom
in US history

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.500
and a skyline that is almost beyond beautiful.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.890
Start your visit in The Loop -

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.820
the central business district encircled by
the 'L', Chicago's elevated train line.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.850
The streets within The Loop are a showcase
of architecture,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.729
from the world's first high-rises, to the
cloud-piercing towers of today.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.690
Willis Tower held the title of world's tallest
building for almost 25 years.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.970
Take the 60-second ride to the Skydeck.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.690
On a really windy day you might even feel
the building sway a little,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.049
but don't panic, it was designed to do just
that.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.549
The Loop also contains some amazing outdoor
sculpture

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.659
and an historic theater district which makes
the area feel

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.530
like a cross between a museum and a film set.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.510
Running north from The Loop is the Magnificent
Mile,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.210
where you'll be able to gaze up at even more
wonders

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.500
from the Chicago School of architecture.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.330
Looking a little out of place is the Old Water
Tower,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.330
a lone, but much-loved survivor from the Chicago
Fire.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.830
Shop 'til you drop in the upscale boutiques

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.720
which line The Magnificent Mile's wide boulevards.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.060
And when it's time to refuel,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.060
sink your teeth into a deep dish pizza - an
old Chicago favorite.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.040
Following the south bank of the Chicago River

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.560
and winding between the canyons of glass and
steel,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.980
The Riverwalk offers a relaxing change of
pace from the downtown bustle.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.379
Still within The Loop is Millennium Park.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.349
Once the site of railway yards and car parks,

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.019
the area has been transformed into what critics
have hailed as 'the future of parks'.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.620
The centerpieces of this visionary space are
the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.209
Frank Gehry-designed Jay Pritzker Pavilion
and the BP Footbridge.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.680
The park showcases a number of public sculptures,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.419
including a futuristic stainless steel archway
to the city, Cloud Gate,

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.689
or as it's affectionately known to locals
- 'The Bean'.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.809
Just across the road is The Art Institute
of Chicago

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:13.010
whose exterior is a work of art in itself.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.510
Set aside at least a day to explore this treasure-house
of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.919
European, American and Asian masterpieces.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.299
There are plenty of treasures to be found
outside The Loop.

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.909
Just to the west is one of Chicago's hidden
gems,

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.400
the Garfield Park Conservatory, an inner-city
haven for nature lovers

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.549
and a first-date favorite for Chicago couples.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.239
In nearby Oak Park, step inside Frank Lloyd
Wright's home and studio,

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.120
where for 20 years he pioneered an entirely
new architectural vision for America.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.099
Unity Temple is just a short stroll away.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.279
Completed in 1908, this Lloyd Wright masterpiece

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:03.799
is widely regarded as the world's first modern
building.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.229
While you're in Oak Park,

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.930
stop by the birthplace of one of Chicago's
most famous sons, Ernest Hemingway.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.019
In the nearby museum,

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:19.019
fans of the novelist can read from his childhood
diary and original manuscripts.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.609
Down by The Loop's waterfront,

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.990
the historic Navy Pier offers entertainment
for all ages.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.410
The pier is also the place to climb aboard

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.370
one of the many lake and river cruises on
offer.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.370
Just south of Navy Pier, The Field Museum
houses over

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.610
20 million specimens from the world of natural
history.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.190
Say hello to Sue, the largest and most intact
skeleton of a

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.730
Tyrannosaurus Rex ever unearthed.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.140
The museum might look a little familiar,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.940
after all, it was the home base for Indiana
Jones in the blockbuster movie series.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.270
A little further south along the waterfront

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.410
you'll find the Museum of Science and Industry
-

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.970
known by generations of school children as
'the best field trip ever!'.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.090
Here you'll get to explore the inner workings
of man and machine,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.310
and discover the secrets of natural phenomena

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.870
like tornadoes, lightning and avalanches.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.680
Chicago's largest green space is Lincoln Park,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.080
a seven mile stretch of shoreline which runs
north from The Loop.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.460
It's home to nature reserves, a conservatory,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.160
and monuments to many of the nation's heroes,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.150
including the park's namesake - Abraham Lincoln.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.000
The park also features the Lincoln Park Zoo

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.090
which has been entertaining and educating
visitors since 1868.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.930
The zoo features two sections specifically
designed for children,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.910
and best of all it's free.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.910
The park is also home to the Chicago History
Museum.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.450
From gangsters to baseball, this is the place
to visit

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.860
if you really want to know what makes this
unique city tick.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.880
As the sun sets, Chicago truly lights up.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.550
But don't plan on going to bed early,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.650
the city offers some of the best jazz, blues
and theater in America.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.710
So come on over to Chicago, the memories you'll
take away will last a lifetime -

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.400
no matter how hard the wind blows.
