00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:08.040
I'm Lillian with Expert Village and I'm ready
now to remove the old polish. I'm going to

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.030
get some regular nail polish remover again
you could buy this at your convenience store,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:22.710
at a discount store, and a piece of cotton.
I'm going to pour some nail polish and squeeze

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.410
out the excess polish and pour on just all
parts of the cotton and I'm ready to remove

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.650
it. Just simply apply the cotton on your toenail
and if you have good new nail polish remover

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.320
it will come off very easy. Sometimes when
you save nail polish remover for a very long

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.650
time it gets weak and the polish is harder
to remove. It comes off as simple as that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:07.740
there is one foot complete. Turn the cotton
over for a fresh nail polish remover area

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:20.650
and just wipe it off simple and easy. Toenails
unlike finger nails don't usually get what

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.690
they call hang nails you get dry skin on the
side of the nails and also broken finger nails.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.460
You have to repair them with nail glue usually
if you have a broken toenail you just cut

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.390
it shorter to the area. If the break is the
break is really really low then you are going

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.370
to want to get some nail glue and repair it
with that and its simple to do that as well

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.810
I don't have a broken nail so I don't have
one to repair but, you could just get some

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.631
nail glue and it comes just like a base coat
does and you just apply it like base coat.

00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:11.049
You let it dry and it sticks together kind
of like super glue.
