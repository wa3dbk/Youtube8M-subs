00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.019
Introduce yourself and confirm the client's ID.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:29.288
Assess for allergies and other considerations such as 
 vomiting, NPO status, current vitals and labs.

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:40.446
Wash your hands.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.620
You should know: why the client is receiving the medication; the drug's classification...

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:57.502
...usual range of dose; contraindications; side effects; and other nursing 
 considerations for the meds you will be giving...

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
...such as lab values and vital signs.

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:10.072
Check the med administration record for the drug's name, dose, frequency, 
 route, expiration of the order and of the medication.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.220
Place the packaged unit dose directly into the medicine cups.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.440
Do not removed the medication from the package until 
 you are at the bedside.  

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:33.896
Use a separate cup for narcotics and medications that 
 require a specific assessment such as vital signs.

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:39.596
This will remind you to complete the assessment before 
 determining whether or not to give those meds.

00:02:03.403 --> 00:02:05.400
Create privacy.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
Once again, confirm client ID.

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:27.320
Provide information on the medications you will be giving: 
 the name; possible side effects; and contraindications.

00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:56.490
Assess patient's knowledge of medication and perform other assessments indicated by that specific med.

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:46.140
If swallowing is difficult, crush the medication into 
 a fine powder with a pill crusher.

00:03:45.974 --> 00:03:51.970
Then, mix the powder with a small amount of food such as applesauce.

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:55.480
Some meds, such as time release or enteric coated tablets, should not be crushed.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.470
Observe your client swallowing the medication and document, including patient tolerance.
