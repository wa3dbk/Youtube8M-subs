00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:13.026
&gt;&gt; That is part of
what really appeals me

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:15.016
about Dartmouth Medical
School is that, you know,

00:00:15.016 --> 00:00:17.276
there's 90 of us, and each
of us are individuals.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:20.356
We're not members, we're
not another board score,

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:21.126
we are people.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:24.246
And I like that the
administrators know my name.

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:25.986
I like that all my
professors know my name.

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:27.566
And they really care about us.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:30.746
And I think that
I'm able to focus

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.016
on making myself a better person

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.116
and going beyond just the
academics of medical school

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:37.736
because we have that
kind of environment.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:38.486
It's supportive.

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:39.436
I'm an individual.

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.126
They want me to grow, to
be who I'm going to be,

00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:46.616
and not just an automaton
of basic science information

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:48.246
or clinical diagnoses.

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:55.506
So I was able to do
clinical research this summer

00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:56.716
with a partner of neurosurgery.

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:58.896
And I felt like that,
in and of itself,

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.296
was an incredible
learning experience,

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:02.296
because I essentially
became the coordinator

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.436
for this clinical project,

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:05.436
going on with the
Department of Neurosurgery.

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:08.656
And it gave me a lot of
confidence in the skills

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.556
that I'm going to need for
third year, that they're going

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:13.936
to be there, and that at least
the beginnings of what I'm going

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:17.026
to need to grow into in the next
few years that I face challenges

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.726
that I've never even
imagined before.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:24.646
I think Dartmouth Medical
School is an incredible place

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:26.266
for aspiring leaders to come

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:28.806
because it is a small
environment,

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:33.166
it is a nurturing environment,
and I really like the comparison

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:38.166
of Dartmouth being a quick skip
that can change directions.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:42.096
You hear the comparison that
a lot of larger schools are,

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.176
you know, different
institutions,

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:47.006
and we see this all the time,
are these huge cruise ships,

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:48.966
that they can't turn fast enough

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:53.526
to avoid the Titanic
hit them the icebergs.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.576
And I think that the nice
thing about Dartmouth is

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.326
that it's very responsive,
and it's small enough

00:01:59.446 --> 00:02:00.706
that we can make a difference.

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:03.826
And I've already seen
that in my own year

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:04.936
and a half here thus far,

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:07.836
is that one student can really
make a difference in what goes

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.866
on on the campus, what goes
on even at the hospital.

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:18.536
&gt;&gt; For me, leadership
means really taking active

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.126
participation in things
that you can care about,

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:22.336
things that you're
passionate about.

00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.866
I think everybody
can find something

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:25.946
that they really care about.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:27.116
I don't think anybody's floating

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:29.526
around in this world
just kind of not caring.

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.766
And I think really
actively throwing yourself

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:36.936
into something you care about,
you can be a leader in any way.

00:02:37.406 --> 00:02:40.826
For me, my leadership
has manifested as I know

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:42.206
that I have some
particular strengths.

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:45.156
And what I try to do is use
those strengths to the fullest.

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:47.616
And when I recognize that I'm
not very good at something,

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:50.376
I find people that are good
at that, and I pull them in

00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:51.636
and get them to help me.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.416
And I think being able to
recognize that and recognize

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:56.546
that we can't do everything

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:00.356
on our own is an important
part of leadership.
