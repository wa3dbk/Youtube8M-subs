00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.580
My name is Michael Ghoram

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.299
it was at in the evening time about

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.930
4:30 to 5 o'clock it was pretty cold

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.830
it was raining the road was slippery

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.550
I baited some shrimps we was at the house we were cooking some circuitry okra shrimp

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.789
stuff like that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.989
we were missing an item to go in it so I said lets run to the piggly wiggly

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.610
on 38 and cha cha so I got in the truck I was the show fer of the truck the driver

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.710
I had Erica and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.200
her two kids in the truck with me
we went going down cha cha to 38

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.460
and by the time I got to the red light my light

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.670
was on green and my arrow was pointing me to make

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.550
my left turn which the automobile in front of me 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.699
was coming which they could've made a
right turn but it was red on their 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:04.309
side

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.290
so after I made my turn she entered the fault at the same time

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.850
and I collided you know collision with her and hit her

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.630
and she got out the car and said you ain't got to call no police there 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.930
three of them in the car with her

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
so she said you ain't got to call no police so I said pull over to the side

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.259
she pulled over in the parking lot over by piggly wiggly

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.840
and we got to talkin whenever she moved it out the car said that's a bad item

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.790
so I just maintained at my vehicle until the officer got there

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.600
Called Gordon McKernan's office cause I know Gordon would get it did.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.159
And he had been a great lawyer and I had a 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.560
brother-in-law, Carl Cunningham, all them deal with Mr. Gordon too.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.079
and he's a good attorney and they make sure they settle your case right and 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.240
get everything did for you he get it did. They really good people and they talk to you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.729
they respect you and they let you know
off the top what they can do what

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.500
they can't do

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.509
Gordon get it did. When you treat your clients good you respect them

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.950
You let them know what is what and with the loop and in the end 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.260
I really love them very much cause they treat me fair and my family fairly so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.010
anything they can do for you they will do it.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.150
I'd say Gordon it's a good company Gordon get it did

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.420
I got Gordon cause Gordon 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.660
got it done

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.740
 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.990
