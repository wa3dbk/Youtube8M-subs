00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.969
A reboot of the "Turtles" franchise, this
$125-million dollar action sci-fi comedy film

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.120
was unsurprisingly, a huge hit at the box
office, taking home nearly half-a-billion

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470
in ticket sales following its August 8, 2014
release.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.380
Although the credits list Jonathan Liebsman
as the director - producer Michael Bay's fingerprints

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.040
are all over this film; the scope, actors,
set design, cinematography, and music all

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.779
feel identical to his "Transformers" series
- for better or worse.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.780
The fast-paced 101-minute story follows Megan
Fox as an eager, low-level New York TV reporter

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.519
who uncovers the existence of the titular
heroes, as they embark on a mission to save

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.320
the city from an evil kingpin.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.170
As many of the in-movie characters are quick
to point out, Fox makes for great eye-candy,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.620
but she's commendably much stronger as the
lead than her forgettable performances in

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.210
the aforementioned "Transformers" series.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.920
Plus, having a relatable and ambitious protagonist
helps anchor some of the absurdities on screen.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.460
Speaking of which, the eight-foot-tall 'heroes
in a half-shell' are portrayed by some convincing

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.410
motion-capture work, and voiced by Alan Ritchson,
Noel Fisher, Johnny Knoxville, and Jeremy

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.410
Howard.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.220
Although their updated design is a distance
departure than their iconic look, far grittier

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.220
and cluttered than necessary.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.010
Thankfully though, their personalities still
shine through: with Donny even given a pair

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.140
of glasses to really drive home his "intelligent"
demeanor.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.409
It's a lazy writing trick, but it does work.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.980
Tony Shalhoub provides the voice of their
sensei master, who reminds his pupils in a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.759
colorful opening montage that they're "bound
for greatness".

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.909
In supporting roles, Will Arnett is wonderful
as a horny news colleague who provides some

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.869
decent comic relief, William Fichtner is fantastic
as an unscrupulous bad guy, while Whoopi Goldberg

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.259
is the hard-nosed news producer.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.390
Although the story takes some interesting
liberties regarding the source-material's

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.320
origin stories... they actually make for a
more involved and effective dynamic between

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.409
our characters.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.110
The turtles are no longer the result of a
random accident, but Fox's old pets, whom

00:01:46.110 --> 00:02:31.590
she deliberately saved following an act of
corporate sabotage.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.349
Despite initial rumors that the turtles would
actually be aliens - Liebsman smartly keeps

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.790
their bizarre story firmly planted in its
mutagen home.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.340
Regardless of their updated appearance and
backstory: they feel like the Ninja Turtles

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.620
we all know and love.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.810
When they speed off in their supped up Turtle-van,
Michelangelo can't resist blasting "So Happy

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.340
Together"... the upbeat pop song from the
60s by... who else, "The Turtles".

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.409
A later scene perfectly illustrates the charm
and playfulness of the group when Mikey busts

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.690
out an impromptu beat-boxing session in an
elevator, moments before returning to battle.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.510
Although the sequences rarely following any
real-world logic or physics, the action here

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.220
is well-executed and particularly fun.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.629
Especially an extended slide down an icy mountainside
- that sees all the turtles working in unison

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.170
to save an 18-wheeler before it careens off
a cliff.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.049
While the visual effects effortlessly blend
the mo-cap stuff with the real environments,

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.330
it's the dynamic and free-floating camera
moves that provide some of the coolest imagery.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.220
Woven throughout is a great score from Brian
Tyler that lends an epic-scale to an otherwise

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.380
one-dimensional narrative.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.239
Being obsessed with these characters and concepts
as a kid, I honestly did not expect to enjoy

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.489
this newest incarnation.

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.879
But the PG-13 rated picture does a fine job
of capturing the spirit and humor of the "Turtles",

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.780
in a modern and exciting action adventure.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.030
It has plenty of flaws, especially with its
clunky script... but a follow-up picture in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.860
2016 no longer seems like an awful idea.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.050
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is fast and
exciting fun, even if these aren't the turtles

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.409
we grew up with.

00:03:49.409 --> 00:04:00.980
Here's what you had to say about it.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.670
Mixed, but mostly negative opinions here:
with many criticizing the character development,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.620
and story - you scored it a FOUR.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.670
"Impressed" is definitely too strong a word,
but I enjoyed this one more than I thought

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.610
I would - it doesn't always feel like a proper
"Turtles" experience, but when it does - it

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.610
works well.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.070
I thought it was GOOD.
