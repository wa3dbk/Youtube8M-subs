Hey guys, welcome to Inspire To Cook!

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:05.800
Today I am going to show you a super cool summer recipe of s'mores

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.142
Marshmallow Smores

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:09.857
This is a very simple yet very cool recipe

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:10.749
You can do at home

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.954
I am going to make 4 portions and these are the ingredients we are going to need

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:17.561
4 halves of Graham Crackers. I am actually using the longer onces

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.309
Breaking them in half

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.650
And 4 marshmallows, medium size marshmallows

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.573
As well as some chocolate, I love to use dark chocolate if you know me

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.030
This is about 80 grams for 4 portions

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.915
As well as a little bit of butter

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:32.610
And of course, we are going to need aluminum foil tray to put it into

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.416
We are going to take our chocolate bars

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.670
And crash them into small pieces

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.542
The smaller they are, the quicker they'll melt

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:45.322
And I am going to add our little bit of butter

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:46.020
Just a notch

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.522
And we are going to take it into microwave for 30 seconds

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:53.227
After 30 seconds have passed we are going to take it into microwave and mix it up

00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:56.692
And if it needs more, we are going to take it for another 30 seconds

00:00:56.692 --> 00:00:58.132
This is the consistency that we want

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:03.303
Dark chocolate seems to be a little bit less liquid so you can put a little more butter to get it to this consistency

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:06.501
And in mean time we are going to go ahead and take our tray

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.325
And put our Graham Cracker Cookies right in here

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:13.993
I am going to separate them out, if you make more, you can actually put them together

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:17.865
And at this point I am going to put a little bit of dark chocolate right in the middle

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:20.305
So the marshmallows will stick when we put them in

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:22.915
And we are going to put the marshmallows right on top of them

00:01:23.572 --> 00:01:24.212
long ways

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:25.257
just like that

00:01:25.257 --> 00:01:29.679
Since dark chocolate seems to be less liquid than the milk chocolate or any other chocolate

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.986
I am going to go ahead and transfer it into a zip lock bag

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:33.643
I am going to turn my corners like that

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.406
So we are not making them dirty

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:37.964
And we are going to transfer the dark chocolate in them

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:44.608
And we'll make a small whole in our zip lock bag

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:45.526
just like that

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:48.914
And cover the marshmallows with some chocolate

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.430
You can put any pattern that you want on them

00:01:56.646 --> 00:02:00.086
I am going to cover this one completely in chocolate

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:02.634
This marshmallow S'more I am going to even out with the spoon a little bit

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.337
And they are ready to go into the dridge

00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:09.540
30 minutes in the fridge have past and our darck chocolate s'mores are all ready

00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:11.134
Look at that, umm

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:11.773
Beutiful

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:14.416
I am going to lay them out on the plate

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.569
Well these Dark Chocolate S'mores look pretty delicious

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.946
So it's time to try them

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:24.799
umm

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.561
I have to say that dark chocolate is the best chocolate for this recipe

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:29.954
it's a little bit harder to work with

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.226
But the taste is just great

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:32.939
umm

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.231
And as you see, they stay in place pretty well

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:37.584
So you don't have to worry about them dropping or anything like that

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:41.938
