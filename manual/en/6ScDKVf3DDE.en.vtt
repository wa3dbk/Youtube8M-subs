00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.810
So when collecting your historical blue and
deciding what you want to collect whether

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.910
it's going to be on teapots whether it's going
to be teapots and sugar bowls and creamers

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.530
or if your going to have a wide range of tableware.
Where you have plates, platters, tirings or

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.320
a number of different other pieces that you
can collect will dictate whether your going

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.950
to display it. You can display a number of
ways I have right here some of these plate

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.670
racks which are really easy and very inexpensive
to buy. I like this particular plate rack

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.040
because it has an adjustable back and it's
very inexpensive this folds forward and backwards

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.260
so that you can put a large platter or a small
plate. It gives you a good range of showing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640
your plate because some of the plate racks
you don't have enough room so your plates

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.739
will lean forward, with this you can adjust
it to make your plate rack lean as far back

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.440
as you wanted to display your piece. You may
want to display it back more than you wanted

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.939
with this, this gives you a good showing of
what is actually is inside of these plates

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.530
because there so much detailed you want to
see it when you display it. The racks are

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.399
really great to display another way to display
is on the wall using 3 prong wires that come

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.749
across the back of your plate to hang these
on the wall. That's one way to display your

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.789
plates, some people like to do a whole wall
that displays just plates they might want

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.279
to mix it in with paintings or pictures and
plates. Sometimes you want to display them

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:32.469
in your kitchen sometimes you want to display
them in your dining room or you might want

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.530
to move them all throughout your house. So
hanging on the walls are a great way to do

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.529
it but you have to be really careful because
you can cause a lot of damage to these plates

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:48.139
to. They have wire coated ones now that aren't
so damaging as to just the plain wires so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:55.249
when your picking out wall hangers be careful
how you pick them up cause you don't want

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.959
to damage your plates. So you can display
them that way, you can display on shelves,

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:07.799
wooden shelves, on your walls, you can just
display on step back cupboards, open cupboards,

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.610
close cupboards just a number different ways
you can display your wares. So depending on

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.280
the size of your collection and the way you
want to display it those are some different

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.400
ways that you can display your historical
blue.
