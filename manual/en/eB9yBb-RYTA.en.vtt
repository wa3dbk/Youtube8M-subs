00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.729
- When riding a mountain bike,

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:03.583
it's really important
to get the right gear,

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:05.683
both for safety and for comfort.

00:00:05.683 --> 00:00:09.316
So, here's GMBN's guide for
what to wear in the bike park.

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:12.483
( electro rock music)

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.231
The most important piece
of equipment, obviously,

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.484
is a helmet, especially
before I drop in down there.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:24.644
I'd recommend if you're
goin' to a bike park

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.248
somewhere where you're usin' ski lifts

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:28.197
and there's lots of downhill runs,

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:30.758
a full-face helmet is a
really, really good idea.

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:32.356
If you're ridin' lots of descents,

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:34.120
you're not gonna need the
open-face quite so much

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.967
'cause maybe you're not peddlin'.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.360
Maybe if you're ridin'
a bit more all mountain

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.164
and goin' outside the bike park,

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:42.946
an open-face might be okay for that,

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.793
but the number one choice for riding

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:47.543
bike parks is a full-face helmet.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.050
It's really important
to find some protection

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.795
that you're comfortable
wearin' in the bike parks.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.059
Personally, I wouldn't go
anywhere near a bike park

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.112
without some pretty
substantial knee pads on.

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:02.183
Other options are obviously
ankle pads, elbow pads,

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:05.698
or even full jerseys that
have body armour on them.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.030
Totally down to personal
preference but I would say

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.466
the bare minimum, knee pads
are what you wanna wear.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.702
A hydration pack is really good to keep,

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.328
obviously, your drinks in there, tools,

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:18.445
lift pass, don't forget that one,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.387
bit of spare cash and a tube just

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:23.088
for if you're going' a little bit further

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:26.452
on the bike park, you're
gonna need some spare parts.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.597
If I'm maybe sessionin' downhill track

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:31.997
on one side of the trail
that finishes in a village,

00:01:31.997 --> 00:01:34.916
I maybe might think about
not takin' this with me,

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:36.165
but you just gotta be aware that

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:37.766
if you do get into any issues,

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.261
maybe you puncture or
you have a mechanical,

00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:42.061
you're gonna have to find
your way off the mountain.

00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:43.847
So, if I'm goin' any distance,

00:01:43.847 --> 00:01:46.920
I'll always take a backpack with spares.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.304
I tend to wear shorts more often than not.

00:01:49.304 --> 00:01:51.065
They're mountain bike-specific shorts.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:53.414
I've got a pocket to put my lift pass in.

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:55.786
They also come with a
padded lining short as well,

00:01:55.786 --> 00:01:57.862
so it's nice and comfortable all day.

00:01:57.862 --> 00:01:59.533
If I may be ridin' downhill runs

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.998
over and over, or it's cold,

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:03.459
I'll think about wearin'
some downhill trousers.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.334
Nice and warm but they also
offer some good protection.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.710
Eye protection is a really good idea,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.631
especially in dusty or muddy conditions.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.069
Goggles work really well
with full-face helmets.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.242
They're designed for
them to sit on the back,

00:02:17.242 --> 00:02:19.883
so they're generally the
best option for those.

00:02:19.883 --> 00:02:23.591
The cross country-style helmet
glasses are a good idea.

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:26.063
Gloves, I realise that
some of the world's top

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:28.245
pro downhillers don't wear gloves

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:29.863
'cause they say they like to feel the bar,

00:02:29.863 --> 00:02:31.559
but I would never recommend that.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.815
I always ride in full-finger gloves.

00:02:33.815 --> 00:02:35.380
Really important for protecting your hand

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.053
if you crash 'cause if you cut your hand,

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.219
that's not gonna be much fun to ride with.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.813
Also, you might wanna
think about a thicker palm

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:45.087
of your glove to save
your hands a little bit

00:02:45.087 --> 00:02:47.936
when you're riding really rough trails.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:50.503
If you ride in a bike park on flat pedals,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.286
a pair of shoes, their really sticky sole

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:54.180
is gonna help on the rough stuff,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.769
especially on the brakin' bumps.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.182
You might find that if you
wear a normal pair of trainers,

00:02:58.182 --> 00:02:59.685
you can shuffle a bit around

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.543
on your pedals, which isn't the best.

00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:04.221
If you're using clips, a
nice set of downhill-style

00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:06.854
shoes are comfortable, and
they're gonna offer you

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:10.733
more protection than a pair
of cross country shoes.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:12.730
The weather can change really
quick here in the mountains,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.923
so it's important to have a rain jacket

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:18.136
if you think you might be
caught out in the bad weather.

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:20.589
It's also a good idea on
ski lifts where they can be

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.935
really exposed and get really cold.

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.142
It's currently 32 degrees in Verbier,

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:27.991
so I'm not sure I need this on.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.382
'Kay, so there's what
to wear at a bike park.

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:33.313
