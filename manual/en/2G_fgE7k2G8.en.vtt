BMW DME Injector Cutoff Circuit Strategy

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.760
BMW has used the injector cutoff strategy
in various forms for many years now.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.740
The importance of this is that a technician
may approach an engine with non pulsing injectors

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.400
and make it seems as if the DME itself is
defective, then the issue is not the DME,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.440
but an ulterior motive that it sees, causing
injector cutoff.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.480
Injector cutoff comes in two flavors, selective
and complete.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.079
Injector cutoff is a DME programming strategy.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.010
It is programmed into the DME unit and may
also render the injector completely inoperative.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.440
Here are the conditions where the DME may
use injector cutoff.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.159
Condition number 1.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.839
Engine or vehicle speed limiter.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.350
For engine or vehicle speed limitation, the
DME will deactivate injection for individual

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.229
cylinders, allowing a smoother limitation
transition.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.490
This prevents overreving, when the engine
reaches maximum RPM, under acceleration, and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.110
limits top vehicle speed to approximately
128 mph.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.060
Condition number 2.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.200
Idle speed actuation.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.409
If a fault is detected with the idle speed
actuator, the DME will initiate fail-safe

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.460
measures and selectively cut pulsation to
the injectors, depending on the effect of

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.190
the fault, as in increased air flow or decreased
air flow.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.100
If there is a fault in the idle speed actuator
circuit, the MDK will compensate to maintain

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.650
idle speed.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.469
The check enigine lamp will be illuminated
to inform the driver of a fault.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.299
If the fault causes increased air flow, as
in actuator failed to open, VANOS, and Knock

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.549
Control are deactivated which noticeably reduces
engine performance.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.560
Condition number 3.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.880
Fault to the throttle controller.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.660
In the event of an MDK or throttle drive by
wire unit malfunction, the following actions

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.920
occur.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.360
Activation of the check engine warning lamp.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.700
MDK is deactivated, the throttle valve is
opened mechanically by the springs.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.030
To maintain vehicle control, the MDK opening
is compensated for by closing the idle speed

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.970
actuator and retarding the ignition for engine
power reduction.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.240
Engine power is further limited by the DME
using fuel injector cut off.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.560
Condition number 4.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.720
Clear flood mode.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.170
Clear-flood mode is activated strictly by
a wide-open throttle or high TPS input.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.170
For this mode to be active, the DME must read
a low engine speed value of under 600 RPM

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.060
and a throttle opening of 85% or higher, usually
wide open throttle.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.710
At this point, the DME reduces injector pulse
to an A/F ratio of 20.0:1 or higher.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.970
In most cases, the DME cuts injector pulsation
completely.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.040
All this is done in order to purge the cylinders
of excess fuel and correct a flooding condition.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.510
This mode is not used on all fuel control
system, which is why some systems will flood

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.400
under heavy cranking.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.180
A condition relating to this mode is an engine
that will not start due to a high TPS voltage

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.730
and no injector pulse.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.730
In such case, the DME will perceive the high
TPS voltage as a W.O.T. condition and activate

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.810
the clear flood mode, thereby, reducing or
cutting injector pulse altogether.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.320
The same can also happen if the TPS ground
wire develops an open circuit, which would

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.910
cause a high TPS voltage input signal as well.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.080
Condition number 5.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.290
Selective injector cut off.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.090
Selective injector cut-off mode is activated
whenever there is a dangerous condition affecting

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.630
the engine.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.260
This is a fairly new feature in fuel control
systems, designed not only to protect the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.680
engine, but the catalytic converter as well.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.900
New regulations require manufacturers to guarantee
the converter for up to 8 years or 80 thousand

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.310
miles.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.440
This makes selective injector cut-off a prime
feature for catalytic converter protection

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.530
in case of a misfire.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.650
The selective injector cutoff mode is also
used in torque management situations where

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.890
torque reduction is needed.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.720
An example is the point when the transmission
is shifting gears or the traction control

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.940
system is activated.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.810
In these two examples, torque reduction is
needed in order to protect the power train

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.270
components from sudden high torque conditions.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.260
Another need for this operational mode is
during high engine temperature conditions,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.070
whereby, the fuel injection pulse is cut-off
intermittently to four cylinders at a time

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.620
to prevent the engine from overheating damage.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.570
By reducing the cylinder combustion intermittently,
the engine generates less heat, saving it

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.310
from damage.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.820
Condition number 6.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.410
Deceleration fuel cut off.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.010
When your vehicle is moving forward, with
zero throttle and is in gear or engine braking,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.060
the DME cuts off the fuel flow to the injectors.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.560
This means you are experiencing forward movement
with no fuel cost.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.920
How long does it take the engine to enter
and leave the deceleration cut off mode?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:00.370
The transition takes between 500 and 750 milliseconds,
depending on several other DME measurements.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.770
What will make the DME leave deceleration
mode?

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.490
Touching the accelerator, Dropping below 1,000
RPM and Putting the transmission in neutral

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:24.270
and disengaging the clutch will render deceleration
cut off useless.
