00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.069
Today we will be extending this apartment
right here.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.450
We're quite clogged for space so I've decided
to extend into the spot next door.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.970
Which will give me enough space for what I
want and I thought I'd show you how to do

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.970
it.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.460
Ok there's two cheats we'll need to be able
to build out here.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.809
Get the cheat box up by pressing ctrl + shift
+ C, I use the left side of my keyboard.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:47.969
The first cheat is testingcheatsenabled 
true and the second cheat, get the cheat box

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:09.120
up again is restrictBuildBuyinBuildings off.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.320
Ok both these cheats will be in the description
as far as I can tell getting the capitals

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.310
in the right spots is a must but then you'll
be able to build in this grid.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.600
The first thing I recommend is finding....
there will be a little ball in there somewhere.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:38.250
You can put lights in the room to see it better,
which I'll do right now.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.870
Hanging lights so you can see it better, just
so you can see it better.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.430
Ok that doesn't work that's because those
lights are pretty crappy.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.720
You need to pick this up, this ball.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.620
Here you can see it better now, that's a hidden
room marker.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.780
You pick that up and destroy it.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.140
Then we have all this free space, then you
get rid of the door.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.349
Obviously there's more then more door to get
rid of here though.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:32.909
You get rid of the apartments doors and then
do what you want with the rest of it.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:42.040
Either put a door in or demolish the wall
and for now I'm going to demolish the wall

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.730
and then remodel the whole thing.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
And that's how you extend apartments.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.680
Thank you!
