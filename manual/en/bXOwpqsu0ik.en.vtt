00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.969
Arthur is a four-year-old Breton

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.760
who was sent to us from France because he was frightened of heavy traffic and tried

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.529
to run away

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.550
even when

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.880
driven with an experienced horse beside him. Other films showing the work we have done

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.980
with him can be seen on our YouTube
channel

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.720
and here we have taken him down town and
put Sam on the reins

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.060
to show that she can control him in a rubber bit

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.470
in heavy fast-moving traffic. Obviously
we cannot drive on the wrong side of the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.100
road here

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.629
but we can do our best to recreate the
environment he will be driving in at home, i.e

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.170
 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.199
on the right hand side of the road with
traffic approaching and passing on his

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:43.690
left.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.970
We have also tucked the carriage
behind this road sign

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.239
which means lorries will not spot
us and slow down as they approach.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.269
This allows us to show that Arthur is
happy with large lorries and other

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:54.720
traffic

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.430
passing him at speed which can often be
frightening to a horse

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460
due to the increased noise, movement and run of air

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.680
that accompanies them. We have asked Sam to hold the reins up loose

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.960
and put her feet up on the rein rail;
this is to show that she does not have

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.860
any brakes on

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.060
and is not hanging onto Arthur to get him
to stand still. We have put Arthur as a pair

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.850
to allow Roly to share some of the
load getting into town

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.320
which enables Arthur to be fresh and
full of energy when he sees

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.350
the traffic. Exposing him to vehicles under
this circumstance

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.290
is a good test because it proves that he
will still listen to us even when he

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.200
is full of beans.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.470
Bear in mind as well as a horse of his
body weight

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.920
would simply knock Roly off his feet
should he choose to jump sideways

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.540
if he wanted to shy at a lorry. Therefore he is free to spook or plunge forward should

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.210
he wish to

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.620
but we know that he won't because he is
not afraid of the traffic.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.500
In olden days horses were often expected
to stand still

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
with no groom at their head and no driver on the reins either. The roads in cities were

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.100
often busier than this road here;

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.270
if not just with motorized vehicles
which were noisier than today's electric cars

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.350
for example

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.530
then with other turnouts passing them at speed as well

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.819
which as no doubt some people will
appreciate can be more exciting and

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.050
unsettling for a horse than lorries. It is
only the standards of horsemanship

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.069
that have changed

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.629
so here we are showing that Arthur will
stand still with no groom at his head

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.959
and while Sam has her hands of the reins too. You can sometimes see at events,

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.510
drivers holding the reins between their knees while they adjust their coats for example -

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.599
a four-in-hand driver often crouches down
to pat his wheelers quarters from the carriage

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.530
after a round

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.049
and logging horses often pull noisy loads
with no driver on the reins

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.739
but their handler walking beside them, so we are showing here that we are confident in

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.150
the work we have done with Arthur

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.519
and his confidence in us as well that he
will stand still happily in such an

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.279
environment.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.010
Although all horses that come to us for
training

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.170
are taught to cope happily with traffic passing on their inside, with horses that come

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.980
from abroad

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.029
or will be sent to a foreign country when
they finish their training

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.290
it is especially important to prepare
them for being driven

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.730
on the other side of the road. Just as a
riding horse can be upset by someone

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.109
mounting from the wrong side

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.480
so a driving horse can be upset by seeing
traffic where they're not accustomed to.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.109
In Arthur's case it is no good simply
getting him used to

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.549
traffic passing on his right hand side
as it does in the UK,

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.480
but we also have to teach him not to be
frightened of traffic passing on his left

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.040
side

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.180
hence why we have spent some time on
this side of the road

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.120
facing in this direction. Even if Arthur was remaining in the UK

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.349
to be driven he might still be asked to overtake a parked lorry, which would then be

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.340
on his near side.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.549
You can see how he copes with this as a
single horse

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.959
on his other film. We have also put Sam
on the reins

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.849
to give Arthur's owner confidence that he
can be driven and controlled by another

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:50.650
driver,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
and by someone who has less experience
than Barry. Although Arthur's driver is a

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.279
gentleman,

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.319
it shows that Arthur does not require a
strong pair of forearms to control him in

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.950
traffic.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.809
We have also put Sam on the carriage by
herself which shows she is not relying on

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.599
a groom to help haul on the reins

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.779
or jump down and get to his head.
Although it is always a good idea to

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.959
have an extra pair of hands with you on
a carriage,

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.340
sometimes the groom may not be of any
use, so again

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.930
to show that we have confidence that Arthur will behave himself with Sam

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.690
we have asked her to take him out by
herself. He is being driven in a soft rubber

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.199
bit;

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.950
a simple snaffle, which shows that we are
not using the leverage

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.330
of a curb bit in order to control him. With
these bits a small amount

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.520
pressure applied on the reins is
magnified in the horse's mouth

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.660
and so gets the desired response even
with the driver using

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.890
only a little bit of pressure. With our snaffles,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.380
there's no curb chain and no extra setting
for the reins

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.210
in order to increase their severity.
Therefore this shows that we have

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.970
confidence in the training we have done
with Arthur, 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.570
that Sam can control him and drive him
safely, confidently

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.980
and happily in heavy traffic by herself.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.740
Arthur will now go back home to be driven
by his owner in France.
