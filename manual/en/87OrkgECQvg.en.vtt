00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:03.000
Don't vote.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600
No, seriously.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.000
Do not vote!

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.900
What's the point??

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.200
It's not like elections are important or anything.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.500
Who cares about education?

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.209
The economy or teachers or even students?

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.570
California has been a financial crisis
for years.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.189
Why vote? Students don't vote anyway.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.000
Why start now? Students don't care.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.500
Who cares about tuition hikes? College is still pretty cheap. Right?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.670
Whatever! Don't vote!

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't vote.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don't vote.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
It's not worth it.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.810
It doesn't even matter.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.000
We can't really make a difference so...don't vote.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So don't vote.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790
So don't vote!!!

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.600
Yeah, it's pointless, right?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.560
Unless you really care and wanna make a difference.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.750
If you care about your education

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.990
and your future. Or if you're just tired of

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.610
seeing the same things year after year. If you believe
that

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.920
everyone deserves the right to seek an
affordable education

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.890
and that school should be a top priority. If
you care about teachers, police,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.910
firefighters, students, parents,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.930
everyone, you should really vote. Maybe
it's time to step up

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.000
and use your right to vote. People have
died just for the right to vote.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.030
Do you understand that? You should definitely vote.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.220
What am I saying here? Of course you should vote.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.880
Especially if you want to have control
over your future. You know you have to be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.100
registered to vote, right?

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.130
I mean, you know that, right? And you know if you have moved recently

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.300
you have to re-register. Everyone knows that
right? The deadline to register is October 22nd.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.510
That's right around the corner. After
October 22nd, that's all,

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.200
that's it. Game over man. And you can't vote.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.409
You can't vote. Okay look, lets make this easy.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.990
Just follow the link and you can
register online. I mean

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.619
we can't make it any easier. You have to
register to vote.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.000
You have to register to vote. It's cool go ahead, I'll wait while you copy that down.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.000
I'll wait too. Take your time.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.989
If we don't vote, nothing will change. If
everyone thinks that voting doesn't

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.050
matter. And that they're just one person, then nothing will change.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.000
And no one will take it seriously.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.489
People say that college students don't vote

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.340
but your vote matters. We all have to
vote.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.610
Election day is November 6th and I know
I'll be voting.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.349
If we don't vote...then nothing will change. You have to vote.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.390
It's all we've got. It's the only way we can
control what happens in our country

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.540
and our state. Election day is November 6th. The polls are open

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.500
all day. So get out there and vote.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
I'm going to vote. What about you?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Me too!

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Me too!

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.500
Me too!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
I mean, we made this whole video and all, so you're gonna vote, right?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.000
Vote!!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Election day is November 6th. Please vote.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.360
Just go vote. It's that simple. You're so gonna vote.
