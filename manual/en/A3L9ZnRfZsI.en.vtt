00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.220
Once upon a time, the darkness was feared.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.800
As darkness is black, black became evil and was feared in turn…

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.060
Aah, sins are more of a weight than emotions.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, spit out those pitch-black things…

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.960
In your past, which is reflected in the mirror,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.560
Lies nothing but pranks, double-dealing, and slander.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
“Forgive me!” Even if you beg, it’s useless…

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:21.780
Once upon a time, light was a blessing.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:31.280
As the light is white, white became virtue and was worshipped in turn…

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.700
Aah, clouds drift in my heart.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.420
Aah, I leave those pure white clouds to the wind.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:51.340
I tell you, this world is a mass of sins.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.120
It is difficult to be pure white,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.940
So, it is okay to be afraid…

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:31.000
It is repeated, and it goes ‘round and ‘round colourfully…

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
So, I clearly divide them:

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.220
Black paths. White paths. Paths.
