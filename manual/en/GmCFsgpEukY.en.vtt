00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:01.254
[Click the button for Part One]

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:05.546
Then who did this to us? and for what, ehh?

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:09.170
How on earth would I know? I'm in the dark as you

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:20.357
No pal, you're sitting on a leather chair, and I'm sitting on a wooden chair
Yes, how come, buddy? yeah, you got connections, that's it

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.496
Are you trying to make me lose my sanity? How can I jab my temples, people when I'm tied up like this?

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:28.989
I'm telling you we're gonna die, Fahmy!

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:36.748
Tell you what? Come and take this damn chair, Fahmy. I don't want this chair
I don't like it, come and take this chair

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:51.730
Hello, Fawzy. Hello, Fahmy. I want to play a game

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.104
Still he calls me Fawzy, it's no use

00:01:55.604 --> 00:01:57.603
When are they gonna upload the subtitle?

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.359
You two, live together like water and oil

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:08.481
The time when one of you would die for the other to live has come

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:16.904
The device you're connected to is an electrical saw that moves along a horizontal axis

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:23.720
For one to survive, he must push the saw with his legs towards the other sitting before him

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:29.846
This will shut the electrial circuit, but one of you would have been cut into pieces by then

00:02:30.904 --> 00:02:36.218

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.122
No, no, no, don't push it this way

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.431
You don't push

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:17.368
You can't do this, I didn't get the chane to get married, you're gonna ruin my future

00:03:17.622 --> 00:03:20.056
Ok, since you didn't get married, what are worried about?!

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:21.683
Shame on you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.244
How about you take this lovely saw? Look how it spins around, it's very nice

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:30.744
I don't like saws, you take it

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:35.182
God forbids, it's all yours, we're pleased to serve you

00:03:36.277 --> 00:03:38.154
Wait, wait a minute, I've got an idea

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:38.838
Yes?

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.210
Pull it your way

00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:46.024
Yeah, right Pal! Why don't you pull it your way, smart a**?

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.334
Why don't you trust me? there's no time, we're gonna die

00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:52.835
How can I trust you? You'd love to see me dead

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.961
Nobody's gonna die, believe me, brother! I beg you to trust me

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.931
There's no time, there's no time, hurry! Trust me just for once, brother

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:12.243
Fine, this the first and the last time though

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:18.656
Pull hard, Fahmy, and I'm gonna count to three then pull my leg out, be careful

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.595
One Two Three

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.029
Be careful, Fahmyyy!!!

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.755
Now I must unplug this wire, I'm gonna put my foot down, ok?

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:44.817
Don't betray me, Fahmy, just don't betray me

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:46.941
Don't you worry

00:05:10.505 --> 00:05:13.814
Hurry, do as I did, unplug the wire from your end and hold it still

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:24.111
Woooow!

00:05:24.444 --> 00:05:26.628
Now extend the wire with your foot towards me

00:05:41.444 --> 00:05:45.691
But I'm still annoyed about that leather chair, why yours and not mine?

00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:48.504
Knock it off already, you're driving me crazy

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:50.815
Then why don't you stop screaming in my face?

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:56.377
I'll scream as I please, and beat you up as well! You're impudent and crude

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:59.315
You're quite the rude one

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:02.565
I'm the rude one? Then come and get it!

00:06:02.815 --> 00:06:04.815
I'm going to beat you to a pulp!

00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:05.619
You're the impudent one

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.031
You're rude and filthy
All this after I saved you? I'll rip out your throat

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:15.656
You're a stinking filthy son of a boot
You're impudent

00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:17.846
You're a boot and a son of a boot

00:06:51.596 --> 00:06:54.717
We want to play a game

00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:07.900
No, no, no, anything but that
My hemorrhoids!!!
