LIZZIE BASSETT: The Bugatti
Veyron is not only gorgeous,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.340
it can also go from 0
to 60 in 2.5 seconds.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.130
And it tops out at
267 miles per hour,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.050
which makes it the world's
fastest police car.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.790
The car costs $1.6
million, and it's

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.320

the cars actually

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.490

down the bad guys.

They have an entirely

-Usually, people, when
they see a policemen,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.080
