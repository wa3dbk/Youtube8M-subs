HANNAH HART: Hello.

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.140
My name is Hannah Hart, and
I am talking to you.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.370
I do two things on
the internet.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.900
One, embarrass myself.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
And two, entertain you?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.550
Question mark?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.975
If you're not familiar with
My Drunk Kitchen--

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:17.690
insert clip--

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.060
-Killer!

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.860
-Whiskey fight!

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.230
HANNAH HART: --or any of my
comedy music video stylings--

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.870
insert clip--

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.420
-(SINGING) Show me where
your noms at.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.045
Show me where your noms at,
where your noms at.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:33.340
HANNAH HART: --then welcome
to the party.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.930
I am participating in this
DanceOn competition because I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.920
super duper love to move my
body and get in people's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.310
personal space.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
And I think that if I stick with
this show long enough,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.850
I'll be able to be all
up in somebody

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.266
else's grill in no time.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:55.510
Though I have little to no
experience as a professional--

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.640
or even good, or even why
is this happening

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.850
in front of my face--

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.590
dancer, I feel pretty confident,
mainly because I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.740
have a strong passion
for dance.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.720
I'm really hoping that
enthusiasm alone is going to

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
get me somewhere in
this competition--

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.910
A for effort kind of mentality,
you know?

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.662
I'd like to wrap myself in a
fine, sweaty sheen of hope.

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:28.920
[HUMMING]

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.580
I really like hip hop,
R&amp;B, soul, and funk.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.330
[HUMMING]

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.310
I really like any music that
moves me or makes me move.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.750
If I could dance battle anyone
else on YouTube, it would be

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.180
the Annoying Orange, mainly
because I think I could win.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.930
I'm doing old man knees,
but you can't tell.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.210
If you don't think I have what
it takes to win the Dance

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.095
Showdown, then you're
probably right.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.540
To my fellow competitors, I
would just like to say do your

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.960
best, and please have fun.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.400
Because if you're not having
fun, then there's no point in

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.570
doing this, stupid.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.220
Long story short, if you're a
devout Hartosexual here to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.340
support me and watch
this hot damn mess

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.220
occur, then thank you.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.725
And let's take this
journey together.
