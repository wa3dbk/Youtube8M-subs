00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.650
DO YOU EVER HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN
A GLASS OF SODA OR A GLASS OF WATER

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.380
AND YOU PICK THE SODA BECAUSE
"WELL, IF YOU HAVE A GLASS OF SODA TODAY,

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.970
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP
OVERWEIGHT AND UNHEALTHY TOMORROW?"

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.030
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW WE ALL LIKE TO THINK.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.180
THAT SOMEHOW,
SUCCESS ONLY COMES FROM DOING HUGE, IMPORTANT

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.369
THINGS RIGHT.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.280
YOU'RE GOING TO ONLY BUY KALE
FOR YOUR HOUSE AT SOME POINT

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
AND BECOME ULTRA HEALTHY,
BUT UNTIL THEN,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.520
IT'S NOT LIKE DRINKING THIS ONE SODA
WILL ALL OF A SUDDEN MAKE YOU

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.980
THIS UNHEALTHY PERSON IN ONE DAY.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.120
SO YOU HAVE THIS BIG PARADOX.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.590
ON ONE HAND, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.330
THE LITTLE DECISION DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.210
THIS ONE DECISION WON'T REALLY AFFECT
YOUR HEALTH IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.180
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT'S REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.760
BECAUSE IN A YEAR,
YOU'LL BE THE RESULT OF YOUR EVERY LITTLE

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.060
DECISION COMPOUNDED.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.770
SO IN ESSENCE, EVERY LITTLE DECISION MATTERS.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.650
AND THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE EASY TO DO.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.950
WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK TOMORROW,
YOU CAN MAKE THE CHOICE TO DRINK WATER INSTEAD

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.950
OF SODA.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.910
ANYONE IS CAPABLE OF DOING THAT.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.970
BUT SINCE IT'S EASY TO DO,
IT'S ALSO EASY NOT TO DO

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.360
AND JUST ORDER THE SODA.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.290
BUT WHAT IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS LITTLE THING
RIGHT?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.250
YOU WON'T BE ANY HEALTHIER THE NEXT DAY,
BUT AFTER A YEAR OF DRINKING WATER INSTEAD

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.100
OF SODA EVERY LUNCH,
YOU WOULD SEE HUGE HEALTH BENEFITS FROM IT.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.670
AND YOU CAN APPLY THIS TO ANYTHING.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.270
WHAT IF YOU JUST READ 10 PAGES OF A GOOD BOOK
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED?

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.360
ANYONE COULD DO THAT.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.960
THAT'S A PRETTY EASY THING TO DO.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.630
BUT SINCE IT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO,
IT'S ALSO PRETTY EASY TO JUST IGNORE IT AND

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.910
NOT DO IT.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.220
IF YOU READ 10 PAGES TONIGHT,
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WILL WAKE UP

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.880
THIS SMART, ENLIGHTENED PERSON TOMORROW.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.460
BUT WHAT ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520
THAT'S LIKE 15 BOOKS.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.890
15 GOOD BOOKS COULD LITERALLY TURN YOU
INTO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.459
WHAT IF YOU DO THIS FOR 4 YEARS AT COLLEGE
WHILE EVERYONE ELSE AROUND YOU DOESN'T READ

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.531
THE 10 PAGES
BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:15.440
ANY BETTER THE NEXT DAY?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.410
THAT'S LIKE 60 BOOKS.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.520
60 GOOD BOOKS COULD PUT YOU AHEAD OF
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.260
WHETHER THAT BE RELATED TO FINANCES, RELATIONSHIPS,
OR JUST OVERALL HAPPINESS.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.530
SO AGAIN, YOU HAVE THIS PARADOX.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.939
ON ONE HAND YOU CAN FALL FOR THE UNSUCCESSFUL
MINDSET OF,

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.719
"WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE THIS LITTLE DECISION
MATTERS."

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.709
BUT IN REALITY, THE LITTLE DECISIONS THAT
WE MAKE IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.359
EVERY LITTLE DECISION OF YOURS WILL BE COMPOUNDED
AT THE END OF THE YEAR

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.959
AND WHO YOU ARE WILL BE THE RESULT OF IT ALL.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.519
NOW HERE'S THE THING...

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.409
I THINK IT'S JUST HUMAN AND OKAY TO INDULGE
IN THINGS...

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.409
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.829
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M THIS LITTLE ROBOT
WHO DOES EVERYTHING QUOTE UNQUOTE RIGHT.

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.079
BUT I'M AT LEAST MORE AWARE OF HOW I THINK
ABOUT THE LITTLE THINGS.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.410
I HAVE A VISION OF WHO I WANT TO BE IN A YEAR,
AND I ASK MYSELF WITH EVERY LITTLE DECISION,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.620
IS THIS GOING TO MOVE ME CLOSER TO THAT PERSON
OR NOT?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.209
AND THE ANSWER ISN'T ALWAYS YES,
BUT AT LEAST I'M AWARE OF IT,

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.499
AND AT LEAST I TRY TO ALIGN MORE
OF MY LITTLE DECISIONS WITH THAT VISION.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.439
AND THE MORE I CAN ANSWER YES,
THE MORE I REALIZE THAT I'M CLOSER TO BEING

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.400
THAT PERSON
AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.849
BUT THE SURPRISING REALIZATION FOR ME HAS
BEEN

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.620
HOW MANY TIMES THE ANSWER IS NO.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.450
NO, THIS ISN'T MOVING ME TO WHERE I WANT TO
BE IN A YEAR.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.129
AND THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON
OF THE SLIGHT EDGE.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.749
A HUGE LESSON OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHERE YOU ARE IN LIFE.

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.360
WHEN YOU GET TO THE END OF THE YEAR
AND YOU'RE UNHEALTHY,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.200
HAVING BEEN CONSCIOUS ABOUT ALL YOUR LITTLE
DECISIONS

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.970
WILL AT LEAST MAKE YOU REALIZE WHY YOU'RE
UNHEALTHY.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.650
YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BLAME YOUR POOR
HEALTH

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.999
ON HOW YOUR JOB DIDN'T PAY YOU ENOUGH TO EAT
HEALTHY,

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.409
YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE THAT
IT'S BECAUSE YOU DECIDED TO BUY THE SODA OVER

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.279
THE FREE WATER
EVERY SINGLE DAY AT LUNCH.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.859
IT'S BECAUSE YOU DECIDED TO BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE
BAG OF COOKIES

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.129
INSTEAD OF BUYING THE CHEAPER BANANAS EVERY
TIME YOU WENT SHOPPING.
