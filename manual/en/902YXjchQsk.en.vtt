00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.970
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.420
Every day for 20 years

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
I would think: "what am I going to do next?"

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
That is how I ask for the inspiration.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.830
I don’t have any ideas myself. I have a vacant mind

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.900
in order to do exactly what the inspiration calls for.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.970
She would sit in her rocking chair until the idea came into her head and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.620
she called this inspiration. The sort of presentation seemingly automatic of

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.170
the image fully formed in her head.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.490
It appeared in her head at a very small scale like a little postage stamp

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.900
so when you look at her notebooks you see how she draws the postage

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.070
stamp sized picture and then does complicated mathematics to scale it up

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.970
to meet the self-defined limitations of her canvas.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.840
I was sitting waiting for an inspiration
about innocence

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.130
and into my mind there  came a grid

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
with lines going this way and lines going that way

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.990
and they were innocent.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.990
They looked like innocence.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.260
Martin said a wonderful thing once when people questioned the paintings.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.710
asking "what are these paintings?". And she said: "From music people accept pure emotion

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.130
but from art they demand explanation."

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.000
Well these paintings are pure emotion. They are paintings of states of existence,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.180
innocence, happiness,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.180
the sublime…

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.100
And we have a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.100
tremendous range of abstract

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.030
feelings but we don’t pay any attention to them.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.430
My granddaughter was about 11 years old

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.200
and she was in Agnes’s apartment and there was a rose in a vase.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.810
She was mesmerised by the rose and Agnes saw that.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.000
She picked up the rose and said: "Is this rose is beautiful Isabel?"

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and Isabel said: “Yes this rose is beautiful”.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.810
Then Martin put the rose behind her back

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.450
and she said to Isabel:

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.480
"Is the rose still beautiful?”

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.230
and Isabel said: “Yes the rose is still beautiful”.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:55.000
She said: “You see the beauty is not in the rose, the beauty is in your mind”.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:22.960
I painted for twenty years and I didn’t like the paintings.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.520
They weren’t what I wanted. I wanted

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.600
really abstract without any cause in this world, you know?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.390
So every day I painted and I got closer and closer to

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.390
abstract painting but it took me 20 years.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.800
I had trouble with that one.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.190
We tend to associate Agnes Martin with the grid but she wasn’t born

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.630
a fully-fledged abstract painter and she went through two decades of

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.010
incredibly intense experimentation to achieve that moment of perfection.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.740
She was a painter with a long life who painted every single day

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:43.000
and edited out the work she didn’t like. If there was a composition that she achieved

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.000
and if it wasn’t quite right she would destroy the picture.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.130
With a mat knife she would cut up her paintings and she would paint that painting again.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.479
And she could paint that painting ten times and destroy nine of them.

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.800
Martin was the greatest editor of work

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.919
I think of any artist probably who ever lived.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.520
I think about nothing but painting and the older I get

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.210
the more I like to paint.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.169
It grows on you.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.719
Just imagine, I am eighty eight so I have been going for quite a while.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.700
I have to sit down.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.700
Looking at these grids and repetitive lines and

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.039
passages of pale colour.

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.620
Think of them as much of a mantra as a visual experience

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.830
and the repetition is like the repetition of the sound and Martin has

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:07.190
felt that the painting is a kind of map and it is a map to your inner responses.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.120
Whether it be joy or happiness or makes you calm...

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.930
That’s the work of art, that her painting is a key to the art within you.
