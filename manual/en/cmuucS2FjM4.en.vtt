00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.950
The fully-contained, flooded backfill concept
began with the combined efforts of the Iowa

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.950
Department of Transportation and Iowa State
University.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.250
IDOT and ISU conducted research looking into
the settlement problems occurring at bridge

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.600
approaches.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.860
This area is commonly felt by motorists as
a dip or roughness in pavement just before

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.190
driving across the bridge.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.960
Wayne Sunday: “Early on in both the research
that Iowa State University did and also lab

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.579
work that our folks did, we determined that
our granular backfill specification – the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.600
amount of fines – was not really a good
drainable material and we consider that to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.280
be a significant problem.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.850
So, through some lab trials, using reduction
of fines passing over a 200 sieve, we determined

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.129
that for a good drainable material for this
kind of application we needed to have four

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.410
percent or less fines passing 200.”

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.519
The process is fairly simple.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.350
It consist of shaping the subgrade four percent
away from the back of the abutment wall to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.810
keep water away from the footing and two percent
in the direction of the sub-drain.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.500
Once the sub-grade shaping is complete, a
geotextile is placed over it and against the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.360
abutment wall.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.780
The geotextile becomes the containment for
all the backfill materials.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.390
A flexible sub-drain pipe is then installed
at the toe of the excavation with two feet

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.380
of porous backfill added to level the area.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.710
Finally, porous sand is placed on top of the
gravel in two foot lifts then flooded with

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.369
water beginning at the downward slope then
proceeding upward.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.369
The key to this process is the permeability
of the sand.

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.659
The faster the water is able to flow into
the drainage layer and out the sub-drain,

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.070
the better the consolidation of the materials.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.859
Wayne Sunday: “We found that we get good
water flow.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.939
The water doesn’t stay in the granular very
long, it goes to the porous and sub-drain,

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:02.939
and drains out.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.320
So it’s very effective in drawing that sand
down and getting that consolidation that we

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320
are looking for.”

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.590
Not only does this method improve consolidation,
it also saves time.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.840
Once the site and materials are prepped, the
process moves relatively fast.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.230
The fully-contained, flooded backfill system
provides a fast and effective way to minimize

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.920
settlement and improve the right quality for
motorists.
