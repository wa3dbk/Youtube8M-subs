00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:05.290
What am I doing with my life?

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.069
I just want to connect.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.790
Why can't I connect with people?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.330
Oh, right.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.420
It's because I'm dead.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.709
I wish I could introduce myself, but I don't
remember my name.

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.190
I think it's started with an "r".

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.600
But that's all I have left.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.430
It's kind of a bummer.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.870
I shouldn't be so hard on myself.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.200
I mean, we are all dead.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.130
This is my best friends.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.280
We even have almost conversations sometimes.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.840
They call these guys, "bonies".

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.129
They'll eat anything with a heartbeat.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.220
I mean, I will too, but...

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.970
At least, I'm conflicted about it.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:54.580
Nice watch.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.580
Be

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.530
dead.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.750
It's too much.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:17.580
- Don't be creepy, don't be creepy.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.170
- What are you?

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.049
This is a corpse infected with the plague.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.200
It is uncaring, unfeeling,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.780
incapable of remorse.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140
I don't understand, but he's changing,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.630
and he feels,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.080
and he's learning to be human again.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.470
- Oh my God, is that him?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.470
- Yeah.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.470
'sup?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.470
You started something here.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.240
Whatever it is what you too have,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.010
it's infecting the others.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.219
- They're somehow curing themselves.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:59.460
- They are not curing themselves.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.210
Come with me.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.950
Shoot on sight.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.700
We have a breach.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700
- You're changing everything.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700
- Corpses are fighting skeletons.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.700
- Who do we shoot?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.700
- Shoot this!

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700
Hi!

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.700
How did you die?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
How old are you?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.700
You could be twenty something.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.700
But you could also be a teenager.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.706
You have one of those faces...
