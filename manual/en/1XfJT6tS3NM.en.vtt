00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.800

And have a great week!

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.460
Hey guys!

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.940
It´s Mindy from Cute Girls Hairstyles

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940
And today I'm gonna show you

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.400
how to use pin curls as an accent for your other hairdo's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.180
So I have just done my hair like I normally do with my wand curls. This is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.880
day three on my hair. So I'm looking for something to kinda pull the sides up a little bit out of the way

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.620
so I'm gonna do pin curls. I always wanna say pin coils, that's not it, either way...

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.700
okay, I've got my piece of hair and I'm gonna take my two fingers

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.060
and I'm gonna just wrap the hair around my fingers

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.480
this is why some people call them finger coils, finger curls...

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.740
Then you're gonna slide the hair off and you're just gonna lay it on the head

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.820
and pin it down

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.420
now I'm gonna take a section, just like almost directly below that first coil

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.500
and I'm gonna do the same thing. So, wrap it around your fingers

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.980
till you run out of hair, slide it all off of your finger tips

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.240
lay it flat on your head

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.440
and pin.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.680
So you get these nice little coils.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.720
Now I'm gonna take one, sort of to the back

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.060
of the two, cause I'm gonna do a little triangular shape

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.740
but you are welcome to pick up as many as you want. I've seen people that do four.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.100
I've even seen five. It's completely up to you what you do.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:21.560
So again fingers, wrap around, slide it off, down flat on to the head, make sure to grab any of those loose ends.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.060
You don't want them to poke out,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.620
and pin it down.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.080
And there you have like a cute little sort of a Rossetti looking accent to your hair.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.480
You can leave it like this and just wear your hair down with this little pin up.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.580
And I've done it to my daughter too, to show you what it looks like on somebody younger.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.180
and with longer hair. You can see that we've just pinned hers to the side and we've actually

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.880
pulled her bangs into her curls so that you can't see her bangs at all.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.420
Like I left mine out and she's pulled hers in,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.200
but another really fun thing to do with the same hairdo

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.900
is to just pull it back.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.180
Especially if you're wearing it like I am

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
day two, day three hair

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.220
and you need your hair pulled back a little bit more.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.560
Like I'm gonna just actually pull it back into a nice little messy bun on the side of my head,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.580
like a little messy. Twist some of my ends in to make a nice little messy bun.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.740
and then you have this fun little accent to a messy bun as well.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.120
So another great one would be as a pony tail. Or I mean there's a million things you could do

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.060
with just these little accents. So leave a comment and tell me below how you would use it in your hair.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.340
and what you would do with it and we'll see you later.
