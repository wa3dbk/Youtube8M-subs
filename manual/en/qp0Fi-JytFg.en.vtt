Hi, I'm Frank Pope, FBI Guitars. I'm here
on behalf of Expert Village to give you some

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.620
tips on how to build your own guitar.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.840
Now I'm going to talk to you about cutting
out the neck; show you the basic steps.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.690
The first step you're going to start with,
is to have a piece of wood. This wood comes

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:27.769
from Stewart McDonald, it's for making glue
in necks. I think it's 3x2 1/2. You want to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.890
first run it on the jointer, make it sure
all four sides are perfectly flat and perfectly

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.110
smooth. If this is not smooth and perfectly
flat on top, you can never have the flat finger

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.160
board that we talked about before.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.000
First thing you're going to do with it is
use the side cutting template. You'll put

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.690
this template on to the wood. You'll mark
it and you'll cut this out on the bandsaw.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.080
Just like this. Don't do anything else. Don't
cut it out from the top yet.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.712
Because the next step is to route the truss
rod channel in it. You're going to use the

00:00:56.712 --> 00:01:02.280
little router table and the dremel tool that
we showed you earlier and this is to show

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.440
you, this is what a router will do with the
appropriate bit. You'll route this the entire

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.720
length of this neck that you've cut out. Except
you'll stop approximately here. This is where

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.630
the end of the truss rod will be.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.310
Once you've done that you can then place this
template on the top of the wood, which will

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.360
be the piece you have cut out, and trace it
and then cut this out as well.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.560
If you'll notice when you look at this piece
of wood, it is not wide enough to make the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.440
little ears of the head. Don't worry about
it. You don't want to start with a piece of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.780
wood wide enough to make the whole thing,
you'll waiste a lot of wood. You can glue

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.310
two little blocks of wood up here on top after
you've cut this out and finish cutting the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.021
little ears out. Since they're inside, the
holes are inside the solid piece of wood,

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.580
it won't effect structurally the neck at all
and it'll save you a lot of wood.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.000
Let me say one other thing to you. If, when
you try to route this truss rod slot, you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.580
find that after you've cut it, it's not perfectly
in the center of the neck, remember this neck

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.099
doesn't use the whole width of this wood.
Don't panic, adjust the center of your neck

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.390
to your truss rod. Don't build a neck with
the rod routed to the side, just move everything

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.590
over and begin with the neck from that point.
