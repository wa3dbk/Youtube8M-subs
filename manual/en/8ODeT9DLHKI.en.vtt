00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.590
APPLYING A SIMPLE STAIN TO A BACTERIAL CULTURE
IS A TECHNIQUE THAT IS USED FOR EXAMINING

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.800
THE SIZE, SHAPE, AND ARRANGEMENT OF A SPECIMEN.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.489
IT USES A DYE TO STAIN THE CELLS, MAKING THEM
EASIER TO SEE UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.790
IN THIS EXPERIMENT, WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE
STEPS FOR APPLYING A SIMPLE STAIN TO THE BACTERIAL

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.239
ORGANISM, STAPHYLOCOCCUS.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.269
START WITH A CLEAN MICROSCOPE SLIDE.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.149
USE A CHINA-MARKING PENCIL TO LABEL ONE END
OF THE SLIDE WITH THE SPECIMEN NAME.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.890
DRAW A CIRCLE IN THE CENTER OF THE SLIDE.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.760
BECAUSE WE’RE USING STAPHYLOCOCCUS FROM
A SOLID SOURCE, WE’LL DRAW A CIRCLE ABOUT

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310
THE SIZE OF A NICKEL.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.549
TURN THE SLIDE OVER SO THAT THE CIRCLE IS
ON THE BOTTOM.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.580
THIS WILL PREVENT THE MARKING FROM MIXING
IN WITH THE SAMPLE.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.450
ADD A DROP OF DISTILLED WATER TO THE SLIDE.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:25.470
STERILIZE AN INOCULATING LOOP BY PASSING IT
THROUGH THE FLAME OF A BUNSEN BURNER.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:37.940
WHEN THE LOOP IS COOL, TOUCH THE BACTERIAL
COLONY AND TRANSFER THE BACTERIA TO THE SLIDE.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.950
USE THE LOOP TO MIX THE CELLS AND THE WATER.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:52.700
SPREAD THE MIXTURE TO COMPLETELY FILL THE
CIRCLE.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.030
ALLOW THE SLIDE TO AIR DRY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.590
THE TIME WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF
THE SMEAR.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.610
YOU WILL KNOW THE SLIDE IS DRY WHEN YOU SEE
A THIN WHITE HAZE.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:21.670
NEXT, HEAT-FIX THE SLIDE BY PASSING IT THROUGH
A FLAME THREE TIMES.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.950
FLOOD THE SLIDE WITH SAFRANIN.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.540
SAFRANIN IS A BIOLOGICAL STAIN THAT WILL DYE
THE BACTERIAL CELLS RED, MAKING THEM EASIER

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.200
TO SEE UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.580
BE SURE TO FILL THE ENTIRE CIRCLE WITH THE
DYE.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.640
LEAVE THE STAIN ON FOR 30 SECONDS.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.390
GENTLY WASH THE SLIDE WITH DISTILLED WATER.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.830
DRAIN OFF ANY EXCESS WATER.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.200
USE BIBULOUS PAPER TO GENTLY BLOT THE SLIDE
DRY.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.540
AFTER THE SLIDE HAS COMPLETELY AIR-DRIED,
THE SMEAR WILL LOOK LIKE A THIN RED HAZE.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.489
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.370
THE SLIDE ON THE LEFT IS OUR STAINED SLIDE.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.670
THE SLIDE ON THE RIGHT IS UNSTAINED.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.180
LOAD THE STAINED SLIDE ONTO THE MICROSCOPE
STAGE.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.760
ALWAYS START WITH THE LOWEST POWER OBJECTIVE.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:42.900
USE THE COURSE AND FINE ADJUSTMENTS TO BRING
THE BACTERIA INTO FOCUS.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:55.510
SINCE THIS IS A BACTERIAL SPECIMEN WE MUST
OBSERVE IT UNDER OIL IMMERSION.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:07.680
THE STAPHYLOCOCCUS CELLS LOOK LIKE SMALL RED
BALLS.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.870
SKETCH THE IMAGE IN YOUR LAB NOTEBOOK.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.310
NOW YOU’RE READY TO GO INTO THE LAB AND
PERFORM A SIMPLE STAIN.
