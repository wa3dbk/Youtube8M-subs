00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.600
Dr. Pillai: &gt;&gt; Sometimes changing your clothes
will put you in the Now.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.020
This is a very revolutionary concept and it's
easy to do that too.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.850
I'll give you an example.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:24.560
There was a woman who was staying in our guest
house; she's a model and apparently she was

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.380
making a lot of money.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.250
I have seen her changing her clothes at least
5 -6 times a day.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.790
All beautiful clothes, she would come out,
even if there was nobody around and she would

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.090
walk with the new outfit she had just put
on.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.890
I was meditating on it.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.940
Apparently she was making a lot of money and
I would attribute one of the reasons why she

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:06.310
was able to attract the money was because
she was in the Now.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:17.709
Being in the Now is quickly changing your
reality.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:29.549
By changing clothes, you can get into contact
with fast time because clothes carry colors

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.749
which are only Light frequencies.

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:45.020
I'm particularly today wearing this outfit
which is particularly good for manifestation,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:56.289
red, Brahmin red, can attract money, and the
white can put you in the Now.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.409
This is a very simple practice, but a very
profound practice.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.409
Try this.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.409
God Bless.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.379
