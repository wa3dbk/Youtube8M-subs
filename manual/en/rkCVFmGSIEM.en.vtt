Hi I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we are
going to start mixing the ingredients together.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:14.240
First we are going to put the flour a cup
and 3/4, then we are going to take the salt

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:31.270
and mix it with the flour together. Now we
are going to put the yeast, the sugar, the

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:51.559
cinnamon, and the water. I'm going to mix
it up together and I still when it is still

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:43.200
not ready I'm going to go ahead add the raisins
to it. As I mention before you should always

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.390
have a extra flour and water encase you need
it for your dough. Cause sometimes different

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.670
cups has different measures and the dough
becomes more stickier or it is to hard and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:11.969
you need to add water to it.
This is our dough it is still a little bit

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:40.489
sticky. Just going to drop more flour and
it here it is ready to exceed and rise. I'm

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.650
going to take a plastic bag and put it in
and let it rise for about a half a hour to

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.749
double it's size. It might take a less the
half a hour about 20 minutes to half a hour

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:57.310
to rise.
