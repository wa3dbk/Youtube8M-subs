00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.440
We strongly recommend that if you acquire
a male, or male sugar gliders that you have

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.230
them neutered.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.730
Neutering is important for a number of different
reasons.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.599
Certainly one of the most important reasons
is that neutering will prevent your sugar

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.120
glider from ever being able to breed.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.819
It will also remove the desire for them to
exhibit some of those normal male hormonal

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.429
tendencies.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.510
The other reason that we recommend neutering
male sugar gliders is that the surgical procedure

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.330
is, as a routine procedure, fairly safe, fairly
uncomplicated as long as the person performing

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.520
the surgery knows how to neuter a sugar glider.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.890
It also enables them to most likely get along
better.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.370
When sugar gliders live in community, when
they live with other sugar gliders, and especially

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.380
if males are living together, neutering them
does often allow them to have a more amicable

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.950
type of relationship together.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.350
For those reasons we usually recommend having
them neutered.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.869
Sugar gliders have a unique testicular anatomy
in that their testicles are held in a small

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.920
sack, somewhat of a pendulous sack that hangs
on the lower abdomen.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.710
We will demonstrate here in Moe, what that
looks like.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.649
So you can see in this male, this small area
of tissue here, that is hanging away from

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.330
the body is actually what houses the testicles.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.520
You can see how surgery-wise, you would have
to be able to remove that and be able to remove

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.729
both of these testes completely.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.039
It is somewhat unique in sugar gliders in
the anatomy and the appearance of it, but

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.060
it does lend itself to a routine type of surgical
procedure.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.560
When it comes to the consideration about females,
the female sugar gliders as marsupials have

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.960
a very unique, very complicated reproductive
anatomy.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.780
The spaying of sugar gliders is not commonly
performed.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.509
The times that it may need to be are when
it is medically necessary, should there be

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.280
reproductive problems, or if it is important
as part of managing any type of health concerns.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.510
Spaying the female is quite a bit more complicated
and is not as routinely performed as it would

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.510
be neutering the male.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.000
We certainly recommend if you are going to
have sugar gliders and keep males that you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.950
have them neutered; for both peace in the
home, peace in their cage and environment,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.870
and allowing for more appropriate and better
socialization.
