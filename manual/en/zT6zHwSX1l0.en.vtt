00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:06.030
So we're rocking and rolling
with my favorite games

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.060
of all time.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.490
Next up, my favorite
psychological game-- it's

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.322
"Dead Space."

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:13.210
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.937
I hate scary games.

00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:17.020
I really don't enjoy them.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.520
I don't like scary
movies, either.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.910
I like sleep too much, so
anything that disrupts my sleep

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.760
patterns with scares or frights
is definitely on my "no" list.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.426

[SCREAMING]

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:30.500
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.820
So it's kind of curious
that "Dead Space"

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.320
became one of my favorite
games when it came out in 2008.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.400
Here's the basic premise.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.080
You're Isaac, a very serious
and stoic systems engineer

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.960
who's aboard this
giant spacecraft

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.280
with a lot of his
former space mates

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.080
who have been transformed
into these things called

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.990
necromorphs.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.394
It all goes downhill from there.

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:51.810
One of the scariest
moments for me

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.509
by far was when this giant
tentacle grabs your leg.

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.050
And you're trying
to shoot it as it's

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.100
pulling you along the floor.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.780
It's terrible.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.988
But there are also these
moments where you're outside

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.640
and you can't hear
anything at all.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.216
The absence of sound is
absolutely terrifying.

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:04.882
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.850
[SILENCE]

00:01:07.927 --> 00:01:08.510
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.590
If you've seen the
movie "Gravity,"

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.150
part of what makes
the movie so tense

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.530
is this juxtaposition between
the destruction that's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.900
happening in the outside
world and just hearing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.200
Sandra Bullock's breathing.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.610
The absence of sound really,
really adds this layer.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.850
It makes things really scary.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.266
"Dead Space" builds
on top of this

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.310
in a lot of different
ways, one of which

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.030
is diegetic interfaces.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.230
Diegetic is just a fancy way
of saying "in the world."

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.410
So in filmmaking, for
example, diegetic sound

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.400
happens when you
crush a Coke can.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.480
It makes a Coke
can crushing noise.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.690
So in "Dead Space," one
of the things that they do

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.870
is eliminate the
separation between you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.040
as a player and
the world of Isaac.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.610
You look along the
spine of his back,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.010
and you can see
his health meter.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.760
You look at the ammo counter on
his gun or even the inventory

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.930
that he has on his wrist.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.380
All of these elements create
what's called immersion.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.917
I know, we talk
about this a lot.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:54.500
But it's really,
really clever the way

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.958
that they do in "Dead Space"
that makes things super scary.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.750
Also, the sound design for the
game is really, really good.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.130
The stomp of Isaac's boot--
he walks really, really

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.650
slowly through the spaceship.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.290
Also, the shriek of
the shuttle as it's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.930
pulling into the
station-- it all

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.294
adds this layer of ambience.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:10.710
And then there's
this final kicker

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.360
that, when you encounter
the necromorphs,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790
you don't shoot
them in the chest.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.600
You have to shoot
them in their arms.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
"Dead Space" is constantly
frightening you and then

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.380
demanding your composure.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.420
But the most
important thing by far

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.200
in terms of bringing
everything together

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.550
is something that most players
probably don't know exists.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.845
It's called the Fear Engine.

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:29.720
It's a piece of technology
that was developed

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.170
by the creator, Visceral Games.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.170
Here's how it works.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.210
Every object in the world has
what's called a fear value.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.900
It goes from zero to one.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.330
So zero is like a butterfly.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.950
One-- holy crap.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.359
Isaac, as well, has
his own fear value,

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.400
which is also measured on
a scale of zero to one.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.170
So that value
controls everything

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.660
that you see, feel,
and hear in the world.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.060
So Isaac's breathing, when
it starts to get scary,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.180
starts to heighten.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.860
The music gets more intense.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.030
The lighting will start
to get more intense.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.960
You'll have enemies
that spawn at you based

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.960
on what that fear value.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.302
It's spatial, as well.

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:02.760
So if there's a really big
enemy that has a super-high fear

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.070
value and is on the
other side of the wall,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.010
everything is going
to start to build up

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.540
to that particular moment.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.190
Alfred Hitchcock said it best.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.810
"There is no terror
in the bang, only

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.300
in the anticipation of it."

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.300
[GUNFIRE AND SCREECHING]

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.240
So that's my pick for
most psychological game.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.300
It got really bad.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.332
I mean, I imagined necromorphs
crawling on the ceiling

00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:23.790
when I was playing the game,
or even when I was not playing

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.039
the game-- like, in real life.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.800
It crossed over.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.900
I could only play the
game during the day time.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.660
It was really scary.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.540
Anyway, what's your
favorite psychological game?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.954
It doesn't have to be scary.

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:35.120
Hash it out in the comments.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.245
And I'll see you next week.
