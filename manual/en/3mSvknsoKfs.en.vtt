00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.799
Many young people have memories of their first
sports match.

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:06.960
But the legacy of Kabul's Ghazi stadium is
one that has passed through infamy as well

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.020
as pride.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.490
“I don't think there are any Kabulis who
don't have a memory of Ghazi Stadium.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:28.140
When I was a child, I came here with my father
to watch Buzkashi competitions.”

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
As head of the Olympic committee, General
Aghbar is keen to promote Afghan athletes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.070
on an international scale.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.920
And with recent successes in football, cricket
and judo, the star of Afghan sports is on

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920
the rise.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.800
“A well-organised sports programme can appeal
to the youth in the society and bring out

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.100
the very highest qualities of citizenship.”

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.170
“The intent is promote a culture of sports
for Afghan youth and give them viable alternatives

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.480
to some of the other negative influences out
there, such as crime, drugs the insurgency,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.580
et cetera.”

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:19.679
“We want the world to know that 
young athletes here are ambassadors for peace.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.679
Their country is burning, there is smoke issuing
from it.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.270
But despite murders and explosions caused
by the criminals of the last century, our

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.759
young athletes can have a strong presence
in international sports and bring medals to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.840
their country through healthy competition.”

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.119
Ghazi Stadium was opened in 1923 and saw its
first international soccer match between Afghanistan

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.369
and Iran in 1941.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
But it's the nineties that saw the stadium's
darkest hours as the Taliban used its grounds

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.890
for public executions.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.450
Today, though, the stadium has a new face,
as with a million dollar investment from the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.909
US government, the pitch has been relaid with
international-standard artificial turf.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.310
“With a sometime chilling and bloody past,
it was going to be hard to vanquish the minotaur

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.649
at the centre of Afghan thought when it came
to the stadium.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.530
But with the chance to re-lay the ground,
a new hope appeared.”

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.500
 Digging up the ground is also a symbolic
act, removing the earth once soaked in blood

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470
and replacing it with new soil.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.120
 “The Taliban and their supporters were
trying to show their power by passing death

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.610
sentences and cutting off people's hands at
Ghazi Stadium.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:38.740
 “Now that construction is occurring here,
we want our youth and all of humanity to breathe

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.640
this air freely.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
”

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.210
After the opening ceremony, Afghanistan's
sportsmen and women will have a chance to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.430
experience the new turf for themselves.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.480
“It's one more step in Afghanistan's march
towards being a modern country in this part

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.680
of the world.”

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.410
