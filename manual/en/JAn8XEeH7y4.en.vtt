00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.100
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime News for August 17th 2015.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.380
Each week, we bring you the biggest talking
points regarding Valve and the community.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.020
It’s not often we start an episode with a story from the community,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.470
but we know you guys will like this first piece.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.480
Earlier this week, Polycount forum
user PogoP started a new thread

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.180
to highlight some of the work they have recently
been undertaking in their spare time,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.410
which, as you can see, stands as a full recreation
of the apartment block sequence

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.460
from Half-Life 2 within the Unreal 4 Engine.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.980
As the 11 screenshots currently uploaded
to the thread demonstrate,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.260
Pogo’s project brilliantly captures the
look and feel of the original sequence

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.530
while giving it a new lick of paint and some
shiny new models straight out of 2015.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.940
Pogo mentions he is also planning
to build an exterior vista of City 17

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.540
once work on the attic is completed,
hopefully rounding out the entire sequence quite nicely.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.310
With most of the interior work now blocked out,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.010
we’re really looking forward to seeing how
the rest of the detailing work pans out,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.350
as it could definitely use some more clutter and dirt

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.480
to make it look like the home of the
oppressed, over-crowded masses

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.360
we all know from Half-Life 2.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.130
If you’re looking to keep up with Pogo’s on-going work,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.860
we highly encourage you to check out the
ever-growing thread over on the Polycount forums,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.780
a link to which has been provided in the video description.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.730
While The International 2015 Dota 2 tournament may be over,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.310
Valve’s post-event clean-up began this past week
with the release of the 10v10 Gamemode

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.850
previously revealed during the All-Star Match over a week ago.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.140
As you would expect from the name,
this new Valve-made custom gamemode

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.800
gives players the chance to battle it out on the
main Dota map with double the number of heroes.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.070
Throughout the match, heroes are given an
increased amount of gold and experience,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.620
helping to speed up farming and allowing everyone
to become active far faster than normal.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.940
To stop the gamemode from becoming a one-sided,
boring stomp-fest literally every game,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.540
Valve have disabled heroes such as Silencer and Bloodseeker,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.780
neither of which can be picked due to
potentially overpowered or “anti-fun” abilities.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.540
The gamemode can currently be
downloaded from the Steam Workshop

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.380
or the in-game Custom Games page,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.050
so be sure to head on over to try it out as
soon as you’re done watching this video.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.190
Alternatively, you may want to hold off
playing the 10v10 gamemode a little longer

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.130
to first check out this neat two and a half minute timelapse video

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.310
by YouTube user Tony Hoffman.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.050
The video shows the construction, use,
and dismantling of the gigantic stage

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.010
used at The International 2015 a few weeks ago.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.300
As Dota fans will undoubtedly remember,
the stage was a ridiculously impressive display

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.750
of lights, screens, and special visual effects,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.520
and it’s extremely interesting to see
how it was all built and managed

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.370
before and during the event,
before then seeing it all torn down again

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.600
after the end of the finals last Saturday.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.510
As usual, links to the video will be available
on-screen now and at the end of this episode.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.830
After over three weeks of silence for Counter-Strike fans,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.740
this past week finally brought about a new update for CS:GO

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.370
and the subsequent start of the
ESL One Cologne 2015 Pick’Em Challenge.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.410
As with previous Pick’Em Challenges, the event allows players

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.990
to purchase and collect Team-themed weapon stickers

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.420
to bet on the outcome of matches and group stages,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.430
this time for the ESL One Cologne 2015
tournament between August 20th and 23rd.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.130
Players competing in the Pick’Em Challenge will earn a Trophy

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.120
displaying their score on their CS:GO and Steam profiles,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.280
while scores can be more closely tracked
against friends using a dedicated leaderboard.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.690
This time, however, Player Stickers are also available.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.700
Similar to the item signatures included
in Dota 2 for a few years now,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.700
Player Stickers feature a scan of the
real-world autograph of a select player,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.420
with 50% of the proceeds of every sale
going to that team’s players and organization.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.310
More details for the most recent Pick’Em Challenge
can be found over on the CS:GO blog,

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.930
so go get stuck in!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.600
Unfortunately for TF2 fans, this week didn’t
bring about the return of new updates.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.990
What TF2 did get, however, is themed downloadable
content for Bossa Studios’ "I Am Bread."

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.600
As we all know from their recent
VR partnerships with the HTC Vive,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.640
the developers at Valve and Bossa are clearly
very close and love working together,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.560
which makes it all the more believable
that this kind of DLC actually exists.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.650
Following on from their previous
TF2 collaboration for Surgeon Simulator,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.740
this new piece of free content sees I Am Bread’s titular bread slice

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.250
venture through RED base to try and reach
a fridge and “BECOME SANDVICH”

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.920
as the DLC tagline helpfully explains.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.790
Taking a look at the official trailer reveals
this DLC has a lot more to offer,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.910
with clear references to the Expiration Date
short and various inventive interactions

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.930
with a number of weapons and items
from the Team Fortress 2 universe.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.780
All current and new owners of I Am Bread can access
the downloadable content for free right now,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.160
so be sure to let us know what you think
of it if you’re going to be checking it out!

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.250
And that wraps up this week of mostly-community Valve news.
