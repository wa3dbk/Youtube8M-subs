00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm here today in our Salem District Signal Shop to learn more about the flashing yellow arrow signals  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
That are going to be installed in the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas  

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Joining me today to talk about these new flashing yellow arrows is Anne Booker our assistant regional traffic engineer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 So, Anne I understand  there are some new types of signals that are coming to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.500
the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas  What can you tell me about these new signals

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Well drivers are familiar with the signal heads which we use for our left turn lanes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That include five lights with a steady green arrow and a solid green ball

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now what we found is that drives at times misunderstand this green ball

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and they proceed on without yielding to oncoming traffic

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We are changing out to a four light signal head

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that includes a flashing yellow arrow

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Why is VDOT making making this change

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to improve safety  researchers show that   drivers understand the flashing yellow arrow

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
more readily and they'll yield to that oncoming traffic before making that left turn

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
About a year and half ago on 419 we changed out three  intersections

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
at Chapperral Drive  Colonial Avenue and  Spring Wood Park Drive

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We had the five lights configuration previously

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and a most of those three intersections we had approximitaly 50 left turn crashes

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In the fourteen months following the change we've had only 4 left turn crashes 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
among those three interchanges and we've seen a reduction  of the number of crashes and an improvement in safety

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I understand there are 100 signals in the Roanoke and Lynchburg that will be changed  Where are these one hundred signals

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We are changing some more on 419  the'll be some on 220 up to Montgomery County

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Appomattox throughout the forrest area of Bedford

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Really all throughout  Roanoke and Lynchburg

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
How much is VDOT spending on making this change

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The total cost of this project is about $1.4 million

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Which sounds like a lot of money

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but when you consider that's less then $14,000 per intersection

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the safety benefit that we anticipate receiving it's considered a low cost safety improvement 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.500
How do you think drivers will react and adjust to these new signals

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
Well with everything there is a learning curve

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I don't anticipate our drivers will have a hard time with it 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Just to make sure we are also going to install a sign beside the 4 light head

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that will say left turn yield  on flashing yellow arrow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That sign will be there for about 30 days and then it will come down

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Does VDOT have plans to install more of these types of signals

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We do as we reconstruct our interchanges when they are need

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We will certainly put up the flashing yellow arrow

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In addition localities in our area have embraced the flashing yellow arrow

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It is a national standard and a number of states are using it 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.500
So expect drivers to see it more nationwide and certainly in this part of Virginia

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500
Well it does sound like a great safety improvement and I really appreciate you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
Taking the time today to join me in the signal shop

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and explaining these new flashing yellow arrows to me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Your very welcome
