[ Sounds of Rushing water ]
[ Lizzie Ehrenhalt ]The tradition

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.110
of taking pictures at Minnehaha Falls
is nearly as old as photography itself.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.050
Since the 1850â€™s tourists
have been coming here to pose

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.870
for snapshots in front of the
dramatic natural backdrop.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.800
The Minnesota Historical Society
preserves many of these images,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.920
from formal Victorian family
portraits to 1950Ã­s candids.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.250
Together they document 100 years
of excursions to this iconic

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.250
Minnesota landmark.
