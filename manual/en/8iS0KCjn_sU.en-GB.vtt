00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.890
Brandon and I are criss-crossing Australia
to track down some of our wildest animals

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.930
on some seriously weird and sometimes deadly missions.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.980
I'm not sure what's coming, but no doubt Brandon has lined up some dangerous creatures for our next adventure.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.540
Salt water crocodiles are one of the fiercest predators on the planet.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.220
They stalk their prey in silence and then suddenly erupt out of the water and devour them.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.060
This is epic! The door is shut and that means something is trapped inside.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.300
Check this out!

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.620
He's making a pretty agitated noise right now.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.280
Being so close to a massive salty is truly nerve-wracking.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.860
Crocodiles can be deadly. And you should never approach one in the wild.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.480
This is not what you want to happen half way through surgery.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.660
It basically just woke up.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.200
Where are we off to?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.120
We're going for a ride.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.080
Okay boys, look outside.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020
Welcome to The Great Barrier Reef.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.360
This is the biggest reef I've ever seen.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.240
Stunning, huh?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.200
Yeah.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.700
Mate, that is crystal blue water, ay?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.320
Ha ha!
That is incredible!

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.690
Hold up brother - you want me to eat a snake?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.460
Yep! You gotta eat it.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.240
Up here it is a delicacy.
You have to catch one. Cook it and eat it.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.980
Bon appetite! Here's the mission.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.180
See ya, Harriet.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.920
Measuring up to 6 or more meters in length, Great Whites are the largest predatory fish in the sea.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.960
I'm going to be diving with a great white shark, aren't I?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.180
This is one nerve-wracking mission.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
Alright my friends, it's show time.
I'm going in there.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.180
Woah! Look at the size of that. It's hard
to describe how you feel when you come face-to-face with a great white shark.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.420
This creature is monstrous.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.920
Let's get bushwhacked!

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.440
And everyone is invited to come along for the ride!
