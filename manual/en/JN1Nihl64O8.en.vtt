00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.180
What you are feeling right now is a modern
day Depression. We will get through this,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.620
but like any major economic shock, the future
is being altered dramatically due to the circumstances

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.280
and actions by central planners today.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.410
Fresh in the memories of Americans is a boom
that lasted for nearly 30 years, from 1980

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.750
to 2008 with minimal interruptions.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.300
Prosperity reigned on America, the credit
bubble that started in the 1980’s helped

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.670
fuel our economic expansion, coupled with
bad monetary policy that gave rise to a tech

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.440
and housing bubble. Not to discount the communications
revolution and the largest generation spending

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.510
more money than any generation in American
history.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.879
The Baby Boomers equal one third of Americas
population, they dwarf both the generation

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.829
before it and after it.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.500
And according to research by Harry Dent, baby
boomers peaked in home buying in 2005, coincidently

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.329
homeownership peaked at 69.4% in 2004.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.200
Today, homeownership is about 65% according
to the U.S. Census, however this rate includes

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.950
millions of people who are at least 90 days
late on their mortgages. If we exclude these

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.979
people, the homeownership rate drops to 62%,
the lowest level in 50 years.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:25.170
As to the future of everyone who is at least
90 days late, this is 1.4 million homeowners

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.759
or “renters in waiting.”

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.450
The total number of properties as of August
2013 that are delinquent in the U.S. is 4.6

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.549
million

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.340
The housing bubble took people who couldn’t
afford to buy homes and made them homeowners.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.119
Today, they are not only renters again, but
they all have severely damaged credit scores

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.410
which is important when buying a home.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.840
The biggest driver for the rental boom though
will be the Class of 2009, 10, 11, 12, and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.510
2013, and for that matter, any graduate during
the rest of this decade.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.159
Young people drive rental markets and new
home buyers, but today’s young people will

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.220
not be buying homes.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.230
Americas Youth, those 18-25 are going to college
and loading up on student loans and consumer

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.260
debt.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.560
Upon graduating, only 43% of them are in careers
for what they went to school for.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.190
Those in the class of 2013 have a total debt,
$35,200 according to a Fidelity Survey. This

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.540
includes about $27,000 in government loans
and $8,000 in other college related debt,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.459
including credit card, personal, state, and
private loans.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.190
These tenants will not be saving up to purchase
their first home and will be chronic renters

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.760
for a good majority of their lives.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.519
With Obamacare now in place, many employers
are reducing part time work hours to less

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.940
than 30 per week; small businesses across
the country with around 50 employees are decreasing

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.870
their workforce to a maximum of 49 people
to avoid penalties of the Affordable Care

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.870
Act.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.720
Not only do recent graduates have debt, but
the jobs just aren’t there...

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.060
Unemployment for recent graduates is 7.9%,
however this does not include those who have

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.870
given up looking for a job or are working
outside their degree. In general, for the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.190
younger generation, those between the ages
of 18 to25, unemployment is at 16.1%.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.760
For those that are employed, 53.6% aren’t
working a job that requires a degree according

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.190
to the Center for College Affordability and
Productivity.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.190
The top jobs for college graduates...
Waitress

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.440
Waiter
Bartender

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.470
Food Service Employee

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470
What will drive the Rental Boom:
Multiple factors will drive the rental boom

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.349
No money for a down payment
No Driver for Jobs

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.069
Bad Credit due to bankruptcy or foreclosure
Unqualified due to lack of income and high

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.069
debt levels

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.959
This is NOT the coming rental boom, this boom
is happening right now, and as&nbsp;you can see,

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.269
the underlying fundamentals are very supportive.

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:15.159
Apartment Vacancy rates are down to 4.2% according
to research by Reis Inc., prior to the housing

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.290
bust, vacancy rates were above 8%.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.259
For Single Family Homes, the median asking
rent just hit an all-time high in July of

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.259
2013.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.009
According the National Association of Realtors,
5 to 6 million families will become new renting

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.610
households in the next 10 years.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.070
Renter households have jumped from 38 million
in 2008 to 42 million according to the U.S.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.070
Census Bureau

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.030
The best part about the rental boom, is that
due to artificially low interest rates, we

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.660
are seeing an anomaly. ***Rising rents while
real wages are down***

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.000
Landlords are becoming more and more recession
resistant by the day. With low vacancy rates,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.860
high demand, and effective rents increasing,
now may be the best time to become a landlord.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.280
The recovery we have seen in the stock market
has not yielded any returns for the middle

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.990
class in America.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.050
1% of income earners took fully 93% of the
income gains since the recovery

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.080
the top 10% of income earners account for
50% of all household income in the U.S.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.720
The breadline in this depression has risen
from 26 million in 2007 to 48 million people

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.960
in 2013.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.431
The destruction of the middle class will alter
when people get married, have children, and

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.990
buy a home.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.820
