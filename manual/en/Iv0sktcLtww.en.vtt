Hi, and welcome to this video on topping
up your oil in your car engine.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.140
This is a Peugeot 206.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.099
As you turn the ignition on, you'll see information on the mileage

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.040
and on the current electronic oil level
in this car it's showing 50% a low oil

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.780
In this car, it's showing 50%

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.599
a low oil level can really damage a car. So it's definitely time to top this one up

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.160
so we start by opening the bonnet so we can get access to the engine, to put the oil in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.050
and also to check the oil level

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.170
opening the bonnet on the 206, you can
see the engine oil directly in front of you

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.780
It's not a very clear image but you
can obviously see from the dipstick the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.500
oil is lower than 50%. It's more
accurately measured on the dipstick than

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:12.600
it is on the dashboard itself this is
the oil I've used standard 1040 oil just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.880
a glass jar just a can't it via I should
say I'm using 1040 as it's the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.650
recommendation in the handbook for my
car

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.580
given hello this oil level was I've got
about 50% of the jar full what to be

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.619
really careful not to overfill the oil
at the engine with oil it can really

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.509
damage the engine exactly the same way
as being too low can just open the cap

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.970
and literally pour the oil straight in

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.090
we're obviously gonna need to read check
the oil level to make sure we get the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.740
right amount of oil in it's important
not to get dirt into the oil so I'm just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.820
going to put the cap straight back on

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.580
takes quite a while for the oil to
actually head down through the engine so

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.160
as you can see it's not really showing
much oil is having dropped to the bottom

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.959
of the dipstick to pick up we need to
wait about two minutes for the oil to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.450
settle correctly in the engine to
measure it properly

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.050
we can help check the oil level again

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.350
and it's at about a third full so we
still need to continue topping up just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.360
going to check it electronically now to
also prove slight difference between the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.230
measures here

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:38.220
and as you see this believes it's over
half-full now so I'm basically going to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.040
top up again now about the same amount
of oil try and bring the dipstick

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.320
measurement to just below the full mark

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.550
the electronic reading now shows 100%
full which is exactly where we want to

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.699
be
