00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.920
Hi, guys, and welcome.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
Today, we are cooking mac 'n' cheese.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.200
A shout out to Paige Gill or Gill,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.360
I don't know
how to say your surname,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.320
but you requested it
in the comments of a previous video

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.720
and we are making it for you.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720
For you.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.200
And we have already cooked
the macaroni and the broccoli,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.560
all cooked and done 'cause
that's the boring and easy bit.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.520
And we're gonna start
by an onion, my darling.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.160
You're chopping an onion,
I am chopping up some bacon.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.240
I'm also gonna put the pan
on with a little bit of oil.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.040
I'm loving your chopping technique.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.680
I'm glad it's working for you.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.200
In it goes.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.800
Now we're gonna cook this
for about 5 minutes

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.600
until it is golden brown.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.080
This is definitely a healthier
mac 'n' cheese than...

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.120
It is, a little bit.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.200
It's still mac 'n' cheese, but...

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.560
I mean, it's,
if it is a light cheese...

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.640
a hundred grams.
- Come, on be precise.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.080
Hundred and fifty five.
Just put a bit extra in.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.120
- I'm gonna eat that.
- It's not gonna harm anyone.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.200
Right, so these are now kind of
getting golden brown,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.520
but I don't want to overdo them

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.400
because this bacon is gonna
be in for another 5 minutes.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840
It's now about time to put
in the cheese, the flour,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.240
all the ingredients basically,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.160
but I'm just taking it off
the heat ever so slightly

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160
and just cooling down the heat

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.520
'cause I don't want
the milk to curdle

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.080
and the cheese because
that is really easy to do.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.440
Can I put the extras
in and you stir?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.440
Yes, that's gonna be the plan.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.480
Okay.
- Okay.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.360
So first, we're going
to need the flour.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.560
Soft cheese next please.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.480
Milk?
Milk gently.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.560
I think it's still a little hot.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.360
No, I think we're okay.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.520
Some sweetcorn.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.720
That was not gently, again.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.960
You're not good at being
gentle, such a brute.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640
And then the pasta and the broccoli.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.240
I think you need to melt
all the cheese first.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.560
It'll keep melting. Don't worry.
Keep going.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.600
Okay.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600
This is one of my favourite dishes.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.840
Whenever we go to the States,
I love having mac 'n' cheese.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.640
I once had mac 'n' cheese with
lobster in it and it was so good.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.120
Hot diggity dang, that sounds good.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.440
Then I need a little
bit of black pepper

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.680
just to season it off.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.080
So while this is simmering,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.520
would you care to chop
me up some coriander?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.760
I would. It's parsley though.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.080
Or parsley.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.440
Just chop this up, roughly chop.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.560
But nice, kind of
fairly finely chopped, diced.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.880
Mix this in with the grated cheese
and we also have breadcrumbs,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.880
which Mike conveniently
made earlier.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.240
Into the dish it goes.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.200
It doesn't have lobster in it,
but bacon will do.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.160
Everyone can add lobster.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160
If you're feeling decadent,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
you can add some lobster
to your mac 'n' cheese.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.200
Right.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
So we get a bit of breadcrumbs

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.160
and we just scatter this all,
over the top.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.200
Dump it on.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.800
No, you got to be nice and even.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.840
I want loads of it, though,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.320
'cause that's
the bit that goes crispy.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.680
Yes, but it's like painting a car,
you've got to do it evenly.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.040
Painting a car.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.680
Like I've ever painted a car.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.880
Make sure you've got
a little bit in the corners.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.000
Right.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.040
I would say that is now done,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
so it's now time
to go into the grill.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.720
We're gonna kind of put in
there until this is melting

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.680
and golden brown, so probably about
10 minutes in a range I'd guess.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.800
Look what I have for you.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.760
Here it is.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.040
mac 'n' cheese.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.400
I'm actually so excited because
I am hungry 'cause it's dinner time.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.680
Serve me some of that up.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.160
It's looking good.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.400
Let's go for it.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.680
Mmm.
- It's pretty good.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.800
That is good.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.280
The texture is pretty good.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.240
You're gonna have to do the talking
'cause I took quite a big mouthful.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.280
Okay.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.440
If you liked this recipe
and you want to recreate it at home,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680
we will put all of the info
in the info bar below.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.760
And if you want to recreate
some classic American recipes,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.040
we have also done
a pancake showdown.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.080
Oh, well. Nailed it.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.880
I'll link that here
and if you fancy making

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.760
some awesome cupcakes
that Mike actually did for me

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.480
as a birthday surprise,
they're cupcakes shaped like burgers,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.680
then we'll link those here.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.960
Don't forget to subscribe
if you haven't already

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.920
and we'll see you again
next Wednesday, bye.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.960
Goodbye.
