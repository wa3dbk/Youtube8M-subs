00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.769
Hello il Pescatore's friends!

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.249
I'm going to make a STICK-MIX
that I will use tomorrow.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.060
The ingredients are:

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.060
Two cans of tuna without oil (80 gr),

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.090
Crumbled boilies, 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.500
the same I decided to use tomorrow, 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.060
in this case they are "The Source" by Dynamite bites.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.520
A teaspoon of salt 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:22.469
And a teaspoon of spicy paprika.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:44.469
Now I pour hempseed, because carps like it very much.

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:18.669
Pellets, that taste like fish,

00:03:54.699 --> 00:04:01.699
And a teaspoon of Carp-zone betaine.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.590
Its smell is very intense.
I mix everything and that is the result!
