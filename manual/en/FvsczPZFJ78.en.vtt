00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
On July 6 at 8:05 P.M., "Yuan Zai" was born!

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.000
It was a highly anticipated day for the zookeepers,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.200
There was no time to celebrate

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.400
soon a lot of work began

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.560
It was everyone's first time watching "Yuan Yuan" give birth

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.200
"Yuan Zai's" birth went smoothly and she was held gingerly

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.100
The stressed zookeepers could now relax

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.500
Zookeepers, veterinarians

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.600
and two Chinese panda specialists

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.300
began the 24 hour watch of "Yuan Yuan's" caretaking

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200
Later, they found out "Yuan Zai" had a wound

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
In order to prevent the underdeveloped immune system

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.300
from worsening the infection of the wound

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.300
the zookeepers began to feed "Yuan Zai" artificially

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.100
"Yuan Zai" is fed at a fixed time every day

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.500
and "Yuan Zai" is also given a rub down

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.300
The newborn panda cub can't poop herself,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
so every day, there is also a fixed time to stimulate "Yuan Zai" to defecate

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.000
The zoo also invited panda cub specialists Wei Ming from China

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600
to offer some assistance

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.000
He arrived at the scene later

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.500
and immediately started working

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.800
The schedule was so tight that he had no time to open his suitcases.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000
Zookeepers did not overlook "Yuan Yuan's" post-natal care

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.900
After delivery, the head chief of Giant Panda closely did a rub down

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.600
to help lighten "Yuan Yuan's" stress

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.900
The zoo invited China's panda breeding expert, Dong Li

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.800
to supervise and assist in post-natal care and breastfeeding techniques

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
In order to match "Yuan Yuan,"

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.400
the zookeeper sometimes came up with some interesting analogies for taking breastmilk.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
The zookeeper treated the mother and daughter wordlessly with such care

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.240
and also customized "Yuan Zai's" quilt

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.300
When "Yuan Zai's" wound healed,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.100
In order to let "Yuan Yuan" returned back to be at Mama's side

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080
The zookeeper also diligently conducted many tests

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.700
Finally, the zookeeper's long-awaited day had arrived

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.200
where "Yuan Yuan" and "Yuan Zai" could reunite as mother and daughter

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.300
The zookeepers observing the reunion were very nervous

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.200
For fear of bothering the reunion, they took care to watch from the side

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.740
The Chinese expert was listening carefully 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.400
to see if "Yuan Zai" was making sounds as she drank the breast milk

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.300
The veterinarian checked the health conditions of both pandas after the reunion

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.300
The zookeepers thought "Yuan Yuan" was exhausted from taking care of "Yuan Zai," so they helped feed her

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.300
and gave her some water

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.340
The zookeepers kept an attentive 24 hour watch and record

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.200
So tiring, yet they don't dare rest

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.300
This is "Yuan Zai" now

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.840
Extraordinarily healthy 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.800
and strong

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.000
A very big applause to the zoo team who invested their time and energy 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.300
and also to "Yuan Zai's" friends who followed her growth

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.500
Thank you everyone!
