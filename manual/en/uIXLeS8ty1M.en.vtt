00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:25.080
You know what 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.400
I like about you guys?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
Sometimes, you send us on, little adventures
through time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.269
That’s what Kevin did.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.260
He recently sent us what I’ve previously
described as a “whole freaking crap ton

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.579
of GameCube games.”

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.670
Even I’m not sure what that measurement
means.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.440
But I’ll tell you one thing it does mean.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.489
I’m going back in time, with some of these
games.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.710
These are games I haven’t played in years.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.239
Some are games I played eight months ago.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.109
Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects is
one of those games.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.030
And if I seem disappointed about that, well
I am.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.540
This is a game I would’ve preferred to never
have played again for the rest of my life.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.140
I reviewed the Xbox version last April, and
it was like being slapped in the dick by a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.140
sloth.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.140
Doesn’t even hurt.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.520
It’s just slow, and kind of confusing.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.790
Nonetheless, our ol’ pal Kevin’s looking
out for me…on that one.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.790
Thanks, Kevin.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.820
Thanks for the…trip through time.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.130
If this is what the past is like, I’ll take
the future.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.130
Lea Thompson.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
Fake boobs.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.670
Of course, some of the games I’ve been revisiting
are actually better than I remembered.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.670
Rise of the Imperfects is not freaking one
of them.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.700
This is one of the worst beat ‘em up games
in the history of the worst beat ‘em up

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
games.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.329
It was released to awful reviews, people slammed
it, they called it dumbest thing ever made

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.759
by people…alright, no one said that.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.270
But I did just say it’s like being slapped
in the dick by a sloth.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.550
That did happen.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.130
And it’s true.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.100
So in the spirit of mercy…let’s start
with the good.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.530
The Thing says “It’s clobberin’ time,”
which reminds me of CM Punk…who had an amazing

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.200
match with the Undertaker at WrestleMania
29.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
Good thing number one.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.570
Elektra has a whale tail.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.469
Good thing number two.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.789
Um.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.890
You can…throw cars, at people.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:18.830
And turn off the GameCube, good thing three.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.240
The weird thing about Rise of the Imperfects
has always been that…it actually shouldn’t

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240
be terrible.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.140
It was developed by talented people; the script
was written by Mark Millar, who is an award-winning

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.320
comic writer; not to mention that it was in
development for a long time.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.130
This game should’ve, at the very least,
not sucked.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.010
The fact that it does is amazing.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.950
It’s actually kind of impressive.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.680
I have no idea what happened.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.590
Anyway, if you’re new to this game…Rise
of the Imperfects is just a standard brawler,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.760
in terms of its design.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.190
Each mission gives you a different Marvel
character, but the objectives are always the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.190
same.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.450
Beat up the enemies, win the level, play a
different level with a different character,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.760
and do the same thing.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.810
The game never changes or evolves.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.530
It always feels the same, regardless of who
you’re controlling or what barren place

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.560
you’re controlling them in.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
And it’s never any fun.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.340
And you know, simple gameplay would be fine
if it was good—it’s not good.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.140
And it doesn’t give you any interesting
moves or anything, either.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.600
Each character has just about the same moveset.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.840
Attack, jump, throw—that’s it.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.390
You can activate this rage mode, once your
meter is full…but it’s never really apparent

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.590
what that does.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.810
Beyond, just…putting a filter on the screen.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.390
Wolverine gets his claws out.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.710
Because, yeah, why would you be able to just
use Wolverine’s claws any time you wanted,

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.710
right?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.950
Who wants to do that?

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.770
Of course, the positive has always been the
presentation.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.760
Some of the cutscenes have a nice style, the
character models are decent…it’s not a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.090
bad looking game.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.350
Not technically.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.840
But on the other hand, the environments are
atrocious, and the music’s forgettable.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.600
But hey, all that other stuff?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.870
That’s a start.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.140
Too bad it ends with you turning off your
GameCube, every time.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.800
Some games get better with age.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:21.979
Rise of the Imperfects stays as…imperfect,
as ever.
