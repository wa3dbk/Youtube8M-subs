00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.002
<i> It wasn't the color
 that you had asked for.</i>

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:04.837
Surprise!

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.040
<i> But I don't think you even
 noticed.</i>

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:13.078
<i> Even with the training wheels,
 you still needed my hand.</i>

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.781
<i> Not to keep you from falling,</i>

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.684
<i> but to help guide you
 in the right direction.</i>

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:21.187
<i> Slowly at first.</i>

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.823
<i> Then a little faster.</i>

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.626
<i> And soon...
 you could steer yourself.</i>

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.097
<i> And then the training wheels
 came off...</i>

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:35.067
<i> and you needed my hand again.</i>

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.604
<i> It was scary taking that step.</i>

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:41.674
<i> But I was there, holding you
 up, directing your path.</i>

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.913
<i> But I couldn't hold on forever.</i>

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.917
<i> I had to let you build
 your own strength.</i>

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.990
<i> Of course, we were there
 when you fell.</i>

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:59.124
<i> "It's not your fault sweetie,"
 I'd say.</i>

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:02.095
<i> "Just part of learning."</i>

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:05.498
<i> And soon, you were flying.</i>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.337
<i> And if I tried to help,
 I'd only hold you back.</i>

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.410
<i> Go fly sweetheart.</i>

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:24.951
<i> We'll always be here.</i>

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.725
<i> Praying your scrapes may be
 slight...</i>

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.427
<i> and your path steady.</i>

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.703
<i> And one day soon...</i>

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.113
<i> you'll do the same for yours.</i>

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.585
