Hi everyone!

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.130
Today I'm going to show you a new nail art
: a floral nail art perfect for this season!

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.500
This design might seem hard to recreate at
first sight, but actually, it is really to

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.500
make!

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's begin!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.570
First of all, apply your base coat.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.780
Then I took a golden polish and I place it
on my ring finger.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.100
Because I wanted something opaque, I applied
3 coats.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.029
I painted the rest of my nails with a burgundy
color.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.090
I applied 2 coats.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.590
If you are making some mistakes, you can take
these kind of pen which removes polish!

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.640
Once everything is dry, I made 4 dots with
the tip of my pink polish.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.540
Try to use an opaque polish.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:01:01.820
Then, trace some "c" shapes around the pink
dots with a beige rosÃ© color.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.500
You can even add a little dot in the center
of the rose.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.550
After that, I took the same golden color and
I traced some kinf of leafs around my flowers.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.120
Just trace 3 lines around each rose.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.600
As you can see, you don't need any tool to
recreate this design!

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.050
A pen is enough!

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.870
FInish by adding your top coat!

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.050
Here is how you can easily recreate this beautiful
and really easy nailart!

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.700
No tools are needed in this case!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.200
I am loving all the colors together for this
season.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.840
If you have noticed, I used a lot of makeupline's
polish in this nail art.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.080
Make up Line is a french brand, which produce
its products in France.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.280
They sell both make up and nailpolish boxes.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.479
There are 4 nailpolish boxes.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.900
They show you how to recreate the make up
and the manicure in each box thanks to a little

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.900
book.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.220
What I love about these products is that they
stay a lot on my nails!

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.549
I went to the swimming pool and my nail art
was still shinny and perfect!

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.330
The polish are also very pigmented which I
really like for these kind of design!

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.170
I really like their polish.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.010
If you were wondering what this brand is all
about, now you know at least why I think of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.010
it!

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.190
I really hope you liked this design!

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:50.270
Feel free to catch me on fb and instagram,
where I post really frequently!

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:59.150
See you soon!
