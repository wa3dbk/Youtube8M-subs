Hello everyone. My name’s Tom and I’m
a second year Pharmacy student. I am also

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.800
a student vlogger for The University of Nottingham.
Today we're going on a tour of the campus.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.300
It's worth noting that The University of Nottingham
has more than one campus. Today I'm going

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.000
to show you University Park. But there is
also Jubilee, Sutton Bonington and King's Meadow,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.200
all of which are very easily accessible.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
Alright on with the video.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.300
Let’s go!

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.800
[Music]

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.289
If you are going to be living on campus, it
is more than likely that you’re going to

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.300
be walking through The Downs every day. It’s
also just a nice place to just chill with

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600
your mates and just enjoy the sun.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:52.600
[Music]

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.319
Right here is Portland and it’s the place
to be if you're on campus. Here you’ll find

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:01.489
the Student Union, Career Advice and also
the on-campus bar Mooch. You will also find

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.600
other shops, such as Boots, the Student Union
Shop and Starbucks.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.200
[Music]

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.380
This is East Drive and this is the main
bus stop on campus. Here you can catch the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.700
many Hopper buses that run through The Uni
and also many public buses that take you into

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.920
Nottingham town centre.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.200
The University of Nottingham also has its
own lake. During the summer you can actually

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.100
rent out boats. Just chill out and enjoy the
sunshine. Just watch out for all the geese

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
that also call The University of Nottingham
home.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:38.400
[Music]

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.200
This is Cripps Health Centre, and this is
where you can find GPs, dentists and also

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.500
the pharmacy on campus.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
[Music]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.090
Here at The University of Nottingham, you
will find we have loads of libraries for you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.400
to do your work. The biggest one on campus
is Hallward and that's based right in the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.100
middle of the site.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.700
[Music]

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.400
But you also have other libraries such as George Green, which was recently renovated,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.660
and also Greenfield Library which is based
in the Medical School. If you’re doing a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.750
healthcare degree here at Nottingham, you
will be glad to hear we’ve got close connections

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.310
with the hospital nearby. The QMC and Medical
School is literally five minutes away

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.800
from campus, and you can access it by a footbridge
here.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.500
[Music]

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.380
On campus you will also find there are many
different gardens for you to just chill out

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.830
and just relax. And this one here is the Millennium
Gardens, which is based just behind the Law

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.100
and Social Sciences Building.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:51.700
[Music]

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.200
That’s all I have time for. So what I’ve
shown you is only a little snippet of what

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.600
The University of Nottingham campus can offer for you.
There’s the Arts Centre, the New Theatre

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.540
and the Sports Centre, which is due for a
40 million pound renovation to be

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.000
completed within the next few years.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.700
I hope this video’s been really helpful
for you and I wish you the best of luck with

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.590
your studies. But all this walking has made
me extremely tired. So I’ll see you in the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.200
next one.
