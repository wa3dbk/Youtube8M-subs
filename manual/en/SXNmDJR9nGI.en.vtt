Yeah, Cirno-chan

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
Besides, Tewi-chan said not to go near the Bamboo Forest because it's dangerous...

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Hmm, which one was it?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.980

Blue is dangerous, and red is even more dangerous, so turn back as soon as you see the ribbons, and don't come near the Bamboo Forest in the first place--

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.980

I hate you, Flan, you crybaby. What are you so sad about?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.980
It's...it's because you're so mean, Flan...

Uu~uu~...

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.980

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.980
You forgot? You pulled out her intestines

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.980
Did I?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980

You've been asleep for three months

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.980
What...?

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.980
You probably don't remember, but three months ago, you went out of control all of a sudden

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.980
And...we tried to stop you, but you went outside the Mansion and into the sun...

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.980
Marisa brought you back later

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.980
but the sunlight burned you all over...even your wings. You were in a dangerous condition

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.980
A-And you were unconscious for three months

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.980
