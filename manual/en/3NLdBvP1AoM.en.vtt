00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.519
Today, I will teach you how to make Low-Fat Paneer!

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:06.254
Put the milk to boil in a deep pan, while stirring occasionally.

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:18.024
You need perforated vessel to make any kind of 
 firm paneer, so that water oozes out.

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:49.730
You need to use low-fat curds and whisk it well.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:25.040
Low-Fat Paneer made using curds, gives good amount of soft Paneer.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.830
When it starts boiling, switch off the flame and wait for 1 minute.

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:38.090
It is very important to allow it to cool 
 for a minute to get soft paneer.

00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:47.040
Now, let's add low-fat curds.

00:02:56.624 --> 00:03:00.620
Then wait for 2 minutes.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:41.220
Once the milk has curdled, strain using a muslin cloth.

00:04:09.693 --> 00:04:14.690
Allow some water to drain out.

00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:21.060
Don't strain it completely...let little water remain..that's how you will get soft paneer.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:46.010
Place the paneer into the muslin cloth in a 125 mm. (5") 
 paneer mould or any mould. Press it with a lid.

00:04:57.527 --> 00:05:03.530
If you do not get this perforated vessel, you can use 
 any perforated deep bowl and cover it with a lid.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:16.440
And so, here our Low-Fat Paneer is ready...you can have 
 it warm, or make vegetable out of it.

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:31.770
Once the paneer is ready, transfer it into a 
 plate and cut it as per your requirement.
