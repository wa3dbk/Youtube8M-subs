Hey y'all okay so as y'all know, Valentines
Day is coming and because of that, we have

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.430
to do a video called How To Confess To Your
Crush. And I am so totally doing this video

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.930
because I absolutely know what I am doing.
But, let me be honest here, I have no clue

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.150
okay. So. Let's get on with it.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.980
First of all if your significant other is

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.980
a female, you could always get her some flowers
on Valentines Day. Flowers, you can never

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.969
go wrong with flowers, unless she hates flowers
then that's a whole new different story. Then

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.850
don't give her flowers. Also, you might want
to do something, it's to check whether she's

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.149
allergic to flowers. You know, just to make
sure. Or like pollen for that matter. If not

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.629
you could always get like fake flowers but
I think fake flowers are quite expensive and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.479
most of them don't actually look that pretty
after all so. Fresh flowers, out of the roots?!

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:09.479
(laughs) are always the best. Fresh flowers,
always go for fresh flowers. Make sure they're

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.729
not wilting, make sure they're not dying,
and make sure she's not allergic. And that's

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.880
all.
If your significant other is a female you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.299
could always fricking serenade her. You could
always play a song on the guitar and sing

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:33.419
a nice love song like. For example I would
say Kiss Me by Ed Sheeran. You will never

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.420
go wrong. Ed Sheeran. Ed Sheeran, our love
lyrical genius, you will never go wrong. If

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.310
you haven't heard about his songs or about
him for that matter, please go check it out.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.090
Ed Sheeran, you will never ever go wrong.
Also he writes breakup songs too, so just

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.219
make sure you don't for that ones. Those.
Make sure you go for the love songs. The sweet

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.299
love songs. Cause you will ever go wrong with
Ed Sheeran.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.359
If your significant other is a female you
could always do something what people do in

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:13.359
the movies. It's to leave a note in her locker.
Although that's usually not a really good

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.530
idea and always ends up really bad in movies
but try it out. It might just possibly work

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.860
in real life. (gasps) I guess. Well. Or you
could always just leave a note in her book

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.550
for first period and hopefully no one else
decides to borrow her book.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.970
If your significant other is a male, it's
really simple. Go up to the guy and say, "Hey

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.380
you, I like you!" but that's probably not
a really smart idea.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.330
If your significant other is a male, you could
always do the note idea, the one about putting

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.400
it in his locker or in his book for first
period, cause movies. You will never go wrong.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.420
It's applicable, both genders, go for it,
do it. It's not really foolproof, I can't

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.340
say foolproof really but I guess it'll work
out for you I guess. Hopefu-Hopefully it works

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.980
out for you. Prayin' for you girl. Guy. Gender
neutral okay, when I say girl or guys.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.900
If your significant other is a male, you could
always do something really easy. It's called

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.130
go to your friends for help. Probably not
a really good idea but they're your friends,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.130
I'm quite sure that they'll come up with some
hella funny good ways of you know, helping

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.750
you confess. And it would be much better than
me, here, sitting right in front of the camera,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.540
telling you how to confess to your crush,
cause obviously I don't know how to do these

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.090
kind of stuff, and this was just meant for
fun.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.840
And that's all for this week's video I hope
you liked it and I hope I was funny enough.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.870
If you liked this video give it a like, leave
me a comment on whether you are actually going

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.720
to try out any of these methods that I listed.
If, anything goes wrong, don't kill me, don't

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.620
hate me, it's just for fun, this video is
simply for fun. And that's all, like, leave

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.620
a comment, subscribe for more videos to catch
up with me and that's all goodbye. 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.000
I don't know what I'm doing (laughs) Okay bye.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.530
And also, before I leave, I hope Valentines Day turns out really good for you. 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530
Hope you have a great Valentines Day okay. 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.460
If you're a single pringle, I love you. I am here, for
you, I'm always here for you, just on the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.800
internet, somewhere far away from you, probably
I guess, and (hand action) 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.680
I'll be here, love you, bye.
