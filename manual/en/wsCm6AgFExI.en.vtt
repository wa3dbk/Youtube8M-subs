00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:17.405
Hello, Banwari.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.608
Greetings.

00:00:19.688 --> 00:00:24.357
Where do you go with plate
full of fruits every morning?

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.208
I offer them to the deity
of Shiva under the big banyan tree.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:35.460
To the lingam.
I have not seen any temple there.

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:38.151
No. No. There is no temple.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.717
You know about the round
rock under that tree, don't you?

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:44.399
Don't consider that rock as ordinary.

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:48.689
A holy sage told me that
it is blessed by Lord Shiva.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.750
And let me tell you a secret.

00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.759
The God fulfils all my wishes.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:55.444
And even talks to me.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:12.743
O Lord, accept my humble prayer.
And bless me.

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:18.855
I bless you, my son.
I have accepted your prayer.

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:21.272
Go. Live peacefully.

00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:39.444
What a foolish and crazy man.

00:01:39.596 --> 00:01:41.367
This is impossible.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.955
Will anyone believe him that..

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:47.027
..god accepts his prayers every day?

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:52.418
Juicy fruits and tasty sweets. Wow!

00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:16.269
Hurry up. We have to
reach the market before noon.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.133
Only then we will get
a good worth of the donkey.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.389
Kishorilal said that all
good deals are made at that time.

00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:37.027
I accept you don't have a vehicle.

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:38.861
But you do have a donkey.

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.476
If I were you I would
have relaxed my feet..

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:44.887
..and would have rode
the donkey comfortably.

00:02:46.775 --> 00:02:50.414
He is right. I should do that.

00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:01.042
Listen. Isn't he the same
man with donkey we saw before?

00:03:01.796 --> 00:03:04.799
Yes, look how that boy
is seated on the donkey.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:07.014
Just like you suggested.

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:09.294
Listen, I have an idea.

00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:12.273
Why don't we make
fun of them a little?

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:15.638
No. I don't think he
will listen to us again.

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:18.920
Nobody can be so foolish
to listen to people so much.

00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.947
Listen, I bet you hundred rupees.

00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:24.919
That man will do our bidding.

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:27.415
Now listen to my plan of action.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.787
No. No. Look at him.

00:03:31.064 --> 00:03:33.344
The father is having trouble walking.

00:03:33.424 --> 00:03:36.477
But the boy is comfortably
riding the donkey.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.572
If I were him I would
have gotten off the donkey..

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:42.273
..and would have made
father ride the donkey.

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.771
They are right, father.

00:03:46.064 --> 00:03:49.042
It is not right that I
ride the donkey while you walk.

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:51.909
Sit on the donkey instead of me.

00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:20.076
Father, I am tired.
Can we rest for some time?

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:23.641
No, son, we are already late.

00:04:28.473 --> 00:04:29.818
Did you see?

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:31.911
What a cruel father?

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:34.518
The way he is torturing his son.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.344
Poor boy. Look, how tired he is.

00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:43.801
Anyway, donkeys are animals of burden.

00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.540
And he is only son.

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.450
If I were his father
I would have made him..

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.394
..ride the donkey with me.

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:57.487
He is right. Maybe I should do that.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:40.133
Have you ever seen anyone
being so cruel to dumb animals?

00:05:40.213 --> 00:05:42.927
The 2 were seated on that poor animal.

00:05:43.065 --> 00:05:47.278
And anyway animals are
god's creation too, right?

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:52.276
Look at that poor thing.
It has fainted.

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:54.767
I don't think it will live.

00:05:55.824 --> 00:05:57.922
If I were in his place
I would have carried..

00:05:58.002 --> 00:05:59.655
..the donkey on my shoulders..

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:02.051
..and would have
taken him to a doctor.

00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:07.526
He is right. I should do that.

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.849
Did you see? Didn't I say?

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:54.812
Those fools will believe anyone.

00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:00.001
Now I accept that you
were telling the truth.

00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:01.938
Okay, I have lost 100 rupees.

00:07:02.173 --> 00:07:03.799
But I had a lot of fun.

00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:17.983
Ghanshyam.

00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:21.822
Forgive me for laughing at you.

00:07:22.057 --> 00:07:26.382
But you created such
a situation yourself..

00:07:26.462 --> 00:07:31.003
..because of which
those boys fooled you.

00:07:31.443 --> 00:07:34.348
I hope you have learnt
a lesson out of it.

00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:37.133
The one who always listens to others..

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:40.233
..become a butt of joke for others.
