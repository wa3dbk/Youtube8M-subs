00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.410
Hi! Today, we're talking about tea. And now
I'm going to talk a little bit about how to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.750
store your puer or how to break up a little
bit for brewing it. What I'm going to do here,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.851
is I'm just going to go ahead and apply pressure
to the middle and break the tea and try and

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:23.140
break it. (Tea breaks). There we go. And now,
I should be able to put this into my clay

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.650
storage vessel here. And one of the reasons
that people do this, is because they say that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.909
if you break the tea up like this and keep
it in the clay before you drink it, then it

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:44.609
produces a tea that's a little bit nicer and
has a nicer flavor. So, I'll just continue

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:52.110
breaking the tea here. And the other thing
to look for in a puer, and you can tell when

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.760
you break it, is that it's the same throughout.
So this tea throughout the whole cake, it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.940
all the same. It's all this ancient tree leaf,
so it's quite consistent. And that's a good

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:16.260
sign. And one more break. We should be able
to get it all in the (jar). Or maybe two more.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.710
And this leaf here would be good for making
a pot of tea right now. And there we have

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.600
the tea in there. And now I'll use a cork
lid so that it'll be able to breathe a little

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.240
bit. Puer actually develops through the changes
in humidity. So, this tea is going to taste

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.200
different in the winter or the summer or the
spring. As the seasons change, the tea will

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.110
taste different. So, if you have a puer and
you taste it and you don't like the way it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.280
tastes now, just save it 'till next summer.
Try it again and you might be pleasantly surprised.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.619
And that's a little bit about puer storage.
