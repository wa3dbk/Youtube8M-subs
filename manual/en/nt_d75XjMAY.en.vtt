Hello, I'm Robin. This is my The Great Gatsby hair how to.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.579
I've taken inspiration from Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jay Gatsbty.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:15.179
The 
film's set in the 1920s. He's got this great comb over, high side parting, volume at the front,

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.060
into this cow lick wave. Everything's perfectly in place.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.500
So what you'll need for this how to is... styling paste or a wax. I'm using got2b iStylers hyper define wax,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.739
a comb,

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.310
a hairdryer, a roller brush,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.860
and a hairspray. I'm using TRESemmÃ© Ultimate Hold and Platinum Shine.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.210
It's the shine that I want from this. To start, make sure that your hair is clean and dry.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.579
Now you need to decide which way you want your hair to go.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.510
In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio's hair goes from left to right,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.660
but I'm going to go from right to left. I'm going in the opposite way that my hair grows

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.980
because it will give it volume. It sits just across my face,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.470
but if I push it across the other way, I've got instant volume

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.330
and I'm also going to be able to create this cow lick.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.560
Get your hair product, stick it in all the way through your hair -

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.530
from root to tip.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.960
Get your comb to add in the parting.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.700
You'll see that he's got a really high parting, so I'm going to add mine in higher than I would normally go.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.000
Just pushing your hair away from where you want that parting.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.860
Don't worry about any of these bits that are sticking up because we will sort them at the end.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.040
Now we need to add the volume into the front for this cow lick,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.020
which is going across my face.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.410
Get the curling brush and hairdryer.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.630
curl through and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.630
pull down across your face.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.860
See that I've got this curl coming down the side of my face. Up and over like a wave and down into a curl.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.450
Now that we've got the basic shape, you can add a little more product,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.550
to the back and to the sides.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.380
Don't overload it,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.770
but use the product to keep it all in place and neat. Get your comb to make sure that your parting is still in place.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.469
Before you hairspray your hair,

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:09.579
you need to sort out the fly-aways.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.169
Spray the hairspray directly onto your comb, not into your hair.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.319
You're just stroking the top of your hair to catch those fly-aways.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.770
You can use the back of the comb

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.239
for the sides.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.219
Do the same with the top.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.639
You can also hairspray your hand.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.499
When it's all sitting as you want it,

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:35.840
you've got all those fly-aways and you've set your parting, grab your hairspray.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.760
I'm using the hairspray to give it shine,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.469
rather than the product that I've initially used.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.979
This is my Leonardo DiCaprio - AKA Jay Gatsby - inspired hairstyle.

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.859
We've got this high side parting,

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:59.539
this volume ledge that comes straight up,

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.569
and then this cow lick wave that comes straight across and down.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.589
And that's it.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:09.180
It's so easy!
