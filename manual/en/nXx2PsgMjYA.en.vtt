00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.400
[ MUSIC ]

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.000
- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON THE 
GRAPHING OF SINE AND COSINE.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.633
THE GOALS OF THE VIDEO 
ARE TO GRAPH

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.633
THE SIGN AND COSINE FUNCTIONS 
ON THE COORDINATE PLANE

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.333
USING THE UNIT CIRCLE,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.533
AND ALSO TO DETERMINE 
THE DOMAIN AND RANGE

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.567
OF THE SINE AND COSINE 
FUNCTIONS.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:19.500
AND LASTLY, 
TO DETERMINE THE PERIOD

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.800
OF THE SINE AND COSINE 
FUNCTIONS.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400
SO REMEMBER 
THAT IF WE CAN DETERMINE

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.200
WHERE THE TERMINAL SIDE OF 
AN ANGLE IN STANDARD POSITION

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.600
INTERSECTS THE UNIT CIRCLE,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.467
THE X COORDINATE OF THAT POINT 
IS EQUAL TO COSINE THETA,

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.133
AND THE Y COORDINATE OF THAT 
POINT IS EQUAL TO SINE THETA.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.467
SO WHAT WE COULD DO, IS MAKE 
A TABLE WITH VARIOUS ANGLES

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.200
AND THE VALUES 
OF SINE AND COSINE,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.900
AND THEN PLOT THEM 
ON THE COORDINATE PLANE.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.933
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.933
LET'S GO AHEAD AND LOOK 
AT A WOLFRAM DEMONSTRATION

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.233
TO DEVELOP THIS IDEA.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.567
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE 
HERE

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.867
IS AS WE ANIMATE THIS POINT 
AROUND THE UNIT CIRCLE,

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:58.067
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE 
GRAPH OF THE SINE FUNCTION.

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:01.107
SO WE'LL BE PLOTTING 
Y COORDINATES OF THIS POINT.

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.807
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT (1,0),

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:06.507
THEREFORE SINE THETA 
IS EQUAL TO ZERO.

00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:08.473
AS WE PROGRESS AROUND 
THE UNIT CIRCLE

00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:12.707
LET'S STOP AT PI 
OVER 2 RADIANS OR 90 DEGREES.

00:01:12.707 --> 00:01:15.973
NOTICE THE Y COORDINATE 
RIGHT HERE WOULD BE +1.

00:01:15.973 --> 00:01:19.873
SO DOWN HERE WE SEE THE POINT 
PI OVER (2,1).

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:24.873
IF WE PAUSE AGAIN 
AT PI RADIANS OR 180 DEGREES,

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:27.940
AGAIN, THE POINT RIGHT HERE 
WOULD BE (-1,0),

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.173
THEREFORE SINE THETA 
IS EQUAL TO ZERO AND SO-ON.

00:01:33.173 --> 00:01:35.673
AS WE GO AROUND 
THE ENTIRE UNIT CIRCLE

00:01:35.673 --> 00:01:37.873
WE END UP 
BACK WHERE WE STARTED,

00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:40.240
WHICH SHOWS THE PERIOD 
OF THE SINE FUNCTION

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.573
EQUAL TO 2PI RADIANS.

00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:46.907
WE COULD ALSO LOOK 
AT NEGATIVE ANGLES

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:49.707
ROTATING AROUND THE CIRCLE 
CLOCKWISE.

00:01:49.707 --> 00:01:52.440
AGAIN, WE'RE PLOTTING THE 
Y COORDINATES OF THIS POINT,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.140
WHICH IS EQUAL TO SINE THETA.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.973
SO WE SEE ANOTHER CYCLE 
OF THE SINE FUNCTION

00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:03.213
AGAIN SHOWING THE PERIOD 
IS 2PI RADIANS.

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:04.947
IF WE WERE GOING TO DO THIS 
BY HAND,

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:08.347
WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS 
TO LOOK AT THE DECIMAL VALUES

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:11.147
OF THIS FUNCTION 
AT DIFFERENT ANGLES.

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.447
AND I'VE ALREADY FILLED OUT 
THIS TABLE

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:13.680
FROM THE CALCULATOR,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.580
BUT LET ME SHOW YOU 
HOW I DID THAT.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.580
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS 
TYPE IN OUR FUNCTION INTO Y1.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.247
I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:25.147
NEXT, LET'S GO AHEAD AND LOOK 
AT THIS IN TERMS OF DEGREES.

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:28.380
SO I'LL PRESS MODE, MAKE SURE 
DEGREE MODE IS SHOWING.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.347
IF IT'S NOT, HIGHLIGHT IT, 
PRESS ENTER.

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:37.180
AND LASTLY, 
LETS GO TO OUR TABLE SET.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.847
AND WE'RE GOING TO START 
AT 0 DEGREES.

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:41.680
THIS DOESN'T MATTER

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.113
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GO 
AHEAD AND SET IT ON ASK MODE.

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.780
PRESS ENTER, GO TO OUR TABLE,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.147
AND NOW WE CAN JUST TYPE IN 
VARIOUS ANGLES,

00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:52.980
AND WRITE DOWN THE DECIMAL 
VALUES FOR SINE THETA.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.713
SO JUST TO SHOW YOU, 
HERE'S 0 DEGREES, 30 DEGREES,

00:02:56.713 --> 00:03:00.687
45 DEGREES, AND SO-ON.

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:02.153
I'VE ALREADY DONE THIS,

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:05.287
SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND USE 
THIS TABLE THAT I'VE CREATED.

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:09.020
AND I WON'T USE ALL THE VALUES 
TO PLOT THE SINE FUNCTION.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.287
I'M GOING TO JUST PICK 
KEY VALUES HERE.

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:17.987
LET'S GO AHEAD AND DIVIDE THIS 
INTO FOURTHS.

00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:20.987
SO ITS 0 DEGREES, WE'RE AT 0.

00:03:20.987 --> 00:03:26.520
AT PI OVER 2 OR 90 DEGREES 
WE'RE AT 1.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:34.887
AT PI WE'RE BACK AT 0, AND 
AT 270 OR 3PI/2 WE'RE AT -1.

00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:36.987
AT 2PI WE'RE BACK AT 0.

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:38.587
SO FROM THE PREVIOUS 
ANIMATION,

00:03:38.587 --> 00:03:41.353
WE CAN SEE THE GRAPH 
OF SINE FUNCTION

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.220
WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.920
AGAIN, WE COULD FILL IN 
MORE VALUES

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.720
BUT I THINK FROM THE PREVIOUS 
ANIMATION WE CAN TELL

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.920
THAT THE GRAPH 
OF THIS FUNCTION

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.820
WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.253
SO ONCE WE HAVE THIS GRAPH

00:03:56.253 --> 00:03:57.887
AND WE'RE ASKED TO FIND 
THE DOMAIN,

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:00.393
WE COULD FIND THE VALUE 
OF SINE THETA

00:04:00.393 --> 00:04:02.527
FOR ANY ANGLE 
WE WANTED TO CHOOSE.

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:04.993
THEREFORE, THE DOMAIN 
IS ALL REALS,

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:10.193
BUT THE RANGE WILL ALWAYS BE 
BETWEEN -1 AND +1.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:14.093
SO ON THE CLOSED INTERVAL FROM 
-1 TO +1 WOULD BE OUR RANGE.

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:15.060
NEXT, WE ALREADY SAY

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.493
THAT THE PERIOD 
WOULD EQUAL 2PI RADIANS,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:21.460
AND THE AMPLITUDE CAN BE 
VIEWED AS HALF THE DISTANCE

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.527
FROM MAX TO THE MIN.

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:26.293
WELL, THE DISTANCE 
FROM -1 TO +1 IS 2,

00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:28.060
AND HALF OF THAT WOULD BE 1.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.627
YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF IT AS 
THE DISTANCE FROM THE X-AXIS

00:04:30.627 --> 00:04:32.460
TO THE MAX OR THE MIN,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.160
WHICH, AGAIN, 
WOULD BE EQUAL TO 1.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.293
OKAY, NOW, LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND TAKE A LOOK

00:04:36.293 --> 00:04:37.960
AT THE GRAPH OF COSINE THETA

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.793
USING THE WOLFRAM 
DEMONSTRATION.

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:42.060
SO WE'LL GET RID 
OF THE SINE FUNCTION.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.427
REMEMBER COSINE THETA IS EQUAL 
TO X ON THE UNIT CIRCLE,

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:47.927
SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE 
X COORDINATE OF THIS POINT.

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:52.660
SO AT 0 DEGREES THE 
X COORDINATE IS EQUAL TO +1.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.427
AND PI OVER 2 RADIANS 
OR 90 DEGREES IS EQUAL TO 0.

00:04:58.427 --> 00:05:03.533
AND PI IS EQUAL TO -1.

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:06.733
3PI/2 OR 270 DEGREES 
WE'RE AT 0.

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:10.433
AND THEN AT 2PI 
WE'RE BACK AT +1.

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:12.333
SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT GRAPH 
THAN SINE THETA,

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:13.933
THIS IS COSINE THETA,

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.433
BUT, AGAIN, WE CAN SEE THE 
PERIOD WOULD BE 2PI RADIANS.

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.400
AND, AGAIN, WE CAN USE 
NEGATIVE ANGLES

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:28.200
TO PRODUCE ANOTHER PERIOD 
OF THE COSINE FUNCTION.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.333
OKAY. LET'S GO AHEAD AND GRAPH 
THIS BY HAND AS WELL.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.733
AGAIN, I'VE ALREADY TAKEN 
THE LIBERTY

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:33.267
TO FILL OUT THIS TABLE.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:34.733
AGAIN, YOU COULD DO THIS 
ON YOUR OWN

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:38.867
IF CHANGE THE FUNCTION TO 
COSINE X, AND GO TO THE TABLE,

00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:42.233
AND PLOT VARIOUS ANGLES.

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:47.200
NOTICE AT 0 IT'S 1, AT 90 
DEGREES ITS 0, AND SO-ON.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.600
AGAIN, LET'S DIVIDE THIS 
INTO FOUR PARTS

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.500
AND PLOT SOME KEY VALUES.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:06.773
SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND PLOT THE 
POINT (0,1) (2PI,0), (PI,-1),

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:11.573
(3PI/2,0), AND (2PI,1).

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:13.040
AND, AGAIN, 
FROM THE PREVIOUS ANIMATION

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.573
WE SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO FIGURE OUT

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:18.573
THAT THE GRAPH OF THIS 
WILL BE A NICE CURVE,

00:06:18.573 --> 00:06:21.140
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.640
AND, AGAIN, OUR DOMAIN 
WOULD BE ALL REALS.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.240
THIS GRAPH MOVES 
LEFT AND RIGHT FOREVER,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.607
AND THE RANGE, AGAIN, 
WOULD BE FROM -1 TO +1.

00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:32.707
AND OUR PERIOD 
IS ALSO 2PI RADIANS,

00:06:32.707 --> 00:06:34.740
AND OUR AMPLITUDE IS ALSO 1.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.973
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THE 
AMPLITUDE AND PERIOD LATER.

00:06:36.973 --> 00:06:40.773
OKAY. SO LET'S BRIEFLY TALK 
ABOUT PERIODIC FUNCTIONS.

00:06:40.773 --> 00:06:42.673
A FUNCTION F 
IS SAID TO BE PERIODIC

00:06:42.673 --> 00:06:47.607
IF F OF X + P = F OF X 
FOR ALL VALUES OF X.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.707
SO IF FOR THE TWO GRAPHS 
WE JUST LOOKED AT,

00:06:49.707 --> 00:06:53.273
IF P WAS 2PI 
THESE TWO FUNCTIONS

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:55.807
WOULD ALWAYS BE EQUAL 
TO EACH OTHER.

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:58.073
THIS CONSTANT P 
IS CALLED THE PERIOD

00:06:58.073 --> 00:07:00.647
AND IT IS REQUIRED 
TO BE POSITIVE.

00:07:00.647 --> 00:07:02.947
A FUNCTION WITH PERIOD P 
WILL REPEAT ON INTERVALS

00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:04.147
OF LENGTH P.

00:07:04.147 --> 00:07:04.947
AND THESE INTERVALS

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:08.147
ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO 
AS THE PERIODS.

00:07:08.147 --> 00:07:12.580
AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE, HERE'S 
A GRAPH OF SINE THETA AGAIN.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.113
THE GRAPH IS CONTINUOUS 
OVER ITS ENTIRE DOMAIN,

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:16.880
THE PERIOD IS 2PI,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.880
THE X INTERCEPTS DO OCCUR 
AT MULTIPLES OF PI RADIANS.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.847
AND SINE NEGATIVE THETA IS 
EQUAL TO NEGATIVE SINE THETA,

00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:29.513
AND THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT IS 
SYMMETRICAL ABOUT THE ORIGIN,

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:32.313
WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT 
MORE LATER.

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:33.980
AND SUMMARIZING 
SOME PROPERTIES

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.147
ABOUT Y EQUALS COSINE DATA,

00:07:36.147 --> 00:07:39.180
CONTINUOUS OVER ITS DOMAIN, 
PERIOD IS 2PI.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.080
THE X INTERCEPTS CREATE 
ODD MULTIPLES OF PI/2 RADIANS.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.080
AND COSINE NEGATIVE THETA 
IS EQUAL TO COSINE THETA

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.480
BECAUSE IT IS AN EVEN FUNCTION 
OR SYMMETRICAL

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.513
ACROSS THE Y-AXIS.

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:54.113
AGAIN, WE'LL TALK MORE 
ABOUT THAT LATER.

00:07:54.113 --> 00:07:56.280
AND I HOPE YOU FOUND 
THIS VIDEO HELPFUL.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.547
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.

00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:58.913
