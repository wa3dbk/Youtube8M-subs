00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.300
Is he one of them?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.340
[Music]

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.009
His little tail is in a spiral.

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.450
Hello Andy this is Eddie. Just calling cause
we saw a snake in the back of headquarters

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.100
and we were wondering if you'd like to see
it too.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.930
What do you do when you see a snake and you
don't know what kind of snake it is?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.630
There he goes he's on the move.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.890
He looks like a cobra with his flat head.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.140
Isn't he pretty?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.440
Are there cobras in Texas?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.680
Cute! It's a little baby hognose. Eastern
hognose, yeah.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.900
Oh see it's not a rattlesnake!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.890
No, but he'd like you to think he is.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.249
Oh yeah, I'm taking pictures of this snake
to post on our Herps of Texas iNaturalist

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:40.629
website where we track observations of all
reptiles and amphibians observed in Texas.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.550
These are really cool little snakes. So he
does a few tricks.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.489
He's doing one of them big time right now
which is flattening himself out, making him

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.889
look larger, and also he looks kind of scary
with his jaws sticking out like that.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.989
They often times, this species will rattle
it's tail. So you really think you're looking

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229
at a rattlesnake.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.430
He's puffing up here. See how he's puffing
up.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.520
Yep.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.070
Some old-timers call them puff adders. They're
not puff adders.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
Well y'all did the right thing calling me
because I'm in the building. You know the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.850
most important thing is don't approach a snake
especially if you don't know what it is. I

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.340
have to say this is a beautiful specimen.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.049
Isn't he pretty?

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.979
Can you say the name one more time?

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.049
It's an eastern hognose snake.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450
Eastern hognose.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.960
Yeah, you see how his nose if you look sideways
it's sort of turned up.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.780
And I know we're not supposed to be handling
them, we're supposed to be calling someone

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.469
who can, but if for whatever reason somebody
got bit by a snake that is not venomous can

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.899
you give us a sense of what could happen to
them or what they should expect to have happen?

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.490
Yeah just wash it with warm soapy water and
go back to work.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.780
Rats.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.079
[Music]

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.420
You never know what you're going to see.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.640
I can honestly say this is the best part of
my day.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.049
[Laughs]

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.780
Abe thinks it's a rattlesnake.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.140
I'm going to turn him loose.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.560
All right then.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.390
How do you like his chances?

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.760
Out here? They're excellent.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.500
I don't want to take him too far. There he
goes. As of now you'll never see him again.
