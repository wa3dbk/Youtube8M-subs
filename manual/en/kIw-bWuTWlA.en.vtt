00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.470
I was working at GlaxoSmithKline, which is GSK. I was based in

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.700
the Worthing site, which is down by the west coast, South West.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.139
My role was to be a primary
process engineer, which basically

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.940
involves looking after the different
processes on the plant and making sure everything

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.299
runs smoothly as possible.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.800
In my department, we have five different processes, so I was working for all those processes.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.000
But during the placement role as well, I also acted as a bridge between the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.070
 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.000
primary department and the engineering department. So whenever we needed anything to be fixed, or anything to be

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.529
looked at, we needed to get people from engineering to come and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.600
sort out any issues that we had on plant.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.100
I think, going on placement, because you're learning practically, you get to learn a lot of stuff that you don't at Uni, so a lot of project management,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.200
 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.900
being time-conscious about certain things; 
make sure you able to meet targets

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.989
and did deadlines effectively. So a lot of stuff like that was embedded into me very early on too,

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.399
because I had to make sure that I hit a lot of targets

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.190
not just for my...not just for my worthwhile, for my own personal gratification as well,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.309
so make sure I was doing a good job. So I
think, a lot of project management skills,

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.390
a lot of communication skills...

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.300
I also developed some leadership skills, because GSK always try and make sure the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.900
placement students and the graduate students

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.140
are able to communicate with people effectively, and also try to make them

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.700
 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.890
leaders, because they want them to get managerial roles in the future because they want to try and make

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.640
sure that they have fresh ideas, innovative ideas
coming from young people

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.790
and make sure their voices are heard as well. Well when I first started, I was kinda thrown in at the deep end a little bit, because

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.700
at the time, we were just coming out of a shutdown, so it was "all hands on deck" and everybody

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.369
had to really put forward the work, so

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.300
a lot of my training was very, very quick
and rapid so i had to get up to speed very, very quickly

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.420
 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.700
with a lot of the stuff that we do. Saying that, everything was fun for me because I enjoyed that kind of style of work

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.750
So I was able to get really involved, get stuck in. being at work daily had definitely

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.560
given me a work routine and a work pattern

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
so I think that's very effective for me to apply that to my university study

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.820
and enable me to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
give myself a pattern and give myself a
routine to sort out my

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.689
social life as well over my personal life and
also my work life. Going into the final year,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.030
we also have a lot of dissertations to write, and we have
deadlines to write so we're able to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.400
plan ourselves ahead because we have a lot
of planning skills that we've learned from placement

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.300
and able to meet the deadlines that we've set for ourselves and also deadlines that we've been set from

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.460
 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.430
our lecturers, to make sure that we don't go over this deadline, make sure everything's met smoothly and accordingly.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.939
I think the placement's a great opportunity. I
think, when you are at uni, you learn a lot of

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.409
things but going on placement shows you the real world, shows you

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.520
a lot of things you can learn practically; it shows you as well sometimes
the standards and the criteria you need

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.810
as well to work in some certain industries.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.330
I've been fast-tracked on
application to go back on the graduate scheme

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.090
so I've been successful in that, so I'll
be able to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.100
complete my online application now to go to an assessment centre which is very, very competitive.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.220
 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.470
But I'm looking forward to that and I'm very hopeful for the best and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.860
hopefully I'll be working back at GSK very, very soon.
