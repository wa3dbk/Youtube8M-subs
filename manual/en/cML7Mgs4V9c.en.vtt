00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.350
Hi! I'm Karina Fraley for Expert Village,
and we are making our yarn doll. That's her

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.320
little button nose. Next, I am going to give
her her mouth. I'm using floss for the mouth.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.570
Again, just a yarn needle is fine. You don't
need a lot of floss. You can also use yarn.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:27.480
Whatever you prefer. We are going to just
use some floss. Pull it through like that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.641
Then you're just going to pick a spot on the
face to start. You're going to kind of start

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:36.550
with the cheek, and then we're just going
to sew the mouth. Basically, anywhere where

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.600
you think the cheek would be, you go ahead
and you pull your needle through like that.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:54.120
Go around one more time to secure it like
that. Then you're going to start forming the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:08.000
mouth. Like that and then back around.
Then through again. She's going to have a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.380
cute little stitch to the mouth. Then we have
one more. That's going to kind of form a little

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.649
cheek. Out like that. It's going to be a knot.
The last time that you pull around like that,

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:39.349
pull your needle through, one more time, and
that's going to form the knot. Back in, out

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:59.969
and through. Like that and then you have your
mouth. Just cut that. Trim it. There is your

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.289
little doll almost ready. A couple more steps.
Stick around.
