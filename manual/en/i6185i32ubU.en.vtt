00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.310
Hi, I'm Kelly with Expert Village. And, I
would like to show you fifteen quick and easy

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.940
non-alcoholic beverages that you and your
family will be able to enjoy this holiday

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.609
season. Now, I'm going to show you how to
make Eggnog for One. If you don't have traditional

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.860
eggnog sitting in the refrigerator or if you
just don't feel like going to the store to

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.660
get some. This is a sure way, quick simple,
to satisfy that craving for eggnog this holiday

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.320
season. What you will need is, one teaspoon
of sugar. I'm actually using brown sugar.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.290
So, if you want to keep it healthy. One egg,
vanilla extract, we're going to use one-fourth

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.640
of a teaspoon. And, some nutmeg for the topping.
I'm going to bring in my shaker. Add some

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:00.070
ice. Now, that we have poured some ice into
our shaker we are going to crack one egg into

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:20.360
it. It's some good protein. Now, one teaspoon
of sugar, one-fourth of a teaspoon of vanilla.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:41.210
There you go. And, time to stir. We're going
to shake all of the ingredients with the ice.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:02:00.749
And, we're going to get a tall glass.
Strain.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.959
Now, that we have strained the ingredients
into our tall glass we are going to add one

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.330
cup of milk. You can use fat-free milk, you
can also use half and half and we will be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:25.720
using soy milk for those of you that are lactose
intolerant like myself.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.560
Now, we're going to add our milk. Looks just
like eggnog, because it is! Let me grab a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:45.730
spoon and we're going to mix it. Give it a
quick little stir. And, now we're going to

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.849
sprinkle some nutmeg. And, there you go! Eggnog
for One that you personally created.
