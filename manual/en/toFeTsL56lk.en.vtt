00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.690
What do you do when the dust cover lens of
your Flip camera cracks or breaks?

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.949
The manufacturer won't repair it, they're
no longer being made, and it's your favorite

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.430
portable video camera...

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.560
Don't despair!

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.200
You can fix it yourself and have it working
as good as new, as long as the mechanics of

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.660
the camera are undamaged with a little help
from Esslinger-dot-com.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.390
Before progressing further and buying the
replacement parts and tools that you need

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.410
to fix your Flip camera, be sure to turn it
on and try recording something.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350
The video will probably be spider-webbed or
broken depending on the damage to your lens,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.070
but you should be able to successfully record
something and view it.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.510
If you can't, repairing the lens will not
fix your Flip.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.790
Once you know your Flip still works, you will
need:

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.430
A sharp bladed bench knife
A blunt tipped, chain nose plier

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.390
A dust blower
A note pad

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.890
A soft cleaning cloth
A paper towel

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.670
And a Flip Camera Lens Repair Kit from Esslinger-dot-com
OR: A replacement twenty millimeter glass

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.880
lens; A two part, all purpose, epoxy; A mixing
stick

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.510
The first thing you need to do to repair the
lens of your flip camera is remove the bezel

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.140
style lens cap.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.360
If you examine the camera lens closely, you
will see that in the middle of the silver

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.280
circle that surrounds the lens is a fine break
where the bezel joins the watch case.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.471
Start by taking your bench knife and running
it along the seam between the bezel and the

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:49.520
camera to break the seal.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.509
Then, use the edge of the blade to gently
pry up the bezel.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.890
When a portion of the bezel has been loosened,
you can grab the lens cap with your fingers

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.670
and carefully peel it off the rest of the
way.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.560
The bezel is very thin and easily damaged
so move slowly here.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.730
The back of the lens cap will probably be
tacky, set it aside face down so you can reuse

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.579
it later when you put everything back together.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.879
Now that the lens cap is gone, you should
be able to remove the broken portions of the

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.700
lens.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.659
Use your small and blunt nosed pliers to remove
the glass, starting at the edge if the glass

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.999
is still mostly intact, or at the gap if the
lens is more severely broken like this one.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.879
Turn your flip camera on its side as you remove
the glass to keep the small shards from slipping

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.260
and falling into the actual camera lens as
this could permanently damage your Flip camera.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:22.329
Set the removed shards of glass on the paper
towel so you can clean them up easily.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.480
Once all the shards of glass have been removed
you'll want to make sure to clean out the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.159
inside of the camera.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.519
Start by running your finger around the edge
where the lens was glued down and make sure

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.370
there is no glue remaining.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:46.760
Use your mixing stick to gently scrape away
any glue.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:58.930
Next, take your dust blower and use the air
to remove any remaining glass debris from

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.150
the camera.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.439
This generally works best when you hold the
Flip camera on its side so the debris can

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.879
fall out and not be pushed further into the
mechanics of the camera.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:22.240
Afterwards, take your soft cleaning cloth
and wipe the inside down as well.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.479
Then, once the camera has been thoroughly
cleaned you are ready to place the new glass

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.479
lens.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.090
Take your note pad and place an equally sized
dot of each of part of the epoxy close together

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.539
on the page.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.360
Use your mixing stick to combine the two parts
together and activate the epoxy.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:55.940
Stir the two parts together for about thirty
seconds to properly mix them.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.319
Apply a thin layer of epoxy to the rim of
the Flip camera where the old lens rested.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.360
Do not over use the glue or use superglue
as both of these options can damage the inner

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.439
workings of the camera or lead to fogging
of your outer lens.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.770
Grab the replacement glass crystal and rub
it quickly in your cleaning cloth to remove

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:28.070
any finger prints and place it carefully on
the camera ledge.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.590
If any excess glue squeezes out when you press
the new lens into place, wipe the excess away

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.700
immediately from the edge with your paper
towel.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.939
Do not press too hard, as doing so may cause
the crystal to slip or move.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:47.790
Let any glue on the central surface of the
crystal wait.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:53.069
Let the epoxy dry for about an hour to be
sure that everything is completely set up.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.530
Once the glue has dried, use your fingernail
to scrape up any remaining glue smears and

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:05.919
wipe away your fingerprints with your cleaning
cloth.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:15.009
Finally, you can replace the film cover bezel.

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.319
If the cover is still tacky, you can replace
it with adding additional adhesive.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.960
Otherwise, you can add a thin layer of epoxy
to the back of the cover before replacing

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.550
the cover on the camera.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:38.530
Use both thumbs to press the cover into place
until you here it click into place.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.919
After the cover has been replaced, you can
begin using your flip camera again immediately.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.889
Simply turn it on and begin filming.

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:56.240
