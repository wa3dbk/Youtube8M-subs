Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today’s PcT Product Demo, I’m

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.240
gonna show you a product called Tool Magic.Now
it isn’t exactly a Polymer clay product,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.980
but as a Polymer clay artist who makes a lot
of jewelry, I think it’s a great product

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.849
to be using with your jewelry making tools.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.009
Now what it is, is a kind of a silicone rubberized
product that you dip your tools into to make

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.900
them…so that you aren’t marring up your
wire, so I’ll just explain.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.760
Now if you’ve got a pair of jewelry pliers…like
these round nose pliers here, when you go

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.149
to use them on your soft metals… now this
is a piece of Dead Soft Bronze wire, if I

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.420
go to grab the wire and make some twists in
it, if I squeeze too hard…and this happens

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.590
a lot with newbies, I can get a lot of little
dents and things in the wire and what that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.430
does is it really makes it look unprofessional,
so if I’m making a pair of earrings or charms

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.149
or something like that, and I’ve got a whole
bunch of little nicks and things in my wire,

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.860
it just doesn’t look very classy.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.390
So other than getting really good with your
pliers and being more gentle with them, another

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.649
product you can use that really helps is this
Tool Magic, and I’ll just show you what

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:37.289
it looks like first, it comes in a little
tub and you can see that there’s this White

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.940
material inside…I think tool magic can come
in some other colors as well, but I’ve got

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.200
White and there’s this clear liquid on the
top, what you need to do is you need to stir

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.630
it really well before you try to dip your
tools into it, so I’m just gonna do that.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.990
And another thing you wanna do is make sure
that your tools are really clean, so I’m

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.649
just…as soon as this is done here I’ll
just…I know that there’s no more liquid

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.110
on the bottom there…or on the top, oh and
it smells, it’s quite strong, so apparently

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.720
don’t be smoking or anything near it, you
don’t want any open flames…you don’t

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540
want it catching on fire..

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.860
So, I’m just gonna take a little bit of
rubbing alcohol on a piece of paper towel

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.250
and wipe down my tools, and this just makes
sure that they’re nice and clean before

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.360
I dip them into the product.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.100
Now, I just wanna dip them down on the working
surface, you don’t wanna get any of the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.420
dip onto the hinges or deeper into the tool,
so I’m just gonna slowly dip my piece…my

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.250
pliers in the magic dip here, and then see,
there’s this coating on the outside.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.620
Just gonna make sure that none is dripping
off and then I’m going to set them up to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.620
dry, you wanna make sure that they’re gonna
be able to dry in a spot where they stay open

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.980
and don’t touch.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.790
Now, the cool thing about this product is
that it’s gonna give you a nice grippy surface

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.390
to work with, it will drip down and get a
little thinner looking…it won’t look so

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.470
heavy on here as it dries a little bit.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.901
But, when you’re working with your tools...now
here’s a pair of flat nose pliers that I’ve

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:32.120
got where the…it’s starting to wear out,
and that’s actually a good thing, ‘cause

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.860
when it starts to wear out, you can just remove
it, real easy, just with something like that

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.090
and you can peel it off and then you would
clean up your tool and then re-dip it, that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.130
way you haven’t wrecked your tools or done
anything permanent to them, and also, if you’ve

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.490
dipped it kinda funny, you can remove it easily.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.770
Now, what you do is, after they’re dry…I
would wait a day or so, then when you go to

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.040
use your jewelry pliers, those edges will
be softer, you’ll grip better without putting

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:12.710
little nicks in your wire, which will be an
improvement on your work, which is important,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.690
if you really want to get some quality work,
you wanna make sure that you’re not dinging

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.709
things up.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.479
Anyways, so I hope that was helpful for you,
I really like this product, it’s a neat

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.090
one and I’ve been using it for a little
while, and if you like this video, let us

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.230
know about that.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.539
And if there’s any products that you’d
like us to demo, or you’ve got some suggestions,

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.030

okay?

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.150
