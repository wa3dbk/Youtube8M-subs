00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.030
Hi I'm Charlie Ray.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.480
Crestliner has introduced two new models,
big water models.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.970
2050 and the 2250 Authority.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.769
The cut-away steps and swim platform allow
easy access into the boat, either for water

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.490
activities or just simply getting the boat
from the trailer.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.320
But the biggest thing about this boat is the
open cockpit.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.380
The removable back seats give you easy access
to the corners on both the starboard and port

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.989
side, for down rigging, netting fish, setting
lines and the other thing that's so obvious

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.969
is the elevated live well.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.269
It's not only a work platform but it's an
insulated 20 gallon live well.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.819
So you can either use that as a live well
or just as your cooler, and there's storage

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.120
under it.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.479
This is a big water fishing boat.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:59.049
On the port side you've got a four rod easy
access lockable rod holder, nine foot accessibility

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.670
for your rods, which is perfect for the big
water, in floor there's room for six more

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.560
8 foot rods this is perfect, no need to worry
about rods and reels.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.030
Storage has always been a concern on fishing
boats, this one has it.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.210
On the starboard side there's all kinds of
compartments and ledges and as you walk up

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.450
through the boat you've got premium consoles
and a wraparound windshield with storage under

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:51.450
the consoles.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.850
If that's not enough for a perfect all around
fishing boat, you've got an ample casting

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.850
deck as well.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.350
Loads of storage and another live well, 50
gallon aerated with a timer.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.420
This boat has it all, even the smallest accessories,
wash down system, extra rod holders that mount

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.720
on to the back live well, even the Suremount
gunnel systems so you can mount your accessories,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.069
rod bags, anywhere along the side.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.730
This is sure to be a favourite.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.640
Check it out and if you're a big water fisherman,
this might just be the boat for you.
