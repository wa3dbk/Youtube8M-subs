00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:17.459
Jaystepher here today with a tutorial on how to build this cool Lego console TV.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.260
First thing we're going to need

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.960
is a 2 by 6 brown plate,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.029
and I'm going to need for of these 1 by 1 studs.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.399
We're going to place them on the bottom.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.010
One on each corner,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.820
and these are going to be our legs of our TV.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.520
Next thing we're going to get is a 1 by 1 smooth dark grey tile,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520
we're going to place it right there,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.730
we're going to place it right there,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.340
and a 1 by 2 smooth dark grey tile,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.979
and a 1 by 2 smooth dark grey tile,

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.380
I'm going to place it right next to the other tile.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.560
This is going to be the bottom part of our screen.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.740
And we're going to take a 1 by 4 light grey brick,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.690
place it in the back.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.140
Then you're going to need four of these

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.500
Then you're going to need four of these

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.680
1 by 2 log bricks.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.290
I'm just going to place one on each side here.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.850
This will be the sides of our TV.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.850
Then we're just going to take two more of these and just repeat.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.870
The next thing we're going to need is two

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.570
of these dark grey eyelet bricks,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.130
and we're going to take one brick, and we're going to take a 1 by 1 black smooth tile,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.220
we're going to place it on the front.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.710
we're going to place it on the front.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.990
This is going to be our speaker for our TV,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.500
and we're going to take another one of these .... This a 1 by 1 ...

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.210
It's a stud that's, I guess painted metal, but  I'm going to use it for a knob,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.519
It's a stud that's, I guess painted metal, but  I'm going to use it for a knob,

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.519
stick it on the other eyelet brick.

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.169
Then we're just going to take both of these bricks we put together,

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:28.169
we're going to place one on top of the other.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:35.579
This will be the controls for our TV.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.769
Now we're ready to build the screen of the TV.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.259
First thing we're going to need is a

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.099
2 by 3 dark grey plate. Any color will do because this won't been seen,

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.349
and I'm going to take a 2 by 2 light-grey tile.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.959
I'm just going to place one on this side here.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:52.919
And we're going to take a

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.079
And we're going to take a

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.709
1 by 2 light-grey tile,

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.979
we're going to put it on this side. There's our screen.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.559
We'll flip this over.

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.560
We're going to take two of these eyelet bricks. These are a little different than the other ones. These are actually flush-mount.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.599
Then we're just going to stick one

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.719
on either side

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.069
top of the screen,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.089
and then we're basically just going to slip this guy in the back.

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:36.289
So we're just going to place it on top here,

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:38.379
and I'm just going to take to these

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.379
1 by 1 light grey bricks, I'm just going to fill the back in.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.979
There, we have our screen.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.519
And I'm just going to take

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.839
these 1 by 6 brown plates or tiles,

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.219
these 1 by 6 brown plates or tiles,

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.519
place them on the top.

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.999
This gives us our top of our TV.

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.629
There you have it.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.969
A cool Lego Console TV

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.519
that looks vintage.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.589
This will work in any

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.619
setting such as a living room or

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.079
a bedroom maybe.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.370
It just adds a little old-fashioned character to
your Lego home

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.209
or castle.

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:25.770
Thank you for watching.
