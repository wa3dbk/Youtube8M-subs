00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.730
I'm Carmi Weininger of the ReactorPanel Saddle Company

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.249
Let's address the burning
question that everyone asks:

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.800
What IS the ReactorPanel Saddle?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.779
How does RP work, and how is it different?

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.519
Here's a tour.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.369
let's start with the saddle "top"

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.369
This is a saddle outfitted for trail riding with a leg channel and D rings to hang your gear.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.210
All of our saddles have the same technology for fitting the horse

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.550
We build on many trees so we can make seats that are comfortable for any rider.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.290
There are fifteen different models so we can support any type of riding.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.240
The tree angles are obvious because they are not covered in flocking.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.020
It's easy to see the angle of the tree which should match the angle of your horse's shoulder.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.520
The bottom of the RP saddle does not have flocking

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.600
unlike conventional saddles that use wool, air or foam to pad the horse's back.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.240
Instead, RP saddle trees are covered in Velcro

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.650
The circles are used to assemble the saddle

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.100
A rubber disc goes into each circle

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.090
Use four discs to assemble the saddle.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.760
The rubber dscs

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.750
come in three different sizes:

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.960
Half- inch

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.940
three-quarter inch

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.600
and one inch thick.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.090
Our discs are made of Sorbothane, which is a very dense patented material

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.400
Discs attach the saddle to the panels

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.050
We will look at the panels in a minute.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.760
 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.110
Because the discs are dense rubber,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940
The discs act as shock absorbers.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.910
Because the discs are on velcro, they can be adjusted almost infinitely

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.549
Which is how we get a custom fit for different horses.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.390
Now, let's talk about panels.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.289
The kidney shape of the panel is anatomically designed

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.519
To fit the area of the horse's back that is able to carry weight

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.349
The curved top of the panel follows the curve from the horse's wither to the back

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.169
The contoured bottom of the panel

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.299
Is designed to fit around the flare of the ribs..

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.779
The panels contain high tech foams so they also absorb shock

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.930
The panels are very flexible and soft.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.049
Let's look at an assembled saddle.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.849
Here is a ReactorPanel Dressage Saddle.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.509
The panels are attached underneath, and you can see the edges in front

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:51.249
You can also see the panels in the rear.

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.309
Taking a closer look,

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.119
You can see the discs sitting in their circles and holding the saddle together.

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.939
because the panels are independently
attached on the left in the right

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.909
The panels move totally independently from each other

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.179
They move out of the way of the shoulder

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.259
The discs allow the panels to compress and expand

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:15.409
The high tech materials allow the panels to flex and follow the back as it moves

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.069
Our horses are not like merry-go-round steeds rising up and down.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.959
Instead, our real horses have backs that swing back and forth as they move.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.979
The ReactorPanel saddle is uniquely designed

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.429
To follow the horse's moving back.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:31.879
Let's take a closer look at the rear of the saddle.

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.849
You'll see the discs - one on each side.

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.279
Check out the angle of the panels in the rear.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.650
Now watch what happens if you put the saddle on a horse with a broad flat back.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.609
The panel automatically flattens out to follow the back!

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.229
Of course if your horse has a steep angle from spine to ribs

00:03:54.229 --> 00:04:00.739
The panels will remain steep to fit the horse.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.719
So - let's talk weight distribution.,

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.639
The ReactorPanel system is uncommonly close contact.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.659
You can see this yourself

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.579
By lifting the flaps of the saddle, you can see

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.150
The saddle sits down right on top of the thin panel

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.189
So in the center, there is an additional weight distribution point

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.400
You are close right where you need it: right under your seat bones.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.590
The panels are thin and also compress under your weight

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.999
So you can easily feel the motion of the back

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.619
The attaching discs are well out of the way of your seat.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:33.290
The front discs work around the shoulder

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.160
The rear discs flex with the hip

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.949
And you sit in the middle with a great deal of stability.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.149
You are NOT up in the air suspended on the discs

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:42.159
But instead are as close to the motion of the horse as you are likely to get in a saddle.
