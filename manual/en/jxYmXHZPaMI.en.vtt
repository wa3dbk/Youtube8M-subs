00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.180
Welcome back to The Crochet Crowd and Red Heart.com, I'm your host Mikey.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.760
In today's tutorial, we are going to discover

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.240
the classic chunky cowl and this is a
brand new yarn available by Red Heart.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.780
It's called Grande and you will see this
in stores near you

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.680
coming soon. You can always go on
RedHeart.com and place your order.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.860
What we have here this is an ultra thick
yarn. This is one of the thickest yarns

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.510
that RedHeart.com

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.090
has ever developed and it is amazing. The
color that you see here

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.200
is called Nectar and this is orchid and there's other colors available on the market.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.660
If you are interested in this type of yarn. So let's go

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.660
tell you a little bit more about
this project. So for this particular tutorial

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920
are you gonna need a really big crochet
hook just like so its size Q.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.590
You're gonna need two balls of yarn to complete this.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.870
Now you can change anything that you
wish. Now this one here

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.960
was done as if it's flat piece just like so.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.140
But you have to do it like it's a scarf
and then you join it at the other end

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.379
but when you join it, you can either
join it with a slight twist so that's

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.000
like an Infinite cowl or you can join in
so it's flat just like you see.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.890
You know the choice is really up to you
and what you prefer. So let's begin...

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.260
there's only two different lines in this
whole project

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.869
and then once you get started you were
off to the races and you're gonna have

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.400
a classic chunky cowl and no time. Remember that the free pattern is

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.830
available in more information of this video.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
To begin I want to leave a little bit of an extra long tail so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.049
that you can use it weave in the end.

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.240
You know you're not going to get to that
that through a darning needle so don't

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.520
even think about it. Just use this because
you can use your fingers to weave it in

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.210
to hide it.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.610
Afterwards we're just going to create a
slip knot like we normally would

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
and just like this okay.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.579
Now let's insert your hook to begin
always going to do

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.900
is chain 12. So, remember that this never
counts as one.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.020
So one, two and three...

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.009
four, five and six.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.380
seven, eight, nine...

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.700
ten, eleven, and twelve.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.939
So this is the width of your particular cowl.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.549
It now says from the third
chain from hook

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.480
you want to double crochet. so let's
begin to count back so 1...

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.549
2... and 3...

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.029
what I want to do is turn that chain
over so we're gonna get the back side of it...

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.609
and so just go 1-2-3

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.840
Turn it over and you will see a backloop 
if you're ever teaching anyone how to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.859
crochet this is the perfect yarn to
do it with because you can just see

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:34.969
everything so clearly.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:39.109
Insert your hook back there and what you
insert in back there

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.579
the rest to this chain will complete
turnaround on you so that you'll see all

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.559
of the other loops

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.889
ready to go, and we want to double
crochet was like so.

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:53.199
Okay so now we're gonna double crochet. 
We're gonna wrap

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.569
K and so then the next one is just
sitting right there for you.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.279
Once you do that first one the whole chain
just turns over permanently

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.409
and you wanna double crochet yourself all
the way across.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.419
Look how bulky this is...

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.730
Compared to the size my hand people
are going to love this stuff.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.919
There's been a demand for its and
Red Heart are excited to launch it as well.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.209
Please double crochet yourself in the
chain all way across and I will show you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.849
what to do.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.949
When you get to the other side we're
just gonna turn our work.

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.599
We want to Ch 2. So we're gonna
go one

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.859
and two and we want to come into the same
stitch

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.019
right into the bottom about and we're gonna
double crochet the first one.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.589
we're then

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.959
going to double crochet the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.799
remainder of the stitches across. All
this particular project is just

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.650
straight double crochet back and forth.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.449
You know you can experiment
with the other stitches if you want to.

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.510
Just to try it out and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.979
you can mix and match. Be aware that
anytime to any kind of alteration on any of the stitches

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:53.749
it is you.

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.900
You are gonna try will alter the pattern

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.369
yarn usage as far as the amount yarn.
If you have extra yarn and you feel confident

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.839
in your abilities some

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:07.239
you can actually give this a try you can
also customize your a particular

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.269
of it for you so if you don't need as
big.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.779
You can always go a little tighter if
you want to makes it really kinda fun

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.639
and fabulous.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.120
Now the secret answer is that there is
10

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.599
double crochets going all the way across
so we make sure we come in

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.409
to that very last one here, just like so.

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.439
So when I come back, remember that
chaining a 2 right here.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.080
We don't count that so it's just one, two and three.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.409
4,5, 6,7, 8, 9 and 10.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.569
So when you get to the other side you
should pay attention that this chaining

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.159
up two

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.720
before you started in the first one you
don't worry about it because you should

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.470
be able to count

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.780
and just like the over here the chaining
too and the double crochet

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.889
into the same spot you have 1, 2, 3,4,5,
6,7,8,9, and 10.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.370
Just keep your stuff in groups of ten and you are good to go.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.090
Each and every time so we just continue
to chain again and we do the same thing

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.229
so we go.

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.409
one... two...

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.659
and then the same one with a double crochet

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.199
and crochet ourselves all the way across
so we continue to do that back in forth

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.669
get the desired length that you need.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.310
Once you get the length that you need
this and were attached to this end.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.819
Just use a piece of string

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.550
and fix it together. You can affix it
together so that it's flat or you can

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.930
add a slight twist to it so it
apparently have an Infiniti

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.889
cowl. It's up to you the creativity is
really in your hands at this point... you

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:32.939
are the artist!

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:36.879
Explore and experiment and you might find
something really interesting.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.030
So until next time, I'm Mikey on behalf of TheCrochetCrowd.com and Red Heart.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.650
 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.710
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.210
See Ya!
