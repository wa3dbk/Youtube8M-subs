00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.260
Molag Bal is arguably the single most feared
figure in the world of Tamriel, a Daedric

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.660
Prince dedicated to the domination and enslavement
of mortals, he has served as a chilling antagonist

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.199
in multiple Elder Scrolls games. You’ve
probably faced off against him or done his

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.680
bidding at one point or another, but you may
not know about the history that inspired the

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.900
character. Many think that the name “Molag
Bal” is a reference to two separate ancient

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.029
gods, Moloch and Ba’al, a pair of deities
worshiped by the Canaanites and a few other

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.370
North African cultures. Moloch was a deity
that inspired fear, and his worshipers were

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.399
even known to sacrifice humans in his name.
Likewise in the Elder Scrolls universe pure-blooded

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.969
female vampires are sacrificed to Molag Bal
in the hopes that they will become Daughters

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
of Coldharbour. The visual inspiration Bethesda
might have taken from Moloch is most readily

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.010
seen in the Daedric Prince’s horns and gorgeous
mouth. The other ancient god, Ba’al, is

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.850
one of the most well-known gods, found in
the Bible and the Koran. In fact, gods named

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.949
“Ba’al” are found throughout gaming,
because the word itself means “lord or master”

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.379
in Hebrew.
The next Daedric Prince we’re going to talk

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.610
about wasn’t directly inspired by religion
at all. Ladies and gentlemen, it should be

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.060
painfully obvious by now that the horror author
H.P. Lovecraft has a strong influence on gaming

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.149
as a whole. From the beginning it was common
knowledge that the Daedric Prince of Knowledge,

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.490
was clearly designed with Lovecraftian gods
in mind. Let’s dig a little deeper though

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.229
and ask ourselves which Lovecraftian god he
resembles most. In Daggerfall and Oblivion,

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.440
Hermaeus Mora was sporting an “amorphous
blob” type look, with tentacles at his base

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.300
and crab-like appendages for his arms. This
look most closely fits the portrayal of the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.080
deity Nyarlathotep and it’s likely that’s
where Bethesda drew their inspiration. However,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.310
in Skyrim’s Dragonborn DLC Hermaeus Mora
leaves his old look behind. Now he appears

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.319
uncannily similar to Cyäegha, an ancient
god that first appeared in “Darkness, My

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.890
Name Is”, a 1976 short story set in the
Lovecraft mythology. That’s not all. Hermaeus

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.300
Mora’s book of ancient knowledge, the Oghma
Infinium is a reference to Lovecraft’s Necronomicon

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.810
but you probably already knew that. Both books
contain forbidden knowledge and appear to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.989
be bound by flesh. The idea that obtaining
forbidden knowledge will drive men mad is

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.959
a concept used many times by H.P. Mortals
who visit the Daedric realm of Apocrypha are

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.859
quickly driven mad as their minds are devoured
by the arcane secrets contained within.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.560
It’s hard to find a video game series with
more writing to dig into than the Elder Scrolls.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.400
Countless hours can be spent browsing the
many bookshelves of Tamriel, taking in everything

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.099
from political treaties to trashy Argonian
romance. So it comes as no surprise that with

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.859
so many pages to fill, the development team
at Bethesda has often looked to real-world

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.230
literature for inspiration. Perhaps the most
intriguing literary reference in Morrowind

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.269
is found in the Sea of Ghosts, where you may
come across a bottle containing a strange,

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.590
mysterious note that reads like a tragic short
story. This is thought to be a reference to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.400
the 1833 Edgar Allan Poe tale “MS. Found
in a Bottle”. In the story, a man writes

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.209
an equally tragic story about his life and
puts the note into a glass bottle, before

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.069
casting it into the sea and succumbing to
his fate aboard a sinking ship. Little did

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.579
Edgar Allan Poe know that his narrator’s
bottle may have just ended up floating the

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.659
waters of Tamriel.
The Black Hand, who you will probably know

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.260
as the governing council of The Dark Brotherhood,
isn’t the only group of assassins to be

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.489
known by that name. In fact, in early 1911,
a secret military group in the Serbian army

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.819
called the Unification of Death was founded
and quickly became known as “The Black Hand”.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.049
The group was rightfully feared by even the
most powerful governments over their short

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.689
time active and is most well-known for its
role in the assassination of Archduke Franz

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.040
Ferdinand, who a member of the group murdered
in 1914, igniting the spark that eventually

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.329
led to the First World War. Similarly the
Dark Brotherhood has a habit of killing high-profile

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.029
rulers. The real-world Black Hand didn’t
end up lasting nearly as long as The Dark

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:50.019
Brotherhood though. The Serbian Prime Minister
at the time, Nikola Pasic, decided to turn

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.389
against them, leading to most of The Black
Hand leadership meeting their end in front

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.180
of a firing squad in 1917. Mirroring this,
the Black Hand turns against some its own

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.980
members in Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, leading
them to near-extinction. Rest in peace Lucien

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.820
Lachance. We’ll miss you.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.560
You thought you knew The Elder Scrolls, but

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.090
hopefully you’ve learned just a thing or
two more. Do you know of any other historical

or literary references we didn't cover here?
