00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.720
At the University of Tennessee we’re all
about big ideas.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.790
And our big ideas are making a big difference
for our students

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.050
We’ve worked hard to make sure more Freshmen
make it into their sophomore year.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.860
No freshmen comes in thinking they aren’t
going to make it to senior year.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.550
All of us sign up for classes in the fall
thinking we’re going to make it to graduation.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.539
So how did we do this, here are some of our
big ideas.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.099
It starts with an expectation that students
graduate in four years.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.640
Requiring students to pay for 15 hours has
translated into an average course load of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.480
15.1 hours

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.800
I remember I had my first advisor meeting
and she laid out the course plan and I could

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.140
see it and tell, I could get it all done in
four years and I wouldn’t have to take 20

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.399
hours a semester.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.289
Good advising, early in a student’s college
career is essential for success and we’ve

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.640
increased our advising staff by 75%.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.960
Requiring students to take all those credits
every semester means we need to make sure

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.220
they’re available and we’ve done that.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.000
And to make getting into those classes even
easier, we had another big idea; One Stop

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.720
- Express Student Services

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.159
One Stop combines all the different offices
of registration, payment and financial aid

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.490
and puts it in one location, it’s in the
library in the middle of campus.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.780
And once they sign up, our our new uTrack
system makes sure students are on the right

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.729
path toward graduation.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.210
But retention is about more than the classroom;
it’s also about the quality of life on campus

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.740
Right now, there’s One Billion dollars worth
of construction under way including academic

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.420
buildings, a new student union and new residence
halls.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.760
I was just telling my brother--he’s about
to be a senior in high school--if you just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.590
come to UT, in the next couple years it’s
going to be beautiful.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.150
And you’re going to be seeing some of the
best things that UT has had in a while.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.579
I am a little jealous.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.889
I wish that it would be finished by 2016,
but I think it will all be worthwhile for

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.811
my cousins, for my younger friends; when I
come back as an alumni, I will enjoy it much,

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:24.811
much more.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:28.760
And... hopefully one day when I bring my kids
here, they’ll appreciate all the construction

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670
that happened right now.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.730
Students really care about the quality of
the spaces where they work, study, live and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.739
play.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.120
So how has all of this impacted our graduation
rate.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.040
It’s a good story; graduation rates are
increasing at a steady pace.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.129
Our four-year rate has increased 12% in 7
years and our six-year graduation rate has

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.449
increased 9%

00:02:54.449 --> 00:03:00.139
Progress in all of these metrics is important
as we work to become a top tier public research

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.409
university.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.349
But it’s not the most important part of
our journey.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.269
Our big ideas are really about investing in
our students’ success and enhancing the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.059
student experience at the University of Tennessee.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.930
Student: It just made sense perfectly, and
that was sort of the attitude I came in with,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.049
I wasn’t entirely sure, just because, like
I said, all my friends were going elsewhere,

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:30.579
but looking back now, I don’t think I would
have succeeded anywhere as well as I have

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.199
here.
