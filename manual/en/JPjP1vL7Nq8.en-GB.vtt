00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.840
Ljord
The country of snow,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.099
ice and sheer cold.
I've left the sea behind...

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:31.339
To return to my village, Riverwalt
And what I found there, was unexpected..

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.940
But ever since I found the stranded ship at
Ljord's coast..

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:45.670
I've been thinking about the good old days
when I lived at sea..

00:00:45.670 --> 00:01:01.519
Will I ever return? To a ship and 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.519
to the sea?

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.120
Like every human being I'm weak..
Even in Riverwalt I tried to build a boat..

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.960
Which is usual in the middle of a forest..
The village was in ruins when I arrived..

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.310
I managed to repair it quite well..
Was able to build a nice home for myself..

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.340
And repaired some more houses..
But it didn't matter..

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.060
The inhabitants of Riverwalt, must really
have upset the Gods..

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.140
Because even when the village was almost restored,
it was destroyed once more..

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.489
The weather started to get worse and worse..
And a blizzard destroyed the village again..

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.410
I don't know why..
Though I am determined to solve this riddle..

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.140
What did they do?
What contains the tombe?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:00.470
The village has been destroyed, so I don't
know how much longer I will stay..

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:09.390
Maybe I'll take my stuff and I'll go looking
for other Ljords..

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.319
But I still have a task..
My father discovered something..

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.890
And left it behind for me..
I've come far..

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:34.550
But I do not want to disappoint my father.
So I will go on, until I find out what he

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.550
discovered..

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.739
It all started at the burial place..
And that is where it ended..

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.760
After having solved riddle after riddle, I
returned to the burial..

00:02:48.760 --> 00:03:02.520
And there we found the door to a tombe..
Now I need a diamond pickaxe to find out what

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:12.870
lies hidden behind that door..

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.909
I have left Riverwalt and started with digging
right away..

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:24.439
And I have dug out a entire mine..
In search of diamond in caves..

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.720
I needed a new home..
And there was only one place I could think

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.220
of..
I left and moved into the Dragonfort..

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.260
I have restored it to its former glory..
It's livable once more.. Not so dangerous

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.500
anymore..
Off course it is way to big for me alone..

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.180
But it's temporary..
One day I will go looking for Ljords of other

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.000
tribes..
But for now I remain here..

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.549
Looking for diamond..
The smith stands ready so that as soon as

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.989
I get those diamonds..
I can make a pickaxe..

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.540
The flags and banners hang again..
Dragonfort is a honourable fort once more!

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:23.730
I made a room in one of the towers..
And it will have to do for now..

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.010
To train my battle skills I have laid out
shooting practice and dummies to battle..

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.830
The Dragonfort has been restored to its former
glory..

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.720
Now it's my turn..

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.890
My name is Etholdir
Lord of the Dragonfort

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.690
And this is my story..
