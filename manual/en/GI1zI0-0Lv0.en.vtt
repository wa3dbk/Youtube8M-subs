00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.650
Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain is wrapped
in lore, easter eggs, concepts, and many interesting

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.700
facts.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.559
It's amazing to see some of the ideas that
were involved in creating the characters and

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.600
other ideas that were scrapped altogether.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Let's take a look at 12 awesome metal gear
facts that you should know about in the Phantom

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.340
Pain and Ground Zeroes.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.390
Quiet's Original Design
Quiet, the sniper deprived of her Words, is

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.570
one of the most complex characters that Kojima
Productions has created.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.480
And there's many layers to her backstory hidden
within Phantom Pain.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.460
But what most players don't know is that her
original concept art had her looking a lot

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.150
like Paz in a bikini.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.010
Her revealing appearance is a key part of
her character, but the designers insisted

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.000
that they carefully chose how to develop her
character.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.330
And of course her current likeness is based
off of her voice and motion capture actress,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.440
Stefanie Joosten.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:06.560
Drawing heavily from her look, her body language,
and facial expressions to bring Quiet to life.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:16.830
80s Filter
One of the original ideas scraped for Phantom

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
Pain was to have an 80s filter to bring players
closer to the feel of the time that the game

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.420
takes place.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.110
It was inspired by the 2013 film Rush due
to the unique look that this movie had.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.800
But the idea was scrapped and forgotten because
the effect was too intensive to render all

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.840
the time on consoles.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.700
PSP Version
Ground Zeroes is known primarily for being

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.381
a next gen PS4 and Xbox One game with its
advanced fox engine, huge open world, and

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.780
detailed graphics.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.360
But Ground Zeroes was originally slated for
release on PSP alongside PS3 much earlier

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.951
than its 2013 release date.

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:56.571
The team pushed it back so that it could be
within the launch window of the new PS4 and

00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:57.950
Xbox One consoles.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.270
Skull Face Origins
Skull Face is the heavily scarred commander

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.190
of the military group XOF during the 1970s.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.439
Who would also become a commander of the Parasite
Unit in the 80s.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:13.540
He suffered extensive injuries in his youth
which caused his characteristic facial scars,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.419
burns, and discolorations.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.269
Skull Face's original name was supposed to
be Scarface.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.299
And he was also meant to appear on the box
art for Ground Zeroes, but he was removed

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.669
because Kojima thought that it would be too
creepy.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.410
Moby Dick References
Kojima likes to keep a lot of mystery in his

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.230
lore and let the fans interpret the games.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.169
But he even extends his storytelling to the
press releases and information surrounding

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.169
the game.

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:43.860
The demo Hideo Kojima showed at GDC 2013 for
The Phantom Pain starts with the words, "Okay

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.579
Ahab, time to go."

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:55.029
A bandaged man then turns and runs to Snake,
saying, "You can call me Ishmael."

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.260
Snake is also revealed to have a prosthetic
left arm and in the actual trailer for the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.430
game you can see a large flaming whale.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.909
These are all allusions to the novel Moby
Dick.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.769
The main character in Moby Dick is named Captain
Ahab, the first words in the book are "You

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.650
can call me Ishmael", and Ahab has a wooden
leg and is hunting the whale that took it.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.989
The trailer claimed that the game was being
developed by a Swedish company called Moby

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.079
Dick Studio.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.989
Despite this, numerous clues suggested that
the trailer was actually created by Kojima

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.459
Productions to promote a new game in the�Metal
Gear�series.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.689
This led to Kojima being questioned about
The Phantom Pain.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.290
When asked about it, he laughed and said that
while he saw the resemblance between Ground

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.449
Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, it was being
developed by Moby Dick Studio and that he

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.370
had nothing to do with it as he was working
on the former.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.230
Obviously Kojima just knows how to generate
media buzz and get fans riled up looking for

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.230
answers.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.349
Kojima Cameo
In the side op Intel Operative Rescue, the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.839
player has to help an agent get into the helicopter.

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:26.690
In the end cutscene, he is revealed as the
creator of the Metal Gear series, Hideo Kojima.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.290
After the mission, he'll be in the helicopter
in the main menu and waiting a while on the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.880
mission select screen will make him spin the
list of missions.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.720
David Bowie and 1984 References
There are many references to Kojima's favorite

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.920
influences wrapped into Phantom Pain.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.780
Diamong Dogs is a private military company
led by Big Boss during the 1980s.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.840
It was created as a result of the devastation
of the Militaires Sans Fronti�res as well

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.620
as the attack on Mother Base.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.450
The name stems from the group's profession
as "dogs of war," who were willing to carry

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.350
out unsavory jobs for clients, while at the
same time maintaining pride in their work.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.870
But it's also a reference to David Bowie's
1974 song and album 'Diamond Dogs' which was

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.260
a musical adaption of George Orwell's famous
book '1984'.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.530
Hideo Kojima is a known David Bowie fan and
in the Metal Gear Solid 5 trailer, it is stated

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.200
that Big Boss has been in a coma for 9 years;
'Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker' - which precedes

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.510
the events of MGS5 - was set in November 1974,
placing MGS5 in late 1983 or more probably

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.570
1984, the year of George Orwell's novel, with
Big Boss shown to be part of a new squad known

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.800
as 'Diamond Dogs', a direct reference to the
album.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.090
Paz Death
In Ground Zeroes, Paz was originally supposed

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.970
to be�Dead All Along, and Skull Face was
going to�place her corpse in front of Chico

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.710
in a way that he couldn't look away from it.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.620
Foxdie Easter Egg
During the Deja Vu extra mission in the�PlayStation

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.550
4�release of Ground Zeroes, interacting
with the prisoners in Chico and Paz's cells

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.520
will cause both prisoners to die from Foxdie.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.720
After both prisoners are dead, the Fox Engine
will appear to be under attack, and will then

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.210
correct itself moments later.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:22.400
Ground Zeroes &amp; Phantom Pain One Game
It was originally intended for Ground Zeroes

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.880
and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain�to
be a single game, but the game's designer,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.230
Hideo Kojima, wanted people to experience
the game near the launch of the PlayStation

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.850
4 and Xbox One.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.110
And thus Ground Zeroes was created as a separate
prologue and ultimately an early demonstration

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.300
of the Fox engine.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.090
Phantom Pain Reference in Metal Gear 2
In the 2006 version of "Metal Gear 2: SOLID

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.310
SNAKE" they changed the portraits in the "codec
calls" with Yoji Shikawa's artwork, and they

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.700
also added a new line in Gray Fox's speech
after you defeat him:

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.080
"They had cut off my ears and my nose, I looked
terrible"

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.060
These new words fit perfectly with Ishmael's
bandaged face in Metal Gear Solid 5.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.680
Which means they had the Phantom Pain plot
developing even back in 2006.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.120
Signature Style
Several hallmarks of the other games were

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.340
removed in order to make it more realistic
and serious, such as Ration-based healing.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.450
Originally, Kojima thought about removing
the trademark exclamation point, in favor

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.600
of realistic expression from the enemy.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.510
Ironically, it seems that the grandfather
clause�prevailed.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.030
What is the grandfather clause?

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.390
It's when a character uses a trope which may
be clich� or even dead at this point, but

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.970
is kept in because it's tied into the character's
legacy.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.260
