00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.660
Ahh Oregon… a state known for dense forests,
livable cities and the occasional sighting

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.630
of bigfoot –Well, there’s something else
happening in Oregon lately.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.549
People are building
ADUs – and lots of them.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.500
Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs, are additional
separate living units on single family

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.490
lots that most people rent out for extra income.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.810
For example, Joe and Amy live in a
beautiful old house in Portland, which has

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.910
supported their many hobbies.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.890
When kids
entered the picture, they remodeled their

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.071
upstairs, added a bathroom, and retired some
of

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.400
their more exotic hobbies, like beekeeping.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.210
Joe and Amy’s lives and priorities had changed.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.930
They wanted to start a fund for their
kid’s college, start saving for retirement

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.190
and both had aging parents they wanted to
be

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760
close to (but not too close).

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.060
A friend suggested they build a rental unit
on their property

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.600
for extra cash.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.560
Joe and Amy were intrigued and visited accessorydwellings.org
where

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.670
they read all about how other home owners
had developed and rented ADUs, on their

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.670
property.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.809
They were motivated!

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.350
He could build a legal ADU in his basement,
attic, garage, above his garage, or as a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.280
freestanding cottage in the backyard.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.280
Even better, the City of Portland is waiving
development impact fees for ADU projects until

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.450
July 2016.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.270
That can equate to a savings
of over $11,000!

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.270
That’s huge!

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.630
Joe and Amy knew this was the perfect way
to invest and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.409
have the flexibility to house one of their
parents in the future.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.900
They decided to convert
the garage.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.290
After construction was complete, the ADU rented
for $850 per month, and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.740
provided a quick return on their investment.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.890
Sure enough, six years later, after the construction
cost had been recouped through rental

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.580
income, Joe’s mother moved into the unit.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.350
Joe and Amy’s neighbor, Rosa, had witnessed
how useful the ADU was over the years

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.290
and visited Accessorydwellings.org to see
if she could benefit from building one as

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.290
well.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.241
Rosa was about to retire and was looking for
a way to reduce her living expenses so she

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.670
could travel more with her dog Baxter.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.319
She worked with an architect to make the best
use of her space, and chose a detached

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.459
backyard ADU designed just for her.

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.359
She built it small because she knew that small
homes are less expensive to build and maintain,

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:19.969
use very little energy, and can be quite
charming.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.610
Rosa moved into her new ADU and rented out
her main house.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.719
The rental
income not only covered the cost of her mortgage,

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.700
but also began to offset the cost of her
ADU construction.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.849
When Rosa’s cousin Daryl in Eugene heard
about this, he decided to build one himself.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.029
Oh, Daryl – he’s a bit obsessed with what
we’ll call “nature photography”.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.550
Since he
spends a good deal of time away in the woods,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.660
he wanted to supplement his income by
renting out his basement.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.390
Daryl is a real “Do-it-yourselfer” and
tackled most of the basement remodel on his

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.390
own.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.390
Nice job Daryl!

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.419
There are so many creative ways to integrate
an ADU into your property to provide

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.790
flexibility and a long-term revenue stream.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.779
Which is right for you?

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.189
Take the first step and visit accessorydwellings.org
and your local permitting office for

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:04.419
