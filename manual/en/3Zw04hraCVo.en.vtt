00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.700
How do we know what "cat" means?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.600
Is it as simple as pointing at the animals we call cat, and then saying the word?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.000
20th century philosopher, 
Jacques Derrida, would say no.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.800
The word "cat" is not simply a reference to the furry, four legged creature that meows

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.000
and is indifferent to your existence.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
In other words, we don't get the meaning of "cats" so easily.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Language is quite a bit more complicated

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.600
Thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle all ground thinking into belief that there is an objective truth

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000
that can be apprehended through philosophy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.700
They understood philosophy as a 
sort of journey where, through practice,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.300
the truth and falsity of our claims 
are eventually revealed.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.300
For Derrida, however, privilege in reason as the way to achieve objective truth is itself problematic.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.600
Deconstruction is a way of showing that our assumptions about language and objectivity are flawed.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
There is no reference point outside of text.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.300
No way to think outside of language.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.600
No correct and true word for actions or object.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.500
There is no objective truth. There is no significance in the words themselves.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Calling a jump kick a snarflag, a punch a flipflam,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.000
a guy abobo, or a cat znutigunrgk jax
 is just as good as any other word.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.020
In his loquacious work of grammatology,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.000
Derrida famously asserts that 
there is nothing outside of the text.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.500
What he means is that we come to understand everything about the world through language.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
And as such, it is inescapable.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.200
The way that we come to know language isn't from an encounter with the true essence of a term,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.600
but rather the meaning is 
created in relation to other words,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.000
or what Derrida calls diffÃ¨rance.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
For example, we know what cat means because we understand the idea of feline, domestic, animal, and pet.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.620
We understand pet as not feral, as a friend.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.780
We understand friend as not an enemy. We comprehend enemy as an opposing force.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.300
We know that by force, in this instance, we don't mean the multiplication of mass and acceleration,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.040
but rather an entity or person, and we comprehend person as not an animal, as not a...

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.460
as not a cat.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.280
Each concept points to another 
concept we define ad infinitum,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
the meaning of a term turtles all the way down.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Moreover, all text is unreliable. There is no single or objective meaning of words.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.020
Most text contains conflicting narratives that intersect and contradict.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.000
Deconstruction points out these contradictions.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And that is how deconstruction is both construction and destruction, hense the word play.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.460
But when does deconstruction end?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.580
Really, isn't a cat just a cat?
