00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.149
Hi, I'm Timothy Scott

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.879
the author of Invasive Plant Medicine 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.239
and I'm here to talk about

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.989
my favorite plant here - Japanese Knotweed

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:19.679
This is really my favorite plant 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:27.019
and it's the plant that instigated this whole journey into
writing a book

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.890
and I got to know Japanese Knotweed many years ago

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.190
when I first started treating lyme disease

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.370
and learned from Stephen Buhner that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.210
that this was the most important herb

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.120
to use in the treatment of lyme disease

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.440
Since then I've learned many things about the plant -  

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.500
not only how it's helping humans heal from disease

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.310
but also how it helps rehabilitate lands

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.250
where it lives and helps clean the environment
for us

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.769
and helps protect these areas that have been 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.030
disturbed by human development and pollution 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.789
So it's a very important plant and there's a
good reason why it grows here

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:10.210
and flourishes where it does

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.680
It's a warrior plant and it has no fear of shovel or poison

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.440
or extreme environments - you can see it growing in basically

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.850
any environment throughout the United States

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.630
and various soil compositions, 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.960
different elevations

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.700
Polygonum cuspidatum is the Latin name for it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.869
Studies in England have found that the plant is primarily a female plant

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:51.540
and the Japanese Knotweed Alliance has called Japanese Knotweed the largest female in biomass terms  

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.400
and with this 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.400
it does not spread so much by seeds - it spreads more by roots and fragments of roots

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.590
and that's what we see here mostly in America

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.490
These plants spread mostly by root fragments

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.480
Any little piece of the root that is

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.539
broken free from the plant can set up whole colonies by themselves

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:23.829
What most likely happened here is that down the river a ways

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.059
just a little bit broke off and over time they've been able -

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.790
The roots have spread throughout the land and into this area

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.199
and have created huge stands of this plant

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:39.619
And if you take a look over here you can also see

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.959
that some folks have tried to really...

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.289
tried to get rid of this plant 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:51.679
And in fact this is the second cutting they've done this year and it's still coming back in - 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.369
and really, the cuttings don't do much to keep it in check -

00:02:55.369 --> 00:03:01.459
it just cuts them back and it still flourishes here

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:14.179
The root is where we find the medicine

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.409
I learned about six years ago from Stephen Buhner -

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.439
when he was writing the book "Healing Lyme" 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.199
that Japanese Knotweed was the most important herb
in treating lyme disease

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.469
and since that time I -

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:36.569
in my herbal practice it has been the
mainstay herb that I've been using 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.169
and with really great success with folks

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:52.239
Now the plant has been used for thousands of years in far east medicine

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.109
and is only now being sought after in the west for herbal medicine -

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.889
and mainly with the work that Buhner has done with lyme disease

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.239
The roundabout way we've learned more and more about
Knotweed

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.179
is through the compounds that are found within the root 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:15.279
The most notable compound in Japanese Knotweed root is resveratrol -

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:22.290
resveratrol is an antioxidant that gained notoriety with the "French paradox" -

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.250
the study that found resveratrol to be
the active component in preventing heart disease 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.249
and other degenerative diseases

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:37.080
and that was through looking at the diet of Europeans who ate

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.419
a rich, fatty diet, with the all-important red wine

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.939
And in that red wine was found resveratrol

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.290
and so that was the component that they found that was

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.069
helping prevent heart disease and other degenerative diseases

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.969
Not only does Knotweed have resveratrol, but it has many other compounds in it

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.319
that address various aspects of the body and healing

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:11.279
The most important piece of Knotweed for medicine is the root

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:19.889
and what I have done is harvest the root and cut it into pieces and dry it

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.639
and then further powder that and put it into capsules

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.309
That has been the easiest way for me to provide that for folks

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.449
Some people do make tinctures out of it -

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.810
though Buhner does not recommend that in the treatment of lyme disease - 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.389
so I haven't pursued that much

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:48.550
And you can always use it in it's raw form and make teas and
decoctions out of it

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.139
by taking some of the roots, you know...

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.620
a few ounces at a time and adding that to a pot of water and boiling for a good twenty 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.100
or thirty minutes to extract these compounds from it

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.500
Another great potential for Japanese Knotweed

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.710
is it being a potential source for biomass for electricity and energy needs

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.199
and as you can see here grows prolifically

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.949
and often grows right along roadsides so it's easy to harvest

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.910
It grows inches a day and the potential of harvesting a few times a year is there

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.129
With simple alterations in equipment that's available already
0:06:33.129,06:38.499
these plants could be harvested and made use of for our energy needs -

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:42.930
and that is another potential for communities with this plant
