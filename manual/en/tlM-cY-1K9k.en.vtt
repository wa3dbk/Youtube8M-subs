00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with the first episode

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.700
of 33303 or Less where I go over three apps
that cost under $3 in

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.009
three minutes.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.550
To start we have Pocket Planes.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.290
In the game you run
a fleet of planes through various airports

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.519
around the world.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820
The
first thing that jumped out at me is the style.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.990
The graphics are
all pixel based and it’s easy to work out

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.590
what you’re supposed to do.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.630
It even goes as far as the sounds which are
simple yet clearly let

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.099
you know what is going on without needing
to look.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.080
The objective is to become the ruler of the
skies by flying your planes

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.590
around the world and purchasing and upgrading
your planes and airports.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.480
As a free to play game you can purchase more
in-game bucks to make it

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.470
faster to progress but just like Jetpack Joyride
spending money is entirely

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.710
optional and you’ll be able to fully enjoy
the game for free.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.210
All flights
take a few minutes to get to their destinations

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.070
so you’ll be able to manage
other things while waiting or just keep an

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.920
eye on your push notifications
to see when they land.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.800
While the game is a bit slow at first it picks
up

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860
after a bit and is really quite fun.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.600
For free in the App Store it’s
definitely worth a download.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.080
Next we have Project 83113, also known as
Project Belle.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.110
I picked this one up and suddenly an hour
of my life

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.939
disappeared before I could set it down.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840
There are a lot of great things
about this, not the least of which are the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.869
awesome cel shaded graphics.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.090
Belle is a platformer with a heavy emphasis
on combat which combined

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.030
with the super fast pace makes an awesome
combo.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.560
The story is that
Project Belle was created to take back the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.079
world from the machines and
it’s told briefly between worlds with comic-like

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.360
cut scenes.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.149
You can swipe
to boost forward, up or down as well as control

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.229
where Belle goes.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440
For the
most part you have to focus on getting through

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.530
the level and avoiding
enemies and hazards while Belle automatically

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.530
shoots.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.359
If it’s getting tough
you can use a powerful attack to clear everything

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.140
out at the temporary cost
of your health which makes it a bit strategic.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.079
If you kill enemies you get
that health back but if you miss then you

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.549
can quickly die.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.539
Project Belle is
one of the most fun games I’ve played in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.509
quite a while and I highly recommend
giving it a shot for $0.99.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.689
Lastly but definitely not least we have Ballistic
SE.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.510
There are lots of great twin stick shooters
in the App Store but Ballistic

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.030
is my favorite for a few reasons.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.149
There are two modes, waves and challenges.

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.391
Waves is a longer game that throws wave after
wave of enemies at you and as

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:09.170
you progress you unlock upgrades such as shooting
faster and making your shots

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.780
attract to the other orbs.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.950
Challenges have you try and survive for two
minutes

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.600
with 10 upgrades.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.350
As you can see the graphics are nothing short
of fantastic

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.560
and better yet the entire game is as responsive
as it gets.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.120
No matter how much
stuff is on screen the game never seems to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
miss a beat.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.670
Best of all the
controls are top notch which is usually my

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.890
biggest problem with twin stick
shooters on touchscreens.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.940
If you enjoy a quick run through a twin stick
shooter

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.220
I highly recommend Ballistic SE.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.000
As of recording this video the app is free
however even for its normal $1.99 price it’s

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.010
worth picking up!

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.960
That’s it for
this episode of 33303 or Less!

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.120
If you guys enjoyed and want to see more
