Hello and welcome to WPBeginner.com. Today,
you'll learn what a

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.980
WordPress XML sitemap is and how to create one.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.610
A sitemap is just a list of pages on a website
and an XML sitemap is a way for website owners

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.240
to tell search engines about all the pages
that exist on their website.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.570
This helps search engines crawl your site
and makes surelinks that are important are

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.930
shared it also shares how frequently you update your website.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.050
So why would you need one?
Well, from an SEO standpoint, it tells the search

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.090
engines about all the pages that are available
on your site. This should help get your pages

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.300
indexed properly.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.960
Also for new sites and blogs, this is helpful because
you don't have too many backlinks to begin

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.900
with so it's harder for search engines to
find all the posts and a sitemap

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.360
tells the search engines what you have so
it knows what to crawl.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.239
There are several different ways to create a sitemap,
but we'll show you how to do it using Yoast's

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.370
WordPress SEO plugin.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.070
Just install and activate the plugin and then
Under the SEO area click XML sitemaps.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.980
Enable the Check this box to enable XML sitemap
functionality.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.580
Click save settings. And now you should be
able to view your site map by the XML sitemap button.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550
Next thing you want to do is you want to go
to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.670
Google webmaster tools to add the
map to your site.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.790
So I'm in Google Webmaster and I've added a site to Google. I've verified ownership of the site,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.690
and I'm going to go and add sitemap.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.819
I can enter the URL of the sitemap and click submit.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.750
Once added, it will show pending at first,
but then you'll be able to see some stats

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.140
about your site. For instance how many links it
found and how many pages have been indexed.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.410
As time goes on, you'll see more and more
useful information in your Google webmaster

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.580
tools about your site.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.729
