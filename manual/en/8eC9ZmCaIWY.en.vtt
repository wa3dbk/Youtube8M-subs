00:05
COMM: An experiment to deter grizzlies form

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.170
stealing hunter's kills hadn't reckoned on
this individual being smarter than the average

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.220
bear.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.820
00:24
COMM: Wildlife biologist Heather Reich has

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.790
studied bears in the wild for more than a
decade, to better understand how to protect

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.890
them.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
00:33
HEATHER: We have a car battery hooked up to

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.659
a fence charger, and that fence charger is
then actually providing a jolt of electricity

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.153
to this deer that we have hanging to see if
we can't help hunters who are hanging out

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:50.480
in the back country that usually have their
kill stolen by a bear.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.320
So the meat is actually carrying an entire
current of electricity.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.460
We just sat back and waited to see what would
happen when the bear did finally come in.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.400
00:56
COMM: The technique is called aversive conditioning

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.640
and a small electric shock is just enough
to warn off the bear but not enough to do

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.640
it any harm.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.460
01:03
HEATHER: After two weeks of waiting a bear

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.860
finally did come in.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.010
He's a young male grizzly that we actually
know in the area um and you can see he comes

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.750
in and he does bite on the deer and he gets
a jolt and we thought well that's great.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.320
Y'know we've proved that it's effective.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950
01:20
HEATHER: What we didn't anticipate was that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.080
that bear was there for fourteen hours.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.600
Often just staring at the deer hanging there
trying to figure out how to get it without

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.190
getting shocked.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.830
The next morning, he can hear the clicking
of the energiser on the deer.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.630
And he decided that he needs to change the
environment a little but and you can see him

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.630
just moving around.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.909
He doesn't know what he's doing, he just knows
maybe if he changes something it'll make the

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.120
shock go away.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100
He pulled the car battery off of the charger
which completely obviously killed the shock

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.520
and it was within ninety seconds of him pulling
that car battery off and hearing the clicking

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.679
stop that he went in and for all he was worth
pulled that deer down and the meat pole swung

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.920
into the energiser and destroyed that and
he got his deer.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.280
02:09
HEATHER: Outsmarted us again, and when we

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.900
came onto that site all we see is that the
deer is gone, the place is a mess, the energiser

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.599
is in pieces on the ground and we figured
the bear just got so mad that he tore the

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.599
site apart.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.819
It wasn't until we saw the video that we actually
saw how that all happened.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.010
And it wasn't even the bear that destroyed
the energised it was just a by-product.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.529
02:32
COMM: Despite the initial failure of the experiment

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.329
and her professional photographer husband
Derek, a valuable insight into the bear's

00:02:42.329 --> 00:03:06.540
tenacity and ingenuity.
