00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
hi guys it's Rafaela okay so today it's

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.010
Friday and I promised you a video every

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.099
Friday I also promised you that the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.040
audio lighting makeup etc would not be

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.980
fantastic and as you can see I am a

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.529
person of my word so I'm shooting in

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
what is left of our office here in the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
southeast as we phase this out and I

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.170
wanted to talk to you today about some

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.109
of the things that we discovered last

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
week as we were originally evaluating

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.759
which channel would be a best would be

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
the best fit for us so what do I mean

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.620
when I say which channels what I mean is

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
the original you know when you go to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.829
amazon.com and you know you say ok I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.050
want to buy a ice cream scoop amazon.com

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.370
you click add it to your cart Amazon

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.469
Prime maybe you have it maybe you don't

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
and all of a sudden it shows up on your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.090
doorstep in two days so behind the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.090
scenes what's happening is you know

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.949
someone is sending a product into

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.660
fulfillment by Amazon or they have it at

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.609
their home or their warehouse and they

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.990
are self fulfilling and they are paying

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.060
a fee to Amazon to basically list it on

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.700
Amazon's platform in front of its you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.970
know millions or billions of customers

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.460
so that is the first channel and for the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.040
opportunity to be present in front of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.450
all those customers Amazon allows two

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.490
different kinds of accounts the personal

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.979
account basically you have to pay ninety

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.829
nine cents per item plus whatever the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.380
referral fee is for your category so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.240
let's say that you decide you want to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.490
sell a glass cases okay and that you're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
gonna sell it for $10 if your category

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.560
fee for that item is 10% you will pay

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.310
Amazon one dollar and you will retain

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.659
the other nine then depending on how you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
are going to get that product to your

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.460
customer that will be determined by

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.500
whether or not you have shifted into an

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.040
Amazon warehouse for fulfillment by

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.370
Amazon otherwise known as

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.660
ba or you are going to sell fulfill a KA

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.330
ship the product to your customer

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.000
yourself so that's the first set of fees

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.780
for the professional side it's $39.99

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.400
per month plus the referral theme that I

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.170
just mentioned for your specific

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
category now obviously you're gonna sell

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.800
more than 40 items a month professional

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.270
is the only way to go so that's the way

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.920
that will be going because of course the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.500
number of products that we move so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.170
second channel is going to be Amazon Web

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.060
Store so Amazon Web Store is when you go

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.500
to somebody's website you may know or

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.110
you may not know that you are on the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.820
Amazon platform so just like there are

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.320
all kinds of other platforms that you

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.230
can build on you can build an HTML

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.610
website your Magento platform all kinds

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.459
of different ones Amazon has their own

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.650
platform of course so the second channel

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.750
is Amazon Web Store and so for our

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.170
purposes what's gonna happen is the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.520
client will go to NV 10.com and our site

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.739
will be running just as it currently

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.630
does on a Magento platform but it will

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.000
be running on Amazon's platform and

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.340
Amazon will fulfill the orders again

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.080
fulfillment by Amazon so you can set up

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.540
that store and you have two options

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.209
again as a seller you can fulfill the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.630
product or you can send it to Amazon for

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:16.420
film your choice and the fees for that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.250
are of course the it's $79 per month to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.870
have that store running plus a two

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.480
percent transaction fee and a two

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.970
percent payment fraud and protection fee

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.680
sorry I keep looking down but I didn't

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.880
memorize this stuff and I wanted to get

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.880
this information to you so
