MUSIC &amp; BACKGROUND VOICESâ™ª

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:13.233
(LES MILES) I THINK THAT THE
SPIRIT OF LSU IS REALLY

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.700
REPRESENTED ABOUT, YOU
KNOW, EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.600
THAT WE GO INTO TIGER STADIUM. I
THINK THERE'S A TEAM THAT PLAYS

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.267
WITH SPIRIT AND I THINK THERE'S
A CROWD THERE THAT ANTICIPATES

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:25.333
THAT SPIRIT. I(NTERVIEWER)
AND THE GOLD?

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.533
(MILES) WELL, OUR TEAM IS GOING
TO GRADUATE, AND OUR TEAM'S

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.600
PURSUING ACADEMICS THAT THEY'RE
GOING TO COMPETE IN THE

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.767
CLASSROOM AS WELL AS ON THE
FOOTBALL FIELD. OF COURSE, IT'S

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:38.500
A GREAT ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. WE
ENJOY VERY MUCH THE AFFILIATION

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.133
WITH THE GREAT ACADEMIC
HISTORY OF LSU.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.833
TIGER STADIUM, PRETTY SIMPLE.
(INTERVIEWER) SATURDAY NIGHTS?

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.033
(MILES) SATURDAY NIGHTS.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:57.600
UH, THERE'S A LOT OF MEN THAT
THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL TIME

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.333
TO SPEND. I THINK I'D GO BACK
AND GRAB MY DAD TO BE HONEST

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:07.233
WITH YOU, YEAH. I THINK THAT HE
WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE ME A LOT

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:14.467
OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW
THAT I WOULD ENJOY.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:22.300
I READ DURING THE SEASON
THE BIBLE, AND THAT'S IT.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.333
AND IN VERY SHORT CLIPS. AND I
SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME THERE

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.567
THAN I DO, BUT YOU KNOW,
DURING THE SEASON,

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.633
THERE'S A LOT TO DO.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.700
BROAD BASED LIBERAL ARTS
SCHOOL WITH ALL THE MAJORS,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.900
ENGINEERING, BUSINESS, PRE-MED,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.000
THERE'S LAW SCHOOL
ON OUR CAMPUS.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.733
IF YOU WANT A CREDENTIAL
THAT STANDS BY ITSELF,

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:52.367
THAT STANDS IN THIS COUNTRY
FROM COAST TO COAST,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.200
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.667
THEY WANT TO HEAR LSU,
THEY'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.333
THAT YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH EXCELLENCE.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:03.833
I THINK ACADEMICALLY THAT
THE CREDENTIAL HERE

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.233
THAT OUR GUYS GET IS
AS GOOD AS THERE IS.
