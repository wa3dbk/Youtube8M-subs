00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.390
The world of the modern day magicians ascends
upon us all with upcoming game Watch Dogs

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.069
and I got the chance to try out a few hours
of the game, a little from the beginning and

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.530
a bit later on where I was more submerged
so here's a preview of what you can expect

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.429
from Ubisoft Montreal's hackfest.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.390
As most of you will know, Watch Dogs got itself
delayed from last year and what I really wanted

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.450
to know was what happened during the time
between when we were promised it and when

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.930
we will be given it.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:39.450
So I asked Danny Belanger, lead game designer
for ubisoft montreal.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:01:04.030
You are Aiden Pearce and alongside the gameplay
is an attempt at an emotional storyline of

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.230
which I can't give you my full opinion on
because well, I didn't see it all.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.570
What I can tell you is what this game is like
in general.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.300
Your main piece of tech is the profiler, this
will help you assess the people around you

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.780
for potential hacks and as to whether they
are going to cause you any hassle if you do

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.440
launch a cyber attack on them.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.350
It will, as the name suggests, let you profile
them with name, age, occupation or interest.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
Some interests are a little tongue in cheek
with homosexual, infertile and recently released

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.610
from mental hospital just some of the ones
that popped out at me.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.820
Although, it's worth noting your profiler
is defunct in areas where you haven't taken

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.600
control of the mainframe, the CToS.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.890
Once profiled, you'll be able to hack into
anyone that offers you a little something

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.550
something in the way of cash which can be
picked up later at an ATM.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.890
You will navigate your map which will highlight
objectives, campaigns, crime detected, fixer

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.710
contract, criminal convoy, gang hideout etc.
but as with most open world games you can

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.710
pick and choose what you play.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.739
But what will help Watch Dogs avoid the curse
of the repetitive task that have sometimes

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:36.090
befallen other open world games 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:59.999
like this?

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.680
Watch Dogs is a reflection on modern life
and with a setting of Chicago, one of the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480
most surveillance stricken states of America,
the game shows how the technology that surrounds

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.129
us could be used in order to commit and prevent
all new sorts of crime.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:26.139
You can access cameras around you to assess
a situation without entering the area itself.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.139
The game has a vast skill tree which will
enable manipulation of your environment such

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.709
as raising or lowering city blocks, change
traffic lights to cause chaos and optimisation

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.129
of your profiler.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:42.040
The skills you gain will help you in tasks
such as hacking, combat, crafting and driving.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.799
As well as the single player campaign, there
is the opportunity for other players to infiltrate

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.629
your world and hack into you.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.349
Alongside this are other multiplayer modes
that Colin Graham, Ubisoft Montreal's animation

00:03:51.349 --> 00:04:02.730
director gives an insight on
But what if you don't want to play with other

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:46.470
people and want to get on with your own business.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:57.410
I had 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.159
a go on some of the online multiplayer and
it was clear I needed some tips from the top

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:52.909
to help me out.

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.710
The open world is vast and I'll pay a few
likenesses to GTA here in that you'll need

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.680
a vehicle to get around but unlike GTA you
don't have to commit, well, Grand Theft Auto

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.770
in order to get it.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.370
Your phone has an on-demand vehicle service
that will deliver you vehicles right next

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.960
to you in the game.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
Handy.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.070
Plus like GTA there's a great selection of
music from Alice Cooper, to Kid Cudi to Curtis

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.910
Mayfield and a rating system based on how
wanted you are by police and the appropriate

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.810
turnout of vehicles, helicopters and aggressive
natures based on this to capture you.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.930
I'm not sure the gameplay had be completely
enthralled and I think Ubisoft knew that may

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.380
happen as later in the game you've got mini
games such as this big metal spider you see

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.380
here.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.139
It's weird and I was told that there's no
real reason for it apart from just in case

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.919
you get bored of the normal gameplay.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.520
There is a lot to do though and there's definitely
variety but even though the people surrounding

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.650
you have been given separate profiles, they
will insist on repeating the same reactions

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.879
vocally over and over again which can get
annoying if you hang around near them long

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:54.879
enough.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.190
I'm looking forward to having a go on the
full game but for now, this is all I know

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.639
and now, you know it too.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.639
What do you think about it?

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.639
Let me know in the comments below.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.639
Watch Dogs is an open world hacking game full
of modern day magicians manipulating Chicago

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:04.639
in order to commit and prevent crime.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.639
A big part of the game is its multiplayer
modes allowing others to infiltrate your world,

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:06.639
you infiltrating theirs and missions requiring
you to play in teams.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.639
I had a go at a preview event run by developers
Ubisoft Montreal and it was clear that I needed

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.639
a few tips from the top on how to catch the
hacker.

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.639
I never caught the hacker that infiltrated
me and I don't want you to come to the same

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.639
demise as me.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.639
So, here's Colin Graham, animation director
for ubisoft montreal giving you some big help.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.639
But don't worry if you don't want to play
online.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.639
Danny Belanger lead game designer gave us
the lowdown on going offline and the shield.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:13.655
