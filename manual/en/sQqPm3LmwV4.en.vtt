00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.049
Today I am going to show you how to take apart
the iPhone 5 and replace the battery.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.760
It is actually pretty simple, there are only
4 screws total that you have to take out.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.350
First make sure that you turn off your iPhone.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.390
Then there are 2 screws down at the bottom.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.490
These are a Pentalobe screw.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150
So you will need a special screw driver to
remove them.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.190
It is the same screw driver that you can use
on the iphone 4 or 4s, it will also work for

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.130
the iphone 5.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.589
Once you get the 2 screws out, Take your suction
cup (The bigger the better) And clip it onto

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:29.589
the screen.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.680
Then using a plastic non marring tool, you
can kind of pry away the screen from the base.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.720
I personally, think it is a little easier
to use a razor blade, But using a razor will

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.410
leave a few little scratches on the bottom
of your device, Only lift the screen up 90

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.410
degrees.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.720
Because you can see right there the ribbon
cables might tear if you fold it farther back.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.050
There is two screws right here on this metal
bit, holding the battery cable in place to

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.050
the motherboard.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.260
Take off these two screws.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.850
They are just your regular small Philips head
screw.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.260
Take off the metal bracket, then you can unclip
the little black cable.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.060
It is kind of like a Lego piece that clamps
in.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.800
And then grab the tab that says "Certified
personnel only" And lift out the battery.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.940
Take your new battery and clip it in place
to the mother board, just like a little Lego.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.990
Snap it in.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.390
Take your metal bracket and then screw the
same 2 little screws back into place.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.582
And remember that the replacement batteries
can be found on Amazon.com, usually they are

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:46.110
pretty cheap.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.860
Ill put a link in the video description below
so you can find that link easily.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.770
And then clamp the screen back on.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.189
Make sure you put back the 2 bottom screws
into the phone as well.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.340
(The Pentalobe ones.)

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.920
There you go, youve replaced the battery!!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.141
