00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:10.069
Build an LED Strober

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.759
The strobe light or stroboscopic lamp, commonly known as Strober,

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.269
is a device used to produce regular flashes of light.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:28.769
The light source commonly used in the strobers is a xenon flash lamp,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.030
which manages a temperature of approximately

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.680
5,600 degrees Kelvin

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.000
This makes some durable and high risk of burning the device.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.020
Having in mind economy and durability,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.870
we have used LEDs instead of the obsolete xenon bulbs.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
LEDs or Light Emitting Diodes, allow today to make a new lighting system,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.120
working at very low temperatures,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.870
giving a greater efficiency, lower environmental pollution and work intermittently

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.420
for extended periods

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.060
of time.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.210
As our primary purpose is to transmit basic concepts of electronics

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.680
through practical projects, a way of achieving a better understanding of this circuit

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280
circuit is to mount breadboard (protoboard) from the schematic.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.280
We recommend domig this setup before building the circuit board.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.800
operation

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.020
This strobe light system is powered by a single source designed without  transformer.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.110
It incorporates a tank circuit formed by a capacitor of 2.2 uF

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.109
polyester

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.810
and a resistance of 330K.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
After these two components limit the current to about 60 milliamps,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.810
is rectified by a diode bridge and a capacitor.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.460
Like this voltage is high,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.620
is reduced to 6 volts by a zener diode

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.240
with its respective polarization resistor.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.390
The 555

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.479
is an integrated circuit used to generate oscillations

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.999
and time delays of accuracy.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.690
In this case we will use it to make an astable oscillator.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.469
The working frequency is set by a potentiometer, a pair of resistors and a capacitor.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.489
The 555 is responsible for controlling the transistors

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.719
that act as switches,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.359
LEDs light up.

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.959
The signal delivered the 555 square foot in 3,

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.279
goes through a 10K resistor to the base of the

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.039
2N3904 transistor.

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.239
The sender of this goes to ground and the collector receives

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.179
the voltage via a 10K resistor and in turn is connected to the base

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.679
of another transistor.

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:56.619
The collector of the other 2N3904  is in series with the LEDs

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.999
that are powered from the positive of the diode bridge,

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.069
before the zener diode limiting resistor.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.919
When the 555 sends a positive voltage,

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.319
the transistor Q1 between emitter and collector leads,

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.279
negatively biasing the base of transistor Q2.

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:21.619
. At this time Q2 does not conduct and therefore does not turn on the LEDs.

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.959
By the time the 555 sends a negative pulse, the first transistor (Q1)

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.489
does not lead and positively polarized base of transistor Q2, making driving.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.299
At that moment you turn on the LEDs.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.299
This cycle is repeated at high speed, producing the effect of flashing light.

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.219
construction

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.469
After downloading from our website the PDF file with a list of materials,

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.969
wiring diagram and the PCB,

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.959
we must begin to build the oscillator card.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.090
They should put all the components using the mask as a guide and review components

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.090
thoroughly before soldering.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:15.549
If you have no experience in assembling electronic project,

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.799
be sure to read our section on Recommendations.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.099
Having built the oscillator circuit, we must make the panel of 80 LEDs.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.530
We will use the lid of a jar of cold recycling.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.180
Mask is printed components found in the PDF file

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.000
and then cut scissors.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.549
Paste the mask pattern on the cap and components with the help of a drill,

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:47.649
drilled all the holes where the LEDs will go later.

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:52.039
LEDs placed at the top, considering that all the LEDs stay with its negative pole

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:58.789
facing the left side, in other words the opposite of clockwise

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.669
To identify the polarity of the LED, we note that the short leg is negative.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.669
If by mistake, an LED is placed upside down, the circuit will not start.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.429
We bend the legs of the LEDs and cut to sufficient size so that the leg

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:21.639
is positive for each LED with LED negative leg immediately following.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.369
At this point we must realize the voltage to feed our circuit.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:31.179
If in our country we have a voltage of 220V

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:32.030
on the public network

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.130
we must make a single series from start to finish with 80 LEDs.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.800
But if we have a voltage of 120 volts,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.249
should do 2 sets of 40 LEDs.

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:50.639
Having made the connection of LEDs, proceed to weld their feet,

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.479
joining all the LEDs together

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:59.479
. Be careful not to melt the plastic lid. Make good welds and quickly.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:06.659
Now comes the installation of the oscillator circuit in the bowl of ice cream.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.889
Must be made three holes in the back: one for the knuckle of the potentiometer shaft

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.539
or another to fit the pin it up,

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:20.400
and at the bottom there is another hole where the power cord exit the circuit.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.959
Card is installed to ensure the pot with nut and washer.

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:30.219
It is important before removing the power cord, tie a knot so that

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.600
when pulling the cable, do not go to abuse the circuit.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.100
The sheet will serve as the strobe support

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.399
the bend by a (U).

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.779
At each end to make a hole using a drill bit the same diameter

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.449
as the screws that adjust the blade to the jar.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.710
We do a couple of holes on the sides of the bowl and put the screws holding it with foil,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.069
leaving the butterflies on the outside,

00:06:55.069 --> 00:07:02.069
so you can adjust to taste and to change the angle of the strobe.

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:07.500
Connecting the LED panel, with the oscillator circuit.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.449
The connection I see is for supply of 120 volts.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.300
If your country the utility voltage is 220 volts,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.050
should be placed in series all 80 LEDs and additional wires will unite

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.379
the two parallel series,

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.580
only two wires will oscillator circuit, to panel LEDs.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.300
In the end we put the power cord plug.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.370
We placed a step switch on and off

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.149
our strobe.

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:38.969
We have our strobe light Strobe or terminated.

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:42.699
We can use it at our parties in the establishment or place next

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:43.639
to our videojukebox,

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.919
encouraging the rumba, giving it a disco atmosphere to our business.

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.099
We hope that this project is also very useful and contribute their knowledge

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:54.009
in electronics.

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:54.699
Success!
