Goodwill Community Foundation: Creating opportunities
for a better life

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.440
After a while, if you have many apps, your
Home screen may start to feel a little...

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.589
cluttered. In this video, I'm going to show
you how to manage the contents of your iPad

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.919
by customizing what you see here. We'll also
take a look at adjusting your apps' settings

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.179
and notifications.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.109
One way to manage your apps is to rearrange
them. To get started, touch and hold any app

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.350
on your Home screen. Notice how they're all
shaking now? That means we can start moving

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.940
things around—just touch and hold an icon,
then drag and drop it into place. You can

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.940
even move an icon to another screen by dragging
it to the edge.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.320
If you want to add an app to your dock, you
can do that too. That way, you can access

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.449
the app no matter what screen you're on.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.629
Another way to organize your Home screen—and
save space—is to place certain apps in a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.100
folder. To do this, drag and drop an icon
directly on top of another. The iPad automatically

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.869
gives the folder a name based on what's inside,
but you can easily change that if you want.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.430
To exit the folder, tap anywhere on the screen.
Then keep dragging and dropping apps until

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
you have the ones you want.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.119
If you change your mind, you can always remove
the folder by removing the apps from the folder.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.119
Just drag and drop them out, one by one. Once
the folder is empty, it'll disappear automatically.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.990
When you're done, press the Home button to
save any changes you've made. As you can see,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.530
the icons have stopped shaking, which means
we can use them again. Let's go back to the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.520
first Home screen.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.539
There may be a time when you want to do more
than just organize your apps. You can also

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.969
edit settings that change the way they actually
work. To access these options, open Settings

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.640
on your device.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.009
Here, you can customize almost anything related
to your iPad—including general settings,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.009
and settings for your apps. To navigate, scroll
up and down in the left pane. Tap an item...

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.629
and your options will open on the right.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.060
Under Twitter, for example, you can add another
account to the app. Under Safari, you can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.069
turn on private browsing, change the default
search engine, or clear your history.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.720
Another thing you can do in settings is manage
your notifications. Just look for Notifications

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.269
near the top of the left pane.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.030
Notifications are the items and actions that
the iPad alerts you to; for example, when

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.530
you receive an email, or when a reminder is
due. By default, most notifications are displayed

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.580
at the top of your screen in the Notification
Center. However, they can also be set up to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.000
alert you with a banner or a pop-up, so you
always know when something needs your attention.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.560
To edit any of your existing notifications
or alerts, tap an item in the section labeled

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
In Notification Center. You can even turn
off notifications for an app if there's one

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.409
that's bothering you.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.409
To set up an app for the first time, scroll
down, and find it under Not in Notification Center.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.280
Let's do Skype.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.129
Here, you'll need to tap the control at the
top to add the app to the Notification Center.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.140
You can also enable alerts if you want. I'm
going to choose the pop-up style, because

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.340
notifications from this app are important
to me. If you prefer not to be interrupted,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.430
you can always choose None, and you'll still
receive updates in the Notification Center.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.549
You can also enable sounds, and something
called the Badge App Icon, which will flag

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.659
the icon itself any time you have a notification
waiting. Here's how it works.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.420
See the little red numbers?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.390
The options are different for every app, so
take a look at the ones on your device, and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.890
see what works best for you. To go back, tap
the Notifications button at the top.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.480
With so much flexibility here—and on the
Home screen—the iPad gives you everything

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.470
you need to manage your apps, and keep your
device organized.
