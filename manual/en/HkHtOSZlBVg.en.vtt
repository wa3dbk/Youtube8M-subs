00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:07.345
everybody will be approved friday that's
the show where she refused something

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:11.126
really fast because i didn't have time
for radio show this week

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:15.086
if they wanna talk about this this is
the uh... the but our bt four tripod

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:17.826
statements also called the steady pod

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:23.805
and what it is is it's kind of a mini
tripod that you can set up like this

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:28.905
it's got a little cor twenty threat on
top of a knob down here and tied in with

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.075
i think colin this is a tripod is sort
of a misnomer because it's more of a

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:35.786
stand there's no way to pay and his head
right here just tilts

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:39.506
into about ten different positions
unlocks tell there's no finer just like

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:40.926
a real tripod

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:43.986
uh... but that's okay because i really
use it for that

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:48.976
these legs here will collapse into the
celtics and they've got uh... pistol

00:00:48.976 --> 00:00:52.836
grip and i've surely this before in my
eyes image for excess trees buildings

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:56.486
they use this way it was in the twenties
field recorder type setup

00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.146
critic so large after the goes on this
and that means in the front top

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:04.166
and i like this shape which is you know
it's a sort of like a lugar pistol

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.516
here because i can talk it into my belt

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.436
and then have a perpendicular to my
bodies of a recording sound was a

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.526
shotgun mic and into boom pole

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:13.825
an actual down

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:16.106
and see the levels that are sticking out

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:19.286
uh... instead alexei recorder being
around her neck which is the way you see

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:21.286
it a lot of uh... a lot of times

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:25.296
so but anyway that's what i typically
use this form i recently had a answering

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.655
new use for this

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:28.336
which i want to share with you

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:33.266
and it involves this this is my soniya
aunti x five in this is the camera use

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.716
now for spills

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:36.946
or for narrative film making

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:40.906
and a lot of people you know will take
uh... these pistol grip type devices

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:42.546
military children

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:45.446
to the bottom of your of their camera
like this

00:01:45.446 --> 00:01:48.636
and what this does is it gives him a
hand holding the barnard camera

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:52.506
obviously something to do some kind of
simple stabilization you have

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:54.806
another point which you can hold your
camera

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:58.566
and i work for running then type of
setup however i don't really like to do

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:01.426
this so they can pistol grip anyway
because

00:02:01.426 --> 00:02:05.316
i'm just use the holding my camera we'll
take stills or whatever with one finger

00:02:05.316 --> 00:02:06.616
of the shutter

00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:08.085
uh... my right hand

00:02:08.085 --> 00:02:11.945
and my thumb is that the record but in
my left hand is uh... justin focus with

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:13.645
a rippling focus for

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:14.726
video

00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:18.486
uh... which i'd never do this by the way
i use my fertile stabilizer too

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:21.555
but i'm shooting stills on definitely
holding like this

00:02:21.555 --> 00:02:22.696
uh... so

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:27.465
one thing i didn't like about this
camera wildest that the size of it

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.565
uh... i really like the camera but if
you hold it a large hands like me

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.726
shareholder small camera like this

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:34.275
person every time

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:38.185
your hand it's sort of its kinda cramped
up and cute saris just being squashed

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.355
like this

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:43.455
so i've always wondered wanted to have a
uh... something that would add more

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:46.955
balked at the camera the battery gripper
something they do have aftermarket

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:49.715
battery groups but they're like a
hundred dollars

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.455
that's not really are not willing to pay
them i just think my camera look bigger

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:58.085
so i thought i was using this today i
thought about uh... the vivitar grip

00:02:58.085 --> 00:03:02.445
and i thought well unilaterally like
using a like this but what happens

00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:06.565
diffuse way to the side because most of
these groups are vertical and doesn't

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:10.505
matter which way their attach the care
with this one is dramatically different

00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:12.075
if you saw into the side

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.775
so now and i grab it

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:18.796
i can actually read my fingers around
the lower portion of reappear in my

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:19.775
irate

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:22.166
index figures still over the shutter so
it's great

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.925
and will attend is now free

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:27.366
so that i can just focus so
effectiveness governor are really

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:30.905
expensive way uh... gave me what i
wanted which was to write my camera a

00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:31.935
little bit bigger

00:03:31.935 --> 00:03:34.275
sulekha hold it for longer periods of
time

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:35.275
comfortably

00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:38.215
so that along with uh... you know using
this roddy i think this is a pretty good
