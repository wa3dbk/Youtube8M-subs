Changing a Flat Tire on a BMW or MINI - BavAuto
Space Saver Spare Tire Kit

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.850
Hi Otto here for Bavarian autosport.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.180
In today’s DIY video we are going to show
you how to use and install the Bavarian autosport

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.930
space saver spare tire kit in the event of
a flat tire on your BMW or Mini.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.440
Now most BMWs and Minis produced from the
mid two-thousands on were delivered with run-flat

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.360
tires and don’t even have a spare tire on
board.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.120
Now while a spare tire and run flats may sound
redundant, think about these points.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.500
Now with these points in mind Bavarian Autosport
has developed space saver spare tire kits

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.400
for most BMW and MINI models that include
the space saver spare, the vehicle jack, a

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.150
lug wrench, and a safety wheel chock.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.930
There’s also optional items to include and
heavy duty scissor jack kit, lug wrench, roadway

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.130
safety devices, wheel alignment tool, wheel
lug socket kits, and a nice storage bag for

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
the trunk.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.479
These items are all for sale on our online
store at bavauto.com.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.380
Here we have the bavauto space saver spare
tire kit in the trunk of the car.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.189
The storage bag is secured to the trunk tie
down rings.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.080
Everything we need to fix the flat tire is
in the storage bag.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.760
Here’s our basic spare tire kit.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.840
We have the vehicle lifting jack, the wheel
chock, the lug bolt wrench, an optional wheel

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.680
alignment tool, and the optional safety triangle
that's included in the bavauto vehicle safety

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.580
and first aid kit.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.340
Our first step is to assemble the triangle
and place it about 50 feet behind the vehicle

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.990
to warn oncoming drivers that we are working
on the side of the road.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:49.690
Next, we place the wheel chock at the diagonally
opposite wheel to assure the vehicle will

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.610
not move as it is lifted.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.100
Before lifting the vehicle with the jack slightly
loosen all of the lug bolts.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.490
We’ll now place the jack into the jacking
receiver pad.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.000
Locate the jacking receiver pad under the
rocker panel.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.650
The receiver pad will be a hard rubber female
socket.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.410
Lift the jack and place the top of the jack
into the receiver pad. raise the jack to that

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.540
the foot is directly below the receiver pad.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.830
Continue to raise the jack until the full
wheel and tire assembly is fully off the ground.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.140
Lift the wheel and tire high enough so that
there will be adequate clearance for the fully

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
inflated spare tire assembly.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.600
Remove the lug bolts.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.009
Remove the flat tire assembly and put it safely
behind the vehicle.

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.980
We can now install the spare tire assembly.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.430
Line up the lug bolts in the hub with the
holes in the wheel.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.660
We like to use the optional bavauto wheel
alignment tool.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.160
The tool threads into one of the lug bolt holes
and greatly simplifies lining up the wheel

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.900
an the lug bolt holes.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.100
Install the lug bolts.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.000
Remove the alignment tool and install the
last bolt.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.700
Snug each of the bolts but don’t fully tighten
them at this time.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.000
Lower the jack and remove it.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.389
Tighten the lug bolts.

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.150
Tighten the bolts in a star or criss-cross
pattern.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.060
The supplied lug wrench is designed to provide
proper lug tightening torque by pulling on

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.920
the handle end of the wrench with moderate
force.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.560
Once the tire is fully installed gather up
the tools and place them in the storage bag

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.820
and put it in the trunk.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.060
Even though and spare tire is something you
hope to never have to use, you now have the

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.860
peace of mind of knowing that you can take
care of a tire emergency and get yourself

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.860
back safely on the road.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.010

tire kit, you can order your space saver spare
