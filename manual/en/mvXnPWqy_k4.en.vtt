Let’s talk about dog car safety harnesses.
These are good for two reasons. One, it will

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.730
keep your dog from becoming a projectile if
you get into a car accident and second, it

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:31.470
will help keep very young puppies or aggressive
dogs into staying in one place in a car. So

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:42.239
here is how we would put on the particular
one I have for my dog Pip dress over the head,

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:51.100
one arm through, underneath and then back
up to the other side. Each harness will be

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.090
different so you can look at the instructions
for yours and then I will have Pip jump up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:12.560
into the car and I will hook her up. Okay
Pip, Pip car, good car. Okay, now I’ll connect

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:24.490
the chain connector to the harness and I have
a quick length on the top here and there you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:38.420
have it. Now this is the connector that came
with the harness. As you can see on one side,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.110
this part here goes into a standard seat belt
socket and this part would connect to the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:57.909
harness here but I found that Pip was escaping
from this. I snuck up on her one time and

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.210
saw that she would bite the seat belt unit
and she would eject this and set herself free.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.779
So that is why I modified the unit and went
to the chain that you just saw.
