00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.030
Over the last year motor premiums
for our customers are fallen by about

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.100
14% following the civil
litigation reviews, which is great news

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.330
customers. And insurers have been really
quick of passing those savings straight

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.520
through to customers. Aviva believes more
can be done to keep premium levels down

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.140
and reduce them further in the long run
even. There are 500,000 whiplash claims

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.630
every year and these at the moment are
compensated with cash. We pay people

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.540
compensation for their injuries. But
we think there's a better way which is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.590
for the majority of those claims, which
are small minor injuries, that it would

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.820
be better for consumers if they were
treated with a rehabilitation and care

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.500
rather than compensation.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.730
As long as I had some control over which
practitioner I was going to see I would

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.690
be happy to have my physiotherapy or
osteopathy treatment paid for by the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.510
insurance company. I've had minor
injuries and I would much rather be

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.100
healthy than have a little extra cash.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
I think replacing a lump sum payment
with physio is a very very good idea

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.620
because it does bypass the whole
claiming things that aren't actually

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.400
true and costing everyone money. And I
also think it's a good thing to do if

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.190
you do have whiplash, it is quite painful
and you actually get something done

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.340
about it. Rehabilitation for whiplash is
incredibly important. Whether it be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.610
minor or whether it be a bit more
significant than that. Without the right

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.630
intervention from the practitioner, from
the physiotherapist it can look at

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.650
affecting the person's return to work.
The time frame so that they return to

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.510
normal social sporting activities, and
family activities and have a big effect

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.130
on the quality of life. From all my
patients I get really positive outcomes,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.020
really positive results with them.
Especially minor whiplash cases.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.800
Customers always feel a lot better in
short spaces of time even with some very

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.830
simple advice, exercises and
rehabilitation.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.030
So our second recommendation relates to
the level at which lawyers become

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
involved in injury claims. And the vast
majority of injury claims are reasonably

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.800
small. They're relatively straightforward
and where there's no discussion to be

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.130
had about who's at fault for the
accident, they can be settled and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.360
compensated really very very quickly.
Aviva's data suggests that where we

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.170
settle claims directly with customers
who come to us without a lawyer, they

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.680
receive just as much compensation as
where there's a lawyer involved on their

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.640
behalf. And the third recommendation is
that a referral fee should be banned

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.710
across the scope of motor claims. In
total these costs add something like 200

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.310
million pounds to the cost of motor
claims across the insurance market.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.860
That's a cost that doesn't need to be
there and it's the cost that flows

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.730
straight through to car insurance
premiums that we believe doesn't need to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.090
be there.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.660
Now is the time to consider whether we
move from providing cash to providing

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.220
care. We know that rehabilitation and
physiotherapy provide great solutions to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.230
injured customers. And doing those things
well provide cheaper insurance for all

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.470
of us.
