00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.580
The shutter in your camera is a little bit like the shutter you'd have

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.610
over a bedroom window.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.149
you open the shutter, light comes in
through the window

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.119
you close it and the light is cut off, if you have the shutter open and then closed

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.110
you get a bit of light come in and then it goes dark again.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.460
That's exactly what the shutter in your camera does, let me show you more.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.490
I'm gonna use my old mamia here it's much easier

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.490
to show you what I'm on about, right now i've got the lens and the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.170
back off, in here that's the cameras shutter, this little curtainy thing

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.120
in the back. When you press the shutter button

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.470
and I'm going to use something like a
two second exposure so it's long enough

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.560
for you to see

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.770
the shutter opens and then light comes
in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.800
and then it closes again just like that
that's all there is to it

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.480
the faster the shutter speed the less
light gets in.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.790
So if i was to set a very fast shutter speed i'm gonna go with a five hundredth of a second,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.309
You're not even gonna see it happen.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.810
They're you go that's all there is to it.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.229
the shutter on your Dslr camera is just the same as this

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.659
and its this little number on the left
here as I

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.509
turn the shutter speed dial you can see
those numbers changing

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.899
that is the speed of your shutter, now if you just have a straight number like

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:24.530
this

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.709
it's a fraction imagine a one forward
slash in front of the number

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.140
so here you've got a one hundred and eightieth of a second.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.700
if I get down to lower numbers like a tenth and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.109
beyond you'll see it'll start to get little speech marks like that,

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:43.719
that means they're whole seconds

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.259
that means that's a two second exposure, a very long time for the shutter to be

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:48.780
open.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.890
Light to come in and then close again,.that's all about there is to a shutter

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.020
it's used for controlling exposure
predominantly

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.469
creatively there's very little you can
do with it apart from freeze or blur

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.110
motion.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.909
I'm sitting next to a little stream here
if I set a fast shutter speed

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.750
I should be able to freeze the little
droplets of motion, little droplets of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.750
water.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.930
Yep that's pretty good, now if i set a slow

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.450
shutter speed , i'm gonna go all the way down here to about a quarter of a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.319
second

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.700
that movement in the water will blur because the shutter is open,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.069
the water is moving and the light of the
water is

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.069
consequently moving on the sensor so you
get the blur.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.770
right let's have a look at the pictures
as I flick between the two here

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.420
in the first image were i used the faster shutter speed

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.500
the droplets of water are frozen it's absolutely static

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.190
in the second were i was using a quarter of a second

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.040
the shutter opened, the water moved and then the shutter closed again

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.610
so the water is blurred that's the basis of the cotton candy waterfall

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.430
technique.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.790
now in order to get those shots I had to
do other things to make sure that I had

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.050
the correct exposure

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.490
but I don't wanna go into that right
here and now I just want you to get

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.390
what shutter is what a shutter is and
what a shutter speed is

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.640
also to get the blurry shot I really
ought to use a tripod

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.230
but I wedged my elbow into two flower pots down here in order to keep the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.420
camera steady.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.650
so though you can use the shutter creatively

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.170
to blur or freeze motion it is
predominantly an exposure control

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.160
and that's about it
