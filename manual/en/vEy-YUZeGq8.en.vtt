“Dietary Guidelines:
Progressing from Pyramid to Plate”

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.710
The pyramid has been
replaced by the plate.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.950
Thursday, June 2, 2011,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.759
the First Lady unveiled the federal
government’s new food icon, MyPlate,

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.940
to serve as a reminder to help
consumers make healthier food choices.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.910
(Tom Vilsack, Secretary of Agriculture)

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.510
“For Americans to lead happy,
productive lives, it helps

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.689
to stay healthy, active, and fit.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.009
It’s really pretty simple.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.580
Choose a healthier plate,
and balance it with exercise.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.600
It all comes down to the choices we make.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.719
That’s why I’m excited to introduce
to you USDA’s new food icon, MyPlate—

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.050
a simple reminder to make
healthy food choices.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.910
MyPlate symbolizes mealtime
and the food groups:

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.530
fruits, grains, vegetables,
protein, and dairy.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.100
A healthy plate for every meal,
and what we eat matters.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.160
Overweight and obesity rates
are at dangerously high levels,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.489
and the Obama administration has worked
to support Americans who want to

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.240
improve their health and nutrition.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.420
MyPlate is a departure from the
food pyramid you’re used to seeing.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.090
It’s an easy-to-understand visual that
shows how to build a healthy meal

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.640
based on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines
for all of Americans.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.530
And if you want to learn
more about a healthy diet,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.909
you can visit choosemyplate.gov

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.869
to get messages, tools, and how-to
materials about healthy eating.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.010
This website will equip consumers with
information on staying healthy,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.430
and tips on balancing calories, foods
to increase, and foods to reduce.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.409
I hope you’re as excited
as I am about MyPlate,

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.189
and the other resources to help Americans
make healthy choices at choosemyplate.gov.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.320
Next time you sit down
for a meal, before you eat,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.680
think about what’s on your plate.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.780
In the months and years ahead,
we hope that MyPlate becomes your plate.”

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.450
And indeed, which do you think is more
helpful in terms of figuring out what

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.100
to eat when you sit down at a meal.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.539
This, or this?

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.369
Nutritionists have expressed concern that
Americans might equate the protein group

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.300
with meat (or think that
dairy doesn’t include soy milk),

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.900
but the USDA defines the protein group as
including beans and peas, soy products,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.470
nuts and seeds, and specifically highlights
beans and peas as unique foods,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.420
as they count towards both
protein and the vegetable group.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.160
It’s like a two-for-one deal.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.750
And I don’t know if you caught it,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300
but if you rewind,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.690
our Secretary of Agriculture
appears to be saying next time

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:48.360
you sit down for a meal, before you eat,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.440
make sure you include in your diet
a centerpiece of fruit—

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.970
and, random bottles
of pharmaceutical drugs.
