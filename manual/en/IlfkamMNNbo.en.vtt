00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:03.674
(energetic music)

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:06.298
- We're gonna review
some hot quarterbacks.

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:07.633
- I love football.

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:09.015
- I love football too.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.303
This is so exciting.

00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:11.879
- Big NFL guy, big NFL guy.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:12.553
- Not really.

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:13.389
- (laughs)

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.734
- I know absolutely nothing about the NFL.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:16.477
- I'm a huge fan.

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:17.684
- In my fantasy football lineup,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.938
it's just hot dudes.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.655
- Hey Tony Romo.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.572
He's fun.

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:24.697
- Nah, I'm just going to
say no right off the bat.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:26.276
Is this like what he
looks all the time to?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.622
- Yeah, I mean for the most part.

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:28.574
- He doesn't win at all.

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:30.072
I feel bad for Cowboys fans,

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:31.105
cause he's such a loser.

00:00:31.105 --> 00:00:32.324
Maybe that's why girls like him,

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:33.752
cause he's like kind of broken.

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:36.365
- I could see people saying hot.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:37.955
But I'm definitely going to say not.

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:38.954
- I'll say not.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:39.883
- [voiceover] Mr. Cam Newton.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:41.330
- [voiceover] Hot, hi.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.007
- Cam is a hottie.

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:42.715
- He's a stud.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:43.505
- A stunner.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.759
- Look at that strong neck,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.547
and that strong jaw line.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.462
- It's the dimples, it's the dimples.

00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:51.295
- I would marry him so fast, he's so hot.

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:52.352
- That's like been one of those guys,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.687
where I like ask my girlfriend like,

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:54.476
do you think he's hot?

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:55.939
And she'll be like, yes.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:57.565
I'm like thank you, cause he is.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:58.259
- (laughs) Right.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:59.236
- He remains hot playing

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:01.588
in the NFL's ugliest uniforms.

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:03.068
- And he's so fast.

00:01:03.068 --> 00:01:03.972
- He's fast.

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:05.529
He does like the little Superman thing

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:06.655
when he scores a touchdown.

00:01:06.655 --> 00:01:07.895
He probably does that when he scores

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:08.664
another touchdown.

00:01:08.664 --> 00:01:09.616
- Okay, you know what I'm saying.

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:10.742
- Cam might be the hottest person

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:11.647
to ever play in the NFL.

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:13.240
- [left man] Overall hot.
- [right man] Overall very hot.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.343
- I'm going to put this
over here for later.

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:17.408
- [voiceover] Bam, Russell Wilson.

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:18.375
- He's handsome.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.756
- He is really handsome.

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:20.465
- No.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.299
He looks confused all the time.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.042
- I think he's hot.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:25.213
I like this, this is a good
looking dude right here.

00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:26.467
- He's super classy.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:27.802
He's a great guy.

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:28.766
But you know what?

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.008
At the end of the time you're still trying

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:31.169
to give it to beast mode.

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:32.260
- You don't want someone

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.916
that's going to metaphorically

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:35.604
get picked off at the one yard line.

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:36.626
Heath Farwell.

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:39.566
- No, no, oh no!

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.898
- I think he looks player.

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:42.106
Like he looks like he might sleep

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:43.232
with two of my friends, maybe.

00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:44.695
- I disagree.

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:45.275
- Really?

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:46.607
- He looks like totally monogamous.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.862
- Nobody throws a sexier deep ball

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:50.534
than this guy right here, Russell Wilson.

00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:51.586
- Dreamboat.

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:53.901
- [voiceover] Hey, Aaron Rodgers.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.120
- I like this guy.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.537
He has a strong nose.

00:01:56.537 --> 00:01:57.744
- Aaron Rodgers is funny.

00:01:57.744 --> 00:01:59.820
- My girlfriend adores this guy.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.946
- All American hunk.

00:02:00.946 --> 00:02:02.501
- Yeah, he's definitely hunky,

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:03.825
look at those pretty blues.

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:05.044
- He has a moustache, sometimes.

00:02:05.044 --> 00:02:06.202
- Yeah, he has a moustache sometimes.

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:07.362
I can't grow a moustache.

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:07.923
- No.

00:02:07.923 --> 00:02:08.968
- Overall hot.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:09.931
- Rodgers looks like the guy

00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:11.058
that will date your sister

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:12.010
and you'd approve of him.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.880
- I don't approve of
anybody dating my sister.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.435
- [voiceover] Oh, Matthew Stafford.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.513
- He looks like a potato
at the state fair.

00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.329
- I'd smash, he's hot.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.102
- He just looks like he hangs out

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.228
at the carnival a lot.

00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:24.096
He uses the phrase, I tell you what.

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:24.978
- Stafford looks like the guy

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:26.487
that'd you run into at a college party,

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.101
that's like extra sweaty for no reason.

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.240
- He looks like how he is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.153
as a quarterback, you know, like.

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:34.870
- Fragile, easily injured,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.273
tries to go downtown all the time.

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:38.167
Not hot.

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:38.829
- Not hot.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.314
If he had Megatron maybe.

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:41.290
- [voiceover] Jay Cuttler.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.416
- Oh (laughs).

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:46.287
- I thought it was Tom
Cruise for a second (laughs).

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:47.924
I'm like when did he get
into the football game.

00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:49.178
- He has beautiful eyes.

00:02:49.178 --> 00:02:50.211
- He's a good looking dude,

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.558
but he's a massive douche.

00:02:51.558 --> 00:02:52.928
I feel bad for Bears fans.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:54.054
- This guy's fun.

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:54.890
- I mean after you're done,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.260
you're going to smoke a
pack of cigarettes in bed.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.887
(laughter)

00:02:56.887 --> 00:02:57.804
- Why does he look different in this one?

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:59.313
- Because he doesn't look
like a football player.

00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:00.358
- Yeah, he doesn't at all.

00:03:00.358 --> 00:03:01.728
- Even though he's such a dad,

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:04.480
I also wouldn't want to
let him near my kids.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.279
- I mean he looks like the really hot guy

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.220
you went to high school with,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.740
that you bump into 15 years later

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.447
and you're like, oh.

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:11.849
- Like last call at a bar,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.408
this is what you're going
to have to go home with.

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:14.871
- The Cutler special.

00:03:14.871 --> 00:03:16.775
(laughter)

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:17.831
- Overall not hot.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.085
- Not hot, sorry dude.

00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:21.001
- Brother versus brother.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.162
- The Manning brothers.

00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:23.381
- Well, well, well.

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.457
Ready, you want to say it on three?

00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:26.620
One, two, three.
