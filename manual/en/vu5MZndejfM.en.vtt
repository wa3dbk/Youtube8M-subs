00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
I thought I'd do a quick career since i
haven't done one in a while i always say

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.519
that um it's not too much to report on
the weight loss stuff i'm using

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.119
myfitnesspal a lot to count calories i
started using food zone because i have

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.470
to use it through with you any stuff
anyway but that's just too complicated

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.310
and it doesn't have enough choices um
but it gives you a much better idea of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.440
what nutrition you're actually getting
um I've been quite up and down I got

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.980
down to 75 kilos which was one of my
major goals and now i'm at like 76

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.710
points something something like that um
sometimes go up to 77 78 my weights kind

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.460
of like quite up and down I'm exercising
not a lot maybe twice a week at this gym

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.489
and I've got my job and I doing more
shifts now because I'm on break from uni

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:14.850
so probably moving fair bit but nothing
major and yeah I I try to make good food

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.810
choices but I do it always and when are
you need was finishing up i'm just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.680
drinking too much alcohol and uh yeah
just things like better just been making

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.250
my weight goes quite up and down but
there is a steady decrease obviously

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.470
because i know any 80 kilos anymore and
which i was stuck on her easily yes um I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.460
used to be 92 kilos i think was my
heaviest as a weight um so I've lost I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.869
feel a bit over the years it it's sort
of the weight loss crept up on me them

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.799
times that I was really really trying
hard to lose weight and you're doing

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.570
Alex strict calorie counting and stuff I
I please like a couple of kilos and then

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.410
gained it all back in it did not work at
all so my approach now I suppose is just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.840
eat what I want when I feel like it
sometimes but

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.989
try to make nutritious choices try and
stick to around 1,400 calories a day but

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.849
certainly I don't feel bad if I eat
closer to 2,000 because it seems to be

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.120
sort of leveling out and overall I'm
just slowly losing right because if I

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.760
hate 1,400 calories every day or below I
would drop weight like crazy but that's

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.630
not very sustainable for me so I'm
pretty flexible with it I I certainly

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.690
want to lose more weight my next goal is
well my very short-term goal now is to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.269
get back to send any pride when I was
and then um a bigger goal is to get to

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.730
70 that's that's been my sort of major
goal for a long time is to get to 70

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.670
kilos which on me is you know don't
really look overweight already theory if

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.519
I feel relatively fit and sort of like
the way my clothes fit and things like

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.620
that and I was a higher rate than I
expected because I muscle or whatever

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.650
that wouldn't bother me at all weights
not a huge issue for me but I guess it's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.060
just something that you can track and I
certainly don't weigh myself ever do

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.569
anything like that um yes weight loss is
certainly not at the forefront of my

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.440
life it's sort of slowly happening I
guess what's more important to me is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.169
making healthier choices um yeah that's
my update i'll show you how I'm looking

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.169
i have tokyo like my pants now

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:09.950
and I bought a dress for the first time
ever so guess I should show you out

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.100
that's just I don't know if i'll
actually ever bring myself to wear it in

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.400
public especially without like any
covering my arms cause we still like

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.480
like my arms but yeah i bought a dress
for the first time ever
