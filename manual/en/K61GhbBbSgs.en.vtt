00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.170
Hi, I am Alexander.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.490
In this vid you will get acquainted with the
SE Electronics USB 2200A microphone.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.370
I will show you its components, connection
and use.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.490
We will also show you some recommended accessories.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.700
So, here is SE Electronics USB 2200A.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:42.979
The main feature of this mic is that 
apart from the built-in interface it has a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.030
regular XLR output, so you can connect it
with audio interfaces and preamps.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.149
This microphone is based on the SE 2200A mic
that has already become classics, and due

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.850
to its level excels Rode NT2.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.350
The main features are zero delay monitoring,
headphones output with a volume control, a

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.119
10dB attenuator, low-cut filter, and simultaneous
work of the digital USB output as well as

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.869
the analogue XLR output.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.990
The USB 2200A is based on a unique microchip,
specially designed for converting the 5V power

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.300
line from the USB output into 48V for the
proper power for the condenser capsule.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.930
Before sending power to the capsule the chip
removes all the extremes and noises of the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.090
USB power line, and that allows to avoid the
capsule noise which typical for other USB-powered

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.090
mics.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.460
These noises normally tend to amplify, so
that is usually the reason why other USB microphones

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.439
prove to be too noisy for professional use.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.780
No other USB mic on the market does not have
these features which make it so unique and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.359
that gives this mic a beneficial advantage
in the studio work.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.060
And now we are going to get acquainted with
the USB 2200A set.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:23.930
And this is 
what we see, opening the box: a manual, a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.450
microphone with a built-in holder, and a USB
cable.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.010
Connection is very simple and does not require
any extra drivers.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:50.290
A right mouse click on the speaker icon, then
on the 'recording device', then 'SE USB 2200A',

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.730
'utility', 'levels' and set the record level,
'ok', next 'playback', then 'USB 2200A', 'utility',

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.530
and on the level tab set the monitoring volume
and - 'ok'.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.180
Next we go to editing software, in our case
it is Cubase.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.190
On the 'devices' tab we choose 'device setup'
and what we have to do is on the control panel

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.030
we turn on the headphones set of the SE Electronics
as well as the SE Electronics mic, and don't

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.100
forget to turn off the mic and speakers of
the built-in audio interface.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.900
Then we press F4 and get to the VST connection.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:39.720
Here we need in the output and input windows
in the audio devices select ASIO DirectX Full

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720
Duplex Driver.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.930
Everything is ready and we can get to work.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:57.370
Taking into account the fact that 
this mic is dual-purposed, we will be recording

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:31.980
it both through a USB and in a regular way
into the audio interface so that you could

00:04:31.980 --> 00:05:01.910
hear its work in two positions and see the
difference.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.310
USB 2200A
Lexicon U22

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.860
USB2200A
Lexicon U22

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.850
I hope you we helped you to get certain impression.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.340
And now, at the end, we traditionally will
give you some information about the accessories.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.900
We are often asked what accessories are necessary
for this mic.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.970
The first recommendation is a microphone stand.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:33.060
Our advice is a straight one because the space
issue is crucial for home recordings.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.640
The next one is a shock mount.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.389
We recommend you SE Electronics 2200T.

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.820
And of course, a pop filter.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.150
Also, if your room does not have acoustic
treatment, a portable reflection filter would

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.360
be of great help.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.980
And for the entire satisfaction don't forget
to purchase an XLR-XLR cable and headphones

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.139
that can be found in range on our site.
