00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.780
What’s up everyone, it’s Than from Tidal
Gardens.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.980
This video is all about Favia and Favites,
two of the most common types of brain corals

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.910
found in the reef keeping hobby.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.040
I’ll be perfectly honest with you guys…
it’s hard for me to tell a lot of these

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.400
types of brain corals apart.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.140
Favia for example, look a whole lot like Goneastrea.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.199
From what I’ve read some of the key differences
are Favites tend to have smaller polyps and

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:41.390
the skeleton between polyps is a single ridge
where it is two separate ridges in the other.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.739
Again, I am not by any stretch a coral taxonomist.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.230
Many of these descriptions were observed shortly
after the invention of the light bulb and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.329
are often very vague.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.350
Yet, those are the official descriptions of
the species.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.010
It’s a little murky, and for what I am focused
on, it’s less useful than one might think.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.340
The care requirements for Favia and Favites
are fairly straight forward.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.940
They tolerate quite a range of lighting and
flow.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.960
We tend to give them relatively low flow and
low light, but I’ve seen them do pretty

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.500
well in tanks that had much stronger lighting.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.550
If you have an aquarium with particularly
strong lights, it’s always a good idea to

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.710
start these guys off in a darker area of the
tank because it takes some time for them to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.060
adjust to higher intensities.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.840
While it’s always a good idea to give corals
a good amount of space, you will want to pay

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.780
special attention to placement of Favia.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.310
They sometimes react aggressively to tank
mates situated too close.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.460
They can send out medium length sweeper tentacles,
but some send out mesenteric filaments as

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.950
well to literally digest neighboring corals
alive.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.090
I try to give at least 6” of space and keep
a watchful eye for any signs of aggression

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.920
like their tentacles extended all the time.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.229
Lastly, let’s talk about feeding.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.950
Most hobbyists probably do not go out of their
way to feed Favia and Favites, but it is certainly

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.050
possible to do so, and I recommend trying
to provide them some food.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.530
They are very active feeders and will accept
a wide variety of foods ranging from sinking

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.610
pellets to frozen foods.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.480
I think regular feeding of corals such as
this will improve their overall growth rate

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.790
and help improve coloration.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.560
One warning I always feel I should mention
about feeding corals is to not overdo it.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.050
Overfeeding has some major drawbacks that
in my opinion greatly outweigh the benefits

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.240
of feeding.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.090
I would start slow, and try to do everything
in your power to make sure most of the food

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.680
makes it to the coral rather than blowing
around the tank.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.060
Two things that help with this is to turn
off the pumps to allow food to settle on the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.130
corals, and also to feed at night when most
corals naturally extend their tentacles to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.240
feed.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.760
Over time, they will adjust to feeding during
the daytime.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.270
All right guys, that pretty much does it for
Favia and Favites.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.159
Until next time, happy reefing!
