00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.040
The cross came to represent all of
Christianity. But why?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.230
why not the fish, it's a pretty good Christian symbol. Right? Sure Jesus was crucified

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.189
upon the cross, but

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:19.050
when and why did it become synonymous
with all of Christianity? Because it looked good

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.419
on the top of steeple are hanging from
the end of a necklace? It's true

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.359
it does look better than minnow or trout hanging from a necklace.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.369
Well we're about to find out all about the cross
on this episode of

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:41.369
Chuck Knows Church [fun music intro]

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.400
Today the cross is the most widely
accepted reminder of Jesus' victory over

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.250
death.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
Believing that through his death and
resurrection there is life eternal

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.580
but the cross as a symbol of Christianity did not happen

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.380
immediately after Easter

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.920
during the first two centuries of
Christianity the cross was rarely

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.290
seen as a symbol or an icon. Now some say
it.. depicted such a painful gruesome

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.430
public execution the Christians were
reluctant to use it..

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.550
understandable..

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.930
now some historians point out that

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.330
uh... there is no cross in Christian art
until the fifth century and Jesus

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.850
was not depicted upon that cross

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.360
until hundreds of years after that.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.080
Now why would that be?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.700
Not surprisingly there are several
different historical opinions [whisper] that's right.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.860
[Gone with the Wind voice] "Disagreement amongst members of the church I do declare I am aghast. Oooo" [laughing behind the camera]

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.789
Now be that as it..

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.310
[voice cracks] Sorry

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.909
[clear throat] Be that as it may,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.119
today the cross is seen everywhere as a
symbol of Christianity.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.569
uh... Roman Catholics often show Jesus
actually on the cross known as the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.839
crucifix. Now this is to emphasize

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.959
Jesus as most important rather than

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.150
the cross

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.249
by itself. Then there are the protestant
traditions that prefer the cross without

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:35.249
Jesus intentionally focusing on Jesus
resurrection after the execution on the cross.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.839
Now, whichever way you feel comfortable displaying the cross in church or

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.469
in your home

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.979
or,.. simply on a dangling necklace.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.669
Know that it unites Christians everywhere with the message

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.609
of God's act of love.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.889
To learn more?

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.569
you can ask your pastor.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.319
Tell the Chuck sent ya

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.979
[excited/confused] What? What about a salmon?..

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.119
salmon necklace?

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.329
They'd be swimming upstream. Might be uncomfortable.. No salmon..
