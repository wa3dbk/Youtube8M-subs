00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.240
Yo, what’s going on guys?

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.370
Troy here with WeightGainNetwork.com.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.270
We’ll make all your active work dreams come
true.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.710
I’m fucking super excited.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.160
We’ve got a killer workout coming up today.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.259
We’ve got the upper chest workout routine.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.500
This entire workout is going to be dedicated
to developing the upper chest.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.690
If you’re in a club and you see that sexy
wood rat and you want immediate entry into

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.740
that rat hole, you’re going to go up to
her looking sexy, looking swol, looking like

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.740
a man child.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.480
You’re going to get immediate entry into
that rat hole.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.490
This workout is all about aesthetics, all
about shaping that upper chest.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.750
If you don’t have an upper chest, you’re
going to look like a fucking pussy when you’re

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.190
rocking that V-neck in the club.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.120
Let me dive right in and show you a killer
upper chest workout routine for maximum aesthetics

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.170
and maximum wood rat slaying.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.560
Alright guys, first superset.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.910
We’ve got the Dumbbell Pullover Master Shredder
Superset.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.000
This is one of my favorite exercises.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.470
It really isolates the upper chest.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.399
And the thing you’ve got to understand about
the upper chest is it’s a really small muscle

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.399
group.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.740
You’ve got to go really hard to break down
the muscle fibers in your upper chest.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.040
The thing is a lot of guys are asking, you
know, how many reps do you do on a certain

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.470
exercise, on all of these upper chest shapers,
you have to go until fucking failure.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.680
It’s one of the hardest muscle groups to
develop, so when you’re doing these exercises

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
go 110%.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
You’ve got to go all out until failure the
entire time.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.810
So, let me demonstrate.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.119
So in starting off, the weight’s going to
be right over your head and on the way back

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.070
you want to have a slight elbow bend.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.479
Give it a good back behind your head and on
the way up you want to squeeze your chest

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.460
slow and controlled.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.120
The way you really feel it is you’ve got
to squeeze your chest slow and controlled

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
on the way up.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:02.369
So breathe in.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.650
So it’s going to emphasize wherever you’re
putting that tension and squeezing, so slow

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.690
and controlled.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:20.989
Squeeze and up.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.240
You want anywhere between 8 and 12 on this,
but like I said before you just have to go

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.060
to failure.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.360
The superset, you’re going to be pretty
fatigued with that first one, so the superset

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.750
the weight is going to be right over your
chest.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.750
Try and keep your elbows in.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.640
Go down slow and controlled.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.180
Come straight back up.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.959
All right next up we’ve got one of my favorite
chest shapers.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.190
We’ve got the Wolverine Low Cable Fly superset
with the Incline Bosu Ball Push-up.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.180
So let me demonstrate how to do it.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.099
I’m sure you guys have done the low cable
flies before, but the Wolverine edition really

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.290
shapes that upper chest, so let me show you
how to do it.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.650
You start off in the normal Low Cable Fly
position.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.160
Then you’re going to crisscross your arms
and you’re going to switch directions.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:28.700
You crisscross each set for each repetition
of the set.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.769
Another little trick, try to stand upright
more.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:42.060
Don’t like lean forward.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:52.790
Stand upright.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.200
Right after that you want to jump right into
these Bosu Ball Incline Pushups.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.360
Put your hands about four inches apart and
go down nice and slow and controlled.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:15.040
Explode up.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:29.319
All right guys, last exercise we’ve got
the Eccentric Overload Incline Bench Press.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.729
In this one it’s really important that you
go down slow and controlled because on the

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.789
eccentric portion you’re going break down
more muscle fibers.

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.349
I have a spotter here.

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.150
I’m going to make sure I’m nice and slow
and controlled and go heavy.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.889
Another thing I do to just because I have
super long arms, I know you guys are going

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.050
to ask why I do this, so I put this on my
chest because if you look at my arms, when

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.650
I’m right here I’m already at 90 degrees,
you go all the way back here, it’s putting

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.789
a lot of stress on your shoulders.

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:58.849
I put this down, just this little gage about
where to stop, so here we go.

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:06.740
All right so these are going to be like a
liftoff and then just kind of stay with me.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.639
Three, two.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.539
That’s good.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:37.669
All right guys you’ve fucking smashed that
upper chest aesthetic routine.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.729
Feel it in my upper chest.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:40.849
Ready to rock that V-neck.

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.469
Headed to the club.

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:43.619
Smash those wood rats.

00:05:43.619 --> 00:06:24.039
Get my aesthetics on.
