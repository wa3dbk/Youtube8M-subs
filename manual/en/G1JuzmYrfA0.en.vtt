00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
Itâ€™s really a weekend where you can learn 
from the best, where you can get the best 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000
out of the leaders and use
it for your own business.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I think that the GFG event is very 
important for young, aspiring people 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.000
that start a new business and 
want to make a positive difference.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Don't look how much you have 
to go to go to your goals.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.500
Stand back and instead 
look how far you've come.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because many of you have already done what you
thought was impossible when you started, right?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Fight for a small period of your life

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
to be a champion for the rest of it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500
People are so afraid of the word "NO".

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As long as you get "no" you can be proud 
of yourself because you are doing something.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
Those who are not getting "no" 
they are not doing anything.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.000
By leaving your comfort zone and 
training these new feelings 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.000
they become more and more normal.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.000
Without failure, without disappointment

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:42.500
there is no success. Failure is necessary for success. 
Therefore, failure cannot be the opposite of success. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The event was amazing and it's awesome
what this company sets up for us here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This evening is all for you and this weekend is for
you so I hope you truly learned from this weekend.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.000
Thank you so much for all you're pulling off and make sure
that when you come back you plan for the very next step.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I am glad to be part of this company, it
is great what the company offers us and  

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.000
I would recommend everybody to bring their new
ones, the fresh ones (YPRs) to this event.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Thank you Vemma for this wonderful weekend.
This has been a great weekend for us.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Getting to this kind of trip, meeting new people,
being fired up again, everyone is really nice here.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.000
it is a great arrangement.
