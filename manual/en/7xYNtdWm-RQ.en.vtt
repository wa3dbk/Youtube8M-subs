00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.530
Hello again, I'm Adriaan Jansen, Lead Designer
of Reus, and I'd like to show you more gameplay

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.429
footage of our game.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.990
We were very happy about all the feedback
we received on the first video, so thanks

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.500
a lot for that!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.880
If you missed out on the first video of Reus,
you can click on the link below to see it.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.660
Before we go, take in mind that Reus is still
work in progress and we're working hard to

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.890
make the game as good as we can!

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.680
Now lets get back to our planet!

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.810
Last time, I've ended up with a small Forest
village, who had just started its first project.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.410
Now, I don't owe these humans anything, and
I can choose to completely ignore this project.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.910
But I like the way they're heading, so I'm
going to help them.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.210
To complete this Granary, this village needs
to put 20 Food in use to raise its population.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.670
The Food in Use slowly rises depending on
the Food available within the borders.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.320
This village has 3 Food in Use, out of the
maximum of 5 Food available within borders.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.059
This Blueberry is giving this village 5 Food,
as you can see when I activate this datalayer.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.270
One way to help them is to simply spam Blueberries,
but this is a slow and ineffective method.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.780
I'm not going to do that.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.570
A better way to help them grow, is to create
an effective ecosystem

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.290
Natural Sources, all have a Symbiosis,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.549
and creating an eco-system that makes good
use of these Symbiosises is, the best way

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.570
to influence a village

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.159
I could make use of the symbiosis of the Blueberry,
but I'm going to try something different.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.280
Let's create some animals with the ocean giant,
right over there.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.920
It seems I created some smalls animals, a
nest of Chickens.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.799
Animals have a range of effect, influencing
every patch within their range.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.799
That's why the Food of the chicken can still
be collected partially, even though it's not

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
within borders.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.619
Let's take a look at its Symbiosis.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.619
Excellent!

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.440
They grow bigger if they can feed on the blueberries!

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.420
Let's make use of that Symbiosis!

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.979
Great!

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.350
The Symbiosis is active!

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.700
Look at how much more Food can be collected
now.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.480
The city is now growing significantly faster,
and can grow up to 18 Food in Use!

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.099
Of course the game is not all chickens and
blueberries

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.450
You have foxes who prey upon rabbits and other
chickens,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.569
Maybe Swamp plants who benefit from high diversity,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.020
Another option are Armadillos who tunnel through
Minerals that you place.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.580
In total, there are over a hundred different
Natural Sources to create your own ecosystems

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.190
with!

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.980
But lets go back to our planet.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.700
The Granary Project has been completed, and
the people are celebrating!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.180
Projects also have a Specialization, a more
powerful version of a Symbiosis.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.080
This Granary has given room for Specialized
Fruit Farmers and Woodworkers.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.690
This specialization will benefit from apple
trees nearby...but we don't have any of those...

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.970
Fortunately, completing a project also yields
an Ambassador, who wants to aid the giants.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.060
Let's pick up this Brave Villager with the
Forest giant.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.390
Picking up an Ambassador with a giant will
increase the giant's strength

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.590
As you can see the ambassador is now on my
forest giant's head, and he has also unlocked

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.129
a new ability: the 'Fruit Aspect' ability

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.769
Aspect abilities are another big part of shaping
your ecosystem.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.420
You can change any Natural Source with an
aspect, basically like a sort of upgrade.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.340
For example, I can make my Blueberries more
'Fruity' with this Fruit Aspect ability, but

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.520
Natural Sources can only have a limited number
of aspects.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.170
This Blueberry can only have one.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.739
So let's see what happens.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.170
Here you can see that the natural source is
now boosted by the Aspect, giving extra fruit

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.319
and thus food.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.880
Aspects also give us another option...

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.310
We can Transmute a natural source into a different
one, if we got the right aspects.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.020
The Fruit aspect allows me to upgrade the
Blueberry!

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.930
Ah good, Apple Trees!

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.520
This will give a lot of food!

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.659
The Apple Tree also has a different, useful
symbiosis, that is directly activated.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.609
You can see the massive amount of Food it's
giving, right over here!

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.090
The chicken lost it's synergy though, since
it no longer has a Blueberry in range

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.500
We can simply fix this by placing a Blueberry
within animal range, right over here.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.059
Now there is a lot more food for the villagers
to feast upon than there was before!

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.279
And let's not forget that the Specialization
of the Granary allows the villagers to get

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.930
more out of that Apple Tree!

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.380
With that, I will conclude this second video.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.620
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.710
There are many other developments possible
in Reus.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.520
Next time I hope to show you more about how
a common game would play, with different villages,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.539
goals and tactics.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.580
We're planning to release Reus in the second
quarter of 2013 for PC.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.449
If you can't wait to discuss Reus, you can
join the Reus forums with the link below.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.339
Thanks for watching!
