Hi, it's Laura from cheerbowsupply.com

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.509
and today I'm gonna show you how to make the popular tick-tock

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.300
style cheer bow.  I'm using

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.360
three-inch base grosgrain ribbon 3/8
grosgrain ribbon

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.400
one and a half inch glitter chevron
ribbon

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.789
mystique fabric, iron on vinyl, heat and bond material

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.650
a plastic zip tie and a pair of scissors.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.710
First to cut my base ribbon to 28

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.520
inches long I'm going to add accent
piece of ribbon

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.649
on top of my base this piece of ribbon

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.480
will need to be thirteen inches long.
This part

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.660
only needs to be thirteen inches long
because it's just gonna cover

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.640
1/2 of my cheer bow. I'm going to center it on my base ribbon like that.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.260
To adher the accent ribbon to my base ribbon I'm going to add a piece of heat and bond to the back. 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.090
Cut your piece of heat and bond to the exact length of your accent ribbon. Trim off any extra.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.090
have he in bonn to the back cut your
piece of heat back to the exact thank

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.450
after accent ribbon chairman of any
extra

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.450
use an iron on medium-high heat and
press the iron down

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.610
and lift it up to adhere the heat and bond
to the back up the accent ribbon.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.020
Do not rub the iron back and forth on the heat and bond strip because this could cause

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.020
it to slide back in fourth.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.220
Take the base ribbon and iron out wrinkles that may already be existing.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.220
Peel the paper off of the head and bond strip

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.040
of have the he in band strap and the
backup your accent ribbon

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.100
Position your accent ribbon

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.430
on your base ribbon exactly where you
want it to be. In this case I'm centering it.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.430
 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.090
To iron your accent ribbon down put a pressing sheet between the iron and the ribbon.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.950
this ribbon has glitter on it and we don't want to smear the print.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.130
Next we are going to add

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.990
and I'm charming at to match the same
length as fax EPABX

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.780
peel the paper

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.000
of the back of the vinyl.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.710
place it directly on top

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.710
have your accent ribbon and your base ribbon.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.700
now you can use a pressing sheet again
and you're going to iron it down

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.650
the exact same way that you did with the accent ribbon and heat and bond strip.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.720
it's especially important not to slide
your iron around during this part

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.750
because vinyl stip will move well move. Adding the vinyl

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.760
will give the ribbon finish classy look

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.830
and it will also prevent your ribbon
loops from getting a floppy

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.830
are misshapen look.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.770
for the other side of the ribbon I'm
going to iron on a piece of mystique

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.460
fabric

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.130
to the base ribbon. The fabric I'm using is precut fabric from cheerbowsupply.com.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.640
The heat and bond material is already attached to the back of the fabric.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.460
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.090
So all you need to do is peal the paper off
the back of the fabric

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.090
and position it directly on your base
ribbon.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.740
Use a pressing sheet to protect your fabric

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.020
iron the fabric onto your

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.330
based ribbon. The heat and bond material works quick so you only need about 3 to 5 seconds

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.460
in each section of your fabric.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.400
Don't worry about the space in between the fabric and your accent
prevent

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.440
that is actually at the back up the bow

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.710
and have enough space to help you get a
better crease and it will not be visible

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:19.710
on your finished cheer bow.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.639
To fold and tie your bow, cross the two pieces of ribbon carefully
pick it up and make sure

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.760
that the loops are even and centered
crease

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.590
center back and forth a few times to
cinch the center. Use a plastic zip ties

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.120
I

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.940
to hold the center together but only
Paul the septa half way tie at first

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.130
so that you can check about before fully
tightening

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.639
Check and make sure that your lips are
even

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.669
and your tails are in the position
that you want them to be make any

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.669
adjustments necessary now before you
finished tightening the zip tie.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.500
Trim off the back piece of the zip tie.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.910
of the back piece of the zip tie. To finish
the tails

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.670
fold the ribbon in half and cut at an angle starting on the fold

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.590
and going up towards the open part of the ribbon.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.760
When you open it up it will give you the fish tail look.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 Repeat the same procedure on the
other side.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.950
folding the ribbon and working from the
folded side

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:59.950
up to the open side of the ribbon now
your bows ready to have a center added

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.460
to it

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.040
and this case I'm going to add a center
that is just

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.920
a flat wrap of grosgrain ribbon

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.140
this is royal blue with a swiss dot print.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:24.140
Put glue on the very back of the cheer bow.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.930
Adhere one end of the  three-eighths inch ribbon for the center to the glue on the back

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.400
and then wrap around the front to the
back again

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.870
Trim off any excess ribbon

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:42.870
and then glue the back piece down

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.009
now your bow is ready and you can add
whatever kind of hardware you like.
