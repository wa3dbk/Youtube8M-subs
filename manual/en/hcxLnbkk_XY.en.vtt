Hi, I’m Dean Donnel for expertvillage.com.
Now what we’re going to do is replace the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.650
oil filter. On most of the cars we have, the
older cars your oil filter is in a place where

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.710
you have easy access. So one of the first
things you need to do when you’re going

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.949
to remove the filter is find out where the
filter location is. Unfortunately this car

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.960
takes more work, the new cars sometimes have
very little access to the filter. In this

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.990
case we need to take the tire and wheel off
to get access to the filter to remove it.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:54.000
Move your tire and wheel,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.980
okay now we got easy access to the filter.
We get our oil filter wrench, put it on the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.070
filter, start to remove the filter. Okay,
now that it’s hand tight we can take the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:22.549
rest off by hand, move our pan over, drop
the filter in the pan. That’s how we remove

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.409
an oil filter. We removed the old oil filter
and let it drain completely, the reason we

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.109
let the old oil filter drain completely, we
don’t any old oil mixed with the new oil.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.189
Now we’re ready to install the new filter.
What I like to do is put a little oil on the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.929
seal to make sure that we get a good firm
seal once we put the new oil filter on, take

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:57.659
a little oil. Another important point is you
only want to hand tighten this filter and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.240
make it snug with one more turn once it seats.
It’s not necessary to go ahead and tighten

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:28.450
it real tight with an oil filter wrench. That’s
how we replace an old oil filter and install

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.940
a new one.
