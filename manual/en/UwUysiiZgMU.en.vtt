Hello I'm Audrey Parramore with thebeadingdr.com.
I'm the beading expert and I'm here to show

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.590
you how to tie a beaded bracelet. These are
some of the supplies that you will need in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.029
order to tie off the beaded bracelet. Of course
a variety of beads of your choice and color

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.820
combinations. Here I have a center stone that
I am using and I am kind of using the same

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.210
accent beads to go around that center stone.
I took off a few beads to just show you how

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.410
to put it on the elastic chord that we are
using for the process of how to tie off a

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:47.280
beaded bracelet. So as you can see I am adding
on each bead to the elastic and after I finish

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.080
adding the beads, you know I make sure it
is the same number of beads on each side so

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.900
then you know it balances well after finishing
the piece. Then we are going to take the elastic

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.450
and we're going to tie the piece off and I'm
just doing an over hand knot and I am going

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:21.290
to do another tie. I like to do a few more
just for again I know I say this, security.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:33.229
I'm actually going to do another technique
where I run in back through a bead and pull

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:43.530
it out and I'm going to run it back through
one more and again my famous word security.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:02:06.270
I take my scissors and give that elastic a
good snip. I have one more tail that I'm going

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:23.420
to take through the other end, I ran that
through that end. Coming back through one

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:46.209
more bead and now I'm going to cut that tail
and that is actually how you tie off a beaded

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.400
bracelet. Audrey Parramore, your beading expert,
