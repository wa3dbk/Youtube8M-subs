00:00:01.982 --> 00:00:06.448
When the dry season begins,
the Serengeti National Park rangers get busy.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.509
This is because of the increasing
number of poaching.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.957
Poachers hunt the gnus
that begin to migrate

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:16.969
and the wild beasts
that move along them.

00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:22.925
The park authority monitors poaching
using a variety of means.

00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:27.185
The monitoring plane flies around
the savanna to look for poachers.

00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:39.313
When they find a poacher
and contact the main office,

00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:41.774
monitors will come in a minute.

00:00:47.385 --> 00:00:50.313
The monitors must be armed.

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:55.310
Because it's very dangerous to face poachers
who carry a variety of weapons.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.537
Poacher sweeping is
like a military operation.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:06.728
Poachers are organized in groups and
they use a variety of methods these days
that it's not easy to catch them.

00:01:07.572 --> 00:01:09.680
The ranger found a trap.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:27.215
Poachers laid a noose made out of
wood, wire and tree bark

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:31.029
to catch the grazers
that come to eat leaves and grasses.

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:38.528
They finally found the poachers.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:40.967
The war between poachers
and the rangers,

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.611
the pursued and the pursuer,
continue in the Serengeti.

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.816
There were three of them

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:04.303
and they were all residents
living in the neighborhood.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.230
The poachers made a hideout
in the savanna to stay there for a while

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.078
to skin and dry the animals
they caught.

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:18.043
They poach for game
because they are extremely poor.

00:02:20.918 --> 00:02:24.290

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.151
The confiscated skins
are burned on-the-spot

00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:44.118
in order to prevent black marketing.

00:02:44.118 --> 00:02:46.421
But no matter how hard the park rangers
try to get rid of poaching,

00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:49.081
it seems impossible
to root it up completely.

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:52.237
To those desperate for a meal,

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:55.552
survival is a greater issue than
animal protection.
