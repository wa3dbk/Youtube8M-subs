Hey Guys, it's
Clarissa, and today I'm going to be showing all of you guys my summer morning routine,
as you probably all ready guessed from the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.570
title of this video! I'm going to be showing
you guys what I do on my ideal summer morning

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.620
when I don't have that much going on in the
day, and I can just hang around in the morning,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.039
and edit videos, and hang out with my boyfriend
Brady... he's a dog. Don't tell anyone. Anyway,

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.539
I hope you enjoy this video, and let's get
started!

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.280
So I don't know about you guys, but I absolutely
love sleeping in on summer mornings, so I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.149
usually sleep in until my dog, Brady wakes
me up with his crazy barking, because obviously

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.140
he needs to protect me against everything
going on outside. Because, you know, people

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.100
walking by are just so dangerous.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.619
I can never get straight up out of bed when
I wake up, so we just snuggle for a little

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.280
bit, and I go on my phone to check twitter,
instagram, and snapchat, to catch up with

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.630
you guys and see what's going on in the world.
(music) Once I've checked all my social media,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.840
I finally drag myself out of bed, and today
I was actually a good girl and made my bed,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.250
but we all forget sometimes. (music) Now I'm
putin' on some fuzzy socks to keep my feet

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.770
comfy, and then I'm heading into the bathroom
to start getting ready for the day! I always

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.380
like to brush my hair and brush my teeth before
I do anything else, and then I wash my face

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.729
with my albabotanica acne-dote face scrub,
and once I've washed that off I use my neotrogena

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.600
acne stress control toner on my t-zone, then
I moisturize my face with my favorite derma

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.630
e moisturizer, and I also like to use an acne
spot treatment from neatrogena on any blemishes

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.489
I've got going on! (music)

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.980
Now I'm heading downstairs for my favorite
part of the morning... BREAKFAST!! I love

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.790
to have fresh fruit for breakfast in the summer,
so I'm just grabbing a bowl, and cutting up

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.030
some mango, which by the way is my favorite
fruit, and then I'm adding some strawberries

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.030
and european style yogurt, and then my favorite
gluten-free granola from Trader Joes. Usually

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.450
I like to have a pan-fried egg as part of
my breakfast, but we actually were completely

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.320
out of eggs today, so I'm just dishing up
some extra yogurt and I'm set to go! (music)

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.220
I like to eat my breakfast outside whenever
I can, and since the weather was absolutely

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.199
beautiful this morning, I decided to head
outside and sit by the pond to read the news

00:02:51.199 --> 00:03:01.260
while I eat! (music)

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.130
Once I'm all done with my breakfast, I head
back upstairs to get ready for the day! Sometimes

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.799
on lazy days I just lay around the house in
my sweats with absolutely no makeup on, but

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.250
on this day I actually felt like having a
little fun with my hair and makeup. I'm starting

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.650
off my makeup by applying my Physician's formula
Circle control concealer under my eyes and

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.120
blending it in, then instead of foundation
I'm using a very light mineral powder from

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.720
Physician's formula, just to get rid of any
shine and help absorb oil my face collects

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.609
throughout the day. Now I'm applying a warm
shade from my Elf Bronzer palatte to help

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.190
give my face a little more color and definition,
and next I'm filling in my brows with my elf

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.320
eyebrow kit, and brushing it out to give a
softer look. Instead of a dark eyeshadow,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.660
I'm using the lightest brown sparkly color
from my revlon photo-ready eyeshadow kit,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.130
and blending it in my creases with my fingers.
You guys know that I love winged liner, so

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.829
I'm using my Rimmel liquid eyeliner to line
my top lash lines and add a little wing, and

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.780
if you're ever tired like I am, and you somehow
slip and mess up your eyeliner, make sure

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.100
you have a makeup eraser on hand! I'm telling
you, I'm pretty clumsy, and this thing has

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.910
saved my eyeliner MANY times! To finish off
my eyes, I'm applying my Maybelline butterfly

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.340
mascara to my top and bottom lashes, For my
lips, I'm using a colored lipgloss from Victoria's

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.780
Secret instead of a lipstick, since it's much
more comfortable to wear on a lazy day!

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.250
Moving on to my hair, I'm just curling it
in large sections since curling large sections

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.690
is WAY faster than curling a bunch of smaller
sections, and it also gives your hair more

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:38.970
of a summery, beachy look! To give my hair
some more texture, I'm using a sea salt texturising

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.100
spray from toni&amp;guy, and scrunching it into
my hair to help relax the curls a little bit,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:52.320
and then I'm using some argan oil to help
defrizz my roots, and I'm all done!

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.390
Now I head back into my room to get dressed,
and of course Brady distracts me by being

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.290
way too cute, as usual. (music) For my outftit,
I decided to wear this super comfy lace dress

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.170
from Free People, and then I accessorized
with a long owl necklace from Forever 21,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.490
and no one needs shoes on a lazy day!

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.820
Now that I'm ALL ready for the day, I usually
like to make myself some Green Tea, and oh

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.150
my gosh... can we just take a moment to appreciate
how cute this mug is? Now I usually like to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.100
catch up on some editing, with Brady of course.
Once I finish up my editing, you'll probably

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.650
catch me at the beach or the pool later because
come on, who would want to take advantage

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.620
of beautiful summer weather? So anyway, that's
my summer morning routine, I hope you guys

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.140
enjoyed, and I'll talk to you later!
