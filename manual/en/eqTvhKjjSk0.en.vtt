00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.727
Make this Scrapbook album for Valentine's Day or any other occasion

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200
Material

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:31.505
cardboard of one or more colors, ruler, scissors, pencil

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:37.748
eraser, glue stick

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.652
optional: decorative paper and ribbon

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.100
and what you´ll use to decorate 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:03.511
Take the color you want for the inner sheets, I'll use brown, use the 
 ruler to help you to make the 3 pieces of 11.5 x 32

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.046
then with other color, make a piece of 14 x 29 cms

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.119
and finally another piece of 12 x 35 cms

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.330
you should have 5 pieces like this

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.770
A base piece of 12 x 35 cm, 3 internal pieces of 11.5 
 x 32 cm, and an expandable piece of 14 x 29 cm

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.880
make marks and folds in each piece

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.820
First the base piece of 12 x 35, with the ruler make marks at 
 the top and bottom at 10 and 10.5 cm of the left side

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.350
and at 8 and 8.5 of the right side

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.160
Tip: you can fold easier if you mark the fold previously with the crease-tool

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.420
before folding, check that the piece is well aligned

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.700
fold over the lines you have 

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.070
lets continue with the internal sheets

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Make marks at 8 cm from each edge

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Make marks at 8 cm from each edge

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.100
fold

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400
if you want you can round the edges 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.730
do the same with each piece

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.600
take the final figure of 14 x 29 and 
 make marks at 10.5 and 21 cms

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.020
Fold in the same way

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.630
after that, accommodate the folds, the first inward, and the second outward

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you should have all the pieces already finished

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.290
Then, we´ll work with the internal parts, in my case the brown´s

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.290
Then, we´ll work with the internal parts, in my case the brown´s

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.280
take two pieces, fold this inward, put glue

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.240
align the other piece and glue it

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.330
Note that it is well aligned on both sides

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.300
fold this inward, put glue and glue the last piece in the same way

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.540
the final result is a piece like this

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.550
fold this figure like this

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.800
glue it to the center of the base part, flip the figure 
 to put adhesive, you can use glue stick or double-sided tape

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.030
take the figure, check that it is centered and glue

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:55.230
Open the figure, we will glue the last piece 
 to the center, in my case the beige

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.560
accommodate the piece like this, put glue in the back

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.450
center it well before gluing

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and press

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.350
the album is finished, you just need to decorate

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:21.130
to decorate with deco paper I´ll give you a tip. Make pieces 1 
 cm smaller than the pieces that you are going to decorate

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.630
for example: This piece measures 8 x 11.5, my 
 decoration shall be of 7 x 10.5

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.480
in the album you can put pictures and messages

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.500
make this album in different colors, Iook this other one I made

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600
Just need to add photos

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.900
