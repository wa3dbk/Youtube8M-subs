00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Hi everyone! In this episode:

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.900
Wargaming League. The prize pool of the grand finals is announced.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.900
NOD captain’s blog, 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.380
the first one of its kind.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.760
The results of the “Amazing setup” contest 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.760
and a new one, as well.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.580
We are getting more and more details about the grand finals.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.520
We traveled to the Wargaming e-sports department 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.240
to learn all of the important details at first hand.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.780
The final tournament will have a new system of the prize pool distribution. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.360
The teams will be more motivated for winning each particular battle.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.520
In the decisive battles victory on each map will bring the team 2000 dollars.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.960
And the total prize pool will be three hundred thousand. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.880
So we are waiting for the teams to show beautiful and spectacular play.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.980
I will remind you: we will have live broadcasts from Poland from April 4th to 6th.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.560
You can already view the mind-blowing trailer of this SUPERB event.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.720
The top players manage to find some time for community service while preparing for the main finals of the year.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.720
This week’s leader is SL1DE.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.720
A new episode of the “Science of Victory” is released on March 20th 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.820
and he acted as a consultant for it.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.060
Besides, he uploaded his game configuration to his Vkontakte page.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.020
Now anyone can use the same graphics and controls settings

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.200
that helped SL1DE win numerous tournaments.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
And that’s not all.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
How did SL1DE get into the World of Tanks?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.660
How much did he make this year?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.960
What helps him set his mind on the game?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.480
Read all about it in the interview on the Virtus.Pro website.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.480
By the way, the Virtus’ website 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.040
continues to entertain it’s visitors with interesting materials.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.580
First of all they are the new articles of the “Seven-Forty Two” series.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.140
One is for the players.
And the other one is useful for novice team managers.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.980
You can also find some unique content in the “Blogging” section here - 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.000
The new captain of the NOD started a blog here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.100
He writes a lot and willingly answers readers’ questions.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.460
By the way, the last post is dedicated to ODGIC tournament,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.520
where the joined team of NOD and TAU-GOW took second place.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.740
The winners are Synergy Mix.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.140
It’s time to announce the results of the “Amazing Setup” contest. 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.020
The things we saw when watching the contestants’ replays… 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.920
We picked four works the stand out from the rest. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.280
We were impressed with a setup with four FV304s. 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.300
While the heavies were distracting the enemy the arty were doing their job,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.140
slowly, but patiently and correctly.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.120
Four E-25s and a T71 managed to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.140
outplay five tier 8s in a fair battle. 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.560
Such skill deserves a prize.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.520
A most surprising victory from seven ELC AMXs.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.100
The guys lost two tanks and then miraculously managed to outsmart the enemy 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
and captured the base fast.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.580
Similar tactics were used by a team that only spent 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.180
25 points on the vehicles.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.940
The T49 bravely defended the base 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.940
while three Pz 1c were capturing.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.780
An important role was played by the enemy KV-4.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.580
He shot a track with no damage once and missed his second shot.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.600
Each member of the winning teams gets 2000 in-game gold. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
Congratulations.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.800
And we announce a new contest!

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.680
Many sports teams have a character that symbolizes them.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.920
Think of a mascot for any team of Wargaming League,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.920
draw it and send it to us.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.140
The winners will get 5000 gold each.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.960
And the best work will be printed on t-shirts.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.360
One will be sent to the winner 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.120
and the rest will be sent to the members of the team that the mascot was meant for.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.660
The details are in a special forum thread.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.640
That’s all I have. We will take a little break,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.640
so see you in two weeks. Bye!
