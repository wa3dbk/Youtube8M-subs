(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:05.335
- [Voiceover] Hey ya'll lovelies!

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:06.932
So here's another fabulous DIY

00:00:06.932 --> 00:00:09.812
that is a current big trend, wax pants.

00:00:09.812 --> 00:00:12.749
These uber-chic style not
only have a waxy texture,

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.733
but they can also
replicate a leather look,

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.642
which is my favorite fall/winter style.

00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:21.293
So before we get started, I
just wanted to share with you

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:24.173
some experience I had trying
another popular method

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:26.832
that I got from other
blog sites and that is

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:29.118
to use otter wax, which
is made out of bees

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.319
and plant wax, not otter.

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:35.109
Major fail. I don't
recommend this method at all.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.193
One, it costs more than
what I'm about to show you.

00:00:38.453 --> 00:00:41.076
Two, it's a lot of work
rubbing, melting the wax

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:44.617
all that jazz. Three, it
seeps through the fabric,

00:00:44.617 --> 00:00:48.118
making it feel icky, dirty,
and gross on your skin.

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:52.014
Four, it was a major
let-down in appearance.

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:54.289
I usually test out every
single DIY to make sure

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.707
it's user friendly. So this
tutorial my friend, is a win!

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:00.401
Okay, let's get started. Shall we?

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.287
You will need some fabric paint.

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:05.538
For the black pants, I use
two matte black bottles.

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:08.707
And for the burgundy, I
only needed one red bottle

00:01:08.707 --> 00:01:11.970
a small brown, and a few drops of black

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.756
to get my desired shade.
You will also need one brush

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:17.673
for each pants. I'm using
these foam brushes right here.

00:01:17.673 --> 00:01:20.717
An old container to pour your
paint into. You will need

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:23.510
some newspaper or bags
to cover up your floor

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.352
to prevent any spillings.
Trust me. You will regret it

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:30.613
if you don't do this. And
lastly, you will also need

00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.551
some pair of pants that you
don't mind painting over.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.129
To paint on a darker shade,
I would recommend using

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.065
a darker pair of pants. And
to paint on lighter shades,

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.805
I would recommend using
lighter color pants.

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:45.802
Okay, so let's get down
with this tutorial.

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:47.646
First thing, you're going
to need to cover the floor.

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:50.930
And cover all the areas where
you're gonna make a mess.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.631
For this next part, I'm going
to mix in a brownish-burgundy

00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:59.429
since I didn't see that
at my fabric store.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.192
I would recommend mixing
a trial amount until

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.405
you're happy with the
outcome and know exactly

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:07.437
how much paint you will
need for your desired shade.

00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:11.653
I pretty much used the full
red and little brown bottle

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:15.647
for my pants. I also
added two drops of black.

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:17.552
Be careful when adding in the black,

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:19.829
as it can make a huge difference.

00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:24.034
(jazzy electronic music)

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:32.063
Once everything is mixed well-enough,

00:02:32.063 --> 00:02:34.525
the fun part is to spread on the paint.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:37.124
Try not to load on a thick cover of paint.

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:38.913
You want the first coat of paint to set

00:02:38.913 --> 00:02:40.863
before adding a second coat.

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:43.103
Cover every single area of the fabric

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.412
and start with one side, like the front.

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:48.497
Don't forget to squeeze into
the cracks of the seams,

00:02:48.497 --> 00:02:51.364
the pockets, and the crotch area.

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:57.267
After 30 minutes, the
front should feel semi-dry.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.249
Then you can flip it over and
paint the back of your pants.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.383
A second coat may be
necessary but remember

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:06.149
to let the pants sit for a few hours

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.901
before you paint on your second coat.

00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.759
Be patient guys!

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:14.970
(melodious pop music)

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.628
The black pants is pretty
much the same process

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:20.822
except you don't need to mix the paint.

00:03:20.822 --> 00:03:23.329
I got excited and squeezed
the paint directly

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.313
onto the pants. So, I
recommend that you put it

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:29.460
in a container first. That
way, the paint can spread

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.890
evenly onto your brush,
making each stroke smoother

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.636
and even. Remember to
let the first layer dry

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.932
for a few hours before brushing over

00:03:38.932 --> 00:03:41.393
another coat of paint.
You could take the pants

00:03:41.393 --> 00:03:44.099
outside, under the sun for a quick dry.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.119
Then, you could cover
up any areas you missed

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.288
with the second coat. Let
the pants dry for about

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:53.424
one to two days.Your first
time wearing these pants,

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:56.487
they will feel crisp and
a bit hard. But, once you

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:59.120
break into them, they should feel normal.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.363
For cleaning, you can
hand-wash them in cool

00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:04.427
or lukewarm water. You
can also use a damp towel

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.776
to pat and clean the pants.

00:04:07.945 --> 00:04:10.580
After a few wears, you may also need

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.401
to apply a new coat every now and then.

00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:16.304
It all depends on how you
wash them or how you're

00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:19.299
roughing them out. Okay!
Enjoy your new pants guys!

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.958
Remember to have fun and be creative!

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.352

love with a thumbs up and
