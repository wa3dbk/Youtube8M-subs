00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
What would happen to you if
a black hole the size of a coin

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.831
suddenly appeared near you?

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:06.346
Short answer: you’d die.

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.081
Long answer: it depends.

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:09.961
Is it a black hole with
the mass of a coin,

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:11.503
or is it as wide as a coin?

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.963
Suppose a US nickel with
the mass of about 5 grams

00:00:14.963 --> 00:00:17.083
magically collapsed into a black hole.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.643
This black hole would have a radius
of about 10 to the power of −30 meters.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.465
By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about
10 to the power of −11 meters.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:28.455
So the black hole compared
to an atom is as small as

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.215
an atom compared to the Sun.

00:00:30.215 --> 00:00:31.885
Unimaginably small!

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:35.675
And a small black hole would also have
an unimaginably short lifetime

00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:37.285
to decay by Hawking radiation.

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.455
It would radiate away what little mass it
has in 10 to the power of −23 seconds.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:47.225
Its 5 grams of mass will be converted
to 450 terajoules of energy,

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.246
which will lead to an explosion
roughly 3 times bigger than

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.616
the atomic bombs dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.097
In this case, you die.

00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:57.077
You also lose the coin.

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.872
If the black hole had the
diameter of a common coin,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.133
then it would be considerably
more massive.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.265
In fact, a black hole with
the diameter of a nickel

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.475
would be slightly more
massive than the Earth.

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:11.195
It would have a surface gravity
a billion billion times greater

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.895
than our planet currently does.

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.475
Its tidal forces on you would be so strong

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:18.323
that they’d rip your
individual cells apart.

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:22.393
The black hole would consume you before
you even realized what’s happening.

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.653
Although the laws of gravity
are still the same,

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:28.007
the phenomenon of gravity that you’d
experience would be very different

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:29.847
around such dense objects.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.690
The range of the gravitational attraction

00:01:31.702 --> 00:01:33.972
extends over the entire
observable universe,

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:37.172
with gravity getting weaker the farther
away you are from something.

00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:41.662
On Earth right now, your head and your
toes are approximately the same distance

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:43.122
from the center of our planet.

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.692
But if you stood on
a nickel-sized black hole,

00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.482
your feet would be hundreds
of times closer to the center,

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.222
and the gravitational force would be
tens of thousands of times as large

00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.681
as the force on your head and
rip you into a billion pieces.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.171
But the black hole wouldn’t
stop with just you.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:01.461
The black hole is now a
dominant gravitational piece

00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.051
of the
Earth–Moon–Black-Hole-of-Death system.

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.761
You might think that the black hole would
sink towards the center of the planet

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.101
and consume it from the inside out.

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:14.631
In fact, the Earth also moves up onto
the black hole and begins to bob around,

00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.331
as if it were orbiting the black hole,

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:19.071
all while having swathes of
mass eaten with each pass,

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.691
which is much more creepy.

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.559
As the Earth is eaten up from the inside,

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:26.099
it collapses into a
scattered disk of hot rock,

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.359
surrounding the black hole
in a tight orbit.

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.859
The black hole slowly doubles its mass
by the time it’s done feeding.

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.809
The Moon’s orbit is now highly elliptical.

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.289
The effects on the Solar system
are awesome—

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.289
in the Biblical sense of awesome,
which means terrifying.

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:45.058
Tidal forces from the black hole would
probably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids,

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:47.398
maybe even parts of the asteroid belt,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840
sending rocks careening
through the Solar system.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:52.677
Bombardment and impacts
may become commonplace

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.157
for the next few million years.

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:58.157
The planets are slightly perturbed, but
stay approximately in the same orbit.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.857
The black hole we used
to call Earth will now

00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:03.357
continue on orbiting
the Sun in the Earth’s place.

00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:06.023
In this case, you also die.

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.124
