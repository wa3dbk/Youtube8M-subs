00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.640
With dove season a little over a week away,
Kansas hunters are eagerly preparing for the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.980
September 1 opener. Kansas typically has one
of the highest mourning dove breeding populations

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.740
in the US, and Kansas dove harvest usually
ranks in the top five states. These fast and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.609
tricky fliers are hard to hit, but they are
delicious table fare and provide excellent

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.369
wingshooting practice for upland birds later
on. The liberal daily bag limit of 15 native

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.590
doves helps get the new hunting seasons off
to a great start.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.650
Scouting is an important element of any successful
hunting, and driving county roads to look

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.040
for dove concentrations can help find good
opportunities. Doves often congregate on powerlines

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.350
in late afternoon near good feed sources like
wheat stubble, grain crops, and weedy fallow

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.760
ground. Waterholes can provide excellent shooting,
especially when local birds habitually use

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.690
them on the way to evening roosts. Finding
these places beforehand can make for fast

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.540
shooting on opening day.
Kansas Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism has numerous

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.830
managed dove fields, and some special hunts,
on public wildlife areas across the state.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.540
These are listed and described by regions
under the hunting section of the KDWPT website.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.680
Dove areas, specifically planted and maintained
for excellent dove shooting, are in the final

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.760
stages of preparation to attract maximum dove
usage. Mowing and spraying creates good access

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.460
for hunters and birds alike, and opening weekend
often provides great shooting on these areas.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.140
WIHA and private lands can also offer great
shooting, but get permission before hunting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.910
private land.
A HIP stamp is required statewide to hunt

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.340
Kansas doves, and some public areas are posted
steel shot only. Also, exotic doves have special

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.320
considerations and may be part of the bag.
Check regulations on the website and prepare

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.700
now to enjoy some of Kansas’ best hunting
opportunties this September.
