00:00:01.354 --> 00:00:02.770
Everything's not
going to be easy.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.640
If everything was easy, how
exciting would life be, right?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.412
And if winning was
always easy, it

00:00:07.412 --> 00:00:08.870
wouldn't be as
fulfilling at times.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.950
I found something I
love at an early age.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.760
Very few people to do that.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.500
I found basketball.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.916
I found something I love to do.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:30.065
And it's a passion
of mine to do it.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.870
I worked at my father's
bars, and making the popcorn,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.790
and hauling ice,
and shoveling snow

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.720
to gain money to be able
to go to some basketball

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.390
camps in the summer, or working
for the Springfield Park

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.900
and Recreation Department.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.030
At NC State, we had summer
jobs, and construction.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.811
But I enjoy the work.

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:52.685
That's how I grew up.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.020
I enjoy a good hard
day's work, and I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.832
think it's helped me in
sports, and in basketball,

00:00:58.832 --> 00:00:59.980
and in my life.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.790
I had so many people
in my life that,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.182
from my grammar school
coach, Pat Finn,

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:09.890
from my high school
coach, Dennis Kinney,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.480
to obviously Coach
Valvano, at a young age,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.410
I had a lot of great mentors
that I could look up to,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.900
that guided me along
the path, hopefully,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.920
to do the right thing.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.600
When you're able to do
things in high school,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.420
and be invited to certain
camps, and do things, and then

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.970
be recruited by the top
schools, and then go

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.380
to a top school like NC
State, obviously there's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.880
going to be other
players there that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.980
have the same press
clipping as you,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.860
have scored a ton of points,
have been an All-American.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.354
Now it's a matter of,
how do you fit into what

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:46.270
the coach and the team
needs to be successful.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.254
When I was used to playing a lot
and then didn't my first couple

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:57.170
years and NC State,
you're so used to playing,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.919
and you want to play,
and help contribute.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.400
But at the end of
the day, you know

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.920
you're playing against guys who
are juniors and seniors that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.240
have had success.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.830
So I knew it was a process.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.370
Was it easy?

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.979
Of course not.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.500
Everyone wants to play.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.530
Not everybody can
handle those things,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.610
and not everybody has
the support system

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.941
that I had to kind of help guide
me through some of the tougher

00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:18.440
times.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.460
My father told me one thing.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.070
He says, Vinnie, if
you're good enough,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.450
Coach Valvano will play you.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.450
He wants to win
basketball games.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.810
And I knew if I
stayed the course,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.510
eventually my
opportunity would come.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.780
By doing the things that
Coach Valvano wanted

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.960
from me, and by understanding
that when my opportunity comes,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.809
be ready for it, I
was willing to put

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.975
in the effort, put in the
time, put in the practice.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.840
And I dedicated
myself to the process

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.380
to what I needed to do to
hopefully be successful.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.560
You have to put the work in, you
have to have the right mindset.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.560
And you have to be able
to bounce back at times.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.390
And everyone's going
to have ups and downs,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.931
but it's how you
handle those things.

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:16.550
The adversity part of it is
what builds your character.
