00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.080
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.430
whether the product or
sums of rational numbers

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.550
are definitely going
to be rational.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.850
So let's just first
think about the product

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.939
of rational numbers.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.230
So if I have one rational
number and-- actually, let me

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.938
instead of writing
out the word rational,

00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:17.890
let me just represent it
as a ratio of two integers.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.010
So I have one rational
number right over there.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.390
I can represent it as a/b.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.240
And I'm going to multiply it
times another rational number,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.350
and I can represent that as a
ratio of two integers, m and n.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.280
And so what is this
product going to be?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.975
Well, the numerator,
I'm going to have am.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.640
I'm going to have a times m.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.690
And in the denominator, I'm
going to have b times n.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.004
Well a is an integer,
m is an integer.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.670
So you have an integer
in the numerator.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.600
And b is an integer
and n is an integer.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.770
So you have an integer
in the denominator.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.140
So now the product is a ratio
of two integers right over here,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.770
so the product is also rational.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.480
So this thing is also rational.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.370
So if you give me the product
of any two rational numbers,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.020
you're going to end up
with a rational number.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380
Let's see if the same thing
is true for the sum of two

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.690
rational numbers.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.020
So let's say my first
rational number is a/b, or can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.330
be represented as a/b, and
my second rational number

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.950
can be represented as m/n.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.750
Well, how would I add these two?

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.340
Well, I can find a
common denominator,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.380
and the easiest
one is b times n.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590
So let me multiply
this fraction.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.670
We multiply this one times
n in the numerator and n

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.520
in the denominator.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.390
And let me multiply
this one times

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.882
b in the numerator and
b in the denominator.

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.340
Now we've written
them so they have

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.610
a common denominator of bn.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:02:05.690
And so this is going to
be equal to an plus bm,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.256
all of that over b times n.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.120
So b times n, we've
just talked about.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.810
This is definitely going to
be an integer right over here.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.530
And then what do
we have up here?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.500
Well, we have a times
n, which is an integer.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050
b times m is another integer.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.720
The sum of two integers
is going to be an integer.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.470
So you have an integer
over in an integer.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.940
You have the ratio
of two integers.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.380
So the sum of two
rational numbers

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.290
is going to give you another.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.520
So this one right over
here was rational,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.500
and this one is right
over here is rational.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.040
So you take the product
of two rational numbers,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.840
you get a rational number.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.710
You take the sum of
two rational numbers,

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.160
you get a rational number.
