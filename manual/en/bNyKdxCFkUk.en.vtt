Hi this is Elise for ExpertVillage.com and
in this second part of the video on collars

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.500
we’re going to be talking about collar types
that are used for management and training.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.730
If you’re interested in finding out more
about my services, you can go to the website

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.570
at www.canineheadstart.com. So here on this
table we have 4 different collar types, I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.329
would divide them into a choke collar and
then halter, head-halter, body-halter types.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:46.020
The first one here is a typical metal choke
collar, and typically you’re going to see

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.629
it like this in the store. This actually is
a fur saver choke collar it has long thin

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.269
lengths, if you have a breed of dog with long
hair, this is the kind of collar you would

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.239
want to use. So the way you work with this
collar is you thread the collar through one

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.640
of the hoops until you have formed a circle,
place it on the dog who is ready there with

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.690
his head and you just slide the collar right
over the dog’s head. It’s important to

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.650
note with this collar type, you need to have
the dog walking on your left hand side and

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.509
the loop has to be thread coming out at the
top here. This ring is attached to the leash

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.640
and it must be on the side of the human. This
is a head-halter and it fits over the dog’s

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:53.679
nose and around the dog’s neck. The leash
is attached down here at the ring and with

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.970
this system the dog really cannot pull you
forward, if you control the head, you can

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.490
control the direction and the speed that the
animal is going in. this is fit by testing

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.520
to see that this nose band goes no further
than the point of the nose here and that the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.110
back part here is snug up against behind the
ears and you can fit about 2 fingers into

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.970
there. This might look a little bit like the
kind of harness you see when it clips on to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.540
the back, but that type of body harness allows
the dog’s entire body to pull forward. This

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:50.400
system has the hook in the front so the way
it goes on the dog, I stand – wait and you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.530
take the two pieces underneath the dog and
clip them on. So you have the leash attached

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.670
here to the clip. Again when the dog pulls
forward, imagine my arm is the leash; their

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:15.659
body is going to be turned back towards the
handler. This allows you a humane, non-punishment

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.209
mode of teaching your dog to walk politely
on leash.
