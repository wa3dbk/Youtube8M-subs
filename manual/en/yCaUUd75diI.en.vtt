00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.400
Just the fact that only a few are

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.580
aware of the following truth

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.230
is proof of how great

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.980
the deception is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.050
which keeps the whole world

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.330
going down the road

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.580
to absolute slavery.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.580
There is only one group of people

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.100
that have ever been blessed

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.280
with freedom and liberty,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.480
and that group is

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.240
God's chosen people.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.880
There is the antithesis of this group

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.880
and they are Satan's chosen people.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.780
It is between these two groups

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.160
that the battle for

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.380
the created world is waged.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.050
The Bible outlines the beginning

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.250
of this conflict in Genesis,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.180
and the ending of it is foretold

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.640
in the prophecies

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.280
with the culmination given

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.980
in the last book Revelation

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.450
These two groups

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.110
are not made up of individuals

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.560
based upon their BELIEFS,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.850
but based upon their ANCESTRY.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.780
In Genesis 3:15

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.310
after the woman is "deceived"

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.660
God addresses the SERPENT saying,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.780
The "enmity" brings the war,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.680
and the "bruising" of head and heel

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.280
are the results of the battles waged

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.400
between these two SEED lines.
