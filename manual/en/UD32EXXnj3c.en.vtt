00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.440
This is Yerba Mate.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.110
It has the strength of coffee,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.110
the nutrition of green tea and the euphoria of chocolate.

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.949
At Sambazon,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.320
we're all about Amazon Superfoods.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589
They deliver next level nutrition

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.220
So when it came time to produce our energy line,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.029
we knew exactly where to go.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.630
Yerba Mate.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.080
We had an invitation to come down here to Paraguay to experience the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.410
harvest celebration, and we 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.480
jumped right on it. So here we are

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.200
in the Paraguayan jungle. Welcome.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.040

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.890
Yerba Mate is a rainforest plant that is consumed 10 to 1 over coffee in southern South America.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.370
It is traditionally drunk out of a gourd, kind of like tea. We've been consuming Yerba Mate

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.730
for years.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.610
It's been our go to source for energy ever since meeting our friends at Guayaki,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.380
who produce the finest Yerba Mate on the planet.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.130
Yerba Mate,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.119
You can think of it in terms of having a shot of wheatgrass

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.530
with a shot of espresso

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.580
Yerba Mate offers

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.250
196 active compounds,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.870
B vitamins and minerals,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.390
amino acids and an abundance

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.049
of antioxidants. Once the plant grows

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.880
five to six years,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.310
they harvest it once a year, then it gets

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.330
transported within the community to a drying facility

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.490
Where it gets flash heat.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.680
The flash heat activates the enzymes

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.930
to prevent the oxidation so that

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.100
it conserves and preserves

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.520
all the antioxidant properties

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.040
in the mate.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.290
We've chosen to work with Guayaki because they align with our three guiding principles.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.690
Their mate is certified organic, it's fair trade and it's sustainably harvested.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.489
For us, at Guayaki,

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.369
passion

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.119
is to work

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.369
together

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.929
to bring the sense of community

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.799
and collaboration between cultures and that's the

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.639
reason we grow the mate together with them.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.569
From the seed all the way to the finer product.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.669
Yerba mate has amazing energy properties. We us it

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.479
in two of my favorite products, Amazon energy and our Acai energy juice.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.980
This

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.540
is Yerba Mate.
