00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.190
My position is oriented toward doing applied
production research for California's Mediterranean

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.190
tree crop and I have been working with the
California olive committee on generally the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.280
most pressing production problems and in recent
years it's been economically feasible mechanical

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
harvesting.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.050
The United States is the world's largest table
olive and olive oil market.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.949
Traditionally, olives have been harvested
by pickers wearing gloves and they stripped

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.559
down the branch into a twenty-pound bucket
wear around their waist.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.760
Unfortunately the cost is becoming prohibitive
and labor availability is decreasing sharply.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.500
We started initially designing a harvester
for the tree that we had which was kind of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.620
a mistake because no successful mechanical
harvesting is developed out changing the tree

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.520
and the machine at the same time.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.829
So, over six years we've gone from very large
machines to smaller more compact machines

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.690
and smaller trees.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.050
So, we have two harvesting technologies that
we have examined.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.119
One is trunk shaking and trunk shaking transmits
shaking very well vertically and less well

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.920
horizontally, very poorly down out a branch
like this.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.509
So, what we had to do for those trees is prune
the trees into a very short upright state,

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.070
keep the fruit close to the axis of the tree.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.329
For the canopy contact, a machine removes
the food by agitating it against the branches.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.100
We need a tree that produces as much of the
fruity wall as we can.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.530
So, we want a short tree, no more than 10-12
feet high pruned no more than six feet wide

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.659
so that the branches lop down and present
a fruity wall as much of a fruity waterfall

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.130
to the harvester rods as we can.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.670
Well, we're really hoping is the mechanical
harvesting will be cheaper, be more reliable

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.340
than trying to find an uneven labor force
and it will allow us to sustain an industry

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.119
that has a nice long history in California.
