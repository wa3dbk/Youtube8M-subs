00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:02.917
&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY READY?

00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:03.458
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:04.667
&gt;&gt; 1, 2, 3.

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:05.833
&gt;&gt; DEEP BREATH, BUDDY.

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.750
THAT'S A GIRL. GOOD GIRL.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.542
HI LAUREN, MY NAME IS
DR. ATKINS I'M ONE

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.208
OF THE RESIDENTS.

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.375
I'M GOING TO HELP
TAKE CARE OF YOU TODAY.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:12.042
ALL RIGHT?

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:13.667
A LOT OF THINGS GOING
TO HAPPEN REAL FAST,

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:14.542
HERE, OKAY?

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.417
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.417
KEEP THOSE BIG
BREATHS IN AND OUT FOR ME.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:20.042
&gt;&gt; IT REALLY HURTS.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.875
&gt;&gt; THE TRAUMA CENTER
OF THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.500
OF PHILADELPHIA TREATS MORE
THAN A THOUSAND TRAUMA CASES

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
EACH YEAR, MANY REFERRED
FROM EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
&gt;&gt; SQUEEZE MY
FINGERS HARD AS YOU CAN.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.000
BOTH SIDES.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.833
SQUEEZE THIS SIDE TOO.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.042
SQUEEZE THEM BOTH.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.417
&gt;&gt; TRAUMA ACROSS THE BOARD
IS A VERY COMMON REASON

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:39.708
FOR A CHILD TO COME TO
AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:41.917
&gt;&gt; TRAUMA IS THE LEADING
CAUSE OF DEATH FOR ALL

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:43.333
CHILDREN IN THE
UNITED STATES,

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.875
FAR SURPASSING
ANY OTHER CAUSE.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.167
&gt;&gt; THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
NOT JUST A GLORIFIED

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:49.000
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.875
WE'RE ACTIVATING A
WHOLE TEAM OF PEOPLE.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.542
&gt;&gt; PRESSING ON YOUR
BACK DOES IT HURT HERE?

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.833
&gt;&gt; LEVEL 1 TRAUMA CENTERS
REQUIRE THERE IS A CERTAIN

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.000
TEAM ON THE GROUND AND
AVAILABLE IN THE HOSPITAL

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.125
WHEN AN INJURED
CHILD ARRIVES.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.625
&gt;&gt; SOME PATIENTS MIGHT
GO FROM HERE DIRECTLY TO

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.458
THE OPERATING ROOM.

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:09.250
&gt;&gt; WE WILL TAKE THE CHILD
TO THE OPERATING ROOM ON

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.583
THE DAY OF THEIR INJURY OR
THE DAY AFTER THEIR INJURY,

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:15.000
AND THAT'S BEEN A DRAMATIC
POSITIVE IMPROVEMENT.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.542
&gt;&gt; AFTER SURGERY,
PATIENTS GO TO ONE OF CHOP'S

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:19.167
INPATIENT UNITS.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:22.792
HERE THE EXPERTISE OF THE
TRAUMA NURSING STAFF COMES

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.917
TOGETHER WITH MANY
DISCIPLINES TO PROVIDE CARE

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.583
FOR THE CHILD AND
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:31.125
&gt;&gt; WE DO QUITE A BIT OF
ONE ON ONE EDUCATION WITH

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:33.000
THE PARENTS AT THE BEDSIDE
ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.125
TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.792
&gt;&gt; WE SEND PARENTS HOME WITH
AMAZING CARE SKILLS SO THEY

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.833
DON'T STAY IN THE HOSPITAL
AS LONG AS THEY USED TO,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.917
BECAUSE THEY BECOME PART
OF THE TREATMENT TEAM.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.125
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THESE
INJURIES ARE PREVENTABLE,

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.083
AND MANY OF THEM ARE
PREDICTABLE AS WELL.

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:48.250
&gt;&gt; SO WE'LL EDUCATE THE
FAMILY ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.625
INJURY THAT THEY HAVE.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.000
HOW COULD IT HAVE
BEEN PREVENTED;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.875
HOW THEY ARE GOING TO
PREVENT IT IN THE FUTURE.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:54.667
&gt;&gt; GREAT, YOU GOT
YOURSELF A NEW HELMET.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.042
&gt;&gt; OUR ULTIMATE DREAM IN
ALL OF TRAUMA IS TO BE OUT

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:57.958
OF BUSINESS.

00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.542
IF WE COULD
PREVENT INJURIES,

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.167
THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.583
&gt;&gt; IF WE CAN LESSEN AN
INJURY, THAT'S PROGRESS.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:06.375
IF WE CAN PREVENT A
DEATH, THAT'S PROGRESS.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:09.458
WE LEARN EVERY SINGLE DAY
FROM THE CHILDREN WE TREAT.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.542
&gt;&gt; IT'S REALLY SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:14.708
ABOUT, EITHER THROUGH
PREVENTION OR THROUGH GIVING

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:17.708
THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE.
