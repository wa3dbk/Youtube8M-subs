00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.560
Welcome to the DevExpress Learn Now series.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.290
Quick tutorials to help you get started using
DevExpress controls.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.090
In this video we'll see how the DocumentManager's
MetroUI View helps you to create great-looking

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.150
streamlined Windows 8 inspired applications
from scratch.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.730
So let's get started.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.240
Let's start Visual Studio and create new Windows
Forms application.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.910
The MetroUI View for the DocumentManager is
generally designed to run in the full-screen

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.370
mode, so set the form's 'FormBorderStyle'
property to 'None' and the 'WindowState' property

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.120
to 'Maximized'.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:45.250
Next, Add the DocumentManager to the form.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.510
Open its smart tag.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.379
Click Convert to Metro-UIview, and run the
document manager designer.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.940
Switch to the 'Documents' section and add
three new Documents.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.970
These are main non-visual objects capable
of displaying application content.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.970
Now we'll go to the 'Tiles' section.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.460
As you can see, three Tiles are automatically
generated - one per each created Document.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.180
Let's switch to the 'Content Containers' section.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.720
The TileContainer that hosts Tiles is also
created automatically.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.090
If we run the application now, we'll see three
Tiles inside of the TileContainer.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.000
Clicking each Tile will display a related
Document.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
OK.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.520
So lets get familiar with Content Containers
available in the MetroUIView.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.969
Delete the automatically created TileContainer
and click the 'Add New Container' button.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.280
Select the 'PageGroup' container.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.640
A PageGroup contains multiple Documents and
displays only one at a time.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.079
Let's populate the PageGroup with Documents
in the 'Navigation Tree' section.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.590
Drag-n-drop Documents from corresponding panel
to the PageGroup.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.020
Now, our PageGroup contains all three Documents.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.170
However, all the Documents created are empty
which means the application won't start because

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.049
content for the documents is required.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.950
Let's Go to the 'Views' section and open the
MetroUIView's events list in the properties

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
grid.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.599
We will handle the 'QueryControl' event to
pass a content to a Document when it needs

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.020
to be displayed.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.120
In this example let's fill the documents with
a new RichEditControl for their content.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.560
Now, Let's run the application.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.489
We now see a PageGroup container and three
document shortcuts at the top-right corner

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.730
allowing you to navigate through the Documents.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.150
This same pattern can be used to create other
Content Containers.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.210
For instance, a slideGroup.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.819
A container that displays all Documents at
the same time and arranges them in a single

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.879
column or row.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.239
A scroll bar is available for scrolling through
the Documents and

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.599
on the Navigation Bars you can see three actions,each
for a corresponding Document, plus the 'Overview'

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.489
action which displays the Overview Screen
where all the Documents are presented as Tabs.

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.010
Next,SplitGroups.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.430
Much like SlideGroups, thes arrange Documents
in a single column or row but display all

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.010
Documents inside one screen.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.239
Users can resise Documents by dragging split
bars that detach neighboring Documents.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.220
Note that the navigation Bar actions function
the same way as SlideGroups.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.220
And finally, a Page.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.090
A content container capable of displaying
only one Document.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.599
Now let's see how to mix multiple Content
Containers and build multi-level application

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
hierarchy.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.799
We'll create three new Documents.Note.

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.709
Do not delete the automatically created TileContainer.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.569
Let's Add one more container, for example
a PageGroup and go to the 'Navigation Tree'

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.090
section and populate the PageGroup with documents.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.930
Now, drag-and-drop the PageGroup to the TileContainer's
'ActivationTarget' item.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.200
The activation target points to a container
or a document that will be displayed when

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.549
the current object gets activated.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.049
In our case, clicking any tile within the
TileContainer will display the corresponding

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.810
Document within a PageGroup that contains
all Documents.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.400
Finally, let's run the application and see
the results.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.660
For more information, see our getting started
topics in the documentation.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.420
Thanks for watching, let's see what develops.
