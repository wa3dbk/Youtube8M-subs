00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.099
So, you want Information... 
 and what better source than a cop, right?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.562
Hey Vic. See... great minds think alike...

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:13.169
Yeah, fools seldom differ, dip shit.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.907
You want info? How about this?

00:00:14.908 --> 00:00:20.897
There's a dealer's boat mooring up Downtown today. 
 The dealer's not the trusting kind, and he'll only meet one-on-one.

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:24.379
He's carrying money and coke, and he doesn't believe in bodyguards.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.727
Why should we trust you?

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.150
If I'm lying, genius, I'm a dead man, right?

00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:31.063
I'll meet this guy, Vic. You can watch over me,

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:33.137
and I'll see you down there.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.250
Hey! Get him!

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.780
Over there!

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550
Hey! You! Nosey asshole!

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.453
I thought this guy didn't use bodyguards.

00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:37.167
Forbes's info is seriously out of date.

00:04:37.168 --> 00:04:40.515
I'll get us some transport, you get what we came for,

00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:42.090
and I'll meet you on shore.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.670
I see him!

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.477
Hey! Make sure no one can see it back there.

00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:31.955
Nice wheels...

00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:33.292
I was in a hurry...

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:35.698
The sooner I off-load this coke the better.

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:38.339
This junk heap ain't doing my image any favors.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.576
Hey, catch you later, bro.

00:07:39.577 --> 00:07:42.080
Hey! Don't mind me! Dick...
