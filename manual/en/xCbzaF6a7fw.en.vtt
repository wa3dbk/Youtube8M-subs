Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to add the flour to the margarine.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.870
We are going to add it very slowly and on
a slow speed of the mixer so it would not

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.130
get all over. First we start the mixer and
then we are going to add the flour slowly

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:32.899
into the mixture. I'm going to take the spoon
again and just scoop the margarine from the

00:00:32.899 --> 00:01:10.499
sides so it would get mixed up with the flour.
You don't have to fluff them together but

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:32.590
once they are mixed up together it can be
stopped. I'm just going to scoop again from

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:45.789
the sides to make sure that everything is
going to mix nicely with the flour. Now it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:02:08.510
is done. You can see I'm going to show you
in a minute it is nicely mixed together.
