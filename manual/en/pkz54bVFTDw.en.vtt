00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.569
Hello folks! I’m Daryl Winkelmann with HP's Industry Standard Servers Marketing team

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:20.619
in this coffee coaching session i will be talking to you about the new

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.039
DL360e Gen8 and how this dense platform delivers essential features for

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.160
value enterprises and SMBs.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.509
Whether you have specific infrastructure needs like a domain controller, or more

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.220
general application needs,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.350
perhaps you are running a cluster environment within Windows Server,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.690
the DL360e is ready to deliver.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.890
The DL360e has been designed to support traditional

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.430
300 series customers who value the reliability and dependability they enjoy

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.100
today

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.650
but who might be looking to reduce capex with a lower acquisition cost

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.960
than other servers.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100
It is also designed to support the needs of our traditional 100 series

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.019
Customers

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.389
who look at price as well as essential features like serviceability and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.080
management

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.430
So, what does the DL360e have to offer?

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000
First of all, along with performance, this server provides storage flexibility.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.200
the system supports both large form factor in small form factor hard drives

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.560
giving customers the choice of capacity and speed to accommodate their

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.080
individual needs

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.430
and the optional security bezel provides an additional level of protection to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.409
front of the server

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.470
as a server delivering the essentials

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.719
the DL360e ships standard with Dynamic Smart Array

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.140
but also supports the full portfolio of standup Smart Array cards

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.930
if customer are looking to standardize or need additional features.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.060
Second, serviceability on this server as well as the entire ProLiant portfolio,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510
has improved greatly in this generation.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.880
When you remove the hood on the DL360e, you will see the difference.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.680
We have removed the air baffle so no more obstructed views and cables have

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.110
an improved design and are cleanly routed along the sides.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.240
The PCI riser solutions have an easy to use thumbscrew release for quick

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.190
removal and replacement.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.420
HP's Smart Socket Guide allows for flawless processor installation

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.880
(no more bent pins).

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
And the sliding rails have been completely redesigned so they snap

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.819
into the rack and the server fits easily into the rails …

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.209
and with sliding rails

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.669
is the option for a cable management arm

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.679
(oh, and if you don't desire in rack serviceability, we continue to offer

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.709
friction rails that are improved over previous generations.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.279
And finally, all the Gen8 servers ship standard with iLO4 giving

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.949
customers the quality management they have come to expect from HP –

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.809
but we'll talk more about that later.

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.899
Now let's look at some more of the features of the DL360e:

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.299
It supports up to 2Intel Xeon® E5-2400 series of

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.849
processors, with choices for 4, 6 and 8 cores with speeds up to

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.339
2.4 GHz, DDR3 memory speeds up to 1600MHz, and a

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.729
384GB maximum memory footprint with the introduction

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.080
of 32GB

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.799
load reduced DIMMs.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.309
It can host up to 4 LFF or 8 SFF hard drives

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.390
including SAS, SATA and SSDs –

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.040
that means customers can get up to 12TB of storage in one,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.939
tiny U.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.330
A quad port NIC ships standard for network connectivity

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.019
and a Full height / Half Lengths slot

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.110
and Low Profiles slot (both PCIeGen 3)

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.769
can accommodate most option cards including the NVidia Quadro 4000.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.189
Gen8 systems support up to 94% efficient power supplies

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.180
that work in conjunction with HP's intelligent PDUs and allow for power

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.139
capping at the server level.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.379
This results in efficient use of power and resources and ultimately betters

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.599
your data center's bottom line.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.159
And customers can get up and running quicker, update systems faster and

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.190
resolve issue

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.709
more rapidly with Intelligent Provisioning,

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.769
Active Health and Proactive Support.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.389
The Smart Socket Guide is an HP innovation put in place to solve a

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.699
common customer pain point when installing

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.799
processors-bent pins.

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.999
In the picture,

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.589
the spring loaded latch in tandem with the blue casing around the processor

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:01.400
prevents fingers from coming into contact with the multitude of pins

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.799
which can cause damage and downtime.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.689
Gen8 also comes with HP's new Smart Drive carriers; they are smaller than the

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.409
previous generation to allow for things like more memory in Blade servers and

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.399
more storage in DL's.

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.709
The intuitive design has an activity ring that lights when the drive is in

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.339
use,

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:21.359
fault LEDs that give real time information on the drive status, and a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.229
"Do Not Remove" LED that illuminates when the drive is part of a critical

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.639
operation (like rebuilding a RAID set)

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.160
to reduce the risk of data corruption.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.440
And the PCI cages are easy to remove and replace with the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.160
thumbscrew locking mechanism.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.379
With Gen8, all ProLiant servers have the iLOManagement Engine standard.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.159
This is great news for our customers who asked that we make this enhancement to some of our

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.659
previous generation of server products.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.259
In addition to the remote console, remote power, and virtual media features

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.689
of prior generations, there are four key new functional areas added to the new iLO

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.419
Management Engine.  First, Intelligent Provisioning takes the strengths of

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.199
products like SmartStart, ProLiant Service Pack, and HP SUM,

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.660
enhances them with the latest ease of use features

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.149
and places them where you can use them immediately, on the system board,

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.510
thus eliminating the need to keep track of all those DVDs.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.330
Next, a long-time desire of many of our customers is now available with Gen8,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.180
Agentless Management.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.099
Base hardware health monitoring and alerting functions now run directly on the iLO

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:19.979
hardware,

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.259
independent of the operating system and the processor.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.960
We have placed a lot of time, money, and effort into making the Gen8 line the highest

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.000
quality product we possibly can,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.420
but with any technology, there will be the occasional failure, and some server

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.020
failures can be extremely hard to reproduce.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.009
And they may escape regular diagnostic runs and take a long time to fix.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.409
With Gen8's new Active Health System, we offer an always-on diagnostics system

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.300
that is constantly examining key data about your system:

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.960
for example, constant feeds of thermal data, configuration changes,

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.970
and every alert in order to facilitate faster root-cause analysis and problem

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.639
resolution

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.919
Finally, with iLO Management Engine we also offer faster access to HP Insight

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.089
remote support

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.020
Remote Support, HP's 24x7 "phone home" remote support software.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.699
that concludes this presentation on the HP Proliant DL360e Gen8

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.859
Thank you for taking the time to learn about all the new features

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:14.889
offered in this exciting new ProLiant Server.

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.509
Whether its compute, storage or both in a 1U platform,

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.789
this server has your essential needs covered.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:27.789
I’m Daryl Winkelmann. thank you for watching
