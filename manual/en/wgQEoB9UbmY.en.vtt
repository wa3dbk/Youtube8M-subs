00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.530
What we know is that working with hostile
avoidant families causes a really high level

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.150
of stress amongst a lot of workers, a lot
of anxiety about how to approach these families

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.480
and how to meet the needs of the children.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.740
What we also know from serious case reviews,
from research is that a lot of situations

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.699
occur when people are not able to see children,
which places them at a great level of risk.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.960
We also know that fear of families, and a
reluctance to challenge can mean that in some

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.350
cases children go unprotected and are at serious
risk of harm.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.579
It’s important to look at reasons behind
people’s behaviour, parents behaviour, it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.809
important to look at the reasons why people
may not engage with services.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.629
Sometimes this maybe to do with their previous
experience of services, their own issues,

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.479
mental health problems or drug or alcohol
abuse.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.060
We look at the reasons for this behaviour,
not so we can except it but so that we can

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.119
begin to start working with parents and we
can begin to make effective plans and approaches.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.640
There are particular skills that we can learn
and we can develop to help us to work with

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.930
families and to challenge them in a constructive
and authoritative way.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.790
I base a lot of my work on issues around the
skills of assertiveness, I find that it is

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:41.149
really helpful for workers to develop a repertoire
of things to say, words, phrases, attitudes

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:49.960
which mean that we can challenge parents in
a helpful authoritative way but not lose sight

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.740
of the needs of the child.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.229
We need to be clear when parents behaviour
is getting in the way of a clear assessment

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.380
of the child’s needs, either because they're
confrontational or because they're avoiding

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.960
our work.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.679
We also need to be clear about the impact
of any hostile or aggressive behaviour not

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.110
only on the workers but on the child themselves.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.520
I also think it is important to consider the
emotional impact of this work our decision

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.390
making a lot of the time as well as being
based on what we think a lot of it is based

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.770
on what we feel, we need to trust our intuition,
we need to listen to our feelings, if we are

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.160
feeling frightened or feeling anxious that
will affect how we think and how we plan and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160
work with families.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.580
What we need to do is try to find situations
in our workplace where we are able to talk

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.000
about our fears, how we are working with this
family and how that reflects on the interagency

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.090
network and there are certainly situations
where it is not safe for workers to be working

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.090
with families.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.660
We need to be clear about staff safety we
need to be clear about when it isn't safe

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.900
for workers to be with families, but then
relate that to risk to the children.
