00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.519
The intervalometer of Magic Lantern is useful function to record time lapses

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.150
the timelapses can be done with video or photos

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.880
I dont recommend doing it with video because the resolution is only up to 1920 pixels

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.800
and the file would occupy more disk space

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.649
So what id prefer is to set Manual Mode in the case of the t2i/550D

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.969
and turn on the intervalometer, here you have 3 options

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.629
the first is to take the picture every "X" time

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.800
the second option lets you start the timelapse after "X" time

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.860
so you can step away from the camera and dont move it pressing buttons

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.980
and the last option will determine how many pics you want to take

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.570
the great thing about this is that it shows below how much time will it take to take that many pics

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.350
and at 24 frames per seconds how much video time will it fill

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.740
another interesting function is the Bulb Ramping

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.850
this will let you make very small light changes automatically

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.230
so you can make sunset/sunrise time lapses

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.190
the first option in the bulb ramping is the optimization

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.580
for either sunrise or sunset or auto

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.850
the second option is the maximum light change jumps

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.760
between on photo and the next

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.090
in this case is set to 0.1 f stop

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.000
you have a third option

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.340
that lets you make

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.960
manual light changes as low as 0.001 f stop

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.940
and you have a fourth option that will let you change the focus point automatically

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.490
just remember to turn on the autofocus at the lens

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.000
one thing you have to have in mind is that the white rectangle

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.140
this rectangle position is where the camera will make the light metering for the bulb

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.360
so the first thing you have to do before a time-lapse

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.770
is to take a well exposed pic

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.180
then go to the menu, turn on intervalometer

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.640
select how many photos and time

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.329
the go to bulb ramping, select whether is a sunrise or sunset

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.419
and the put the white rectangle in a good position

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.749
so that the camera can measure the light correctly

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.549
and can perceive the light changes in the frame

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.129
the camera will take a couple of seconds for some processing

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.369
some curves for the bulb ramping

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.329
and finally it will ask you for a well exposed photo, that would be the photo

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.269
you took earlier

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.389
then it will ask you for a percentage of luma

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.699
its complicated but in general terms 50% its ok

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.579
a good tip is to underexpose the phoro when your doing a sunset
