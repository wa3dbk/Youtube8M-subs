00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:25.750
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - I'm Max MacDonald and I
am here with the incredibly fabulous Isis

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.050
King who is in top-model all-stars.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.210
Isis came into your living room and blew everyone
away as being the first trans woman to ever

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.039
enter America's next top model.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.739
Isis thank you for being with us.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.739
&gt;&gt; ISIS KING - Thank you.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:43.749
Nice to meet you.

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.199
And fashion designer, actress, and motivation
speaker.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.399
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - (laughs) and slash slash.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.749
So the first question that has been lighting
up twitter when I told people that I was going

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.219
to be interviewing is how do you feel about
the whole controversy around the whole Miss

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.219
Canada Pageant?

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.520
&gt;&gt; ISIS KING - I told somebody yesterday,
I didn't think it was that big of a deal because

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.590
I know top model is different but I did the
same thing four years ago.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.380
So I was just wondering why are we still on
the same issue?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.770
But I am happy that now the rules are changed,
I wish Jenna so much luck.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.109
She's beautiful and she's going to do great.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.030
But yeah we were there four years ago, like
let's move on people.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.030
If you are trans, you are born in the wrong
body, the whole contest was based on beauty.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.850
If she looks good enough, let her in the contest.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.229
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - Now I know people who are
going to ask what did you mean by "top model

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.690
threw me off my path a bit"

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.740
&gt;&gt; ISIS KING - Okay top model threw me off
my path meaning, I originally moved to New

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
York to transition but to also pursue my career
as a fashion designer.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.750
And when I did top model I became this reality
star and this top model so I focused on that.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.539
And then I put design into the backburner
because I'm like oh my god, I have this amazing

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.539
opportunity.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.710
I'm going to focus solely on that.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.360
So I kind of put my talent, well my other
talent in the closet and now I'm like pulling

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.660
it out and I'm definitely focused on everything,
not just designing but all of the things that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.470
make up who I am.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:29.020
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - With us both being black
we know that sometimes the black culture cannot

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.710
be the most welcoming to anything different.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.300
So how were able to push through the forest
and actually become yourself Isis.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.280
&gt;&gt; ISIS KING - In the black culture I would
be considered at the bottom of the totem pole.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.260
Just because of the taboo.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.970
Gay and lesbian are still in between being
accepted or not.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.150
Transgender is like... so like I said normality,
I'm bringing that and I want the world to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.340
see that just because you transition doesn't
mean you are going to be a different person

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.340
you know?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.400
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - I completely get that.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.879
What would you say to a trans young who watching
this right now at home?

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.680
&gt;&gt; ISIS KING - I would tell them to follow
your dreams, not allow the circumstances to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.610
make up who you are inside.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.040
Don't allow to hinder your blessings your
opportunities .

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.560
&gt;&gt; MAX MACDONALD - Thank you very much Isis,
this was a pleasure.ï¿½
