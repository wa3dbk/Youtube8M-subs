00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.810
In today's tutorial I'm going to show you
how to install Magic Zoom Plus in Magento.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.830
My product image looks flat.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.200
So I want to change that from this to

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.219
this.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.340
Do you see how the image completely changes
by having a zoom effect.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.820
Add to that the enlarged option, my image
now looks really impressive.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.330
To get this effect we need to go to the Magic
Toolbox website.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.770
You can also use this video to install Magic
Zoom because the process is the same.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.590
Today though we're going to install Magic
Zoom Plus, so if we go to the main product

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.330
page, you'll see the Magento icon on the right
hand side which will take you to the Magic

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.030
Zoom Plus for Magento page.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.890
Click the download button and save the zip
file to your computer.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.010
Extract all the files.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.780
And the magic zoom plus folder is what we'll
upload to our server.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.940
I'm going to use FileZilla for this.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.420
Find the magic zoom plus folder on your computer
and upload it to the Magento directory on

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
your server.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.170
This will take a few moments so pause the
video here and start again once your folder

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.610
has uploaded.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.080
My files have now finished uploading and you
can see my magic zoom plus folder is showing

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.330
here.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.210
Next we need to disable the compilation process.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.860
We can do this by going to System, Tools,
Compilation.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.020
You can see my compiler status is Enabled
so I need to disable it.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.810
Next we're going to install Magic Zoom Plus.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.610
To do this enter your Magento website url
and after it enter magic zoom plus.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.600
You'll be taken to this page and all you have
to do is click Install.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.750
Now go back to the Compilation page we were
just on and this time click Run Compilation

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.750
Process.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.530
Of course, if you don't use the Magento compiler
then you don't need to do this step.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.509
Next we need to clear the cache.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.140
Go to Cache Management.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.629
Select all.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.029
Make sure the Action says Refresh and click
Submit.

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.930
Magic Zoom Plus is now installed.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.739
If you refresh your product page you'll see
it in action.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.629
Remember to only upload large images as they'll
be used for the zoom and enlarge effects.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.379
Magento will automatically resize the large
images to fit other areas of your website.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.569
Now that Magic Zoom Plus is installed let's
make a couple of changes.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.459
First we'll change the zoom size.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.010
Then we'll change the background color around
the enlarged image.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.579
To do this, go to the Magic Zoom Plus settings
page.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.809
Scroll down to the Zoomed Area Width option
and I'll change this to from three hundred

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.680
to five hundred.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.739
I'll change the Zoomed Area Height to four
hundred.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.340
Scroll down to the Background section and
change the Opacity to fifty.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.599
The background color is defaulted to black.

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.999
I'm going to change this to red.

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:18.930
So if we fresh our product page you can see
the zoom area is now bigger and the enlarged

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.900
background color is red.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.629
There's so many simple customizations you
can make which look really effective.

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:34.549
Try all the options on the Settings page and
see what works best for your Magento website.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.559
As well as adding Magic Zoom Plus to your
product pages, you can also add it to your

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:40.559
CMS pages.

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:46.650
First you'll need to select Yes next to the
Include Headers on all Pages option.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.799
This will bring in the CSS and JS files to
your CMS pages.

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.170
You can see at the moment my home page is
blank.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:06.170
To change this Go to CMS, Pages, Select the
page you want Choose Content and select the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.449
HTML icon.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.129
This will open a HTML window.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.750
Next, go to the Magic Zoom Plus Integration
page.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.000
Under point four of the Installation section,
copy the code shown and paste it into your

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.660
HTML window.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.770
The href reference is the large image which
will be your zoom and enlarge effect.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.630
We have the Magic Zoom Plus class and the
image source is the small image which will

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.340
appear on your web page.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.150
So I'm just going to enter my large and small
image references.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.600
Click Update And save your page Now if we
refresh our home page You can see Magic Zoom

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.340
Plus is now working.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:58.150
At the top of each page on our website is
a Contact Us link.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.280

our tools, just get in touch.

through, we'll get back to you the very next

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.430

And that brings us to the end of this tutorial.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.790
