00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.420
Hi I'm Craig Jackson. Today we're going to turn this into this.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.780
Sometimes blanks are waxed to hold in moisture. We're going to scrape
that off before we get started.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.720
We'll first mark out our center, so we can
align our faceplate. We're using good

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.160
heavy screws to make sure our faceplate
is very secure.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.719
All Easy Wood Tool Faceplates include a washer. We'll put
that on first. Now we'll install our

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:51.770
faceplate all the way until it's flush.
Again with our Easy Rougher to make the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
blank perfectly round.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.760
When roughing, just travel the tool
slowly and let it do its work.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.940
Using just the left edge of the Easy Rougher,  we'll start shaping our tenon.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
Eventually that's what our chuck will
grab onto.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.060
Once we get too far over our tool rest, we'll move the tool rest around to the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.080
front and simply plunge the rougher into the work.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.960
We continue using the Easy Rougher while we define the rim of the
bowl.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.900
Once we have the basic shape roughed out,
we'll switch to our Easy Finisher and use

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.630
the round cutter to create the outside
curve of our bowl.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.280
The Easy Finisher makes it easy for us to blend our bowl into the rim.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.000
Now we'll clean up the bottom and
slightly undercut it, so it will sit

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
flat on the table.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.420
Rounding over the rim is easy with the
round cutter on the Easy Finisher.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.840
Before we turn the bowl around and start
hollowing, we'll make one last pass over the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.920
outside curves with the Easy Rougher to
cut down on our sanding later.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.280
Finally we add a little shoulder cut to
make it a bit more interesting.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.060
We use the Easy Detailer to put a taper
on the tenon to match the jaws on our chuck.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.900
After the final inspection we'll take it
off the lathe to remove the faceplate.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.720
As you can see here, the holes left by the
screws will be removed as we hollow out

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.660
the bowl.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.100
After we screw on the chuck,
we'll hold our bowl with one finger in the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.650
center, to make sure it's flat as we
tighten down.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.300
Spin the chuck by hand to make sure your bowl doesn't wobble. If
needed, use the tool rest as a guide and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.790
lightly tap the bowl until it spins true.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.140
We always set the tool rest height so the top of our cutter is lined up with
the center.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.620
First we'll flatten it out so we're
starting from a level surface.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.240
For this design, we're going to imagine the outside
curvature of the bowl continues through to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.040
the top and mark that spot as the
outside of our bead.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.140
Now we'll make another mark for the inside of our bead.
And make sure it's the same thickness as

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.950
our rim.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.540
We'll clear away some material to
help define our bead.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.960
Now with the Easy Detailer, carefully
round over the bead.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.160
Now it's time to get hollowing. We're
going to use our Easy Finisher and

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.440
slowly slide it back and forth, while
being careful not to get close to the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.880
bead.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.060
Anchor the handle to your side to make smooth, controlled cuts.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.360
I like to make the inside match the
outside, so we have a uniform wall

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
thickness all the way from the rim down
to the bottom.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.240
The moisture from greenwood can cause
rust to form on your tool rest. We'll use

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.850
some 0000 steel wool and we'll scrub
off the tool rest at the bottom of our

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.850
tool. That will smooth things out.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.400
Move the tool very slowly for the last
few cuts. The slower we go, the less we sand.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.879
Once the thickness is uniform,

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:04.689
we're done. I love turning beaded rim platters
with my Easy Wood Tools. I make the

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.449
big ones, I make the small ones and
they're all fun.

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.489
I think it's time for you to go make your own.
