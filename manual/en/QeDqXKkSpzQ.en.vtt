00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.960
How to Calculate Your Body Fat Percentage.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.490
Your body fat percentage helps you determine
your diet and exercise needs.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.299
The number gives you an idea of how much of
your body is composed of fat, muscles, and

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.299
tissue.

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:25.020
You will need Caliper Body density equation
Body fat percentage equation Fat percentage

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.210
scale Trained expert (optional) and online
calculator (optional).

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.890
Step 1.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.379
Know the body fat ranges to aim for if you're
a woman.

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.079
10 percent body fat is the absolute minimum;
athletes tend to be in the 14 to 20 percent

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.079
range.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.300
Fit people are at 21 to 24 percent.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.210
25 to 31 percent is acceptable, and 32 percent
and higher is too much.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.719
Step 2.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.440
Know the body fat ranges to shoot for if you're
a man.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.769
For men, 2 to 4 percent is essential, athletes
are 6 to 13 percent, fit men are 14 to 17

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.769
percent, and 18 to 25 percent is considered
acceptable.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.440
26 percent or more is considered excessive.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.930
Step 3.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.960
Prepare for taking your measurements.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.580
Don't drinking too much water or exercise
2 hours before taking measurements as this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
can skew the body fat percentage scores.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.170
Step 4.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.260
Locate the sites for skin-fold measurements.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.690
For men, the sites are diagonally on the chest,
and vertically on the abdominals and thighs.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.170
For women, the sites are vertically on the
triceps and thighs, and diagonally on the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.140
suprailiac, which is midway between the hip
joint and the rib cage.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.850
Step 5.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.610
Use a caliper to take skin-fold measurements.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.920
Pinch and pull a fold of skin using your index
finger and thumb.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.990
Use the caliper to take a measurement one
centimeter away.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.100
Wait a few seconds for the fat to compress.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.940
Take the measurements from your right side,
and take two from each site.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.940
Have a trained professional take skin-fold
measurements to get the most accurate numbers.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.300
Step 6.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Add your skin-fold measurements, and enter
the sum into the body density equation to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.539
calculate your body density.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:17.269
For women, the equation is .0000023 times
the sum squared, minus your age multiplied

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:29.569
by .0001392, minus .0009929 multiplied by
the sum, plus 1.0994921.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:48.219
For men, the numbers are .0000016, .0002574,
.0008267, and 1.1093800.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.000
Step 7.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.780
Determine your body fat percentage by dividing
495 by your body density and subtracting 450.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.749
To avoid number crunching, use an online calculator
to determine your body density and fat percentage

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.879
based on your skin-fold measurements.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:04.879
Step 8.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.069
Take a bioelectrical impedance analysis using
a fat-percentage scale if you want to bypass

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.069
the math.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.530
The scale sends a low-voltage electrical current
through your body to measure your fat percentage.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.720
Electricity goes faster through fat-free mass
like muscles.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.870
Step 9.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.390
Understand that the error rate for these methods
can be as high as 8 percent, but your body

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.530
fat percentage range will give you a good
idea of your body makeup and what goals you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.530
should aim for.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.280
Now you know your body-fat percentage, and
can set accurate goals.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.670
Did you know According to the Centers for
Disease Control, Mississippi had the highest

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.980
obesity rate in 2009 at 34.4 percent.
