Hi, I’m Mitch Warren with the Purdue University 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.540
Office of Admissions. And first, I wanted to say

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.410
“Thanks!” Thanks for considering Purdue as a potential option

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.750
for your higher education. We’re most sincerely complimented in

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.440
your interest in Purdue. We wanted to provide this video to cover some

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.380
information that we thought would be helpful

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.210
as you are preparing to look at your admissions decision or perhaps you’ve

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.190
already done so.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.920
And this is really whether you are the student, the parent or a family member

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.059
who’s involved in the process. The decision we wanted to talk about

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.890
is called “denied/offered alternate major.”

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.280
And despite the way this sounds initially, it’s actually good news.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.760
What it means unfortunately is that for many of our high-demand,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.049
incredibly competitive majors, we’re not,

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.739
unfortunately, able to offer all talented students a spot

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.179
in that major on our West Lafayette campus.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.260
But what it means is for you, we think you would be a great Purdue student, and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.649
we hope that you would consider some other options.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.049
So how would you do so? Well, if you’re in the area,

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.619
you’re certainly welcome to just pop in to the admissions office. We’re happy to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.420
chat with you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.770
in person. For most people, for whom

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.850
it’s not a reasonable drive, we would encourage you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.060
- give us a call. Actually, chatting over the telephone

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.229
is honestly probably one of the best and most simple ways to cover some

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.049
information.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.659
Certainly you can investigate options on the web,

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.060
see what majors might be of interest to you.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.039
And once you’ve chosen another academic program,

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.509
completing an online form is really quite simple

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.549
and really takes very little time. You complete the form,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.149
you submit it, and your case will go back to the admissions

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.520
committee. And hopefully, the news you have at that point

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.170
will be that you are an admitted student and on your way to becoming

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219
a Boilermaker. Again, thanks for your interest in Purdue.
