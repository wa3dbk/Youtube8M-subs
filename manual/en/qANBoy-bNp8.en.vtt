00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.109
Hey YouTubers. Thank you everyone that
came to my Marvel Q&amp;A the other day.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.639
Just in case you didn't make the stream
I'm uploading part of this video

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.349
but there's also been some, like, really big
rumors flying around this morning. So

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.600
Batman versus Superman might be two
films, I kinda think it's bullcrap.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.520
There was an image that was posted, this
is what it looks like, I'll put it up right here.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
I don't think this is the real deal, I
think somebody just did this in Photoshop.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.230
The first trailer is supposed to come
with Jupiter Ascending on February 6th

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.550
so hopefully we'll find out
then whether or not it's real.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.420
There's also new trailers for Arrow Season 3

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.579
and The Flash that feature a bunch of new
characters so I'm gonna do videos for

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.770
both those two next.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.540
They'll be two trailer breakdowns and I'm
also working on a Sherlock video.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.879
While I'm working on those videos please
enjoy some of this Marvel steam, just

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.690
bear in mind that it's
pretty raw, I mean it's unedited.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.760
Hey everybody.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.380
How's it going?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.640
I decided to fire up Prison Architect.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.460
I don't have any Marvel games loaded on
my computer right now

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.280
all my Marvel games are on my mobile phone,
on my iPhone.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.220
Uh, I mean Spider-Man, you know, I mean yeah.
Marvel could probably do something more

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.790
interesting with the character but

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.270
no, I mean I don't care if he's, if he's not
in Avengers then, like, I'm not gonna care.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.799
They already have like way too many
characters that are going to be in that next movie.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.840
in the third Avengers movie.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.100
Uh, Hawkeye Ant-Man GIF.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
Uh, know I did not see that. He is, like,
Jeremy Renner,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.049
um, said that he is putting his suit back
on for another Marvel project.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.329
Most believe that it's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.
because that,

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.770
like, there will be an Avenger, like a
real deal Avenger

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.100
from Age of Ultron on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and
he is just, like, one of the most likely candidates.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.600
The current plot in Agent Carter, well, we
actually, I mean we don't know enough. I think

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.450
the way they explained it in the episode
is that there's about six pieces

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.450
of Starktech and that, um, that formula

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.649
was just one of them. So I think that
that is going to be

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.509
the thing that they chase around, like those
different things that got stolen.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.740
so Dominic Cooper isn't in every episode

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.670
or not in like a big way. It's mostly
based on Peggy Carter so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.480
when he said "I'm gonna go to Europe
and chase down the ones that are there"

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.760
that was, like, his excuse to, like, get
him

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.549
off-screen. Uh, so Peggy Carter is mostly 
gonna be staying in the United States

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.169
tracking down the stuff that's, you know,
been stolen in the United States.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.980
Map Easter egg, Black Panther. Uh, yeah. There
was a Namor,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.409
there was a Namor Easter egg
in the first Captain America movie too

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.569
for Atlantis. That doesn't mean that
they're going to use him.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.379
The rights issues for Namor are a
little fuzzy.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.339
I think Universal might still have the
rights for him otherwise, like, they probably would have

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.629
mentioned him in a bigger way. Agent Coulson is director

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.560
yet Nick Fury's in the movie. Um, yeah, the movie's
gonna explain that.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.980
Yeah don't, like, don't get too worried
about stuff like that. The Cinematic Universe

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.829
and their television shows, they're all
connected but they have like their movie

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.030
cast and they have like their TV cast.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.769
the reason why you see, and DC does this a
lot more, the reason why you see, like,

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.389
some actors get recast, like in the DC
Universe,

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.000
they'll recast TV actors roles with movie
actors,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.459
you know, when it gets to like the, you
know, 2, 3,

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.639
$400 million dollar level, they feel like
the

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.940
TV actor, whoever they cast, can't open

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.099
like a $150 million dollar movie. That's
mostly like a financial decision

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.519
they feel like those movie people have a
broader appeal

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.260
internationally. So they're talking like
China, people, like, places outside the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.109
United States

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.030
which I'm sure there are a bunch of you in
in the channel here that are actually from

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.669
outside the United States. So it's like

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.940
different actors are popular inside the
United States than outside. So like

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.440
Tom Cruise, not really popular in the
United States,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.260
super popular internationally which is
why he still gets hired to make movies and gets paid,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.849
you know, the amount of money he does. Stark and
Vanko's plans.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.730
Vanko was actually one of the coolest
things, I got so excited when I saw him.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.620
I read he was gonna be in the series, I
just, I didn't know how they were going to use him.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.540
So the, when they went to see him

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.919
to get information about the bomb, the
 nitromene,

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.479
it was at Stark labs. So this is like
some time before they had their falling out

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.060
And if they get a season 2, maybe they'll
explore that more

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.739
but I don't think that Vanko is going to
be as big a part

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.839
early on. I think they'll just go to
him every once in a while. They'll, um, yeah. This,

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.950
like, the eight episodes, they wrote it, you
know, assuming that they were not gonna

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.719
get season two so it's not like there's
going to be a big hanging

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:34.659
plot. I mean they'll throw, like they'll probably
announce whether or not they're going to renew it

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.300
before the, before it's over but they
wrote it so that it's, like, a fairly

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.710
satisfying conclusion.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.000
And they're building towards, like, something
big. I mean, I have no idea what

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.880
but it'll presumably explain how the show's
connected to the movies in a bigger way.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.000
Teaser before Jupiter Ascending. Um,
there're, like, yeah. There're a lot of, like,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.919
likely candidates for teaser dates. Super
Bowl's one of them.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.800
The problem with the Super Bowl is
that it's, like, four million dollars

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.060
or like two million dollars

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.650
for, like, a 30-second spot so if they do
air a trailer

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.960
during the Super Bowl it'll be, like, a
30-second version of

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.340
the trailer and then they'll be like "Go
online to see the full trailer."

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.020
you know, which is kind of douchey, kind of a douchey thing to do.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.639
Warner Brothers will do like a really
big

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.770
Marvel style Comic-Con panel, they're
planning one,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.340
because they'll actually have footage for
Batman versus Superman. Like

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.719
this past year at Comic-Con they had, like they
had just started

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.019
filming so they really didn't have much. Yes, yeah I'll be doing weekly Agent Carter videos.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.219
I'm more worried about Daredevil.
Daredevil actually, so April 10th,

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.490
they actually moved it up. Originally it was listed
for, like,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.000
May the 1st which is the day that Ultron,
Age of Ultron comes out.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.460
So they moved it up so like what they're
doing is, like, to get you

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.469
thinking about Marvel things they'll
have Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.219
and then they'll have Daredevil so it'll be,
like, them, like, shooting, like,

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.380
a Marvel shotgun at your face. You know, they'll be running

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.389
all kinds of, like, crazy Ultron ads. It's gonna be fun. Like,

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.690
April, May, June will be like crazy Marvel
time.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.610
Um, yeah actually. Um, for some reason
comiXology does not have like a social

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.279
page where it's, like, you can go and, like,
visit a profile where you can see, like,

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:18.349
the stuff that I buy.

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.960
Most of the comics that I'm buying right now
are Marvel,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.630
um, and Image Comics. So like my favorite

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.830
new comic right, now like my brand new one is
Manifest Destiny.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.019
The Ant-Man comic, I bought the Ant-Man comic that
they just, they restarted it. It's like Ant-Man

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.700
number one with Scott Lang

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.920
and he's working with, it's like

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.020
kinda tying in with Stark
Industries and Tony Stark. It looks like

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.120
it's gonna be fun. Ant-Man is, like, a
really weird character. I think that

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.800
they're just trying to create more
awareness

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.890
for, like, the Scott Lang character
so that people are,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.340
you know, kind of understand where he's
coming from. He's very different from,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.710
like, the other Marvel heroes.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.090
Just because the Arrow and Flash
trailer videos are pretty easy for me to

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.410
get out, I'm gonna post those videos next
so be sure to subscribe to get everything.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.540
In the meantime, you can click here to
watch the Ant-Man trailer again.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.820
I know it sounds weird, it's gonna be an
awesome movie, it'll be a lot of fun. And

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.460
click here for my Agent Carter review.
Thank you so much watching, so let's all high

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.730
five, I'll see you guys tonight.
