Today on Sciencey Stuff we're going to be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.180
picking up an ice cube with a piece of string!

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.020
So...

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.150
For our picking up our ice cube with a piece
of string we need salt, some string, a plate

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.160
and some ice cubes.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.310
I shall go get those now!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:46.560
&gt;&gt;Door shuts
Okay we have our ice cubes, slightly melting

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.230
but that’s okay!

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.690
&gt;&gt;Ice cubes clattering
This one's too melt...

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
We'll try this one.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.690
Okay.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
So we have an ice cube and we are going to
place it on our plate.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:08.650
Get some string and we ore going to get it
wet 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:18.500
and we place it on our ice cube and we get
some of our salt and put some salt on top

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.979
of our ice cube.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.180
We wait 'bout a minute.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:33.210
&gt;&gt;Watch Beeps
Okay about one and a half minutes.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210
Oh it's stuck to the plate...

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.940
There we go.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:47.400
We have successfully picked an ice cube with
a piece of string!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.509
The reason we can pick up ice cube with a
piece of string is its an endothermic reaction

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:05.700
meaning that the salt takes heat from it's
surroundings and i-it um... like the string.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.920
The salt will take heat from the string of
the wet string that’s because we wetted

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.170
it so now the string is wet.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.980
So when its wet and losses heat it starts
to freeze so when the string starts to freeze

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.940
because it has water in it will stick to the
ice cube.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.440
And that is why we can pick up our ice cube
with a piece of string!

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.769
Stay tuned next week when I am going to make
a tasty science treat!
