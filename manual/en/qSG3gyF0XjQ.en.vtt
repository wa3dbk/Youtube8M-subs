00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:12.416
[Tim Hawkinson: Family Resemblance]

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.055
The first piece, as you walk into the space,

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.477
is a railroad signal crossing lantern.

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.700
We can unlock it and I can lower it for you.

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.540
[INTERVIEWER, OFF-SCREEN] Oh, okay! That would be very...

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.277
[HAWKINSON] An action shot.

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:31.510
[INTERVIEWER, OFF-SCREEN] Yes, please!

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.815
[HAWKINSON] I'm going to get the key.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.078
Could we get the key?

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.992
Okay, there we go.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.889
Yeah, so...

00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.340
It's a butt-head Fresnel lens,

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:52.247
using the same body molds that I used in the seahorse

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.140
and then in the lens-mobile.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.942
The title is "Double Dutch".

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.679
All the pieces in the show take their titles from Girl Scout cookies,

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.448
and some of the cookies are retired Girl Scout cookies.

00:01:07.448 --> 00:01:08.571
Some are more...

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.943
ones we're maybe more familiar with,

00:01:10.943 --> 00:01:12.278
like Samoa.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.077
Kookaburra, I think.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.139
But there are no Thin Mints.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.972
Nothing quite worked as a Thin Mint.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.081
My daughter Clare is a Brownie.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.909
A couple of months ago, she was in the process of making sales,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.647
going door-to-door with her list of Thin Mints

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:43.416
and Tagalongs, and all that.

00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:46.109
My favorite is Samoa.

00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:50.216
I won't stick my tongue out, I just had coffee.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:51.879
[LAUGHS]

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:54.879
I suppose I was working on the bronze figure--

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.448
me with my tongue sticking out...

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.804
The tongue sticking out had this very aggressive expression,

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:06.016
like a Samoan war cry.

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.543
I thought that would be a possible title,

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.602
and then started looking at other Girl Scout cookie names

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.278
as possibilities for other pieces,

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:18.006
and some of them sort of fit almost like they were intentional.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.803
There are things in the show that I have made with Clare through time.

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:31.941
She kind of has given me ideas.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:34.418
It's somebody now to bounce ideas off of,

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:37.143
as well as to get this different perspective.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.448
She kind of appears in different guises.

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:54.542
Maybe a little bit in the foot,

00:02:55.016 --> 00:03:01.083
which has a friendship ankle bracelet extension cord.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.817
I don't think that would be there if she weren't weaving me friendship bracelets

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.816
and bracelets for her friends.

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:12.939
That's Clare's bike.

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:15.510
She learned to ride without training wheels.

00:03:15.677 --> 00:03:17.110
After she was no longer using it,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.909
I asked her permission to chop her bike up.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:20.678
[LAUGHS]

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.172
She's kind of used to me coming up with these

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:27.815
second lives for things lying around the house.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.141
The individual plates that a seahorse is composed of,

00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:36.878
they're called scutes.

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:41.571
I wanted to use my different body impressions as all the scoots

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:42.880
on the seahorse.

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:45.571
So, down here are the fingers.

00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:47.141
Further up, thumbprints.

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:50.169
The eyes are kind of bellybuttons.

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:56.111
These kind of horn structures are my mouth

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.848
just the forming of a kiss.

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:03.015
You can kind of read body parts a little more clearly in the bubbles.

00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:06.141
You can see different skin textures.

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:08.816
The largest one is my head--

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.171
two skull caps, fit together.

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:15.615
The seahorse is made out of polyester resin--

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:19.171
the same material that I use to coat the animal piece,

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.973
"Animal Treasures".

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:26.016
It's a mobile.

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.078
Each cub is balanced on the tooth of the next one.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.508
An infant's heart rate, within five seconds,

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:40.247
will drop when it's being held by its mother or grandmother.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.816
There is this very, kind of, relaxed gesture there.

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:56.448
This body of work is relating more to my familyâ€”

00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:57.972
specifically my parents.

00:04:57.972 --> 00:05:00.773
I mean, if you want to go personal for a moment,

00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:04.217
I can say that I just feel very torn being here

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:07.677
because my mother is dying right now.

00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:10.141
You know, I reflected a lot on,

00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:12.575
you know, just the family relationship,

00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:14.143
and the embrace.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.016
So it has that kind of embrace,

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:22.425
where each figure is placing its trust in the next generation up.
