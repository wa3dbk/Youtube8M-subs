I founded the Manto Centre this year, on Corfu.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.300
It is housed in a beautiful Greek estate with a lovely garden.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.200
It is also close to Agios Georgios Pagon,
one of the most beautiful bays in the area...

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.900
Compared to other Greek islands Corfu is very green,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.200
comparable to Tuscany, strewn with
olive trees...

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.200
It has lovely beaches, kind hospitable people,
a wonderful relaxed atmosphere, and a unique

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.700
culte, epitomized in Corfu-City...

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.210
We offer Yoga or Taichi five times a week

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.149
We have an open studio, where we hold art
workshops on a regular basis.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.100
Our Mediterranean cuisine is mostly vegetarian,
and providing the highest-quality food is

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.509
of utmost importance to us!
As well a cook in-house,we also go out to

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.189
eat, as well as host a Greek cooking night,
where we prepare traditional Greek dishes together...

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.189
 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.700
"Just be" is our motto, and that is what we try to practice!
