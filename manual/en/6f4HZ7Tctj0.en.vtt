00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Pull out your monkey wrench,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.980
and just say no to crack,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.100
'cause we're going PLUMBING!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.600
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.480
Hello, Internet,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.540
and welcome to Game Theory!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.240
Gaming's tangential learning experience!

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.520
Since last week's -first- episode about theoretical physics was a LITTLE heavy,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.520
Today, we're going to lighten things up

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.880
by spending some time with the world's most famous plumber,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.460
Mario...

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.220
Uh...

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.540
Mario.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.060
But,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.940
what do we REALLY know about this international man of mystery?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.800
Has Nintendo been pulling the wool over the eyes of western audiences

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.860
about Mario's TRUE heritage?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.380
Let's find out.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.420
Mario's FIRST career was as a carpenter...

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.660
CARPENTER...

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.040
Running on girders to stop evil apes in "Donkey Kong."

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.140
It wasn't until the 1983 arcade game "Mario Brothers,"

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.880
that he got his start as an Italian-American plumber in New York.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.840
In it, Mario - and brother, Luigi - must combat turtles, crabs, and flies

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.140
wandering through the pipelines.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.220
So, as someone currently LIVING in New York,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.320
and figuring that flies in a sewer are a given,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.560
I ask:
Do we REALLY have turtles and crabs running through the city's pipes?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.360
Well, let's start with the crabs.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000
The long winters of New York,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
and the ALREADY polluted and cold conditions of the sewer,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.920
would make it pretty challenging for a crab to survive.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.900
However, in ITALY, with its warmer climate,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.080
crabs in the sewer can be dated back to the year 100.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.740
When emperor Trajan imported crabs from Macedonia,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.960
and set them free in the center of the town for him as part of a Pagan crab festival.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.340
Those that escaped into the sewer THRIVED,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420
and to this day, they are called "Trajan Crabs" -

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.520
- or sewer crabs.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.180
But what about turtles?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.580
And NO, these turtles don't count.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.480
Although specific data is rare,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.740
it is generally believed that the chilly, dark, and bacteria-ridden conditions of the sewer

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.740
would prevent cold-blooded creatures, like turtles, from surviving and reproducing underground.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.880
HOWEVER, there IS another side to the story.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.600
Folklore abounds with tales of unwanted pets being flushed down toilets,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.120
only to flourish in the sewer.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.320
According to Robert Daley's "The World Beneath the City,"

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.800
New York sewers were known to contain alligators in 1935,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.660
And there have since been multiple reports on the animals being captured on city streets.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.800
One as recent as 2006 in Brooklyn.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.820
BUT, most telling of all, in Alexandria, Australia,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.360
rescuers found a rare American snapping turtle

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960
-that they nicknamed "Cowabunga"- living in the sewers.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.200
Look familiar?

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.800
So,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.040
maybe there IS something to this after all...

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.280
Moving on to our portly plumber's signature adventures, with the "Super Mario Bros" games,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.460
our red-clad hero finds himself in the Mushroom Kingdom.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.960
A plumber's paradise of pipes,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.700
clogged with fire-breathing weeds and elaborate brick sewers.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.500
I originally wanted to explore if it was possible to clean out pipes using fireballs,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.900
since that appears to be Mario's ONLY plumbing technique,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.760
but Google searching for "weed in pipes"

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520
didn't give me EXACTLY what I was looking for.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.440
However, I did dredge up THIS factoid:

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.680
Pets aren't the only things being flushed down toilets.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.340
Another popular staple of New York sewer folklore in the 1960's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.360
was that of "New York White."

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.580
An especially potent albino strain of marijuana

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.900
growing from seeds in pot baggies

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.840
that had been flushed down toilets during drug raids.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.240
Unfortunately, there was never any verification of this.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.500
Probably due to the alligators and mutant turtles guarding their stashes.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.680
But, on a somewhat related note,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.780
last month, 39 pounds of pot were found clogging the sewers in Arizona.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.900
So, maybe Mario had some ulterior motives

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.280
when he lit up the weed in those green pipes.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.580
Speaking of green pipes,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.280
that's a weird color for a pipe to be, right?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.420
Not really.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.900
For one, many pipes are made of copper,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.680
and copper exposed to moisture oxidizes,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.640
creating a green patina on its surface.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.500
For a classic example, just look at the Statue of Liberty.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.740
So, perhaps the plumbing in the Mushroom Kingdom

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.620
is all copper, and just a little aged,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.780
but there IS another explanation.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.960
With the green movement in full swing,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.120
more and more companies are covering their products in this quote-unquote "eco-friendly color."

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.860
For instance, the German company "Aquatherm"

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.180
has built their reputation around a signature product line:

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.360
The aptly-named "GreenPipe."

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.000
One final note about Super Mario Brothers:

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.120
Notice how the underground parts of the game take place in BRICK sewers?

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.940
Well, Nintendo got lucky in making Mario from New York.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.300
If he were from ANYWHERE else, they would've been wrong,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.420
considering that clay was the dominant material for pipe

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.000
when sewers were FIRST installed - shortly after the Civil War,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.240
and cast iron became a popular choice thereafter.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.160
New York sewers, on the other hand, are indeed brick,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.140
Influenced by the Europeans,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.880
who switched to elaborate brick systems

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.560
after a tragic experience with lead pipes,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.700
Perhaps contributed to shortened life expectancies.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.200
This underground architecture, much still in use today,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.260
closely resembles some sewer designs used in Mario's later games-

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.180
-like in Super Mario RPG.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.660
And on THAT note,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.600
[DID YOU KNOW THAT...]

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.520
In the forest maze of Super Mario RPG,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.460
Mario experiences a DIFFERENT kind of pipe.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.040
Log pipes - that function much in the same way as the normal green variety.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.280
Surprisingly, we once again find ourselves looking abroad for the real-world example.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.720
For perhaps as early as the 13th Century,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.040
people in England were using hollowed-out elm logs for  water pipelines.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.720
The US eventually caught on to the idea,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.600
installing wooden pipes in the early 1800s.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640
[NOW YOU KNOW...]

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.300
And now, it's time for my final thought.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.760
We've grown up believing in what Nintendo has always told us,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.920
that Mario is a true-blooded Italian-American from New York living in the Mushroom Kingdom!

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.920
But what we've seen here today MIGHT point in another direction.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.940
We've learned that crabs run rampant in the sewers of Italy,

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.100
and that turtles have a better chance of surviving sewer conditions in warmer climates.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.860
We now know that a leading green pipe manufacturer has a headquarters in Germany,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.280
and that brick sewer structures and log drainage systems

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.360
are more commonly found in old European cities.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.060
So, what does that tell us?

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.240
Only this:

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.760
That our Italian-"American" plumber may actually have FEWER American ties than we've been led to believe,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.940
and that - perhaps - the Mushroom Kingdom is actually found in the Old Continent.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.160
As one last nail in Mario's coffin,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.580
as ANYONE in New York can tell you,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.540
no REAL New Yorker would be caught DEAD wearing bright colors.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:05.060
His GARISH red garb is much more suited for the fru-fru styling of a European man.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.500
Anyway,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.940
it's just a theory.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.480
A Game Theory!

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.660
Thanks for watching!
