00:00:03.568 --> 00:00:08.267
(Jazz and Asian music)

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.840
- Today we're exploring Mt. Fuji, Lake Ashi and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.081
riding a bullet train, and we couldn't ask for

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.793
a more perfect day to do it on.

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:20.931
^ We've stopped up here at one of the viewpoints

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.925
^ on Mt. Fuji and we get this incredible view

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.537
of some of the other Japanese mountains.

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:31.401
The peak of Mt. Fuji doesn't seem that high

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.248
when you're up here at the viewpoint, but it's

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:37.184
actually almost 4,000 meters above sea level.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.693
^ We've made it here to Lake Ashi, we're gonna

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:44.208
^ hop on the boat and sail around.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.917
So we're out here on Lake Ashi and

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:51.134
not only is it breathtaking and known for its hot springs,

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.781
but, most importantly, it's known for the

00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.352
incredible views of Mt. Fuji.

00:01:00.858 --> 00:01:04.409
Got my ticket, gonna head up the Hakone Ropeway.

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:07.598
So the ropeway has brought us up here to

00:01:07.598 --> 00:01:12.266
the top of Komagatake and the views are breathtaking.

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.532
You have Mt. Fuji, you have Lake Ashi, and then

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:18.172
in the distance, the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:18.172 --> 00:01:19.147
I'm in love.

00:01:19.147 --> 00:01:21.713
(electronic dance music)

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:24.673
- This lake is just so tranquil and just beautiful.

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:28.029
Wish I could stay here longer too, actually.

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.490
^ - [Brock] Now I have a bullet train

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.367
^ waiting for me to take me back, so let's hop on board.

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:36.475
(train announcement chimes)

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:41.193
- Japan is home to the second-fastest train in

00:01:41.193 --> 00:01:43.492
the entire world, so when you visit this country,

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:46.493
you have to take the opportunity to ride on the train.

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.550
Today has been epic.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.128
I got to see Mt. Fuji and Lake Ashi,

00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:56.197
now I have a bullet train that's taking me home.

00:01:56.727 --> 00:01:58.503
Life is good.

00:01:58.503 --> 00:02:02.503
(gentle electronic music)
