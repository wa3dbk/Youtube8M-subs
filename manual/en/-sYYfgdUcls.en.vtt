00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Residential Security Shutters from Enviroblind

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:19.720
“Crime in progress – police radio”

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
“Storm coming – weather radio”

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Whether it’s from the unfortunate realities of today’s world,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or the powerful forces of nature,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when it comes to protecting your home and family

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you can rely of the strength and security of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
security shutters from Enviroblind.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In today’s world, security is an issue almost everywhere.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Alarm systems provide limited protection

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and bars are unsightly and impractical.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Solid and strong, rolling security shutters create a secure barrier

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When you need it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and virtually disappear when you don’t.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The ideal solution for protecting seasonal properties,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
patio doors, basement windows or anywhere you 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
require increased security.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Security shutters can be installed on windows, doors,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
even skylights for protection and peace of mind.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Our security rolling shutters are strong enough to withstand

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
almost anything mother nature can dish out:

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
harsh sunlight, high winds and severe storms never even touch your windows.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Customer Testimonials

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let’s have a look at just how strong they are.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We commissioned Intertek,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
one of north America's leading test facilities,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to perform comprehensive strength tests on the security shutters.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Tested against hurricane conditions,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the shutters held their own against high velocity

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
static winds from both directions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the impact test involves you shooting a wooden 2x4 directly at the shutters

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
from a high-pressure cannon at speeds of 30 mph.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Test engineer speaking

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Very little damage or deformation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
“A very good hurricane resistance product.”

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Since extreme weather and temperature don’t reach your windows,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
security shutters also keep your house cooler in the summer

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and warmer in the winter,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Conserving energy and saving you money.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Customer Testimonials

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
There may be times when you want to control the brightness as well as the temperatures in your home

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
security shutters are fully adjustable to control the darkness

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to provide complete daytime blackout conditions.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Because they’re insulated, they significantly reduce outside noise,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
creating a cool, dark and quiet environment

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Perfect for shift workers who need to sleep during the day,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
migrane sufferers who want to eliminate light and sound,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or those who want to enjoy their home theater without having glare or distractions.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Simply operated from the inside by either an easy-to-use manual system

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
or with motorized convenience,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
With the flip of a switch or push of a button, you can control the security shutters individually or together.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Programmable timers offer “set it and forget it” convenience.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Enviroblind security shutters are made of interlocking aluminum profiles

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
filled with foam to provide optimum weather and noise insulation.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
They glide securely in the vertical rails

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and roll up and disappear in the overhead panel box.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Choose from several colors or we can custom paint them to match your home.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Our special manufacturing process ensures fast delivery

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Installation is quick and easy

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
