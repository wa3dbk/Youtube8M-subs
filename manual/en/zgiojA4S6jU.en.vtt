00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.187
- I feel like it's all
gonna be fancy as (bleep).

00:00:02.187 --> 00:00:06.169
(patriotic brass music)

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.328
- I expect British snacks to all have

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:10.731
sort of, like, charming names.

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:13.448
- As far as I know, there's
a bunch of sausages.

00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:17.000
- Probably gonna be, like,
some preserved fish and chips.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.726
- [Voiceover] Chocolate Digestives,

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:20.548
Chocolate-covered wheat biscuits

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:23.265
- The name is the least
appealing thing I've ever heard.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:24.251
- It seems like something

00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.028
that you would take when you were sick.

00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:27.584
Like, "Oh, you have an upset stomach?

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:28.982
"Here, have this digestive biscuit."

00:00:28.982 --> 00:00:32.280
- It's just a good cookie. Is
it digestive because it's good

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.801
and you'll eat it?

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.344
- [Voiceover] Pork Scratchings,

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:38.259
made from the rinds, or skin, of the pig.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.277
- Oh my god, that's, that's very fragrant.

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:46.178
- It's just a, oh, it's so crunchy.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.349
- Oh my God, they, like,
left the fat on there?

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:51.158
- (laughing) Wait a minute, it says,

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.293
"Although every care has
been taken to remove bones,

00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:57.892
"some may remain." There's bones?

00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:00.214
- Y'all probably think this
is so gross, but it's so good.

00:01:00.214 --> 00:01:01.857
- [Voiceover] Twiglets

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:05.158
A wheat-based savory snack
flavored using yeast extract.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:10.158
- (Inhalation) They kind of
smell like old soy sauce.

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:12.464
- This snack's pretty
confusing, because it's like,

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:13.451
like what the (bleep) is it?

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.688
- They are like rotten Cheetos.
Or like burnt sausage ends.

00:01:17.688 --> 00:01:20.313
- Wait, you know what,
this is kind of good.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:24.212
It kind of tastes like
when you burn toast,

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:27.069
and then you rolled it
in spicy Cheeto dust.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.206
- [Voiceover] Monster Munch

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:31.212
This flavor is pickled onion,
and it's a baked corn snack.

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:34.027
- I know as a kid, you were
supposed to do this, I'm sure.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.056
This is, like, what you do
with these, and then you go

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:37.508
(growling)

00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:40.387
- Oh, it's kind of sour. It has
so much onion flavor, though

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:42.987
it's, like, making my mouth water a lot.

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:45.530
- Oh, it's awful by the end!

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.825
Whauh, oh, it's like, everything
that's wrong with a Funyon,

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:51.706
with pickle juice on it.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:54.051
- Yeah, you won't want to
kiss people after this.

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:56.907
- They look like Funyons, but they taste

00:01:56.907 --> 00:02:00.866
like a pickle that was left
inside somebody's gym sock.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.514
- [Voiceover] Marmite

00:02:02.514 --> 00:02:06.275
A dark brown salty paste
made from yeast extract

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:08.353
- (muttering) OK, OK, I'm ready.

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:11.790
- What, whoa, whoa what is that?

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.341
- Whoa, hello.

00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:17.651
(chewing noises)

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:21.646
- It's sour and salty at the same time.

00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:24.026
Like you, you gave me a piece of salt,

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:26.150
and dipped it in vinegar,
and then made me lick it.

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.165
(retching)

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:35.603
- It's so strong.

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:38.544
- I know if I ever go to England,

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:40.218
I'll stay away from the snacks,

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:41.482
and go straight to the fish and chips.

00:02:41.482 --> 00:02:43.758
- I'm kind of disappointed that
I didn't get to have, like,

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:46.997
some crumpets or some,
like, what Americans

00:02:46.997 --> 00:02:50.120
think English people are
eating all over town.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.837
- I feel like I could
get used to the Marmite,

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:54.085
in this weird way.

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:55.312
- A lot of these things were, like,

00:02:55.312 --> 00:02:58.888
too flavorful in this, like,
vinegary-salty spectrum.

00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:03.169
The only thing that wasn't
salty was the digestive cookie.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.942
Which maybe that is to help
you digest all that salt.

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:10.809
(upbeat flute music)
