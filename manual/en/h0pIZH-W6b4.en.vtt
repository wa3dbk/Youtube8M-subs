00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.160
Greetings Children!

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.320
*Exhaling exasperatedly*

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.940
I-I am beside myself.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.640
If you recall, last time I deconstructed the popular "Miss Ping" video.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.840
Well the creators responded, in full force!

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.240
They tried to prove me wrong by re-making the video using a more voluptuous girl and all the same techniques with slight alterations.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.260
And to show how confident they are they published the new video at half the resolution of the original.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.660
This is now a matter of honor.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.680
I vow that I will not rest until I've debunked every single- *gasp as beeping is heard*

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.580
I almost forgot!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.620
It's not too late.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.600
We don't wanna miss this.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.300
A comet.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.260
Not just any comet.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.700
A viral comet.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.600
You see, most viral videos burst into social consciousness and then disappear just as quickly into the annals of pop culture history.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.780
Leaving us to wonder what we ever liked about the Numa Numa kid or planking.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:12.540
But some videos mostly ones about fake accidents, conspiracies, or alternative medicine claims come back again and again.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.260
Take for instance the truck saves plane video, this astonishing news excerpt shows a daring rescue of a plane whos landing gear is jammed.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.480
It's been around for years, and is obviously fake, but continues to be posted by random people and believed by random others.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.360
Join me on "The Ship of Outrage" to explore the ridiculousness of this, and other, Viral Comets.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.840
To understand the nature of this viral comet we must go back in time to the moment of its birth in the year of our lord, twenty hundred and eleven.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.920
*yells comedically as he falls*

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.680
Even back then when the video first appeared there were those who questioned its authenticity.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.000
(Non-believer)"This video is an illusion"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.480
But the powerful majority of un-discerning viewers disagreed.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.380
(Powerful majority of un-discerning viewers)"Blasphemy!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.880
All internet videos are real!

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.820
Recant! Or face punishment for your skepticism"

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.920
(Non-believer)"I will do no such thing, it is fake and you would see this too... if only you'd open your eyes.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.720
The plane, she has no airline markings. Just like the news graphics have no station ID!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.640
The Contrast of the plane and its shadow is visibly different from the background.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.820
All the people look like Costco catalog models, and even though they are describing a harrowing near-death experience from minutes earlier

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.760
They speak with the ease and clarity of an infomercial testimonial, lit perfectly at an airport terminal.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.460
The hero guy pimps the trucks technical features and the truck itself looks like a shiny showroom vehicle...

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.860
after a freaking 400 ton plane smashed onto it!

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.460
And also, there's a disclaimer at the very begining that says the whole thing is not real. What are you stupid?"

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.600
(Powerful majority of un-discerning viewers)"Oh snap!"

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.300
It's just a grass roots viral ad. Originally posted on an innocent YouTube channel by the multi-national advertising agency, TBWA.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.380
But you won't find it there now.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.200
The campaign is long over and a crazy plane accident is no longer "on message" for Nissan.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:31.380
But do a search and you'll probably see the video posted as recently as a couple months ago by some random user. Real or not, it's a lasting viral hit.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.880
And we all need a little dose of "attention" every now and then.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.160
Oh yeah. That's the stuff.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.000
But I wouldn't get too hung up on the fact that people repost the video as their own. You see, this ad itself is not original.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.500
It's premise and main visual set piece already existed in another video posted on the web back in 2000.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.320
It's an independent short film entitled "405".

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.820
A funny and exciting action piece about an airliner making an emergency landing on top of an unsuspecting SUV.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.120
And it advertises... nothing.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:15.480
It's just cool and creative. What took dozens of executive account co-executive associate producers in charge of executive accounts hundreds

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.580
of thousands of dollars to create by hiring the visual effects vendor of "Firefly" and "Battlestar Galactica"

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:30.340
Was done more convincingly, and in a more entertaining way by a couple of indie film makers in three months on their home computers a decade earlier.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.140
But the life cycle of a web meme is always the same... "405" is arguably the worlds first successful internet viral video.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.280
Having been seen and shared by millions five years before YouTube was even conceived.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.620
And even though both its creators went on to careers in visual effects, the film became just another viral comet.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.800
Obscure enough for a corporation to completely lift its idea for a commercial while random YouTube users continue to post it as their own.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.980
Some even collecting ad revenue which I don't think goes to the film makers.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.800
All of this can be avoided if you make it a habit to always go to the source.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.420
When you see an interesting video trending, don't follow the clickbait link to an embedded player and cite some pointless blog article.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.860
"Present company excluded"

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.480
Instead, search for it yourself and go to the oldest existing post. You're more likely to find the original creator.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.640
Reward them with your views.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.120
And see the video in its original context. Or you might find something even better.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.020
Then relax take a deep breath-

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.220
*loud inhale, choking sounds, then gulp*

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.620
-and enjoy the creativity.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.800
*outro music begins playing*

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.180
But now I'm afraid it's time for me to go kids, a graduate student in Wyoming is browsing the Templeton Foundation's website.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.200
Remember, love with your heart, use your head for everything else!

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
