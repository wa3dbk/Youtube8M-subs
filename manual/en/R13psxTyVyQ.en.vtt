00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.449
With a mild climate, and miles and miles of
orchards, 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.000
Santa Clara Valley was originally known
as the "Valley of Heart's Delight."

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.970
Better known today as the Silicon Valley,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.810
Santa Clara County is a vibrant, bustling
high tech and business hub, and home to nearly

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.449
2 million people.
Known for its innovation and considered one

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.300
of the top research and development centers
in the world, the Silicon Valley continues

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.300
to thrive and grow. With an estimated 500,000
new residents expected in the next 25 years,

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:48.589
commuters need new options.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.449
It is amazing how bad that traffic can be.
Because I am flying over the traffic and in

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.970
many areas it is flowing just beautifully
and you think you've got it made and then

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.640
it comes to a complete standstill.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.210
After 5:30, say like another couple thousand
cars have already beaten you to the punch.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.220
The economy may be slumping, but the roads
certainly don't say that.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.220
With limited land and final resources to add
more freeways and to address concerns of high

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.630
gas prices and environmental impacts, experts
are exploring innovative alternatives to providing

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.630
motorists with fast, safe, and reliable commutes.
Leading that effort is the Valley Transportation

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.220
Authority (VTA), the agency that oversees
the county's public transit and highway

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.070
systems.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.070
We have limited area for increasing the capacity
on the freeway system. This is a valley that

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.530
is already urbanized and quickly becoming
more urbanized. There is not a lot of room

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.360
left to be widening of freeways. So what we've
got is a situation where a lot more people

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.420
and jobs are going to be created in the future.
The current conditions are already congested

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.560
so the problem is how we deal with that growth
from that sort of standpoint.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.200
To help ease growing traffic congestion, VTA
is planning to convert existing high occupancy

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.200
vehicle, or carpool lanes on the SR 85 and
the U.S. 101 to new high occupancy toll or

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.370
Express Lanes. The new Express Lanes network
will provide solo drivers the option of paying

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.780
a toll to use the lanes for a less congested
commute.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.740
We need to place a great premium on squeezing
as much capacity as we can out of the existing

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.760
highway network. And that's what we think
express lanes do. They allow you to not only

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.760
move more carpools and van pools and buses
through the HOV system, but they also permit

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.240
single occupant drivers to pay their way onto
those lanes so that you can get the maximum

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.099
through put through the same bit of concrete.
So what we want to do is have traffic flowing

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.530
smoothly. We don't want people speeding
over the speed limit because then they are

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.430
emitting too much pollution and we don't
want them doing stop and go because then they

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.010
are also emitting more pollution than the
car has to get from point A to point B.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.090
By allowing solo drivers to pay a toll to
use existing carpool lanes on State Route-85

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.020
and U.S. 101, we can offer commuters a reliable,
fast alternative, and at the same time generate

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.870
revenue that will be used to operate and maintain
the lanes, pay for highway patrol services

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.879
and support additional improvements in these
corridors.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.300
Well we're very pleased that VTA in Santa
Clara County and Silicon Valley is one of

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.129
the pioneers for this express lane concept.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.360
We have an aging freeway infrastructure, and
we don't have the revenue available through

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.440
gas tax programs to be able to properly take
care of the infrastructure we have or adequately

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.830
operate it. And so the express lane program
provides an additional source of revenue to

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.330
take care of our freeway system so that they
are free of potholes and can be operated in

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.180
the most efficient way.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.370
Curious about the Express Lanes? Here's
what you can expect.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.599
The Express Lanes are easy to use and operate
24/7. The California Highway Patrol enforces

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.949
the rules visually and electronically.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.860
Transit vehicles, carpoolers, motorcycles
and eligible clean air vehicles can use them

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.610
at no charge.
Solo drivers with a FasTrak (R) transponder

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.800
can choose to pay a toll to use them.
Signs alert you to access points and the current

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.689
toll.
An overhead antenna reads your transponder

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.889
and the correct toll is automatically deducted
from your prepaid account.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.889
Tolls vary based on the level of congestion
in the Express Lanes and are adjusted to keep

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.080
traffic moving.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.249
Similar projects in San Diego and Orange County,
and in Minneapolis and Seattle, have been have

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.469
been operating successfully and have proven
popular with people from all income levels

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.699
and all walks of life.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.189
Well regardless of where I visit and see express
lanes and talk to business leaders and community

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.229
leaders, I hear nothing but good things especially
Southern California. I have family that lives

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.419
down there, they spend a lot of time going
to and from work and if they are lucky enough

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.569
to be able to use one of the express lanes
they get to work quicker, less stress, less

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.520
frazzled by the time they get to work and
then sometimes even more importantly they

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.969
get home quicker. But I also want to mention
as much of a challenge as traffic has been

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.699
for the business community, and it does affect
a business's bottom line, I think we also

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.110
have to look at the quality of life. We want
to have healthy employees. We want to have

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.509
healthy employers and in doing that we want
people to spend less time on the roadway,

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.110
more time at productive meetings in their
offices or with clients, but we also want

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.839
people to be able to get home at a reasonable
time and have extra hours to spend with their

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.189
family not stuck on roadways.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:02.189
For anybody who absolutely has to get from
point A to point B because of a family commitment,

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.199
or with school or with a job, that at least
they have the option if they want to pay a

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.839
little bit more to use the Hot Lane that that
is something that's available to them. For

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.180
me, the reason why I am in support of Hot
Lanes is it is going to make improvements

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.649
to all of the transportation system. So even if
you don't want to go on the freeway you

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.580
know that the streets are going to be improved
or there is going to be an additional bus,

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.020
or there is going to be an additional light
rail car or we're going to bring BART down,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.339
so it just gives people more options to get
from point A to point B.

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.129
Express lanes would improve my commute quite
a bit being that it that I would be able to use it

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:45.029
at my disposal and not have to be stuck in
traffic.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:50.710
Another benefit will be that the express lanes
will free up congestion in the other lanes.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.960
If the lane is going to be paying for VTA
improvements like more light rail or trains

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.129
or that kind of stuff, then I am more for
it.

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.610
I have to be where I have to be when the client
expects me to be there. So I can avoid being

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.189
in the traffic, traveling in the carpool lane
is absolutely what I would want to do if that

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:11.919
was available to me. I would do it.

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.360
The Silicon Valley is recognized the world over
for inventing

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.979
and adopting revolutionary new ideas. With
the introduction of the Express Lanes, we

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:27.499
have the opportunity to apply our legendary
technological know-how to overcome

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.489
the challenge of traffic congestion in our
community.
