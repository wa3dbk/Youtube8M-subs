00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.410
If you love money, well we’re about to flip
the table and talk about what money loves…

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.050
Hi, I’m Nathalie Lussier, your business
strategist and digital visionary.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.490
And this is Off The Charts, where we re-imagine
what’s possible for your business.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.369
Let’s do this.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.400
Money can be a tricky topic for many of us:
we all seem to have our own money issues.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200
We can get tangled up in our past relationship
with money, not having it, not saving it,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.669
or whatever your story is.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.149
But today I want us to take a different look
at money.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.699
Instead of trying to fix our relationship
with money, why not look at things from money’s

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.030
perspective… because I guarantee that money
itself is a lot less emotional and a lot more

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.030
unbiased.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.410
There are three things that I’ve learned
about money over the last few years, and they

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.410
are:

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.410
Money loves clarity.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.710
Money loves speed.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.920
Money loves to circulate.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.570
Let’s take a look at each one, and see how
you can use these realizations to your benefit.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
1.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.059
Money loves clarity.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.390
What can you do in your life and business
to create more clarity, especially as it relates

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.390
to money?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.740
For example, could you sort out all of your
different bank accounts so you know exactly

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.870
where all of your money is at all times?

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.320
This is freeing in and of itself, and it also
gives you a sense of ease when it comes to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320
money.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.750
Beyond that, can you make it more clear how
people can give you money?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.159
What I mean by that is, are your products
and services really clear and easy to sign

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.549
up for, or do you make people jump through
hoops to buy from you?

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.060
Do people know exactly what you do, or are
they confused about your business?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.110
The more clearly you can explain how you can
help people, the easier it is for people to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.560
take you up on it and hire or buy from you.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.210
Similarly, if you have a complicated payment
process with 5 steps and plenty of hurdles,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.119
that keeps people and their money at bay.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.119
2.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.119
Money loves speed.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.380
I’m not sure exactly why this is true, but
there’s something about money that loves

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.810
to be in motion… and it feels like the faster,
the better.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.110
If you’re speaking to an interested customer
or client, give them everything they need

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.939
to say yes right on the spot.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.570
Don’t say you’ll get back to them…

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.570
next week.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.730
Don’t let them sit on the fence, give them
all the clarity they need to say yes or no,

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.940
and move on.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.230
When I was doing a lot of web design, I would
speak to many interested potential clients

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.350
on the phone.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.140
Every now and then, I’d speak to someone
on a Friday afternoon and wait until Monday

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.280
to get back to them.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.420
Those deals never worked out.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.530
Money has a sense of urgency built into it.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.740
It wants to make things happen.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.390
If you drag things out, slow things down,
or wait to see how things will turn… you’ll

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.200
usually end up with no money exchanging hands.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.640
That’s why launches work: they have a built-in
sense of urgency.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.020
It’s also why you don’t want people to
be confused or to think things over for too

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.460
long, because if someone is waffling then
they’re going to pass.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.460
3.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.460
Money loves to circulate consciously.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.460
This follows from the previous point, there’s
something powerful about money wanting to

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.460
feel useful.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.980
If you’ve got money hidden under your bed,
and it doesn’t have a purpose, then this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.360
money feels like it’s not being used to
its full extent.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.770
Now that doesn’t mean you can’t have savings,
in fact I do think money likes to be saved.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.190
But only if you’re saving money with a strong
intention behind it, if you’ve earmarked

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.190
it for something.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.450
If you think back: every time you’ve wanted
to save money for something specific, you

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.980
were able to do it.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.680
There was money there for it.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.080
Whether it was buying a dress for that special
occasion, saving for a down payment on a house,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.100
or investing in a program.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.150
That’s because you gave money a job, even
if it was to accumulate, it was for a specific

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.360
reason.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.080
Money also loves to change hands.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.360
This means it loves to be spent, but just
like saving if you’re not being intentional

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.890
about your spending money won’t be there
for it.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.210
When you’re investing money into your business,
it tends to come back to you.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.210
When you’re investing into yourself, it
tends to come back.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.190
When you allow it to leak out in less intentional
ways, it will find its way into other people’s

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.190
lives.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.090
The distinction is that money goes where it
is told to go, but if you don’t care or

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.390
don’t consciously consider where you want
it to go… it will go leak out unconsciously.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.490
Bringing awareness to how you circulate your
money is another part of the clarity piece,

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.940
and it ensures you’re making money feel
welcome to circulate back to you.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.590
These are my discoveries about money as they
stand today.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.340
