00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:09.003
Hello~

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.700
We are standing near the Eiffel Tower

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.434
Seto is a hamburger 

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:28.182
I sold everything! 

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.546
I think it would look good on you

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:35.301
Yeah this one! I love it!

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.142
I love clutch bags!
-You always have bags that are around this big

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.625
This is cute! I want it!!

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:47.619
How's my outfit? 

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:53.769
They always make fun of me when I make mistakes. 

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.874
Can you cut all of this?

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:04.559
I want to do this again with three of us

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:07.177
Yeah that would be great!
-Just letting you know

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.366
You look awesome

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.219
We'll grow up

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:19.138
What should I wear? I'm going to find what I've always wanted

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:20.397
Ta-da

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:22.961
You popped out too quickly 

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:32.184
Ta-da
Today, we are visiting the studio for Stella...

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:34.369
Your voice was bit soft...

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.660
Its passion hidden in the heart snarls even at 
 the moon
This is Harajuku's elegant monster
Saki Sato

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:50.340
Everybody is looking at me
I'm a girl that looks 
 innocent but also mysterious 
I'm Yano Anna 

00:01:52.964 --> 00:01:54.580
I sweated a lot
-That was something new

00:01:56.185 --> 00:02:00.360
Kurumi, I can't get number 21. Can I just give 
 you number 20, instead?
-No, I want number 21!

00:02:01.882 --> 00:02:04.420
I want 21! We haven't got much time 
 so can you just do this quickly?

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:13.260
You know the one with horns? I'm just bit worried that it goes to 
 our viewers. We should have thought about this earlier (and choose better items)

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:16.270
Hello, I'm Natsume Mito

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.640
Last time, in HARAJUKU-Q, oh I said it wrong

00:02:20.741 --> 00:02:22.810
A fox

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.350
That's cool!

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.010
Something bad happened just now

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.640
I saw everything... Everything...
-It's ok, nothing bad will happen

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:47.240
Our manager...

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.720
Why did you ask us to look for your stuff?

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:02.040
But it was fun
-No it was not!

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.180
It's bit embarrassing.
Let's say one comic cost 450 yen

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.310
900 yen.
900 yen.
900 yen

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:13.600
When do you do it?
-Now (Imadesyo)

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:18.280
We didn't get to have a look here 
-We didn't...

00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:21.480
We started from here...
We couldn't come back here
