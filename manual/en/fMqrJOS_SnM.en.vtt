00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.870
&gt;&gt; KIRK STEUDLE: "It's important that the state of Michigan, in our transportation network, that we invest in

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.260
a system that is safe and is modern and has accessible transit buildings."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.090
&gt;&gt; TIM MELTON: "It's going to be a great visual sight for the city as you drive around Woodward, or the loop.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.270
Very, very thrilled to be here today. I look forward to bigger and better things coming from this."

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.910
with good equipment, great on-time performance. No 30 mile-an-hour zones,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.770
no pulling over for freight trains. Traveling at 79, 90 and 110 miles an hour. We can do that."

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.350
&gt;&gt; GARY PETERS: "America is a great country, but the only way  we're going to continue to be great is by making those investments in infrastructure,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.290
building transit stations like this, improving tracks, improving speeds and building integrated

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.360
transit systems throughout the area.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.030
So the fact that we're dedicating this station here today

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.140
shows that Pontiac is back on the right track, again."
