00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.290
Hello everybody! I'm in Croatia, at Zadar,
to test Chevrolet Trax, Opel Mokka’s brother

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.950
and a rival for models such as
Nissan Juke and Renault Captur. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.560
Unlike its rivals, Trax put great accent on
the practical aspect. The backrest of the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.350
right front seat can be folded in to load
long objects over 2 meters.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.300
The trunk is also large: 356 liters or 785 liters
with the rear back seats folded down.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.080
There are several elements that I particularly like
about Trax. First of all it's the design.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.470
Both interior and exterior of the car have
a very coherent design and,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.040
in terms of what the exterior is concerned,
it has some very masculine lines,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.810
muscular ones that look very good on this model.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.930
Inside, the space is very well organized
and the controls are perfectly right.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.550
The steering wheel, the buttons for the power windows
and mirrors adjustment - all come in handy

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.340
and gives you a very pleasant sensation of ergonomics,
of comfort.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.600
Trax has a multimedia system with a 7 inch touch screen.
It's called MyLink and

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.010
can mirror from a SmartPhone the
BringGo navigation software.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.760
So instead of typing on your phone, you
type on the touch screen of the car.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.160
It's a more affordable solution in financial
terms and promises to better

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.550
keep up with the world of SmartPhones.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.310
Here in Croatia I drove two versions of Trax.
I am talking about the 1.4 liter turbocharged gasoline version

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.220
and the 1.7 liter turbo diesel.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.700
The most proper combination for Trax is
the 1.4 liter turbo gasoline engine with

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.950
140 PS/HP which I am driving right now,
with AWD and manual transmission –

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.390
otherwise, the only one that is available.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.290
The turbo diesel version I drove yesterday is not recommended,
from my point of view,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.800
because the engine transmits to the cabin very much noise

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.330
and vibrations.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.290
Imagine the sound of a Iveco Turbo Daily minibus -
if you ever drove one.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.390
Well, that loud and clear you can hear the diesel engine
in Chevrolet Trax.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.460
I think this is the most noisily turbo diesel car
I have ever driven.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.200
I spoke to the people from Chevrolet and
I asked them about this detail.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.450
They said that, indeed, there is a problem with the
soundproofing and, as the cars will be delivered to customers

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.390
in the following months,
this inconvenient will be solved.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.830
Here in Croatia we drive some preproduction cars,
so, these are not the final versions that customers will buy. 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.910
The combination of a gasoline engine and
a 4x4 traction system makes Trax

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.070
a very pleasant car to drive; it is agile.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.230
The steering seems to be working a little
better, more promptly than the diesel version

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.310
and the consumption is not very high as long as
you do not overdo with the speed on the highway.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.910
For the gasoline version the average real fuel consumption
is somewhere around 8.5 liters/100 km as an average.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.670
Besides the lack of very modern engines and transmissions,
Trax has some restrictions for options

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.500
to avoid becoming too expensive
and not to cannibalize itself with Opel/Vauxhall Mokka.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.510
For example, the Chevrolet model cannot have
under any circumstance automatic air conditioning

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.650
or xenon headlights.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.750
As a conclusion, Chevrolet Trax can be a very interesting
and practical car if you know how to configure it.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.780
Romanian market price list starts at 15,500 Euro including VAT,

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.870
and 4x4 gasoline version as the one tested in
Croatia has a price list of 20,800 Euros with VAT,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.380
which also includes ecological leather trim
and electric sunroof.
