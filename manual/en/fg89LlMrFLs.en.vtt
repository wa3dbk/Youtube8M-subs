00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:18.918
So what’s up, boy?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.388
You sounded urgent over the phone.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.238
Thank you for coming; it is rather urgent.

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:28.958
I’m going to the recruitment office this
afternoon, and I still can’t decide whether

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.487
I should join the Army or Marines.

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:35.217
It’s confirmed then – you are joining
the service.

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.988
That’s wonderful news.

00:00:36.988 --> 00:00:38.068
Thank you.

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:42.538
Since you’ve served in the military before,
I thought you’d be the best person to talk

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:43.848
to about this.

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:47.818
I’ll do whatever I can to help you to make
a decision.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:51.958
Just remember that whichever branches of the
armed forces you decide to join, both have

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.767
a rich history and strong tradition behind
them.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.548
I understand that, which only makes it harder.

00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:00.158
I can imagine.

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:03.628
Let me explain the major difference between
the two.

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:08.818
The Army will offer greater chances for advancements
and promotions, while the Marines will transform

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:12.198
you into the best soldier you can possibly
be.

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:13.458
Why is that?

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:18.868
Well, the Army has a significantly larger
budget, a wider global presence, potentially

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:22.698
more combat time and bigger scope of responsibility.

00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:27.577
The Army also has 190 Military Occupational
Specialty.

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:32.437
This basically means that it needs more leaders
and officers to manage itself.

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:37.497
Which is why there is a greater chance for
a promotion, right?

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.497
Exactly.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.878
What about the Marines?

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.027
What makes them so special?

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:46.798
For starters, enlisting does not grant you
the right to be called a Marine.

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:49.688
Instead, you have to go through a grueling
13 weeks bootcamp.

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:50.688
Wow.

00:01:50.688 --> 00:01:55.638
And if you do it well enough, only then will
you be awarded with the Eagle, Globe, and

00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:59.668
Anchor insignia and get to call yourself a
Marine.

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:00.928
That sounds tough!

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:02.588
It is.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:06.057
The training is also more specialized and
intense.

00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:10.978
You will eventually become a superior marksmen,
swimmer and tactician.

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:13.548
Except you don’t get promoted, right?

00:02:13.548 --> 00:02:15.458
I didn’t say that.

00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:19.688
There are promotion opportunities, but the
competition will be much more intense owing

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:24.738
to the fewer leadership position required;
the Army is two and a half times bigger than

00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:25.738
the Marines.

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:26.738
I see.

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:29.527
I am not taking anything away from the Army
though.

00:02:29.527 --> 00:02:35.688
Some regiments, such as the Rangers and Special
Forces, have training comparable to the Marines.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.977
I am so glad we had this talk.

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:40.908
I now understand so much more.

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:42.307
So am I.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:44.248
Have you reached a decision yet?

00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:48.338
Almost, but I will make a final decision this
afternoon.

00:02:48.338 --> 00:02:53.638
With these new information, I would like to
do some last minute research online.

00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:57.888
Whatever your decision will be, I just want
to say how proud I am of you.

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.307
Now let’s go get some lunch!

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:01.788
Thank you, and lets!
