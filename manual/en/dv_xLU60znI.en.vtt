A travel wallet is a great to way keep all
those important things in one place during

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.620
the time of travel so you can easily have
them on hand.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.910
I was inspired by Sonia from Sonia's Travels
to come up with this simple travel wallet

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.910
tutorial.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.600
She made a video on how to carry your travel
documents and has a really cool channel.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.350
It's really fun to watch her travel the world
plus she does have helpful tips.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.029
So be sure to check out her travel wallet
video and subscribe to her channel.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.700
You can find those links in the description
below.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.040
For this travel wallet, I decided to use craft
foam.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.260
Not only is this material super inexpensive
for large sheets, but it comes in a variety

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.940
of colors you can find at almost all the major
craft stores.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.780
And an added bonus, since it's foam, it has
waterproof qualities.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.770
The design I made gives you an area for your
boarding pass on the left, with ID or other

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.670
cards and passport pockets on the right.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.470
You can of course, alter this to make one
big pocket or any part to fit your needs.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.080
Here's a list of materials and tools I'll
be using to make one wallet.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.860
First, trim the foam sheet down to 15 by 9
inches (38 cm x 23 cm).

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:36.090
You can mark your measurements with a dent
rather than a pen mark.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.020
Then score a line in the middle.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.640
If you don't have a bone folder to do this
with, check out the description below for

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.870
substitutes.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:55.940
Now score a line 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) away
from the center line on both sides.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:08.759
And then cut a 1.5 inch (38 mm) rectangle
off the top left flap.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:17.740
Now make a line 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the
top on the right flap.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.620
If you want your wallet to have round corners,
you can use a bottle cap to cut around.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.280
For the pocket flaps, fold them over, and
place the cap top onto the corner and cut

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
around it.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.010
You can clean up the edges with the x-acto
if you need to.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.270
And please be careful when cutting, I don't
like reading comments saying you cut your

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.410
finger from watching my tutorial.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.060
So take caution and cut carefully.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.900
After all that, your foam sheet should look
like this.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.069
And now I'm going to glue the flaps down to
form the pockets.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.959
I'm using a glue gun for this.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.770
If you want to use a different glue, make
sure it's a really strong glue.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.209
Glue the left flap down on the bottom.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.970
This flap will eventually lay flat.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:25.640
Now on the right flap, glue a line on the
bottom, top and scored line.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.890
And now for the band.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.819
I'm using this 3/8 inch elastic band.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.599
For more on elastic band sources and substitutes,
check out this video here.

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.060
You can also find the link in the description
below.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.120
If you don't want to glue on an elastic band,
you could just wrap a rubber band or hair

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.310
tie around it.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.489
To measure the amount of elastic band, wrap
it around, and slightly pull it so there is

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.489
enough tension.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.670
You want it loose enough to stretch over the
wallet, but not too loose that it just hangs

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.500
off of it.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.450
I cut mine to about 9.5 inches (24 cm).

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.350
Now make a rough dent area in the center of
the wallet on the outside, about the width

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.519
of your band.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.870
This little dent helps the glue stick the
band and foam together, making it stronger.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.249
Then glue the ends of the band to that area
in the center.

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:41.509
Loop the band around like this to glue both
ends side by side.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.360
After that's dry, you can swing it around
to close your new travel wallet.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.849
I will say that this material can get dented,
but if it's light enough, amazingly the squishy

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.509
foam material pops back up and the dents fade
away after an hour or so.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.060
You could use this to your advantage and impress
a design onto it.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.779
Just make sure you press hard enough, or else
the design will fade away.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.199
Another way to decorate your wallet, is to
cut pieces out of other foam colors and glue

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.509
them on.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.900
I hope you found this tutorial helpful and
have fun making your custom travel wallet.
