00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.360
but chinese company

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.320
did that four point seven billion
dollars last week to take over

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.029
smithfield foods

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.330
which is america's

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.959
biggest pork producer

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.619
this would mean

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.820
the biggest chinese acquisition ever of
an american company

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.260
and the name of the uh... chinese

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.480
company issue

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.699
trying oakley

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.930
and they're worth

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.580
seven billion dollars their absolute
behemoth they used to be a state-run

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.850
uh... me company

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.920
than they were privatized seven billion
dollars

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.499
and they are the dominance sausage maker
and poor producer

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.300
in china

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.160
uh... why is this uh... such a
tremendous story in my eyes

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.110
this is a all on the heels

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.720
just westmont

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.860
the meat industry so are they doing well
they were selling

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
box

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.870
mink

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.350
in red meat

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.830
and it was passed off as every day in
the in some cases lamb in other cases

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.870
pork some cases poultry

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.830
and of course we will have no idea what
i read it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.799
now up on top of that

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.880
there was a headline from c_n_n_ just
three days ago

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.159
magnets

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.760
and bacteria

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.640
playing chinese me

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.369
so are there was of personal story of a
family that bought sausage day

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.600
notice after they had even if they were
magazine the package

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.160
there were kids that got

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.870
violently ill diarrhea vomiting

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.420
uh... and it was widespread

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.650
and on top of that there was another
scandal that there's been a legal

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.120
chemical cold

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.430
claimed the role

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.930
which is used in the east

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.030
they can actually be extremely toxic

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.079
toxic

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590
to if humans and they use it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.220
uh... particularly i think with up pigs
bs they want to get them to the right

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.790
uh... size and the right percentage in
terms of

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.870
leanest of of meat

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.140
and uh...

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.520
if i guess if you don't cook at the
right away or whatever the case may be

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
but humans actually do get sick from it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.250
and so they were caught using

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.880
uh... cl

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.780
claim here all and thousands of people
got violently sick in china including

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.309
some

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.699
were digis dot

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.769
solaris

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.670
on the heels of just reading uh...

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.819
of afghans and stories they say

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.409
all chinese me cos

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.339
there are no good they're completely
unregulated they sell rat and make and

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.370
fox appointed as other meats

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.959
they are not get some bacteria to use
their legal and instability

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.269
right after reading those stories now we
learn

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.309
that a chinese company in the four point
seven billion dollars to take over

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.939
smithfield spoons

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.409
which is america's biggest

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.039
poor producer

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.229
looking around crazy that is men

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.599
is that we want to do with our

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.019
me company made it like that

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.269
believe that they now some people might
say well carl

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.169
they maybe by

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.400
uh... the united states acquiring

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.529
or the chinese company acquiring this
maybe they'll start

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.939
uh... abiding by a or food standards
which is barton is a slightly better

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.489
than their food centers

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.329
if you actually believe that i have a
bridge to sell you

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.249
because already we've had um... you know
a largely unregulated and binding united

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.729
states of america

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.379
uh... in all industries because uh...
big business lobbyist for the loopholes

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.109
really can get away with doing the like
this

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.109
and look at that

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.459
agee gag bills where you're not allowed

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.689
to record

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.909
but secretly or do journalism on

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.260
uh... certainly purple producing factory
so if they have the mad cows their

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.449
falling over admit cal disease and so
they pick him up that video is you're

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.229
not autor uh... released a video or else
you get sued

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.289
so they've been free speech in
journalism in terms of by the meat

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.309
industry

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.250
analyst has disaster

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.169
written all over but then the plot
thickens even more

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.589
because that so how is this happening
and before the people that are pushing

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.579
for the deal

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.239
goldman sachs c_d_h_ investments
singapore sovereign wealth fund and new

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.199
horizon capital which is a private
equity affirm co founded by the son of

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.829
the former chinese prime minister

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.699
when jod val

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.309
they are

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.909
they all all large portions of by those
to me cos writer chan is one of the

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.229
american one

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.060
and they stand to make the tremendous
amount of money

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.199
by merging the companies together

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.590
now the only maybe bright spot in this
whole story

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.619
is that

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:29.479
the united states government

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.610
has to approve it

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.069
now in any uh... saying world

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.310
by the united states would certainly

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.580
uh... invoke the sherman antitrust act
they will understand this is kind of

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.020
like a monopoly is a business getting
too big

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.369
they were cornered the market

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:49.210
it would be unfair competition it
wouldn't be true capitalism right no

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.809
hope for the sherman antitrust act to
stop anti-competitive

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.629
of moves like this so hopefully they
will strike it down and hopefully

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.529
they'll say we're not gonna lab has to
go through

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:04.110
but uh... number one i will let breath
for that because they

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.080
if i had to guess i would but i think
they would uh... approved the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.039
acquisition

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.330
and by member to

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.969
if it goes through and this is allowed

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.319
packing up

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.819
let's all our pick of the different
hobby

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.520
because i'm telling you

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.180
we will we will not get

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.449
anything accomplished in the united
states of america in terms of good

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.029
policy

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.460
because money has is completely corrupt
our politics

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.650
to the point where they're there's no
there's still

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.870
simply no hope until we get money at
last minute anyway

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.119
internet dollar raise the minimum wage

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:40.759
not happening until we get money out of
politics
