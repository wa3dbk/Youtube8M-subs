00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.820
Bobcat Company introduces the 500 frame size skid-steer and compact track loaders.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.279
Seven new machines provide operators with extensive feature upgrades, including

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.520
increased visibility, a more comfortable
cab, and easier serviceability.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.520
The 500 platform loaders include the S510, S530, S550, S570, and S590,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.280
as well as the T550 and the T590.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.000
The S510, S550 and T550 feature a radius lift path,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.620
ideal for dumping over a wall, back filling, or loading flatbed trucks.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.320
The S530, S570, S590 and T590 models feature a vertical lift path,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.740
which provides the ability to lift heavier loads.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.180
The M-Series vertical lift path machines feature an increased lift height over equivalent K-Series models.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.060
The 500 frame size loaders feature a unique cab forward design that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.260
moves the operator closer to the attachment and provides unmatched visibility in all directions.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.259
The largest cab door opening on the market provides superior visibility to the cutting edge

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.610
of the bucket or the corners of an
attachment. The cab door threshold has

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.840
been lowered, making it easier for
operators to enter and exit the cab

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.189
while the height of the cab has actually
been increased, providing additional

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:42.740
headroom but still keeping the overall
machine size small enough to maneuver easily in tight spaces.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.299
Windows on the sides and rear of the cab have also been increased in size

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.130
to provide more visibility. And the larger top window

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.979
makes it easier for the operator to see
an attachment with the lift arms raised.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.450
Bobcat increased the size of the 500
loader cab by 10% and redesigned

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.740
the interior to allow operators to
adjust the environments to their individual preferences.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.740
Bobcat 500 frame size loaders have a new best-in-class pressurized cab

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.459
with a new one-piece seal that goes all the way around the door

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.940
and fits into a special curved pocket. This minimizes the amount of dirt and dust

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.580
that might enter the cab, creating more enjoyable working conditions.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.780
Noise is another factor affecting operator comfort.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.360
Bobcat reduced the sound level
of new loaders by installing new engine mounts,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.940
which improve isolation and
decrease vibration. Operators have the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.300
choice between standard foot pedal
hydraulic controls, the advanced control

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.650
system or ACS, or the selectable joystick
controls or SJC. The standard foot pedals

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.020
control the lift and tilt through
mechanical linkage.The optional ACS lets

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.220
the loader operator use a dash-mounted
switch to instantly select between

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.680
advanced hand control or advanced foot
control of lift and tilt functions.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.220
The SJC has low effort control levers which can be operated in the ISO or H pattern.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.960
They move up and down in conjunction with the seats to reduce arm movements

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.970
and operator fatigue, and they
also slide forward or backward to adjust

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.400
to the preference of each individual
operator. Operators want to spend minimal

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.680
time on routine maintenance. Simple
checkpoints and superior design make it

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.100
easier to perform maintenance correctly,
faster, and at proper intervals.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.140
Keeping the loaders cool when working long hours is important in prolonging the service life of the machine.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.320
That's why Bobcat designed the cooling system for increased efficiency and
higher performance.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.080
It's also easier to clean out. The oil cooler swings up and allows access to the radiator.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.720
Hydraulic performance on M-Series loaders has been increased over previous models.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.300
The hydraulic systems have been engineered for higher standard flow and pressure

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.820
and give attachments more power to work more quickly. Size, horsepower, and cubic inch displacement

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.060
are matched to the loader's rated operating capacity, balance,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.700
and weight, producing a loader that can
even outperform higher horsepower machines.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:32.300
The skid-steer models offer a 2-speed feature, which boosts the maximum travel speed from 7.4 miles per hour to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.590
11 miles per hour. The hydraulic bucket
positioning option keeps the loader

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.220
bucket level as the lift arms travel
upward, enabling operators to spill less and work faster.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.600
The deluxe instrumentation panel offers better interaction and easy-to-read
virtual sweep gauges, allowing the

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.760
operator to quickly read and understand
the machines performance.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.680
New job-enhancing features were also added. Now it can monitor key loader functions

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.860
and keyless start helps prevent theft.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.540
The 500 frame size loaders incorporate superior performance

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.860
and operator comforts to replace the current K-Series models.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.960
The new 500 frame size loaders are available now through Bobcat dealers nationwide.
