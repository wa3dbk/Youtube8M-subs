00:00:00.103 --> 00:00:07.497
Freestyle - Shoulder Catch

00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:14.518
Developing an early catch in freestyle is extremely important for all swimmers, but it's just not easy for all swimmers.

00:00:15.637 --> 00:00:16.272
Why do it:

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:20.264
Obviously why to catch the water early in freestyle isn't a question.

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.571
But why do this drill?

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:30.096
By developing a focal point or even a bit of timing as to what starts first in the freestyle catch, you can take some time to actually build your pull.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:32.418
How to do it:

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:36.486
This extremely simple drill starts with slow smooth freestyle.

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.133
Try really to feel what's going on with this.

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.784
It's best to plan on not breathing for a bit.

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:46.860
Sometimes a snorkel and pull buoy will allow you to spend more time thinking about what's going on.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:53.486
Start by swimming freestyle, first making sure that you're reaching complete extension on each arm.

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:59.327
You should be extending so much that you feel your shoulder come into contact with the side of your face or your cheek.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.479
From this position the drill is simple.

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:08.539
All you have to do is start your pull prior to allowing your shoulder to break contact with your cheek.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.263
The order of the catch can be hand, forearm, shoulder.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.394
But this isn't the perfect definition of the freestyle pull.

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:23.307
It will give you something to think about for a simple process to get your hand and forearm in a more vertical position to initiate the pull.

00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.104
How to do it really well(the fine points):

00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:32.502
When you initiate the catch with the hand, you may feel your shoulder driving up into your cheek.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.715
This hand down shoulder up movement is not to be avoided in this drill.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:41.331
It will help you get your entire arm into a bit better position to connect with the water.

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:48.804
While ultimately you will not want your shoulder popping up when you swim, this drill is about the arm from the hand and to the forearm.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.808
The shoulder against the cheek just gives you something else to think about.
