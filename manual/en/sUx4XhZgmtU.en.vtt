Hi, this is Jon on behalf of Expert Village.
In this video clip we'll be calculating siding.

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.610
Here we have a basic garage with a hip roof
and we need to calculate how much siding we're

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.990
going to need to buy to cover all four sides.
So first of all our measurements we have 20"

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.600
X 20" and it's 8 feet high. So we need to
draw out each side that we're going to be

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.559
siding and we need to calculate the square
footage for each side so we know that all

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.670
sides are 8 feet high by 20 feet long. So
we're going to calculate those together and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.410
get 160 square footage for each of those sides.
For our side with the garage door we know

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.790
that the entire side is 160 and we're just
going to calculate the size of the garage

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.870
door and subtract it from our side. Now our
garage is 16 by 7 and that gives me a total

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.630
of 112 square feet so I'm going to take that
one 112 and take that out of our entire side

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.020
of 160, and that leaves me with 48 square
feet that I need to size. Now if I add up

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.910
all four of my sides I have the three sides
that are 160 square feet and the one side

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.900
with the garage door that's 48, that gives
me a total of 528 square feet of side that

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.840
I'm going to need to put my siding on. However
when ordering siding you alway want to make

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.460
sure to order extra you're not going to use
all of every single piece so you need to add

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.970
in a little bit for waist.
