00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.015
MR. JOHNSON: Ah, nothing like
a relaxing day in the park.

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:12.060
GROVER: V here.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.090
Get your letter V.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.446
MR. JOHNSON: Oh no.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:17.360
GROVER: Why hello there, sir.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.330
You look like a gentleman
in need of the letter V.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.080
MR. JOHNSON: No.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.940
I can assure you I do
not need a letter V.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.940
GROVER: Oh, well then perhaps
I can interest you in

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.030
something that begins with the
letter V like this v--

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.710
v--

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.040
violin.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.470
MR. JOHNSON: I'm just trying
to relax in the park.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.200
I don't need a violin.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.910
GROVER: Then perhaps you would
enjoy some healthy v-- v--

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.850
vegetables.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.810
MR. JOHNSON: I'm not
in the mood for

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.490
any vegetables either.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.290
GROVER: OK, but I am sure you
will enjoy this lovely v--

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.520
vase with some v--

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.180
violets.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.740
MR. JOHNSON: I have no use
for violets in a vase.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.314
GROVER: How about a v--

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:02.600
vacuum?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.772
MR. JOHNSON: Hey, watch where
you point that thing.

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.320
GROVER: There go the violets.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.097
MR. JOHNSON: Whoa, turn
that vacuum off.

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:14.015
GROVER: Oh, no.

00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:15.851
There go the vegetables.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.076
I thought that was valuable.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:27.020
MR. JOHNSON: Would you get
rid of that thing?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.710
GROVER: But the vacuum really
doesn't vacuum, sir.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.840
You will have nothing left that
starts with the letter V.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.310
MR. JOHNSON: I already have
something that begins with the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.810
letter V, OK.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.070
I have a v --

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.022
v--

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:40.272
vest.

00:01:42.354 --> 00:01:44.258
GROVER: Ah, the vacuum
stopped.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.970
Thank you for your help, sir.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.860
Now, if you will excuse me,
I will just take my

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.965
letter V and vamoose.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.650
MR. JOHNSON: I need a vacation.
