[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.350
Do you know which
of the car or plane

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.980
burns more fuel to carry you
from one place to one other?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.400
In other words, if you want to
travel from city A to city B

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.430
while using as little
fuel as possible,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.480
should you go by
car or by plane?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.650
In this video, I'm
going to show you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.690
how to deal with the
various variables

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.370
that you need to analyze
to find the answer.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.780
And to make it simpler,
let's take an example.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.310
Let's pick a popular
car and a popular plane,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.450
and calculate how much fuel
it takes for each of them

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.740
to go from A to B. For the car,
what about a Toyota Corolla,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.190
which is the best
seller of all times?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.700
And it looks roughly like this.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.840
And for the plane,
let's go with the Boeing

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.720
737, the most popular plane
in commercial aviation.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.360
And here is what it looks like.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.380
All right, let's go
through the numbers.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.310
How much fuel does
each of them burn?

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.230
On a highway at
60 MPH, a Corolla

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.370
burns roughly 1.8
gallons per hour.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.200
OK, so how much is 1.8
gallons per hour exactly?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.990
To help us compare
the fuel flows,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.970
I built this experiment
with color water.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.930
The left hand side
is for the car,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.760
and right now is set up
to 1.8 gallons per hour.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.900
Wow, this is a very
thin stream of fuel,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.290
but in fact that's
all the Corolla

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.780
needs to drive you
at 60 miles per hour.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.370
Now, how many gallons
per hour do you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.270
think a plane burns in cruise?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.850
Any idea?

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.890
Here's the number.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.780
In cruise, the Boeing 737
burns 725 gallons per hours.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.940
Holy cow!

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.110
This is a lot fuel.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.250
Actually, it is 400
times more than the car.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.490
In the experiment, the hose
was not even big enough

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.710
to accommodate the fuel flow.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.060
What you see here is
the fuel flow of only

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.390
one of the engines, but since
the plane has two engines,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.860
this is what the fuel flow
of the plane in cruise

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.210
really looks like.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.300
Pretty impressive.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.340
So it looks like the plane burns
a lot more fuel than the car,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.240
but this comparison
is not really fair

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.340
since the plane also carries
a lot more passengers.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.270
As a matter of fact, in
the US the average number

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.640
of passengers in
a car is only 1.6,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.750
whereas a Boeing 737 carries
in average 144 passengers.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.770
Therefore, the
comparison would be

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.110
more fair if we consider
the fuel flow per passenger

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.570
instead, which is the
quantity of fuel per hour

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.380
that a car of a plane needs
to carry one passenger.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.650
For the car, we have 1.8
gallons per hour divided

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.050
by 1.6 passengers, which
makes 1.1 gallons per hour

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.600
per passenger.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.050
Now for the plane,
725 gallons per hour

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.140
divided by 144 passengers
yields 5.0 gallons

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.240
per hour per passenger.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.370
Have you noticed how much
closer the numbers are?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.890
Now, this is what it looks
like in the experiment.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.740
These are the fuel flows
divided by the average number

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.770
of passengers for
the car on the left

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.910
and for the plane on the right.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.840
The fuel flows are
now much closer,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.110
but the plane still appears
to be thirstier than the car.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.790
However, we're still missing
something in this comparison.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.990
The plane is moving much
faster than the car,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.790
so it will take less time
to cover the same distance.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.220
Remember that we're
trying to find

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.920
which one of the
care of the plane

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360
requires this fuel to go
from city A to city B,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.770
or in other words, to
cover a given distance.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.090
Let's take an example.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.890
To cover 1 mile, the
plane takes 7 seconds,

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.870
whereas the car needs 1 minute.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.250
Now, let's have a look
at the amount of fuel

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.680
that the car and the plane
needs with our experiment.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.350
The fuel flows exactly
the same than before,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.300
but now we're going
to collect the fuel

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.760
for the amount of time needed
by the car and the plane

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.340
to cover 1 mile.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.079
As we said, the plane is flying
much faster than the car,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.110
and you can see in the
animation at the top

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.839
that it has already arrived.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.950
The amount of liquid you see in
the cup on the right hand side

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.320
is exactly the amount of
fuel that the Boeing 737

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.210
requires to carry one
passenger one mile.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.800
Meanwhile, the
car keeps driving,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.680
as you can see in the
animation on the top,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.750
and the amount of fuel
in the cup on left

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.100
already exceeds that of
the plane on the right.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.910
What we've seen
with this experiment

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.970
is that comparisons
of fuel consumptions

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.780
between different
means of transportation

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.100
are not necessarily as
simple as they may appear.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.880
In fact, a Boeing 737 burns
an enormous quantity of fuel

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.640
compared to a Corolla,
but because it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.730
carries a lot more passages
and also moves much faster,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.160
it actually requires
less fuel to carry

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.160
1 passenger over 1 mile.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.955
And here comes the proof.

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:14.100
Both glasses contain
the amount of fuel

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.110
to carry 1 passenger
over 1 mile,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.750
but other on the left
side we're using a car,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.010
whereas on the right
side we're using a plane.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.820
So just finishing off
with the actual numbers,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.220
if we divide the fuel flow
per passenger per the speed,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.970
60 miles per hour
for the Corolla

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.150
and 515 miles per hour
for the Boeing 737,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.030
we obtain the amount of
fuel per passenger per mile.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.610
For the car, this
number is 0.018 gallons

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.220
per passenger mile, or 2.4 fluid
ounces per passenger per mile.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.460
Now for the plane,
we only need half

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.260
of this, 1.2 fluid ounces
per passenger per mile.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.610
