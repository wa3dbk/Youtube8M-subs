Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village, and today we’re going

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.019
to talk about training dogs. So Aida the standard
poodle is ready to learn how to lie down.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.629
She has been very distracted by squirrels
and leaping about in a lively manner, so this

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.500
might be a bit challenging. Now that head
shake means that she’s getting a little

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.609
nervous, so what I’d like to do is start
by getting her attention, and then see if

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.449
she’ll respond to some body language like
she did when we were teaching the standard

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.160
poodle how to sit, good. Now I got a voluntary
check in there that was beautiful, Aida, good,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:45.010
sit, good, so I’m going to just try a hand
signal and see how far we get down, ump, sit.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.980
Okay so that “ump” was a no reward marker.
When her rear went in the air, I was indicating

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.210
to her that’s not what I wanted, so we’re
going to try this again with food as a lure

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.330
to help her out a little. So the food is here,
I take it straight down to the ground down,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.420
good, very nice, okay. Now I’m going to
say “okay” when she starts to leap up,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.180
because that’s my release word. You can
use anything for a release word, okay, free,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.500
it doesn’t matter as long as you are consistent.
Aida, good, sit, needs a hand signal for help,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:30.330
ump, I’m going to wait until she calms down
a little bit, good and then taking down, good,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:43.920
okay. …okay, sit, good, ump. Now Aida is
testing me a little bit here: that’s all

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:58.130
right. I have patience. Sit, good, down, good,
no food, ump… down, good. Now I did a no

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.700
reward marker there when she got up, because
I want to teach her that when I say down,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.340
that means to stay. Sit, down. We’ll talk
more about stay in the next video. Ump…

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.019
down, Aida really needs some food reinforcement
for the stay, so we’re going to go on to

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.909
that video, see what she’s doing up and
down and up and down. At Taurus this is what

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.749
we call a popcorn dog. This is a challenge,
but we’ll teach her how to stay in the next

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:25.059
video.
