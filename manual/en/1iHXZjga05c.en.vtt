00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.540
Today I will be making sabudana khichdi

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.140
or spiced tapioca.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.580
Sabudana khichdi is very mildly spiced

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.420
and with crunch of peanut. It tastes delicious.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.440
This is a great dish for breakfast or for light lunch.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.420
This recipe will serve 3-4.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.620
For this recipe we need:

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.300
1.5 cups of tapioca

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.740
You need to wash and rinse the tapioca

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.140
and soak it in about 1/2 cup of water for 6-8 hours.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.780
Which I have already done it.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.680
And this tapioca as you see it has been soaked for about 6 hours

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.380
and it is dry because you cannot really put too much water.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.320
And as you see it has become 3 time of size.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
We need 3 tablespoons of oil.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.920
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.960
1/2 teaspoon of black mustard seeds

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.420
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.960
1 teaspoon of salt or adjust to your taste.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.740
1/2 cup of green peas

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.380
I like to use the baby green peas because they are more tender.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.060
And I just like to use them to provide the color.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.400
It looks very pretty.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460
1/2 cup of broken peanuts

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.280
2 green chillies

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.620
which I have sliced them lengthwise

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.500
and take out some seeds, so it's not very hot.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.160
2 tablespoons of chopped green cilantro (hara dhaniya)

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.080
And about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.540
you can adjust this to your taste.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.140
This is a very easy recipe to make.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.620
First I am going to dry roast the peanuts

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.440
and then season the oil with spices.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.420
After that stir fry the soaked tapioca.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.540
It looks very good and it taste delicious and you are going to enjoy it.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.440
On medium heat, first I am going to dry roast the peanuts.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.700
It will take about 2 minutes

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.040
or it will start smelling and peanuts will be ready.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.640
This has been about 2 minutes.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.040
Peanuts are ready and they are having very sweet smell

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.160
and as you see it has started changing the color to light brown.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.560
So we are going to take it out and keep it aside.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.160
Heat is on, medium.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.860
So first I am going to add the oil.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.180
And just wait till oil is hot.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.180
I like to use the white frying pan because it's easier

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.120
to stir fry the tapioca and they do open up much better.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.500
Oil is ready.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.160
First I am going to add the cumin seeds

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.200
as you see it is cracking right away.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.280
I am going to add the black mustard seeds.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.800
Just for a minute mix it and then add the green chillies.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.500
Stir fry the green chillies for few seconds.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.620
And now I am going to add the green peas.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.880
Again stir fry the green peas until they are slightly tender.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.100
And it shouldn't take more than a minute to do that.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.020
Green peas are ready.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.040
I am going to add the tapioca.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.380
Just mix the tapioca gently so they do not stick to each other.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.080
And stir fry.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.500
Stir fry for about a minute

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.980
and then we are going to add the salt and turmeric.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.580
Now I am going to the turmeric.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.180
It just gives a very nice color.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.680
And salt.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.900
And this should take about 5-6 minutes.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.360
So we do have to keep stirring otherwise it will stick to each other.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.400
And do stir it very gently.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.580
As you see it's looking very nice.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.420
It has a very light color.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.780
It has been about 2 minutes when I added the salt and turmeric.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.740
It's time to add the peanuts.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.880
And again it should take about maybe 2-3 more minutes

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.960
and it will start becoming translucent.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.480
It has been about 6 minutes.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.960
And as you see they are looking like pulse

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.420
and they look very pretty.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.140
It's time to add the lemon juice

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.340
and cilantro (hara dhaniya).

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
And whip it for another minute.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.640
This is ready to serve.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.760
Tapioca kichidi is looking great.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.540
And as you see you can count all these tapioca

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.840
they are looking like pulse.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.580
It's a very delicious dish.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.400
You can also try this as a snack. It will great.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.080
Enjoy.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.540
And I will see you again with a new recipe.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.320
