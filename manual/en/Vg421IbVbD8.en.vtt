00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.420
Joe: Hey, it's Joe Crump.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.690
I've got another question here.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.770
This one is from Dotty Fahn.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.420
Dotty says, "Joe, my question is how do I
get my credit together, what should be paid

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.099
first, and what's a good credit score?"

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:21.240
Joe: First of all, if you go to cleanyourcredit.com,
I sell a book on how to clean your credit

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240
up.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.840
Essentially it's just a method of disputing
bad items on your credit report.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.230
The only way that your credit will ever get
cleaned up, even using these techniques, is

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.620
if you start making your payments on time,
so if you're continuing to make your payments

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.579
late, then your credit's just going to get
screwed up again no matter what you do to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.600
clean it up.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.219
If you want to get your credit cleaned up,
focus on making your payments on time and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.170
working out some kind of payment arrangement
with the creditors that you have.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.429
In some cases it makes sense to file bankruptcy
and start over and get a fresh start if you

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.820
know that you'll never be able to catch up
because at least then, you know that you're

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.530
10 years away from having clean credit and
you can do it sooner sometimes.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.539
Or, just letting everything go and not paying
it, and sometimes you can pull that off too

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.880
and still get those things off of your credit.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.740
Joe: If you're not making credit card payments
and your credit is trashed, and you stop all

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.909
of that and you don't have any other assets
that they can attach to, filing bankruptcy

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.759
sometimes is a problem because it takes 10
year to get a bankruptcy off of your credit

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.429
report, whereas it may only take a couple
years or a year or at the most or 7 years

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.119
to get a bad credit card off of your account,
so it sometimes make more sense to wait.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.729
And talk to a bankruptcy attorney (although
they make money by having you go through bankruptcy

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.530
so they may not be the best one to talk to)
but look at those options as well.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.579
Joe: As far as getting your credit clean,
after you've been through the bankruptcy or

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.509
you've just got some negatives on your credit
or those types of things, focus on the things

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.509
that matter.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.600
If you have a late mortgage and you have a
late credit card and you go out and try to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.320
get a mortgage, it's a lot harder to get a
mortgage if you've been late on it.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.269
If you've been late on a credit card one time
and you've never been late on a mortgage then

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.269
it's easier to get a mortgage.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.931
Although, these days it's hard to get a mortgage
with any kind of credit -- you have to have

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.950
well over a 700 credit score to make that
happen.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.489
Joe: Get your credit score online.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.959
Go online and just type in 'free credit report.'

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.760
And I would pay for a service, like a monthly
service, maybe 10 or 15 bucks a month.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.930
You can have access to all three of your credit
reports.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.209
You can even dispute them online, although
sometimes it makes sense to dispute them through

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.099
the mail as well.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.349
And I have techniques to do that in that book
that I told you about.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.300
So that hopefully will give you an idea.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.610
Joe: One thing you need to keep in mind -- you
don't need good credit to be a real estate

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.610
investor.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.680
Most of, well, I'm not saying most -- but
many of the people that have been in my program

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.180
have had bad credit.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.570
When I started buying rent to buy, it was
after my big crash.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.189
I don't know if you've read my story or not.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.970
If you haven't, go to the website that shows
you all about my experience in California

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.299
back in 1991 and 1992 when everything crashed
for me and I lost a 17 million dollar business.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.430
That trashed my credit.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.019
And I had to learn how to do this with no
money, with no credit, and that's where all

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.690
of these techniques came from.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.150
And I built on them over the years to create
the program that I've created today and to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.900
build a portfolio and to come back and to
be stronger than before.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.110
Joe: So hopefully that helps.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.350
Thanks.
