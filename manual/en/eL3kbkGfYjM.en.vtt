((Boat motor))
[Narration]

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.540
In several Central and North Texas lakes,
there lurks a tiny striped invader that is

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.450
causing problems for motor boats and water
supply systems.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.789
[Todd Robinson - Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Technician]
They have the ability to attach to hard substrates

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.700
that are upright in water, meaning they could
attach to your boat, they could attach into

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.040
pipes, onto pumps, any means of water conveyance.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.490
They are a general nuisance.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.130
[Narration]
They're called zebra mussels and Texas Parks

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.770
and Wildlife is trying to stop the spread
of this invasive species with a new statewide

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.039
rule requiring boaters to drain all water
from their boats every time they leave a public

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.800
lake, river or creek.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.690
This rule will keep boaters from unknowingly
transporting the small but destructive invasive

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.499
across the state.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.780
Adult Zebra mussels grow to just 1.5 inches
and the larvae are invisible to the naked

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.780
eye.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
They can hid e in water left in your boat
such as live-wells, bilges and bait buckets.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.870
[Todd]
We urge them to go ahead and have the maintenance

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.769
staff at the marina that they're at go ahead
and pressure wash the boat to remove them

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.980
off right there at the lake.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.739
[Narration]
Zebra mussels originated from Eurasia and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.470
are believed to have been transported in ballast
water from ships into the Great Lakes.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.580
They entered Texas in 2009 and are now in
several Texas lakes and rivers and threatening

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.720
to spread throughout the state.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:25.940
With the summer boating season under way,
Texas Parks and Wildlife is ramping up awareness.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.450
[Todd]
Buoys at 17 different marinas and we have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.110
signage at all the access points.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.450
We have billboards out on the highway, and
at all the gas stations, we have pump toppers."

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.670
((spray painting))

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.070
[Todd]
We are putting 6ft by 8ft stencils at several

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.070
locations.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.530
[Todd]
They are here and they're not going anywhere.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.880
There's no way to totally eradicate them.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.950
At this point we're just wanting to prevent
their spread throughout the rest of Texas.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.450
[Narration]
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Karen

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.670
Loke.
