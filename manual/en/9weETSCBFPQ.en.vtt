00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.320
Huh, what are these?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.000
Oh, these must be the fake Chaos Emeralds.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.900
Just looking at these things make me sick.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.830
Just how long are you going to stay down there?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.540
'uh?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.380
There's no need to worry.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.240
I'm up here.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.880
Just look above you.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.180
I was waiting for you, Sonic.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180
You are the only one who is able to--

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.480
control the light of the Chaos Emeralds.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.780
I'm terribly sorry for doing so much damage
to get here,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.020
but I just couldn't find a front door.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.780
And I have something very important to do.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.520
It's not a problem.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.540
I just wanted to know if you're as powerful
as we think you are.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.620
So far, I'm impressed.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420
Because according to our calculations,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.180
you were supposed to stop in the middle of
this room.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.480
I'm also sorry that I have to leave so soon,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.460
but I have friends to rescue.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.220
Don't be in such a hurry.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.580
I'm sure we have plenty of time.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.020
I would like to see if your strength corresponds
to our data.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.940
Data this, data that.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.300
Blah, blah, blah.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.160
Who cares?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.080
I just want my friends.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.780
Are you sure you want to leave...

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.600
after seeing this?

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.460
I've spared your two dear friends.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.520
They're just tired, that's all.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.620
Chris!

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.720
Cosmo!

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.380
You may want to be careful.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.820
If you try to break it, the pressure could
instantly kill them.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.840
You could lose your two friends, forever.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.920
And of course if you don't accept my propositions...

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.620
you know what will happen.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.580
No, Cosmo...

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.900
She must've been so scared.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.060
Hmm?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.500
Does that bother you?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.240
And Chris...

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.160
what have you done to 'em?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.960
It was necessary to punish these animals for
being disobedient,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.620
you know?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.320
Look, Sonic.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.060
I created these two Metarex myself.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.420
Gold, will test your strength.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.360
And Silver, will test your speed.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.880
And if your power is according to our calculations,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960
then I'm sure this wouldn't be any problem
for you.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.520
So what is your decision, Sonic?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.300
Want a fight?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.960
Well then here it is!

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.680
Is this...

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.200
what you wanted?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.560
Stop it right now, Sonic!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.160
I've never seen you like this before.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.220
Did you see the thrashing he gave to them?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.660
Yeah, he made heaps of metal out of them!

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.500
Sorry, but for some reason,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.020
something went wrong with the Egg Drive and
we landed here.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.260
You see, we don't have much time left so please
listen to me.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.600
Sonic.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.500
I'm really disappointed in you.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.720
It's not very good to act out in anger and
rage at all.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.440
So I will pretend I didn't see anything.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.600
Just go back to your ship.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.440
And don't worry about your friends,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.660
I know they're going to be just fine.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.840
Huh?
