00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.800
The page background is what will appear behind
all of your content on your page.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.010
You can choose from four options.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.510
None, which will just leave the background
as white, color fill, which will allow you

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.449
to give the background one solid colour, gradient
fill, which will allow you to use two colours

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.060
that will transition smoothly, or image fill
which will allow you to have an image for

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.269
the background.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.270
As mentioned earlier, selecting None will
have the page background be solid white.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.180
Color fill allows you to click on the colour
image which will prompt the colour window

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.890
to appear.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.170
You can make the background any colour you
want it to be.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.340
Gradient fill will allow you to choose two
different colours and have them blend together.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.410
Each colour can be chosen by clicking on the
colour image for each respective colour.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.650
Once you have your two colours selected, you
can modify the way you want the gradient to

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.210
appear.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.850
For example, you can flip the order of these
two colours by clicking on the arrows.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.880
You can notice the page background changing
when doing this.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.829
You can also choose the direction of the gradient.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.569
Toggling between the horizontal and vertical
arrows will change the direction of the gradient

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:21.369
from either horizontal or vertical.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.000
Alternatively, you can manually change the
direction by adjust the angle with the toggle,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.399
or by clicking on the up and down arrows.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.600
If you want to have an image for your background,
you will need to choose the image from your

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.509
list of Assets, or from your hard drive by
selecting Choose to open the Finder window.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.920
Once your image has been set as the page background,
you can either have it set to scale to fit,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.249
scale to Fill, Stretch, Original Size, or
Tile.

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.579
The option you choose will depend on the image
you want as your page background.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.049
If you want, you can add a shadow to your
page by clicking the Shadow option.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.130
You can select the colour for your shadow,
and how big you want the shadow to be.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.520
The shadow option works with any type of page
background.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.720
You can also add a browser background to your
site.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.010
The browser background is the background you
will see as the background for the website

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.810
when viewing it in a web browser.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.940
For the browser background, there are two
options.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.170
You can choose Color Fill which will allow
you to choose a solid colour for your browser

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.110
background, similar to the page background.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.520
If you want this left as white, then you do
not need to select anything.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.390
You can also choose to Image Fill the browser
background.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.170
Again, you can select the image from your
assets list or choose to locate the image

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.410
on your hard drive.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.680
When your browser background image has been
set, you can leave it as Tiled or change it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.050
to original size.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.410
Again, the option you choose will be dependant
on the image you have selected to use for

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.590
your browser background.
