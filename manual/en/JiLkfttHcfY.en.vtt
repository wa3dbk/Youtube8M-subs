00:00:00.787 --> 00:00:03.986
A landscape passes by a window. Text, Made by Hand.

00:00:16.527 --> 00:00:25.966
Text, Since 1997, more than 600 textile factories have closed in the U.S. Today, less than 2% of apparel purchased in the U.S. is actually made in the U.S.

00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:50.806
Text, Since 1998, Carhartt has made 57 million pieces of apparel in the U.S.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:16.624
Text, Inspired by their American workers, Carhartt named a line of clothing after them. the Made in the USA line features seven of the company's most iconic garments.

00:01:34.132 --> 00:01:40.560
Text, Everything Carhartt makes is designed in Michigan. The Made in USA line is built in four factories in Kentucky and Tennessee.

00:01:54.878 --> 00:02:08.862
Text, Carhartt employs 2,000 American workers, including 900 UFCW union members. Last year, Carhartt purchased 16 million pounds of U.S. cotton from Mt. Vernon Mills in Georgia. That's enough American cotton to cover more than 16,000 football fields.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.509
Text, No brand makes more rugged workwear in the U.S. than Carhartt.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:10.512
Text, In 123 years, we've never stopped making clothes in America, because it matters.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:25.544
Logo, Carhartt.

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.790 line:84%
A lot of times it's
hard to find something

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.331 line:90%
made in America anymore.

00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:12.870 line:84%
There was a lot
of companies that

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.078 line:90%
was here for years and years.

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:15.900 line:84%
And all the sudden,
they're gone.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.470 line:84%
I think people are really tired
of feeling like everything is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.450 line:90%
coming from some other country.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.020 line:84%
In a global economy
that we're in,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.978 line:84%
you know, they think
things are made everywhere

00:00:37.978 --> 00:00:40.000 line:90%
else except right here at home.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.560 line:84%
And I think Carhartt
has proven and shown

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.792 line:84%
that things can be done here
at home and can be successful.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.599 line:84%
We have made products
in the USA for as long

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:55.640 line:90%
as I've been at Carhartt.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.130 line:84%
We did go offshore
and make garments,

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.060 line:84%
but we've continued to
make products in the USA.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.890 line:84%
Somebody that makes the
comment, there's nothing made

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.040 line:84%
in the United States anymore,
than you say, I can tell you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.630 line:90%
there is.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800 line:84%
Making an American
made product is

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.990 line:84%
very important for the
survival of the US.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.720 line:84%
It's important to have these
factories in your home town.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.010 line:84%
It means a lot to
the whole community,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.440 line:90%
what Carhartt does for us.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 line:84%
Being an American
company, we should

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.020 line:90%
make some American products.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.820 line:84%
And in doing that,
we're giving the people

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.494 line:84%
a choice to buy a product
made by people in America.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.950 line:84%
It's where the
company was founded.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.890 line:90%
It's where it's roots are.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.520 line:84%
And it's still where our
owner has his loyalties.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.010 line:90%
It's really part of the culture.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.210 line:84%
And it's part of of the DNA
of not only the product,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.597 line:90%
but really the company.

00:02:29.597 --> 00:02:30.680 line:90%
That's where we came from.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.721 line:84%
It makes me proud to know
that we're still making

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:35.904 line:90%
made in the USA stuff here.

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:37.320 line:84%
What I hope for
more than anything

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.810 line:84%
is that everybody else
has the experience

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.030 line:84%
to be able to work
close to home,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.880 line:84%
and to support their
family with a good job,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.970 line:84%
and to have the pride that
we have, knowing that job

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.540 line:90%
well done.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.590 line:84%
19 years ago, I'll be
honest, when I first started,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.930 line:90%
I didn't know what Carhartt was.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.840 line:84%
Now that I've work with
them, wherever I go,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.760 line:84%
I look to see what's
hanging on the racks.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.860 line:84%
If I see a jacket, one
of the first things

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.370 line:90%
I do to see if it's made here.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.230 line:84%
And then I'll look in the
pocket to see who made it.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.626 line:84%
I'm proud to say I'm
part of Carhartt family.

00:03:16.626 --> 00:03:17.622 line:90%
I really am.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.350 line:84%
One of the Carhartt mottos
is For The American Worker.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.190 line:84%
And if everybody
took the mindset of,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.220 line:84%
I get it done over there
cheaper, if everybody

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.834 line:84%
does that, there's not
going be such thing

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:38.750 line:90%
as an American worker.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.010 line:84%
America was not built
by corporate people

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.490 line:84%
who were sitting behind
desks with suits and ties on.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.920 line:84%
People who actually
got down and dirty

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.400 line:84%
worked hard to
create this country.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.060 line:84%
Carhartt exists to
serve the worker.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.820 line:84%
And without serving
the blue collar worker,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.790 line:90%
we wouldn't be in business.
