00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.869
The Halloween season is almost at its conclusion
and for those who celebrate this yearly event

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.750
I hope you have something fun planned for
the evening!

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.590
If not you can always waste away the time
between carloads of kids by playing some games

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.020
on your iOS device (though if you're home
you may just be watching TV or playing a console...

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.230
shame on you!).

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.740
However, lets not dilly-dally around, I have
costumes to complete and meals to prepare,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.129
so here's the Friday News Wrap Up for the
28th of October, 2011.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.449
I could be all super old and mean and claim
that if you don't love the Peanuts cartoon

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.909
then you're nothing but a cold heartless shell
of a human being, but that wouldn't be productive

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.050
now would it?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.199
Honestly, you'll either love the idea of this
to bits or not, but it looks like Capcom's

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.489
next major release is set to do to Peanuts
what they did to The Smurfs and despite the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.289
handful of mishaps from parents who left themselves
recently logged in to iTunes, for a freemium

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200
game it's still a huge success.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.239
So, do you have what it takes to pull off
a Street Fair while taking control of the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.770
lovable Snoopy?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.920
Street Fair is set to hit the App Store on
the 17th of November.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.410
This news piece is definitely more for the
hardcore fans of the series who just can't

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.350
get enough of the Prince's antics as he rolls
up the denizens of earth for the pleasure

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.510
of the King.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.170
The latest update to the game, released yesterday,
adding six new stages plus a bonus 'Tekken'

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.220
stage.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.270
The 'Time Trip' pack is available for unlocking
in the Online Store for a currently discounted

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.890
price of US$3.99 - so yeah, definitely one
for the hardcore fans.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.880
However, if you're after a real bargain you
can check out most of NAMCO BANDAI's games

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.130
on the App Store as they're currently on sale
at 50% off or more until Midnight PST Monday

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.000
31st of October.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.810
Perhaps one of the biggest complaints we had
at AppSpy about The Dark Meadow was the way

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.960
in which the game managed to hamstring its
pacing and spookiness by packing the game

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.810
full of monsters that required lengthy after-combat
sequences.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.200
With that in mind it's great to see Phosphor
games attempting to recapture the haunting

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.270
feeling of their game by reducing the amount
of monsters wandering and removing the post

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.140
combat summary screen.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.040
Other tweaks to the game include a higher
level cap (from 40 to 50); the addition of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.120
'save slots' to have multiple games running;
and a 'New Game 9' for those after a harder

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.120
challenge.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.650
If you haven't already picked up The Dark
Meadow, the game is currently on sale until

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.580
Halloween for US$2.99 - a great spooky treat
for the holiday season!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.780
Despite being a fan of comics I must admit
more than a little ignorance when it comes

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.909
to the story of Elisa Cameron, a journalist
stuck between the realms of the living and

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.689
the dead as she attempts to solve her own
murder.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.659
Set for release in early 2012, the so-dubbed
'First Person Mystery' (otherwise known as

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.969
a hidden-object adventure game) seems like
an interesting way to bring a comic to life.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.349
If you're a fan of the comic, hit up the comments
and let us know what you think.

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.540
This piece of news has me conflicted - on
the one hand the Wizardry series is a classic

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.499
that certainly deserves at least some mention,
other other the recent release of Labyrinth

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.560
of Souls on the Playstation Network was so
true to its roots that it sort of missed the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.120
part where it's 2011, not 1981.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.440
Surprisingly, despite being a personal fan
of the work by RPG studio Atlus, their 2001

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.440
reboot of the series passed me by, so this
recent reboot of a reboot was truly surprising.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.201
At any rate the game is set to see its way
on to iOS devices with a copy of the game

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.849
dropping on the App Store on the 3rd of Nov.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.090
If you love classic dungeon crawling (and
I do mean real dungeon crawling - graph paper

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:36.889
and all, no mini-maps) then keep an eye out
for this one.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.530
While this may not excite many of our viewers,
I'm always interested in checking out games

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.010
that come out of the smaller studios out there
(and by small I mean super small) because

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.330
there's a chance you may find something truly
special and unique.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.230
Unfortunately Ocarbot isn't quite on the upper
tiers of being one of these hidden gems, however

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.159
fans of puzzle games may still get a kick
out of the little robot's plight.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.980
Each room simply requires you to get to the
exit - you have three controls to complete

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.390
this task, moving left/right and going up
ladders.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.290
Being set in what is essentially a platform-based
world, these restrictions bring complications

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.379
of their own, even before you have to navigate
simple hazards such as pits or magnets.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.010
Thankfully Ocarbot can push around blocks
to move past them, Sokaban-style, and with

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.959
50 levels to conquer it's not an easy game
to complete.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.850
The retro style of the game feels more like
a shortcut, rather than a serious artistic

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.730
choice, but the chip tune soundtrack can be
catchy.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.510
It would have helped if the game included
more user-friendly options such as the ability

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.580
to 'undo' moves, as having a single mistake
ruin a puzzle at the last moment can be a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.600
serious chore.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.950
It's not perfect, but Ocarbot scratches that
brain-tickling itch if you have it.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.030
As much as I'd like to pretend that there's
another game that can pip the first-place

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.060
post for this week, Modern Combat 3 is just
too strong a contender, knocking out its opponents

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.330
left-and-right.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.470
Although there are a lot of obvious shortcomings
in the game's singleplayer campaign, the multiplayer

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.240
is where this title truly shines and as the
servers start to stabilize and players start

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.970
to unlock more weaponry, the game's true colors
are beginning to shine.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.540
Many attempts have been made to bring a competitive
FPS scene to the iOS and many have fallen

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.760
to the wayside - Modern Combat 3 improves
on its predecessor by only a margin, but it's

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.170
enough to make it worthwhile for any action
fan after a fast-paced online shooter.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.760
As always you can keep track of our updates
at AppSpy via Twitter, Facebook or RSS and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.100
we'll be back after the weekend to bring you
a whole bunch of juicy reviews.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.190
Until then, enjoy the weekend!
