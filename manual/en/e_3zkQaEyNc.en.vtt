00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.670 position:98%
JOSH BROWNE: At most of the race tracks, you're
cornering for a large percentage of the lap. That's why you could

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.200 position:72%
say the races are won and lost in the corners.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.630 position:98%
STEVE LETARTE: The corners are where all your speed is
gained or lost. Sometimes you see a guy going down the straightaway

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.670 position:98%
and you think this other car has fifty more horsepower because he
drives right by him. Well, people don't understand that was all

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.930 position:98%
momentum from what happened back in the corner. The guys that
understand the corner the best, make the car change direction the

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.000 position:97%
fastest and apply the power the best, they're gonna be successful.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.500 position:98%
NARRATOR: The roar of the engines, the squeal of the
tires, then the race to victory lane. It all says, NASCAR. A race

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.670 position:98%
car is much more than steel, gas, rubber and speed. A race car is a
science experiment on wheels.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.430 position:98%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: Driving a stock car is easy,
right? Go fast and turn left. Turns out there's a whole lot more to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.700
turning left than you might think.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.000 position:97%
STEVE LETARTE: Racing is usually all about the turns
when it comes to NASCAR. Because you or I could probably drive a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.670 position:98%
straight line. Our speeds are not the 300 miles an hour. At 180 or
200 miles an hour, while that seems fast, straight is straight, and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.430
it's pretty easy to do.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.300 position:98%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: Straight is simple. In fact
most things want to go straight. When I give this ball a push, it

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.470 position:98%
goes straight, and it will keep going straight until something makes
it change direction. Similarly, a race car going 180 miles an hour down

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.600 position:98%
down the straightaway will keep going 180 miles an hour down the straightaway
unless something makes it change direction.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600 position:63%
That something is the centripetal force.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.570 position:98%
NICK HUGHES: In order to make the car go around a
corner, we have to provide a force that is perpendicular to the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.170
direction of travel.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.370 position:97%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: When I tie the ball to a string
and push the ball, the centripetal force generated by the string

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.800 position:97%
makes the ball move in a circle. Of course, race cars don't have
strings to make them turn. They have tires.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.000 position:88%
JOHN PROBST: The contact patch for the tire would be its
footprint. You know, the tire itself's footprint,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.130
relative to the track.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.130 position:97%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: When sitting still, the contact
patch for a single tire is about the area of a man's size eleven

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.530 position:97%
shoe print. But tire camber, the banking of the track, and the way
the car's weight shifts in the turn, may make it smaller. So for a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.130
right front tire in a left turn...

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.530 position:97%
BRANDON THOMAS: ...you're looking at a contact patch
that's probably four inches wide, maybe two to three inches long. So

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.370 position:95%
you're talking about a very small area producing a very large
amount of force.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.030 position:94%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: Taking turn one at Texas Motor
Speedway at 180 miles an hour requires over 10,000 pounds of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.300 position:83%
centripetal force. That's something a driver notices.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.170 position:97%
JEFF GORDON: I'd rarely ever take my hand off the
steering wheel in the corners. But you know, there are certain

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.200 position:97%
tracks we go to where maybe I have had to do something. And the
first time you do it, it's sort of a wake up call. You go, whoa!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.370 position:97%
You know, you gotta kinda catch your hand and be ready for it.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.470 position:97%
CARL EDWARDS: The time when I really notice it is if I
go to grab my drink bottle or something, even under caution, my hand

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.270 position:98%
pools up with blood, you know, and I have to bring it back and work
it a little bit to make it quit tingling.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.000 position:94%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: The couple of tons of force you
need to make the car turn, doesn't only come from the tires.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.430 position:97%
STEVE LETARTE: If you go out into a parking lot and you
try to drive around in a circle, you don't have a whole lot of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.630 position:97%
confidence because the parking lot's completely flat, and you have
nothing really holding you up, and eventually you wanna slide out.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.370 position:97%
But now if you put angle or banking to that, and you pull two or
three degrees of lateral G, well now that banking's really helping

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.570
you to go around and to the left.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.270 position:98%
BRANDON THOMAS: Banking makes the car think it's driving
a straighter line. So if you have a corner radius, say a really

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.830 position:97%
tight corner radius and there's no banking, you can only go around
that corner, say, 50 miles an hour. But now take a similar corner

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.600 position:84%
radius with a high bank, you can go 100 miles an hour.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.170 position:98%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: The track always pushes on the
car perpendicular to the track's surface. On a flat track the force

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:46.000 position:98%
is straight up. On a banked track, only part of the track's push is
straight up. The rest of the push is toward the center. The track

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.300
actually helps the car turn.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.030 position:97%
STEVE LETARTE: If you drive around the race track in a
street car, you have to turn to the right. Because the banking alone

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.300 position:72%
wants to slide you to the bottom of the track.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.100 position:97%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: Even though Dover and Phoenix
are both one-mile tracks, Dover has 24 degrees of banking, while the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.970 position:97%
highest banked turn at Phoenix is only 11 degrees. Cars get a lot more
help turning at Dover than they do at Phoenix. Even air helps the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.670
cars turn.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.130 position:95%
NICK HUGHES: The amount of grip that's generated by all
four tires basically sums together with the side force that's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:25.170 position:98%
aerodynamically pushing on the car, to sum to a force that will
dictate how hard you can corner the car.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.330 position:97%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: Aerodynamic side force is the
force of the air pushing the car sideways, just like you'd feel when


00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.130 position:98%
you're driving past a semi-trailer on the expressway. Side force is
also one reason for the end plate on the rear wing.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.630 position:98%
JOHN PROBST: If we had ten pounds of side force, which
would be aerodynamic side force, basically air pushing the car back

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.300 position:98%
to center, if you will, so trying to steer it straight, then that's
directly ten pounds going to help turn the car.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.070 position:97%
DIANDRA LESLIE-PELECKY: The next time someone tells you
that all there is to driving a stock car is turning left, you tell

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.470 position:98%
them, it takes a combination of tires, the track, and the air, to
generate the thousands of pounds of force necessary to get a car

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:11.430 position:97%
into and out of a turn at 180 miles an hour. Guts, and a heavy right
foot help. But in the end, you need the right science to turn left.
