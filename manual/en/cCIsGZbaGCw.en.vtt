NOWNESS presents

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.420
A film by Ryan Hopkinson

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720
Demon chef

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.760
In eastern culture, we believe that

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.480
There are demons

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.260
There is a round where there are spirits

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.980
And they are wondering

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.860
I call myself the demon chef

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.200
Because I would say I am in this round

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.020
It’s not positive it’s not negative

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.119
It is just free for all

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939
This is where I belong

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.860
When I see something, a spark happening

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.760
Some energy of creativity gets into my mind

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520
So I’m looking for a dimension

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.079
That nobody has actually looked at

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.550
Because that makes it unique

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.770
That makes it innovative

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
I try not to have favor in ingredients

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
Because it shrinks my perspective, 
it shrinks my feel

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.930
It shrinks my imagination

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.800
Everything I do, I try to utilize

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.140
Something from the Chinese dictionary.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.660
Texture is very important in the Chinese culture,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.759
We emphasize it, we describe our food with
texture.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.390
We don’t describe it with taste.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.130
We actually have different degrees of crunchy

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.970
that's not even in the English language

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.139
When we create a dish

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.399
I want to excite, remind

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.219
I want to open up your imagination

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.719
before I start to present my food

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.680
I want to take your comfort zone

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.780
And bring it to the edge

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.079
This is what the “X-treme” Chinese mean

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.299
Bringing you to that edge, of life and death,

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.030
Of what’s sane and what’s insane, the
edge of good and bad

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.270
I’m able to take you closer and closer to
that edge without you falling

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420
And what exciting that experience is
