00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.660
German: . . . crowns in all her mouth, and
she's a returning customer.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.660
Where do you live?

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.860
Yvonne: I live in Canada.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.860
German: In which part?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860
Yvonne: In Alberta.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860
German: In Alberta.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.061
This is the third time that she has been here,
and

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:24.850
with all those teeth that we made, crowns
and veneers and there was one

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.480
bridge that we did.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.730
There is a big change in the way that she
smiles.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.520
Tell
us a little bit about how your life changed

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.790
with your beautiful smile,
without makeover.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.230
Yvonne: Well, I feel really confident.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.160
I just love my teeth, and my
smile.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.411
So do a lot of people.

00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:44.290
I get tons of compliments, and he's my hero.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.480
German: Every patient requires a different
way of treatment.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.930
I took us
nine days, isn't it, to do all of your teeth.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.760
All the [performance] of your
teeth.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.510
Yvonne: Yeah.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.399
German: Even with that, but every time that
she comes back, it's just

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.059
for a small adjustment.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.890
Remember that teeth are always changing.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.090
Probably
not the tooth, but the way that you bite,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.270
and it depends a lot on how you
clean your teeth, and also the service and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.270
maintenance.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.270
You go away here
every four months?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.270
Yvonne: Yeah.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.270
Very important.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.270
Cleaning and flossing.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.270
Yes.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.270
German: It's important.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.270
Water Pik?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.270
Yvonne: And Water Pik.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.270
Every four months I go.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.270
German: Yeah, that's what I recommend.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.280
Obviously she goes every four to
six months to do those regular cleanups, and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.970
what have they told you about
those teeth?

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.970
Did they like them?

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:34.970
Yvonne: They love my teeth.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.490
They're really impressed back home in
Canada, that those are really well done' really

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.490
well done.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:52.349
German: Tell me about your mom, what we did
to her?

00:01:52.349 --> 00:02:00.759
Yvonne: My mom had a full mouth makeover with
crowns, and I think there

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.759
was a bridge in there.

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.759
German: How old is she?

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.759
Yvonne: My lovely mom is 54, but looks 15
years younger.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.759
We saved a lot
of money.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.450
German: We work with the same materials that
they use back home,

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
because porcelain is basically made in Germany
or Japan, and also in the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.580
States.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.490
We just have to import the materials, that
are the same materials

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.110
that you use back home.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.380
That's why the quality is the same.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.990
The difference
is the price only.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.310
And the price depends only, just because we
try to make

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.140
an ethical profit, that's all.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.000
We can play with shades, heights, and also
types of colors.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.811
I would like to see you here clinically so
I can give you

00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:41.811
different options.

00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.840
That depends also on the type of skin, and
also if

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:54.000
you're a little more conservative in the way
you want to look.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.650
That's all,
and thank you for coming again.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.650
Yvonne: Thank you for having me.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.650
German: And please give a big hug to [Seven].

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.990
He's the number one
tattoo guy in Canada, isn't he?

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.060
Yvonne: He is.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.420
German: He has a three month waiting . . .

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
Yvonne: Three year.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.230
German: Three year waiting list.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.230
So,.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.710
Imagine how good he is.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.710
Please,
Seven.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.471
A big hug for you, and I hope you take some
vacations here in

00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:14.471
Cancun.

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.471
Thank you.

00:03:15.471 --> 00:03:16.471
Yvonne: He's an artist, just like you.

00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:17.471
German: An artist?

00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:18.471
Well, I do sculpture, and I do sculpture also
in

00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:21.280
bronze, but also I do sculpture in teeth.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.470
We do it with heart.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.080
Please come
to visit us here in Cancun, Mexico.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.530
Yvonne: I recommend this clinic to anybody,
and everybody.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.920
German: Thank you.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.370
So, bye bye to everyone, and I hope to see
you here.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.370
Yvonne: Bye.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.370
German: See you.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.372
Thank you.
