HARVEY FOSTER: You have to
believe in traveling.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.680
You've got to go out
and do stuff.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.920
Of course I've had fun.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.380
I have fun everywhere, man.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.030
Every single spot we went to
there's something to remember.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.800
Like when my bike broke down.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.850
The roughest moments
you remember a lot.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.370
Well, at least my fucking bike
broke down on the Baja and not

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160
in Victoria.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.152
The day before though, I knew
my bike was running hard.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.506
I need that wrench.

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:11.760
It's too loose.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.440
We rode for half an hour, people
started passing me

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.620
because I wanted to slow
down and just enjoy it.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.810
So I got all that out of me.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.390
And fucking, the Canadians
are behind me--

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.260
Ky and Keegan.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.900
He pulls up beside me and
I was smoking man.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.660
I was smoking.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.160
KYNAN TAIT: I don't know.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.680
He was ahead of us and we pulled
over and there was just

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.960
oil everywhere.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.191
He was leaking oil last night,
and then it just looked it

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.441
blew up today.

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:44.160
HARVEY FOSTER: A man's always
got to push his bike.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.502
That's sick, hey?

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:47.260
That was dope.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.010
I don't know, I wanted
to push my bike.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.990
I got a moment with
her right now.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.510
And he knows I don't have many
possessions in life except for

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.915
my motorcycle.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.340
And he makes fun of me for being
a free spirit-- yeah,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.390
I'll go whatever, do whatever.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.360
But I'm going to sound like a
total typical Harley Davidson

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.479
dude, but my bike is my life.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.510
When my bike broke down, Keegan
handed me the machete.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.480
All right, cool.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.170
It's not like all my anger
and all my shit is gone.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.840
But it was like, whatever, make

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.560
the best of the situation.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.835
I like the way this
guy thinks.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.990
Got my fucking captain
right there, with me.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.910
Actually, I like that you
were there a lot.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.620
I was really fucking stoked.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.690
I don't know if that's like a
teary moment or something for

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.810
people who don't know
me and this guy.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.460
But we kind of do a lot
of shit together.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.130
So when it broke down I was
like, who else would I want to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.080
be beside me other than
the guy I'd go

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.383
across the country with?

00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:55.355
KYNAN TAIT: Good riding
with you, Harvey!

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.230
HARVEY FOSTER: I didn't
get to do this trip.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.870
Like, I did the trip
a different way.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.380
That's all I think about in the
truck is like, oh man, I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.863
hope we pull over somewhere
where they need gas and we can

00:03:22.863 --> 00:03:24.113
skate some.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:27.758
Yes!

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:42.650
That thing was really tight.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.070
And it sucks, too, because there
was like professional

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.610
skateboarders there and
I couldn't do it.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.495
When they could have done
a really good trick.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.570
[SCREAMS]

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.960
Heath and Keegan placed a bet
whether I'd do it or not.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.430
Heath said no one could do it.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.720
Keegan said I could do it.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.630
So then when I heard about
that, too, I was like I'm

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.800
letting Canada down.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.750
Because we're used to stupid
spots that are really fucking

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.385
stupid to skate and we have
to work to skate them.

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:11.645
So I was kind of like fuck,
I blew it there.

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.650
But I don't have patience
for things like that.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.079
I don't have patience at all.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.180
If I didn't do it in ten
tries, I was over it.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.480
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.240
No way.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.808
It was hot, that's my excuse.

00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:29.670
No, I'm over this.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.380
But, I don't know, I think the
next two days are going to be

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.620
a lot of fun.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.890
I can even feel it in
the group, too.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.080
Because I think it's been hard
on them riding a lot in hot

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.210
weather, bugs, windy roads.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.260
But I think the next few days
are going to be a lot of fun.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.243
This is good to think
about, too.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:03.865
BILL BRYANT: We're coming
out of Mulege.

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:06.910
It's about 15 miles south
and we rounded a

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.495
corner up on a hill.

00:05:07.495 --> 00:05:10.170
And looking down onto that
bay, I think everybody's

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.990
stoked meter just went
through the roof.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.972
That's what everybody
expects from Baja.

00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:17.506
You want to see some crystal
clear water, you want to see a

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:19.130
big, white beach and hardly
anybody there.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.545
And we rode down there and
stripped off our clothes and

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.264
ran out in the water
in our underwear.

00:05:24.264 --> 00:05:27.236
I think that was an epic point
of the trip, it was just fun.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.790
ARTO SAARI: Sorry about it.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.915
Floating in paradise
with a beer.

00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:36.237
I'm sorry.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:37.211
I'm sorry.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.133
I rode a motorcycle here.

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:41.975
HIME HERBERT: That was insane.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.640
That was like a postcard.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.982
Fuck, man, this is what
I signed up for.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.290
KEEGAN SAUDER: I honestly can't
think of one high point.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.350
Like, it just kind
of blends in.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.000
The whole thing is
pretty magical.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.580
Just the fact that we're all
doing this, the whole thing is

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.120
just amazing.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.974
This is like, this is
living right here.

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:10.050
This is how it should be.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.500
I know one day it's going to
end, so I'm definitely trying

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.646
to take full advantage of it and
just appreciate the hell

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:16.896
out of it right now.
