00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.589
Hey everyone, Jason here.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.790
Today I'm excited to show you my latest alternate model design.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.310
A few months ago I was invited to take part
in an alternate model build challenge,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.220
and the set I was given was this one. It's set 60004 and it's obviously a fire station.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.780
Part of the challenge was to build a model
in the same theme as the original set,

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.989
in this case the LEGO City theme.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.200
And also to keep it targeted towards the same age range as the original set,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.140
which I think in this case was ages 8 to 12.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.520
The biggest challenge for me was just coming
up with an idea of what to build. Obviously

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.750
I don't build a lot of models in the LEGO
City theme.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.560
When Kristal saw the number of windows in this set she suggested I build a window factory,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.620
which got me thinking about construction in general, and led me to build this construction site.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.540
I tried to incorporate a lot of play feature
into this, so let's take a look at it.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.240
There are four main components to the model.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.200
The unfinished office building, which is obviously still under construction,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.600
the working tower crane, 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.740
this truck and trailer for hauling materials around and the construction office.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.100
The office building is pretty basic, although
I did repurpose the garage doors from the

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.870
fire station as a skylight,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.159
and I intentionally did not use all of the
major building elements so that you could

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.850
finish it off as you see fit.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.380
Right now the office building is attached
to the tower crane using some of these extra

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.729
pieces, but we can easily take those away,
and we'll take a look at the tower crane.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.530
This small Technic connector and bar can slide
along the long Technic axle which was used

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.170
as the fire pole in the original set

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.969
to raise and lower the load, and I just have
a couple of these slope pieces here that

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.990
that Technic piece can sit behind to lock it in place.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.540
I also added the small winch onto this bar,
and there's enough friction between it and

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.600
the bar that you can use it to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.400
lift the load even further, or lower it.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.799
This Technic piece here can also act as a primitive trolley,

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.799
and you can slide it along that axle to bring
the load closer in or further out

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.320
from the base of the tower crane.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.890
I have designed several baskets for the crane.
They each have a single stud at the top which

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.620
allows the 'hook' of the crane to attach to
them.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.840
Each one is designed for a different material.
This one is for the window frames.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.140
The one is designed for the panes of glass.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.240
And this one is for the tall building bricks.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.150
And of course because the attachment is just
a stud on the crane hook, you can simply attach

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.790
any part that has a stud on it, and carry
it around.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.960
Underneath each of the baskets is this simple
frame which fits snugly over the tile either

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.720
on the back of the truck or on the trailer.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.030
And that way it locks them into place, so
as you're moving you materials around they

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.310
won't fall off.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.260
They're completely interchangeable.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
The trailer is attached to the truck using
this simple tow hook.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.760
The roof of the construction office is only
attached using a few studs,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.540
so that way it is easily removed.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.300
So you can get in there and play with all
the fun little details.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.580
There's a computer, storage container, some
coffee cups and tools, and a little stove

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.760
for cooking your lunch on.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.620
So, when we put it all together, we can drive our materials in,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.360
go pick them up with the tower crane,

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.540
and bring them over to continue working on
the building.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.900
Just like for all my alternate model designs
I have created

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.100
step by step building instructions for this model.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.690
You can find them freely available at my website
at jkbrickworks.com

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.350
I'll add a direct link at the end of the video
and in the description below.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.290
Hope you enjoyed the video. Thanks for watching,
keep on building and I will see you next time.
