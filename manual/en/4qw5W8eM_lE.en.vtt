00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.069
Instructions are necessary before

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.290
operating or servicing your Bobcat skid

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.049
steer loader. Read and understand the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.670
operation and maintenance manual,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.369
operators handbook, and decals on the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.770
machine. Follow warnings and instructions

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580
in the manuals when making repairs,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.890
adjustments, or servicing. Check for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.810
correct function after adjustments,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.410
repairs, or service. Untrained operators

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.110
and failure to follow instructions can

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.320
cause injury or death. Let's take a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.179
minute to show you some things to look

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.909
for before you operate Bobcat compact

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.489
loaders. Let's start with the front of the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.069
machine, the Bob-Tach. Look for the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.949
obvious. Any loose hardware, broken pieces,

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.589
or leaky hoses, and repair them as

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.800
necessary. Also, make sure that the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.960
Bob-Tach levers are fully engaged with

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.870
the attachment, so that the wedges extend

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.850
through the holes in the attachment

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.940
mounting frame. Next, check the ROPS for

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.590
any damage and make sure the mounting

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.510
hardware is attached. Now let's inspect

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.870
the track for any abnormal wear patterns,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.930
and also check for proper tension.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.910
A track that's too loose can cause

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.340
de-tracking, and one that's too tight can

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.740
cause a loss of power and add excessive

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.470
stress to the drive components. Refer to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.390
the maintenance manual and watch the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.250
video on track tension to make the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.800
necessary adjustments. If this were a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.500
Bobcat wheel loader, we would look for warrant

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.600
tread, or abnormal wear, low air pressure,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.850
and loose lug nuts. Okay moving along,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.050
we'll want to inspect the lift arm

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.970
support device, replace it if it's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.820
damaged. Check the hydraulic fluid

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700
level, look for damaged hoses and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.220
fittings, look for wear that could cause

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.220
damage,  look for oil residue that could

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.380
indicate a leak, and look for puddles on

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.280
the ground that could signal a leak. The

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.619
operators area, engine compartment, and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.170
engine cooling system must be inspected

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.600
and cleaned if necessary, to prevent fire

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.700
hazards and overheating. Some

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.630
applications

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260
may require this several times a day.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.520
Open the tailgate and latch the door

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.370
stop. Look for any loose or worn wires,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.220
tube lines, or hoses. Check for debris and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.830
foreign material. Now let's look at the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.560
service schedule. There's a service decal

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.900
showing the required service at various

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.510
hours of usage on the machine. There's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.650
also a grease chart with instructions.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.530
Check the engine oil, the water trap on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.840
the fuel filter, and make sure the oil

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.700
cap and fuel cap are in place and tight.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.010
Also, look for damage or leaks in the air

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.880
filter system. Now remove the cover over

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.830
the hydraulic and engine coolers, and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.310
check for and remove any debris. Check

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.990
the engine coolant level, while the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.970
engine is cold. Check the cooling system

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.730
for damage or leaks. Replace the cover

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.280
and close the tailgate, making sure they

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.820
are latched securely. Walk around the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.800
loader, check for any loose hardware,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.160
damage safety decals or treads, and make

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.960
sure they are replaced or repaired as

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.080
necessary. Now we're ready to get in the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.280
operators compartment.

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.610
Inspect the seatbelt and then fasten it.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.409
Check the functionality of the seat bar

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.769
and pull it down. Then turn the ignition

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.110
to the on position and check the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.540
operation indicator lights. This light

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.489
signals the need to change the air

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.430
filter. Operate the backup alarm in front

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.069
horn, now start the engine and check the

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.359
vic system functions.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.310
Now, inspect and secure your jobsite and

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.340
you're ready for operation. If you need

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.620
or want more information, contact your

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.199
local Bobcat dealer. They can also offer

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.389
training or perform service work for

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.610
your Bobcat machine, and are your source

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.470
for genuine Bobcat parts.
