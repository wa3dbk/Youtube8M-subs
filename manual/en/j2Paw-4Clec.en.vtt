00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:20.090
SCP-821 is a structure located within the
former town of Esheville, FL. Records recovered

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:30.259
from the local government indicate it was
constructed sometime between 1955-1957.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:38.570
The interior is in a permanent state of degradation,
with all attempts at maintenance or restoration

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.570
being unsuccessful.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.269
SCP-821's interior contains a varying number
of devices intended for children, such a carousel,

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:57.230
a stage with a set of 4 animatronic figures,
and a variety of midway games.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.020
There are also a number of kiosks which sold
food and souvenirs when SCP-821 was active.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.269
During initial containment, these devices
were fully functional.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.340
Maintenance was performed by humanoids within
SCP-821, formerly known as SCP-821-1, who

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.880
also operated the devices within SCP-821.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.549
Instances of SCP-821-1 were humanoid automatons
composed of painted copper.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.720
Devices contained within SCP-821 displayed
anomalous properties when they functioned,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
including:

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.750
interior.jpeg
A portion of SCP-821's current interior.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.290
Models of animals that were attached to the
carousel would move autonomously.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.890
Animatronics were shown to be able to engage
prepubescent subjects in conversation.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.560
Food and drink were produced within SCP-821
without a source.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.840
Midway games that would emit vocalizations
complimenting users with high scores.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.229
The animatronic band was composed of four
machines, each playing a different instrument.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.369
Once per hour, they would play a set of popular
songs from 1957-1960.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.770
When not playing, these animatronics could
communicate with subjects observing them,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.090
and were capable of conducting basic conversation.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.579
Notably, vocalizations produced in this manner
were shown to be unique, with logs compiled

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.560
between 1959-1961 showing that no conversation
had been repeated.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.509
However, following Incident SCP-821-A, all
instances of SCP-821-1 were apparently destroyed

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:12.980
or otherwise removed, and SCP-821 began to
exhibit rapid structural deterioration.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.069
The devices contained within SCP-821 began
to function erratically, showing much more

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.420
dangerous properties than had previously been
observed.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.610
In addition, SCP-821 itself is no longer safe
to enter due to its structural damage.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.550
Alterations to devices include portions of
the carousel and animatronic band becoming

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.110
aggressive, striking and biting any subjects
that approached them.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.319
Notably, portions of SCP-821 capable of speech
were highly apologetic, offering to assist

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.340
the subject that had been injured.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.640
Currently, no components of SCP-821 capable
of producing speech are functional.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.819
Addendum: Incident 821-A.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.099
On 4/11/1989, personnel attempting to enter
SCP-821 found that the entrance had been sealed

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:03.599
off, and a note labeled "OUT OF BUSINESS"
affixed to the door.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.130
Investigation into SCP-821's interior showed
that no instances of SCP-821-1 could be located.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:25.570
In the center of the main floor, a letter
was found.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.380
The text of the letter has been included in
this report.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.610
As of 5/16/1999, SCP-821 has been designated
as neutralized.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.730
Hello my friends.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:41.510
This is a day we have all been dreading, and
I am sad to be the one who has to break the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.510
news.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.790
You've all known for awhile that Funland has
been having troubled times for a very long

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.310
while, and although times were tough, we always
managed to pull through.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.569
But we can't do it anymore.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.060
I've seen the parks and attractions that come
from the huge amusement companies, and we

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.069
just can't compete.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:09.750
The children just aren't interested in old
places like this.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:18.590
The skee-ball, Big Bertha's show plaza, the
carouselâ€¦ they just don't care.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.609
They're bored by it.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:29.520
The world 
has moved on.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:41.310
I know that each of you has put a lifetime
into making Funland a success, and that's

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.500
the hardest thing for me.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:59.670
Each of you will receive a generous severance
package, followed by a pass to return to your

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.670
home.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.060
Thank you for your service.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.860
Mr. Funland
