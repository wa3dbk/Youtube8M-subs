00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.579
Killing people is satisfying. Well it is in
video games, at least. Luckily, I have never

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.570
had to kill anyone in real life, so I can’t
share that experience with you. But, I can

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.189
tell you about the art of the kill in the
video game sense. Specifically, I’d like

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.000
to talk about Assassin’s Creed. The whole
series, actually, because Jakob and I have

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.109
played them all collectively. This series
is the place to go for killing. I mean, it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.220
has assassin in the name, so I wouldn’t
expect much different. As the player, you

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.239
take more than a few lives playing this game,
and the best part is strategizing or setting

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.220
up these kills. If you don't want to do that
though, you can go right ahead and take someone

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.100
down up front. You’ll catch the attention
of the guards while you're at it, so I suggest

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.510
you decide wisely. There’s so much potential
to have variety in kills because of the various

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250
weapons in the game. We think a few weapons
in particular are pretty awesome, so we decided

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.030
to create a top 5 countdown of our favorite
throughout from the time of the Crusades to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.070
Revolutionary America. Stay tuned to witness
some brutal takedowns.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.200
This weapon is the all new, redesigned version
of the blade we’ve all come to know and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.420
love. That’s right folks, it’s the hookblade!
With this, Ezio could climb faster, latch

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.479
on to buildings after jumping from great heights,
slide down zip lines, grab on to people to

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.140
get by them more quickly, kill people with
it, and even use it in cooperation with the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.180
classic hidden blade! You can also be cheap
and swipe peoples legs in battle, which is

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.180
my personal favorite. I’d have to say this
weapon has it all, and it makes Assassin’s

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.040
Creed: Revelations much more fluid as a result.
Not to mention it’s saved my ass from falling

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.040
countless amounts of times.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.880
What's better than chucking a huge deadly
weapon at bad guys? Almost nothing. That's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.680
why the bearded axe is next on the list. While
working my way through Assassins Creed Brotherhood,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.649
I found myself constantly changing weapons
while on my way to missions. The bearded axe

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.590
was one of my favorites, and for good reason.
It is just insanely hard to resist throwing

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.810
a massive axe into the skulls of the guards
patrolling Italy. It is entertaining to say

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.329
the least, but also gives you freedom in some
of your kills since you don't have to be targeting

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.939
someone to throw the axe. What this meant
for me was a lot of civilians’ lives being

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.039
cut short by my axe “accidentally” hitting
their bodies. It's all good though, because

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.730
my deadly actions against civilians were quickly
forgiven… but that doesn't mean I stopped

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.310
killing them.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.440
The Mercenario War Hammer from Assassins Creed
2 is by far one of the most fun weapons to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.390
use. Ezio has a plethora of deadly weapons
to choose from in AC2, but the war hammer

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.610
was always one of my favorites. Oddly enough,
it isn't even THAT good of a weapon. In fact,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.430
it is one of the first few weapons you get,
but its insane kills never get old. You can

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.879
sprint at any group of guards and kill the
first guy with a devastating combination of

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.620
blows. Then, as you counter attack the others,
they quickly meet their end as you smash their

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.420
heads, bodies, and sometimes testicles. So,
for the extremely satisfying deaths the war

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.360
hammer deals out, it earned itself the number
3 spot.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.940
Using the crossbow is the best way to get
in a quick kill from afar without being noticed.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.849
It can also be used to thin out a concentrated
area of guards, in order to make the actual

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.019
fight a little bit easier. Shooting it draws
minimal attention from enemies, which makes

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.830
the crossbow one of the most stealthy items
on the list. Its the Renaissance equivalent

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.010
of the modern sniper rifle, and since sniping
is my favorite form of combat, the crossbow

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.159
holds a special place in my heart. It certainly
suits my stealthy style of play. Unfortunately,

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.919
that doesn’t always work out the way I plan
it to.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.140
To set the scene for the number one weapon,
I want to first put you in the setting I was

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.159
in when I played Assassin's Creed 3. As an
AP United States History student, I was learning

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.980
about everything that surrounded the American
Revolution, so when Assassin's Creed 3 came

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.549
out, it wasn’t an option to pick it up,
it was a necessity. The atmosphere of the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.560
game was enthralling as I relived in person
everything I was learning. The best part about

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.930
the Boston environment is the Frontier, with
its densely wooded forests. In these areas,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.489
Connor can make best use of our favorite weapon,
the rope dart. This weapon has to be the most

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.370
inventive in the series, and not many others
can combat the awesomeness that you feel when

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.670
you pull off a kill with this weapon. It’s
basically a flying noose; Connor throws it

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.970
at an enemy and jumps off a branch or other
thin surface to LITERALLY HANG HIM. Can’t

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.900
get much better than that. Well, we don’t
think so, at least.
