Hi, I'm Kelli, I'm an aesthetician and makeup
artist at Ulta Salon and Cosmetics, and I'm

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.970
going to talk to you today about four common
complexion problems, these are probably the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.659
most common. Acne of course number one. Many
people suffer from an occasional breakout.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.290
You want to decide further whether it's an
occasional breakout or full blown acne, just

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.780
getting a blemish once a month is not consider
acne. Many people over treat the skin for

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.130
acne when you might just need a spot treatment
if you get that occasional blemish, if you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.680
have a lot of breakout, papules and pustules
which are blackheads and whiteheads all over

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.170
the place, then you might need a more aggressive
acne treatment. Hyper-pigmentation is another

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.040
really common skin condition that a lot of
people suffer from. Basically hyper-pigmentation

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.070
is mostly caused by the sun. What happen is
we have melanin in our skin cells and the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.850
melanocytes are what produce melanin, melanin
is what give skin its color. But basically

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.660
what can happen sometimes when you go out
into the sun, tan is basically a defense mechanism

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.540
for your skin, that's why it helps to protect
it from the UV rays, but some of your melanocytes

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.000
might over produce melanin and that can cause
you the age spots or the hyper-pigmentation

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or the uneven skin tone. That can usually
be solved by getting chemical peels or using

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.240
some lightening products. Another really common
problem is redness or sensitivity, there's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.350
a difference between redness and sensitivity
caused from a sensitized skin or for someone

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.490
who truly has sensitive skin. Someone who
has really sensitive skin has allergic reactions

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.200
to products or elements such as wind, sun,
stuff like that. Somebody who has sensitized

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.140
skin maybe has used products that have either
over-stripped the skin or caused to a lot

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.369
of the sensitivity. But those can be remedied
just by using a lot of calming and cooling

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.090
products on the skin, hydrating masks, those
types of things. And of course probably one

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.850
of the largest concerns that people have with
skin is aging, fine lines and wrinkles. This

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.670
can be prevented just by getting on a good
skin care routine and making sure that you're

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.120
using SPF every time that you leave your house,
and they do have a wide variety of anti-aging

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.420
products on the market today. So to recap,
the four most common skin conditions are,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.870
acne, hyper-pigmentation, redness and sensitivity,
and aging.
