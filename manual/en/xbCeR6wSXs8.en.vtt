00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:01.112
- Hi everyone.

00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:02.738
Welcome to another FanScreen video,

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:04.301
sponsored by Cineplex.

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.597
This month I am getting
nostalgic about summer.

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:08.289
Cineplex has asked me to recap

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.154
my best summer day of 2015

00:00:11.154 --> 00:00:12.900
and as soon as they asked me to do that,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.485
I had just the day in mind.

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:16.456
Not only because it was
the day I saw Ant-Man,

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:18.745
but it was the day I decided to live

00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:23.369
the most quintessential,
classic, summer day ever.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.401
I wanted to do stuff that
people do every summer,

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:29.749
but all in one day, like beach volleyball,

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.431
and also just generally
going to the beach,

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.561
buying a Popsicle from one
of those guys on bicycles

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.876
who sell Popsicles to people.

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:39.176
Very summery.

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:42.412
And I was going to see a summer
movie that night, Ant-Man,

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.670
as previously mentioned.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.503
It was a Tuesday, I woke up

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.636
and put on some sunscreen

00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:50.078
and decided the first
thing I was going to do

00:00:50.078 --> 00:00:51.379
was climb a tree.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.065
I've never climbed a tree before.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:55.211
It was a big moment for me.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.513
(soft jazzy music)

00:00:58.034 --> 00:00:59.910
It did not go very well.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.084
- Nope, nope, nope.

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:02.876
- (Voiceover] You know what?

00:01:02.876 --> 00:01:03.505
I think it's okay.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:04.683
I think we can just move along.

00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:07.453
- No, I'm going to get this.

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:08.172
Give ...

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:08.558
One ...

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:09.164
Hold on.

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:10.119
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.258
(soft jazzy music)

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:25.785
- You think you're so big?

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.045
You think you're so smart, eh?

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:27.939
(snapping)

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.300
You want that to be you?

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.419
(soft jazzy music)

00:01:32.103 --> 00:01:33.590
Ew, what is that?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.469
(soft jazzy music)

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:36.115
- [Voiceover] Let's move on.

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:37.029
- Enough.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.269
Give me a sec.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:39.061
One sec ...

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.875
I have a ...

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.445
(soft jazzy music)

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:49.159
You know what?

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.703
You're going to watch me climb this tree.

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.006
It's going to happen.

00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.433
Watch me now.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:05.862
(yelling)

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.705
- So I came to about six hours later

00:02:09.705 --> 00:02:12.377
and after the doctor said I was all clear

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:15.810
I went to see Ant-Man
and I had a great time.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.599
And I didn't get a sunburn,

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.321
which was, I guess, an upside.

00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:21.830
From Monday, August 31st

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.024
all the way to Friday, September 4th

00:02:24.024 --> 00:02:27.168
you can go to a Cineplex
Theatre anywhere in Canada

00:02:27.168 --> 00:02:28.955
and pay Tuesday prices.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.312
It's Tuesday everyday.

00:02:31.312 --> 00:02:32.592
And if you have one of these babies,

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:35.558
you can save another 10%, which is ...

00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.246
um ...

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.176
like, uh ...

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.089
Nope, can't do the math.

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.589
You save money, basically.

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.747
Thank you so much to Cineplex
