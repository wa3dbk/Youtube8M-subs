CHICKEN: Why do I
cock-a-doodle-doo this?

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:06.522
I always over pack.

00:00:06.522 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm never going to get this
suitcase to the airport.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.890

GROVER: So if I carry that

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.475
What do you say?

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:20.910
CHICKEN: That would
be wonderful.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.570
I do have a plane to catch.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.630

is on the case.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.670
[GROVER LAUGHS]

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.042
See what I did there.

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.050
This is the case and
I said I am on--

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.090

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.340
GROVER: Right.

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.250
What is going on?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.860
What has happened to my super
strength and my super energy?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.720
This is terrible.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.340
What am I going to do?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.740
CHICKEN: How should I know?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.030
I'm just a chicken.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.540

[SUPER FOODS SINGING]

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.620
OK, I am going to have
to stop you there.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.030
You can not save the day this
time because you cannot lift

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.840
this suitcase.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760
And besides, you do
not have any arms.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.570
BANANA: No, but we
can help you.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.100

LOAF OF BREAD: What
did you have for

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.400
breakfast this morning?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.680
GROVER: Listen, I am a very
busy super monster.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.950
I do not have time for things
like breakfast or silly

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.250
questions like these.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.766
BROCCOLI: But that's
the problem.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.486
You lost your strength because
you skipped breakfast.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:27.610
GROVER: What does one thing
have to do with the other?

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.310
CHEESE: Eating breakfast gives
you the strength and energy

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.030

LOAF OF BREAD: You shouldn't
skip any meal but specially

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.230
not breakfast.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.660
BANANA: Eating every meal's
important, but breakfast is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.460
the most important
meal of the day.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.062

CHICKEN: Is this gonna
take long?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.970

feel better already.

You were right.

Eating a healthy breakfast
really did do the trick.
