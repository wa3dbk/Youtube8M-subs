00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.519
From the makers of oxygen, we now present
you, our latest revolutionary not-copied-from-anyone

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.980
product yet, the iHandle!

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.220
With only one design more than one use, it
may be only device you'll ever need.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.110
Correction: Never misspelled with ever. Intentionally.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.270
Why do you want it?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.789
Why not ask it why does it want YOU?

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.300
It can be used as a hat!

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.140
Or a food bowl!

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.410
What?

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.219
Maybe a dustpan!

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.729
And it can be used as a gun!

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:49.229
But Dad, it wasn't me!

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:59.699
I'm sorry son, it's too late now.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.369
Or a water bowl!

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.260
Perhaps a defensive device!

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.850
Umm...a mind control device!

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:36.480
Possibly a rake!

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.060
Or a fan!

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.080
I feel nothing, faster!

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.960
A pony!

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:58.010
A calculator too!

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:06.510
How does it even work?

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.630
And of course, a trolling device!

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:22.870
A knife too, of course!

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:31.939
I used to be an adventurer like you, then
I took an arrow to the knee.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.400
An awesome levitation device

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.410
What you're seeing is an optical illusion,
not a chair.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.330
For campers too, a frying pan with non-stick
coating from Tefalâ„¢

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.569
It also can be a furniture, anytime!

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:05.540
It would be nice if there was a chair here.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.040
And for exercise too!

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.719
Uh, a mirror?

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.340
I look fabulous!

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.599
Futhermore, a magic wand!

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.720
And finally, a teleportation device!

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.019
Still not convinced?

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:39.379

customers.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.579
It has changed my life a lot. Without it,
I would have never get this far in life.

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.579
But wait, there's more!
