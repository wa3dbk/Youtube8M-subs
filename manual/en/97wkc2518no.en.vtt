Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I have with me a classic muscle car mod, but

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.610
for your newer generation ride, I'm talking
about MMD's smooth aluminum rear window louver

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.450
fitting all 2005 and newer Mustangs.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.610
IF you're looking for a retro or modern styling
part that's going to set your ride apart from

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.869
the others, look no further than MMD, they've
quickly become the industry leader in producing

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.880
cool and unique styling parts for Mustangs
of all ages.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.510
Alright so rear window louvers are no doubt
one of those love it or hate it mods that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.230
originated back in the 60's or 70's muscle
car era, and can still be found on a lot of

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.440
today's modern muscle cars.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.579
Taking a closer look at the louver itself
you'll notice a lightweight but extremely

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.219
durable aluminum construction, just like those
classic louvers back in the day.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.540
In addition, it is then finished off with
a very sleek matte black paint job, which

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.070
looks great as is, or if you want to get a
little crazy, you can always paint it to match

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.969
your car, for a totally unique look.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.140
Some people may be concerned with losing a
great deal of visibility out of the back window

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.000
when installing something like this and honestly
it is a valid concern, however because the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.130
curvature of the louver itself fits the contour
of the window extremely well, the reduction

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.700
in visibility isn't as bad as you might think.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.310
Another one of the nice features with this
louver is the bracket mounting system, thanks

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.040
to this you can easily unscrew the 4 nuts
securing the louver to the window itself,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.700
and then lift it off completely whenever it
comes time to clean the rear window.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.670
Speaking of those brackets, well you do receive
4 in the package along with all the 3M tape

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.579
needed for the install.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.329
You'll want to clear the 4 corners of the
rear window first using the supplied alcohol

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.141
prep pads, and then prep those same areas
with the included adhesion promoter, just

00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:51.079
to ensure a nice secure bond between the brackets
and the window itself.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.180
When it's all said and done you should be
wrapped up in about an hour from start to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.480
finish.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.620
So if you're one of the many Mustang owners
out there who dig the more retro themed items

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.310
on their modern Mustang, then be sure to check
out MMD's smooth aluminum rear window louver

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.320
