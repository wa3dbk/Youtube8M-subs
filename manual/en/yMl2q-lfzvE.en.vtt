00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.560
Patricia.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.679
Good morning.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:04.509
Lovely to see you.

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:05.809
Very lovely to see you.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:07.289
Welcome to Cuckoo Hall Primary School.

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:08.789
That's fantastic.
Thank you very much, thank you

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.350
This is my colleague Jonathan Hill.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.850
Very pleased to meet you.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.109
Can I introduce our Secretary of State, this
is Mr Gove.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.059
Could you say good morning to Mr Gove?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.230
Good morning Mr Gove.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.300
Good morning boys and girls, good morning.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.400
What do you think is the best thing
about this school?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800
We keep learning more and more, and that helps
us to get clever.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.860
Hands up all those who think that the school
is brilliant, because you get the chance to learn.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.330
And hands up all those of you who
think science is brilliant. That’s great.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.380
Secretary of State, how do you have fun?

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.730
The most fun I have is with my son, who is in
Reception class, making Lego Star Wars models.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.040
This school is one of the best in London,
and one of the best in the country. It’s

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.170
been visited by inspectors from outside, and
they’ve had a look at everything. And they

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.650
see that this school is outstanding, brilliant,
in everything that it does.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.960
Cuckoo Hall Primary School is an outstanding
school in Edmonton, where the headteacher and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.280
her team have achieved fantastic results with
the children. This is the kind of school, which,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.119
in future, could be able to use academy freedom,
to give itself even more freedom.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.200
I want you to help me. Peter made a place
in the, um, ... 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.900
kitchen.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.300
Kitchen, ok.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.069
My view is that people who really know how
best to run schools are the people who love

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.579
education. And we should step back a little
bit, and give heads and teachers a bit more

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.009
control over what happens in the classroom.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.389
We are quite unique in terms of exercising
autonomy in order to bring the best possible

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:49.840
provision into this school for our children.
We do things in the way that we feel our children

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.749
need and benefit from. For example, very,
very focused literacy and maths programmes,

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.179
but also a very creative curriculum, a very
enjoyable curriculum.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.719
One of the things that I want to do is to
make sure that not just schools get the money

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.189
that they need, but also that heads and teachers
have more control over what happens.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:14.189
The government wants to see outstanding teachers
and headteachers, and, in time, parents to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.580
have more freedom to run the schools in the
way that they best can, in order to deliver

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.170
an even better education for all children.
