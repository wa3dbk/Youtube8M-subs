00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.009
A cup of tea. It's a refreshing, healing
everyday treat that we take for granted,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.590
without much thought for the people who
work to make that treat possible.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.730
But young people, particularly young
women, in the tea growing communities

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.280
of India

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.150
are vulnerable. Without completing their
education they're vulnerable to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.300
exploitation:

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.070
open to the temptation to move to cities
where they can find themselves drawn

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.400
into child labour,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.900
at risk of physical and sexual abuse, and
many given in marriage while still children.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.800
Without support they don't know any
different. They aren't aware of other choices

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
and their communities are unable to give
them the protection that all children

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.399
deserve to help them build a better life.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.629
The challenges facing young people,
particularly girls, in rural communities

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.680
in India

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.200
are immense, and there are no quick or easy
solutions. It is only by working at all

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.570
levels with governments,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.360
education and child protection agencies,
and communities,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.910
that we will be able to give children improved life opportunities

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.350
and make the systemic changes that
prevent trafficking

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.630
and other forms of child exploitation.
Unicef and ETP

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.600
are today announcing a three year
program in partnership with tea companies,

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.150
retailers, and our long standing partner IDH, the sustainable trade initiative,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.630
that will focus on the Indian state of
Assam,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.860
and has the potential to serve as a
model to protect children

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.549
across other rural communities. The 3 year Assam program will target families

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.560
in 350 communities linked to a hundred
tea estates.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
It'll equip more than 25,000 girls

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.520
with the knowledge and life skills to
help them secure a better future

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.869
making them less vulnerable to abuse and
exploitation.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.040
It'll give more than 10,000 community
members

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.439
the knowledge and training to protect those
children from all forms of violence.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.750
It'll help make families in each
community aware of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.829
children's rights, and the support they can
call on to help educate and protect

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:54.970
their children.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.939
And it'll work with state and district
governments to improve the quality of

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.049
education and the effectiveness of child
protection.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.189
This project is going to take care of
several layers of stakeholders.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.830
One is the community, which is the most
important, where the child is,

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.020
and then moving on to working with the
government

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.200
at different levels: both at the village
level, district

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
and state level, and working with the
government ensuring

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.319
that that is going to be a policy change,
there is going to be better implementation

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.640
of rules and regulations,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.810
to ensure that the rights of the child are

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.920
secured. At the same time working
with the tea estate managers,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.300
working with the tea companies, to
look at the business from a child's perspective.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.349
I think where Unicef has intervened, girls have learned to dream

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.129
and to learn to realise their dream as well.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.379
And they know that it is possible to do
that. We're delighted to help fund this

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.440
program and work with a range of experts
from Unicef and ETP to address the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.300
serious issues which communities in

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.580
Assam face. For Tesco it's also about
demonstrating

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.250
that wherever we source we want to make sure we're having a positive impact with our trade.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.500
And there's very few products that it's more important to do that with than the everyday cuppa.
