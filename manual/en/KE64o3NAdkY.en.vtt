00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.740
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.200
if your speedometer isn't working, then stay tuned,
because today I'm going to show how to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.990
fix the speedometer that stuck on zero,
now cars used to be simple, the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.010
speedometers had a cable that went
inside the speedometer head, and it's

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.809
spun and made the speedometer move, but
modern cars stopped using speedometer

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.580
cables over 20 years ago, modern cars
are all computerized, this is a speed

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.540
sensor that bolts in the transmission,
and it sends electrical impulses to the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.190
dash to make the speedometer work, with
such computerized systems, you use

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.960
another computer, a scan tool, to analyze
what's going wrong with the system, in

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.680
the case of the Honda, we plug it into
under the cigarette lighter where the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.170
data port is, right down in here, in it
goes, then we put the scan tool on data

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.090
and watch the speed as we drive, in this
case, the speed stayed at zero even

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.539
though we're going at least thirty, so
we all the sensor isn't giving any

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.580
information to the computer, so in this
case, we'll replace the speed sensor, but

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.759
if the scan tool was giving the miles an
hour in the correct speed while we are

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.119
driving, that would mean the speed
sensors working, and probably the

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.560
speedometer inside the dash was bad, now
in the case of the Honda, the speed

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.950
sensors hidden on the transmission, way
under here, so we got to take all this

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.540
air duct work out of the way to even see
it, we'll just pull this all out the way,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.479
wiggle it and get off, and there's a
sensor hiding down inside the engine

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.110
right there, I've unplugged the plug on
the top of it, so you can see it better,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.420
here's a new one, it just has two little
bolts you take off and pull it out, and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.040
out comes the old dirty one, be sure to
make sure they're the same, they got the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.060
same bottom and the same connector so it
looks like the right part, then you just

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.979
get their old ten millimeter socket
ratchet, bolt it back in, put the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.390
electrical connection in until it snaps,
well in this case, it didn't snap it so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.950
old, but it is on, then we put all the
place a duct work back on, now we'll

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.940
close the hood and take it for a drive,
off we go and there goes the speedometer,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.620
it's working now, so the next time your
speedometer breaks, why not fix it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.120
yourself, it's not that hard,

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.019
and remember if your car has any
problems just visit the Scotty Kilmer

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.000
channel, before it's too late!
