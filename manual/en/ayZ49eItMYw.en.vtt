&gt;&gt; Hilah: Hey dudes!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:04.210
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I am
gonna show you a really quick and simple beef

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.390
and broccoli stir fry.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.759
This is one of our go-to meals around my house,
and stir fry is just a great thing to know

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.059
how to do because you can pretty much throw
whatever you want in there, so and we did

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.450
a tofu stir fry many, many years ago, but
no we’re going to do a stir fry for the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.279
rest of you people, including the men folk
because if you eat too much tofu, you might

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.910
grow boobs like mine!

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.730
&gt;&gt; Hilah: We’ve got a skirt steak here.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.160
You can use skirt of flank steak or even like
sirloin tips, but skirt steak is pretty inexpensive.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.050
The only thing that you need to remember is
to cut it across the grain really thinly,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.120
so and we’re going to do that.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.140
First thing I am just gonna just flip it over.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.040
The other side is where the fat is and just
trim off any excess fat or this little membrane

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.800
stuff, and skirt and flank steak are sort
of both, well they are, they are not sort

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.780
of, they’re both from the underside of the
cow, and they both can be a little stringy

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.420
and tough, but they’re both really, really
nicely flavored meats if you prepare them

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.690
right, and I will show you.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.450
Skirt steak has got a little more fat than
flank steak, and they’re both pretty inexpensive.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.030
This is also the cut that you would use for
fajitas.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450
Banjo and Daisy are gonna love this!

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.860
Ah oh, I shouldn’t have said their names.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.620
I know we can be so, I’m just sort of pulling
and cutting with a really sharp knife to get

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.910
this off.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.070
Okay, so once you’ve got your piece of meat
pretty well trimmed like this, I’m actually

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.900
just gonna stick it in the freezer for like
10 minutes and having it kind of partially

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.330
frozen when you slice it is gonna to make
it easier to slice it really thinly, and while

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.600
our meat is partially freezing, I can go ahead
and start prepping our broccoli.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.620
I’ve just got a couple of stalks here, and
I am gonna get rid of the stem, and I usually

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.030
hang on to these and add them to soups or
like, other stir-frys or make puree, like,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.350
broccoli soup out of them, so you don’t
have to throw it away, and then we’ll just

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.280
start sort of slicing at the bottom here to
get these florets off, and you want to keep

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.730
them in their little cute tree shape, you
know, to validate yourself making authentic

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.019
Chinese food at home.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.730
It looks a lot prettier that way.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:16.730
Hmm hmm hmmm.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.730
Doop doop doop.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.579
And then once you get to the center where
it looks a little bit tricky to start separating

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.779
the florets are really small.

00:02:25.779 --> 00:02:29.120
We can just go ahead and cut this little center
piece in half, or even quarters if it’s

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120
really big.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
It just depends.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.319
You kind of want to just make sure you keep
them all approximately the same size.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.529
Okay, awesome!

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:41.299
That didn't really take 10 minutes, but let’s
pretend like the meat is partially frozen.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.299
Huh?

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.299
Between me and you?

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.500
All right, our not quite partially frozen
meat, but we’re gonna just start slicing

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.630
it really thinly, and you can kind of see
it better on this side I’ll show you.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.090
So you see these grain lines here that run
perpendicular to the direction of the length

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.090
of the meat?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.370
We are going to cut against those, so we’ll
want to cut this way, and that’s going to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.489
help make it really tender.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.249
I’ll cut it that way first.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:13.749
Get that out of the way, and then it’s really
thin and if you want to even do it like on

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:21.299
a diagonal, that’s fine too, and I’ll
do the same basic method recipe with chicken

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.799
breasts or chicken thighs sometimes as well,
just mix it up, and you can add carrots or

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.920
onion or whatever, but we’re just gonna
keep it simple with the beef and broccoli

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.069
today, and as it is sliced, I am dropping
it into this bowl.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.959
Rad Tad!

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.689
And now I’ve got my little beef strips.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.340
I am gonna just drizzle this with maybe a
tablespoon of soy sauce and let it kind of

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.599
hang out there until I need it.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.389
That’s what I call a marinade, not really,
that’s just putting soy sauce on something.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.019
All right, we’re doing this a little bit
different because I am really trying to recreate

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.549
the old Chinese restaurant thing, so I am
actually gonna steam the broccoli first as

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.749
opposed to stir-frying it, so I’ve just
got about a half cup of water here, and if

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:14.719
you have a wok you can totally do this in
a wok, but I just figured I’d show you this

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.389
way since, you know, a lot of people don’t
have fancy stuff like woks.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.700
So, ooh, that lid’s hot!

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.430
All right, so I ‘ll just covering it back
up, got it on high heat, and just like a minute.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.870
We just want to get it nice and bright and
crisp because we are gonna toss it back with

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.000
the sauce later, so just sort of like par
steaming it here, so all right, one minute

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
later.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.409
I’ve got this gorgeous emerald green broccoli,
and I am just gonna put it back in my bowl.

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.810
Oops!

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.260
You didn't see that, and we’ll continue
to cook a little bit, but I am not too worried

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.260
about it.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:58.800
It should still be plenty nice and green,
and I need to get rid of this water.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.090
Okay, and now we are gonna cook our beef.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.790
Okay, so smokin’ hot skillet here.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.800
I am gonna add a couple of tablespoons of
oil.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.800
If you wanted to kind of sautee in water to
make it lower fat, you could do that.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.790
I don’t really worry about it too much as
you can tell, just kidding, or maybe I’m

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.790
not.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.020
Okay, so then add my beef, and just add it
in single layer, and I’ve tossed it around

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.370
with the soy sauce, and this really is only
going to take about another minute.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.009
It’s not gonna take very long at all.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.750
Don’t crowd your pan or your wok.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.270
If you have to do it in two batches to get
it all cooked, that’s fine.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.270
Whoa!

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.319
And I’ve got a couple of, well, a few dried,
red chilis here that I am gonna add in that’s

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.319
gonna make it a little spicy.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:54.000
Of course you could leave that out if you
wanted to, and Just start moving it around,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.120
and we’re really almost done.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.639
It’s kind of amazing!

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.280
So once your beef is almost cooked, like,
you don’t want to overcook this cut either

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.570
or else it could get tough, so once you’re
almost cooked here, you’re gonna add the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.639
secret ingredient which is oyster sauce which
is made with oysters.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.400
It just kind of adds a really nice like, umami
flavor, and a little bit of chicken broth,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.650
and a little bit of garlic, and I like to
add the garlic at the end so that stays really

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.160
nice and hot, but if you wanted to add it
with the beef and make it a little milder,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.650
that’s fine, and now we’re going to add
in our broccoli, get that tossed around.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.979
Oh, man, this looks so fresh, smells awesome.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:51.600
It’s gonna be quite a delicious meal, and
it comes together in a cinch.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.889
Okay, so great!

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:53.889
This looks perfect.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.860
Once you sauce is just about evaporated and
the broccoli is nice and coated and shiny,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.680
we are ready to eat.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.069
Now you can serve this over rice obviously
or noodles, or sometimes what I’ll do is

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.169
even just throw it into a tortilla and make
a taco out of it.

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.689
That’s really nice, but I’m just gonna
eat it as is except with some of my favorite

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:19.120
sauce, and if you are morally opposed or something
to using oyster sauce, then you can leave

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.499
it out and just do a little more chicken sauce
and soy sauce, but I really like it.

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:25.870
Man that’s so good!

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.650
It’s so tender.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:33.240
It’s just really, really full of flavor,
and it’s even faster than even getting takeout

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.670
you guys, and it’s so much healthier for
you.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.509
