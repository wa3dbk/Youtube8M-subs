00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.816
So great work last week, everybody.

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:25.190
I think it was really successful.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.356
But we do have quite a bit
of notes to work through.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.030
So let's start out with the big boys.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.340
I think, Eli, you take Everest.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.020
We tested three different things.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.840
And what we're going for is two
versions of the convex shape.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.330
I think that about sums up that.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.580
Awesome, so let's do Swingers.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.949
I think the motion was awesome.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.740
But we still need to get this right,
test a few different versions,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.720
one where one is actually a little
further out and a little lower,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.450
so that you get two types of reach.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.710
We'll cover Crybaby now.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.580
So this is one that we tested with
mixed results at alpha testing.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.190
And we tested a few different things.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.710
We know we need some better
tests between now and beta.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.720
So we have some promising leads.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.250
But we definitely have a ways to go.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.640
So we're out here in Temecula.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.670
We're getting ready for our
beta test event, which is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.012
where we test with actual participants.

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:14.220
We have about four days left.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.590
Our CEO's coming out on site.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.798
And we have to have everything
fully pieced together.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.470
Morning.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.130
Can you load up your stuff
and meet us over at Swingers?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.822
We should have more
help showing up soon.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.150
A little fiasco to start the party?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.710
Just a little one or two.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.010
So basically, there's a delay
with our trucking today.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.970
It's throwing our schedule off.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.920
Crybaby's been a real challenge,
to chemically get right,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.330
to get the right effect
consistently, but also safely.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.540
Actually, in alpha testing, we
never did come up with something.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.880
We did some additional testing
between alpha and beta.

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:00.065
Oh shit.

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:02.390
Fan that.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.250
So the crybaby obstacle is supposed
to simulate getting teargassed.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.400
Most people don't really know
what this actually feels like.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.000
We're trying to create that in a
relatively controlled, relatively

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.930
safe environment.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.577
We had a lot of challenges coming up
with this, because everybody's senses

00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:18.160
are different.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.060
No one's got some tears.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.230
We've got a couple of ideas.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.970
Basically, you're going
to go into this obstacle.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.140
There's going to be a lot of smoke.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.490
You're not going to
know what's going on.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.450
Refreshing, I guess.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.510
I'd like to tell you what's going
on in there, but maybe I shouldn't.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.660
Is this Tegan's stuff?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.160
It's one.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.720
It's fast.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.670
I'm sure it's great.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.696
Wow, you get it straightaway, don't you?

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.005
The guys got this structure
partially built yesterday.

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.330
Our first point is going
to be doing our layout.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.350
We want to put the bridge
here first before we

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.600
start putting the scaffold up.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.030
Or do you want to lift over it?

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.370
I think we should put it here first.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.760
Yeah.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.210
All right, we're just about to the point
where we can start doing the layout.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.090
Yeah.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.520
Every decision we make
isn't going to be a hit.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.820
But in order for us to make
a decision that's a hit,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.012
we have to make some failures.

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.210
I'm not going to say
everything's going wrong.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.670
But we've definitely
had a slew of delays.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.540
I felt really comfortable yesterday
afternoon when I showed up on sight.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.710
I'm still confident that
we'll meet our objectives.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.051
But I'm not as comfortable
in where we're at right now.

00:03:18.051 --> 00:03:19.550
So we're a little bit under the gun.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.685
We're working with a skeleton crew
right now of our innovation team

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:24.560
and a couple of the
construction contractors.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.976
We really need to nail all the
marks and hit our schedule,

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:29.870
or else we'll be in rough
shape at the end of the week.
