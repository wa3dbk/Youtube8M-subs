00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
-(Celery) In fact, around the produce section,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.980
I'm known as a bit of a playboy.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.396
So she says she heard it was the onion,
but Onion, he's like,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.900
"I'm not the one dropping
stink bombs over here."

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.359
[others chuckle]
-Hey, hey Celery.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.759
-What?
-Hey Celery, hey.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.339
-W-w-what is it, Orange?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.012
-I bet you, uh...

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.620
You umm...

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.192
Uhh...
-What do you want?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.660
-[sighs] I don't know.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.260
-Yeah, whatever.
So anyways...

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.653
-[sighs]

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.560
-(voice) Hey, what's the
matter with you, Orange?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.900
-Oh hey, Cabbage.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.454
-Man oh man, Orange, you look awful.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.853
-[sighs] Yeah.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.480
-You feeling down?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.199
-I guess I just don't see the point.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.800
-Oh what?
Making fun of Celery?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.076
-Well, everyone I talk
to just gets chopped up.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.910
I mean, any second now,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.155
someone's gonna pick up Celery
and we'll never see him again.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.080
-Pick up Celery?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.860
Come on, Orange,
Celery can't even get a date.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.580
-What? No, I can get a date,
dude, any time I want.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.240
-No way, man.
Everyone knows you're a "stalker."

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.880
Ha-ha, get it Orange?
He's a "stalker."

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.911
-Yeah.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.620
-You know why you're in a funk?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.039
-'Cause I'm sitting too close to Onion?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.292
-You smelt it, you dealt it, buddy.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.759
-Yeah, maybe.
-(Cabbage) Maybe?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.240
That's not the Orange I know.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.959
The Orange I know would've said...

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.680
"Eww, baseball is smelly!
Somebody threw a stinkball!"

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.640
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-He'd-a said...

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.179
"Gross! Onion's making grunions!"

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.239
-[snickering]
Grunions...

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.140
-Knock it off, Cabbage.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.200
-"Oh! If I'm lyin', then you're cryin'."

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380
-[laughs]
It's true 'cause it rhymes.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.456
-I'm not crying!
There's something in my eye.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.472
-Yeah, stink-eye. [laughs]

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.251
-[laughs] That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.793
-Hey Cabbage, thanks for the lift.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.518
-That's how we do, Orange.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.298
-Yeah, you're a real "taxicabbage."

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.580
[laughs]
-Yeah, yeah that's funny, Orange. Ha-ha.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.159
-Hey Cabbage,
know why you're so smart?

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.111
'Cause you've got a big head. [laughs]

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.070
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's funny, Orange.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.993
-Hey Cabbage,
why are you embarrassed?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.895
Is it 'cause you saw the salad dressing?

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.779
[laughter]

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.340
-Okay! That's enough, Orange.
You can stop.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.900
-I would, but you won't "lettuce."

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.620
[laughter]

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.417
-Oh, so that's how it is.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.920
I try to help you out and
you stab me in the back.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.938
-Geez, you sound like a
real Caesar salad. [laughs]

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.634
-Caesar salad?
I don't get it.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.612
-You know, Caesar,
stabbed in the back? Knife?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.100
-Yeah... still not gettin' it.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.018
-Knife.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.760
-Aaaaghgh!

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.520
Nooooooo!

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.099
-It's a "cole-slaughter."

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.147
[weak laugh] Ow.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.772
[groans] I liked Cabbage, too.
He was funny.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.460
-(Onion)
Hey Orange, umm...

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.960
I'm really sorry about Cabbage.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.000
-[sighs] Thanks, Onion.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.858
-Man, just goes to show ya.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.217
You never know when your time's--

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.371
Aah!!

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380
