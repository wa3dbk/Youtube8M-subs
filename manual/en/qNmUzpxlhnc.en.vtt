Hey guys and welcome back to That Was History.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.509
I’m Cliff Langston and today we are talking
about Barbie Dolls….but don’t run too

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.320
soon… it’s not exactly what it looks like!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.650
You and I aren’t playing dress up by any
means.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.980
Jeremy actually brought up a question recently
and wanted us to speculate what might be different

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.019
if the Barbie Doll had never been invented
or released?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.869
Trying to answer this question does present
a challenge though.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.509
Barbie Dolls were not part of my arsenal of
toys when I was growing up.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.880
My sister played with them, but I stayed far
away from those girly toys riddled with cooties.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.930
Since I did not play with them as a child,
I felt it might be a disservice to you if

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.320
I tried to imagine their nonexistence solely
on my opinion.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.870
So I called in reinforcements… my wife Nicole,
who was heavily influenced by this toy throughout

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.990
her childhood.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.960
As an expert in the field, how different would
things be, in your opinion, if the Barbie

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.980
Doll never existed?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.079
I think that a big change might be the
way that young girls and women perceive themselves.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.700
This has been a big topic of debate for many
years, actually.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.360
A lot of women grew up believing that Barbie
was the ideal look that they should try to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.860
model themselves after.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.409
A “Barbie woman” is someone with decent
height, long legs, a slim figure, proportionate

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.640
features, and a perfect complexion.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.049
In reality, this just isn’t the way we are
made.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.390
Every woman has their strong features and
their weak points.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.990
Unfortunately, advancements in the field of
plastic surgery have made it even easier to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.179
achieve those Barbie qualities.

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.789
Some women even take it too far and become
more plastic than they are organic.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.119
This makes the Barbie parallel even more evident.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.119
I can definitely see where you are coming
from, but surely Barbie Dolls encourage good

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.609
qualities in children as well, right?

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.039
Absolutely!

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.779
One great thing that Barbie taught young girls
is that they could be anything that they

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:44.779
wanted to be.

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:51.259
Dolls like the President, Doctor, and Astronaut
Barbies encouraged women to pursue their dreams. They can be whatever they want.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.420
In fact, Barbie has had close to 150 different
careers in her lifetime.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.509
You can’t exactly argue with that…

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.420
I don’t suppose you can, but let’s
take a look at the economic side of things.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.340
Barbie Dolls have been bringing in a great
deal of profit for the American toy company,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.039
Matell since 1959.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.940
Couple that with the fact that 90% of girls
age 3 to 10 own at least one Barbie, and on

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
average, girls 3-6 have roughly 12 Barbies,
and you will see that the numbers add up…

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.630
so much in fact, that Matell has sold over
10 million Barbie Dolls since their introduction

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.140
with an estimated $1.3 billion dollars in
annual sales.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.140
That’s a lot of money that Matell would
not currently have at their disposal if the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.490
Barbie Doll was nonexistent.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.490
Also, brands such as the Bratz and Monster
High dolls might not be around if Barbie wasn’t

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.510
invented years ago to set the stage.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.110
These other doll brands have made quite the
profit as well by simply riding off of the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.640
success of their competition.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.980
What do you think?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.580
Do you agree or disagree with our speculations?
