00:00:01.278 --> 00:00:05.278
So now we have the world’s premier

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:07.797
iPad magician.

00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:18.073
Hello everyone.
Wow, this is quite a crowd.

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:20.863
I’m Simon.
I came all the way from Germany.

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:23.236
I love watching YouTube on my iPad.

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:26.490
But I figured out a couple of things
that I need to share with you.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:30.705
I’m not sure if you have experienced that
as well but if I go through like this.

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:35.947
I don’t know if this is
a software problem, whatever.

00:00:36.308 --> 00:00:39.340
There’s more space
for your creativity now -

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.238
whatever you want to put on.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.392
Can you see this on the screen?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.920
This is a cord and, thanks to this,

00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:48.586
I do have access to a whole
new set of applications

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.174
that are all a bit better
than the last ones.

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:53.464
Thank you.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.804
So thanks to this, I can show you
a couple of my favourite holiday pictures.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:02.802
I hope you have some time.

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:05.663
Don’t worry, I won’t show you all of them.

00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:07.838
I’ll just give you
the overview, like this.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.111
And that way I can easily
print them out.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.279
And you know what, that is fantastic

00:01:18.304 --> 00:01:20.272
because my parents,
they do not have an iPad.

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:24.625
So I just put it on a post card, send it
back home from LA and here we go.

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:28.813
But before I do so, I have
to put a digital copy. That’s important.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.623
Whatever you do, that you know that.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.624
This year, this one
is my favourite picture.

00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:41.295
It’s the perfect sunset.

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:46.059
I didn’t want to wait until the end
so I can still work on it.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.826
Move it around here.

00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:51.092
That way, it becomes
really romantic, doesn’t it?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.003
And I can even take the sun out
and stop global warming. Hey.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:04.701
Do you play tennis?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.831
In the first row.
No, you don’t?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.950
So you can start…

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.841
Just get your iPad. Get the right picture.

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.723
Bring it to the right size
about like this.

00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:14.734
And then you can use your iPad
as a tennis racquet.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.841
And this saves you quite some money

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.651
because you can use
the same tennis ball all over again.

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:28.105
You just put it back.

00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:30.788
If you...

00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:36.072
If you want to continue,
just double click.

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:38.624
Here we go.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.350
As I come from Germany,
we had a terrible weather this year.

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:46.033
I came up with the idea…

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:50.371
With an app that could actually
change the weather.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.352
So have a look at
the weather lady - over here.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:04.070
Most frequent asked question:
No, I cannot take her out of the iPad.

00:03:05.448 --> 00:03:07.543
I can’t change the weather but her hair.

00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:16.887
Doesn’t make any sense but it’s fun.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:27.197
So now I want to try an experiment
between two continents.

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:31.822
I’m going to use FaceTime
to call a friend of mine in Germany.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.195
So, I hope he’s ready.

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:38.360
That is you, by the way - VidCon crowd.
Hello.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.864
- Hey Christoph, can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

00:03:41.976 --> 00:03:43.724
- Okay, are you ready?
- I’m ready.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.026
Okay, let’s go.

00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:48.897
- Here’s the straw.
- Thank you. That’s good.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:50.096
- Okay, like that?
- Perfect.

00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:52.646
With that straw, I can easily...

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:56.485
stream not only music and videos
but real objects.

00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:58.263
- For example...
- Now the glass.

00:03:58.288 --> 00:03:59.779
Yes. A Coke.

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.712
Or anything else.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.047
By the way, I have a glass of milk.
He doesn’t know about that.

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:23.098
As you can see, it works indeed.

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:25.181
Please give a big hand
to Christoph in Germany.

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:30.088
Thank you.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.205
So when I got an email to come over here,
I was very excited

00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:38.103
to see you all at VidCon.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.861
Well, all the way from Germany,

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:43.473
I shouldn’t come without bringing
something with me.

00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:47.301
And I guess you know what we
are famous for over here - over there.

00:04:47.785 --> 00:04:49.301
Yes, it’s...

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.909
the beer.

00:04:52.443 --> 00:04:54.333
So, I would invite…

00:04:54.358 --> 00:04:56.652
Please, Hank, can I invite you
to come on stage?

00:04:58.436 --> 00:04:59.769
Let’s put that on here.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.374
Hey, Hank. Come on. Grab a glass. Yeah?

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:09.053
And, well, let’s just enjoy a beer.

00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:21.455
- Good German beer.
- I do not understand this.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:27.359
There’s nothing back there.

00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:30.077
The problem is the data connection
is a bit weak.

00:05:30.142 --> 00:05:32.348
Get another glass for me as well.
Get another glass.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.613
The data connection is a bit weak
so otherwise...

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.205
- the beer would go faster.
- You do have to have some.

00:05:39.587 --> 00:05:41.873
I want to have fun as well
but maybe when I’m off stage.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.002
Wouldn’t be a good example
for a few of you.

00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:48.295
I think that’s enough.
Cheers, Hank. Enjoy.

00:05:51.802 --> 00:05:54.404
- I can confirm that this is beer.
- Cheers!

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.491
See you later.
See you backstage.
