5 Tips on How to Shop Smart Dress Sharp for
the Right Price Buying Tips for Men

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
[0:00:00]

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Hi!

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.240
I'm Antonio Centeno.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm the founder of Real Men Real Style.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.330
Guys, today I'm going to give you five tips
on how to shop smart.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.519
Many of you guys I know are out there building
your wardrobe.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.020
You're wanting to have clothing and have accessories
that in a sense help you send the message

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.990
you want to send, and I want to make sure
that you don’t get raked over the coals

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.231
when you're out there buying things that you're
paying almost double the price of what you

00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.109
should, so hopefully you can take these tips
and you can run with them.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
I have to admit, these tips are a little bit
general, but I will link to an article over

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.560
at Real Men Real Style and we'll go into more
detail.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.820
In addition, I'll link to other videos, to
other articles that go into more detail for

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.150
each of the points.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.150
Cool?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.150
Okay.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.340
Guys, if you haven't already, please subscribe
to my YouTube channel.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.120
That way, these videos come right to you.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.100
In addition, if you like this, if you find
it useful, I'd appreciate the like.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.160
And if you have something to add, if I miss
a tip that you feel, "Antonio, you should've

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.710
had this in the video," make sure to go leave
it down in the comments below.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.300
You guys know I love to hear from you.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.410
I appreciate your support.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.960
I'm always down there in the YouTube comments
responding to people, so that's the best way

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.260
probably to engage me, short of being on my
email list, which you can join at any time,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.649
and go grab my free 47-page e-book on men's
style.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.899
This e-book has been downloaded over a hundred
thousand times and men around the world daily

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.049
write me and say, "This e-book is amazing.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.170
You should be charging for it."

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.720
Maybe at some point I will, but right now
it's free.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.740
Okay, so tip number one, what's the first
thing you needed to do when making a buying

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.869
decision is only buy what you need.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.210
It seems pretty simple, right?

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.960
How many times though -- and I've done this
myself.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.060
I remember I bought this orange vest and I
didn’t know what I was thinking.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.399
This was back in probably 2000.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030
I was a young Marine officer stationed at
Carlsbad, California.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.390
I went to an outlet and I saw this orange
vest.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.890
There were a couple of things that were wrong
with it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.389
One, it was a large and I should be wearing
a medium, but this thing is great.

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:02.960
It's 70% off, so I purchased it.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.639
Now, one, I don’t know really where this
orange down vest would've fit into my core

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.420
wardrobe at that point in my life because
it didn’t fit there.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.300
It was the wrong size, but I justified it
because gosh, it was 70% off.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.720
It was such a great deal.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.910
Where is that orange vest now?

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.910
I don’t know.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.940
I gave it away to goodwill years ago.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.360
How many times did I wear that?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360
Maybe one.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.840
I've got a picture of it somewhere and that's
why I remember this vest.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.890
I was riding my motorcycle.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.310
I had all these layers on and then it somehow
fit and I wore it more like a signal vest

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.750
so people could see me and cars not hit me
or anything like that.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.820
The point is, guys, we oftentimes buy clothing
that we don’t need.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.130
Now, how can you not make this mistake?

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.790
Let's go to point number two, educate yourself.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.840
Now, if you've watched a couple of my videos,
congratulations, but what I would recommend

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.230
is you go and watch a lot of my videos.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.080
Go check out Aaron Marino over at I am Alpha
M., teaching men's fashion, FashionBeans.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.730
Go read what those guys are saying over there
if you're more fashion-inclined.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.150
Articles of Style, go check out what Dan is
writing about.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.140
Go check out Primer Magazine, The Art of Manliness,
they all have style sections, Barron over

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140
at the Effortless Gent.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.440
The point is, gentlemen, educate yourself.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.450
When it comes down to it, you need to be seeking
a little bit of self-improvement every single

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.100
day and I think being on someone's email list
that really resonates with you, find your

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.040
Yoda, find the guy that you really resonate
with, and listen to what he has to say, learn

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.970
a little bit every day, but focus in on educating
yourself so that you know what to buy.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.910
Now, after you're doing this and as you're
going through this, part number three, create

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.890
a list, create a plan.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.080
You should have a list of the items that should
be in your core wardrobe.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.770
Now, I give this to the guys that are in my
style system, which I've got these premium

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.110
courses and I do actually give them a breakout
list, but for you, if you're just starting

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.500
off, if you don’t know where to go, first
think about what's going to be your needs.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.720
Now, these are going to change and depending
on where you are at in life, what kind of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.800
a job you have.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.890
If you're a lawyer in New York City, well,
you're going to have different needs than

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.420
if you're a small town -- let's say you're
a master electrician and you're over in Shawano,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.420
Wisconsin.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.060
You're going to have a little bit different
needs of what should be in your wardrobe.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.819
However, there are items that need to be in
your wardrobe.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.699
You need to put together that list.

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.330
Focus in on your needs, then after that, focus
in on your wants.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.490
After that, you want to be thinking of what
are you going to spend money on because this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.539
makes it really easy for you to decide where
you're going to spend your money.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.129
There are certain pieces that are investment
pieces.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.889
There are other pieces which are nice to have
and you want to spend money there only after

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.699
you've invested in having at least a suit.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.409
And when I say a suit, having a nice suit
that fits you well and that's both the trousers

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.270
and the jacket made from the same fabric,
having a light colored dress shirt again that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.379
fits you well with a tie, with shoes, and
that entire outfit right there is going to

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:02.379
serve you.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.379
[0:05:01]

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:04.659
Now, make sure to get a muted tie because
you want to be able to not only wear this

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:07.229
to a wedding, but also a funeral.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.870
That right there is going to be one of your
go-to investment pieces.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.801
In the article over at Real Men Real Style,
I go into a lot more detail about what you

00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:19.669
should have as some of these things, the first
items that men should have in his wardrobe,

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.060
but understand that actually you writing out
that list, maybe putting it on a shared document

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.610
on Google Docs is going to be a very important
step.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.789
Point number four, return policy.

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.699
Whenever you're out there shopping, look at
the return policy.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.599
I remember I bought something on -- I think
it was Lucky's website and it was a clearance

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:37.599
item.

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.500
I didn’t realize after I got it and it didn’t
fit me very well that I couldn't send it back.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.850
They've got a "no return policy" on clearance
items.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.150
Now, that struck me as kind of weird and I
actually talked with the manager.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.969
They did actually accept it back, but it's
one of those things that you don’t want

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:52.969
to have to do it.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.280
You want to make sure you work with a company
or you purchase from someone that you can

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.960
make a return.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.449
If you're working with a custom clothier,
he shouldn't be looking to build out your

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.030
ten shirts at the same time.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.871
Initially, you want to get that one shirt,
get the fit right, get the style right, make

00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:11.279
sure you're happy with it, then he can build
the other nine shirts out.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.180
So not just return policy, but also making
sure how they deal with whenever you've got

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.789
something that needs to be adjusted, the fit.

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.260
Those are the kinds of things you want to
look at.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.659
Look at those store company policies especially
for returns.

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.379
Number five, don’t get caught in the hype.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.210
This happens especially around the holidays.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.020
You're going to see Black Friday.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.749
You're going to see Cyber Monday, Labor Day
sales, all these sales.

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.050
They try to get you and engage you in the
company.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.440
I'm not going to name names.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.259
Let's just say there are some companies that
they always have a sale going on.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.949
They realize that's a tactic to get you to
feel that you've got to take action and purchase

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.069
now, but don’t fall for that.

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:56.240
If you understand you only buy what you're
going to need, if you educate yourself, if

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.539
you create a list and if you understand the
return policy, then this last one should be

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:01.539
pretty easy.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:02.539
All right.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.539
Gentlemen, that's it.

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.009
I will see you in the next video.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.569
If you’ve got something to add, leave it
down on the comments below and go check out

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.809
I've put together a great article which supports
this video.

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:12.809
Take care.

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:13.809
Bye-bye.

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:13.813
