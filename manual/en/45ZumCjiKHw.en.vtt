00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100
Naval Academy

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560
Greetings, fellow Captains!

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.260
Today is the second episode of our video tutorial on how to play World of Warships.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.960
Last time we showed you how to control the ship and execute maneuvers.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.640
Now it's time to learn a few tricks about firepower.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.260
Every ship carries an arsenal of guns,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.560
ranging from heavy cannons to anti-aircraft guns.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.640
Tier VI battleship Fuso, for instance, carries 106 guns.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.440
How do you manage such assets?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.280
Usually, ships carry three types of armament:

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
primary armament for fighting against heavy armored ships

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.920
such as battleships and cruisers;

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.480
secondary armament,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.200
which works well against swift and unarmored targets such as destroyers;

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.740
and anti-aircraft guns,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100
which are quite good for shooting enemy aircraft.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.920
Most of the time you will be using your primary armament.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.520
Use the Shift key or the scroll wheel to switch to Binocular View.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.080
First, check out the indicators.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Their number is equal to the number of primary armament guns or turrets.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.160
Use the reticle to aim at the target.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.040
The green indicator means the gun is ready to fire.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
The bright orange indicator means the gun is turning to the target.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
The dim orange indicator means the gun cannot be aimed at the target.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.800
The red indicator means the gun is disabled.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.780
A similar color scheme is used for the ship status panel.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.780
The line under the reticle is the reload indicator.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.220
Use the mouse to fire.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.980
Click the left button to fire the guns one at a time,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.880
starting with the first gun that was loaded and pointed to the target.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
Click one more time to fire the next gun.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.540
Click and hold the left button for sequential fire,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.600
with all available guns firing one after another.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.740
When you click the middle button or the scroll wheel,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740
the gun is fired and the camera follows the shell.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.100
Double click to fire a full broadside-all available guns firing simultaneously.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.300
The game features automatic target lock,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.940
which makes aiming easier.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000
The enemy will be marked with a white circle

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.560
and the camera (but not the reticle!) will start following the ship.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.000
Learn how to maximize your ship's firepower.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.560
Before firing guns, position your ship correctly relative to the target.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160
As an example,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
Tier III cruiser St. Louis carries a primary armament of 14 guns.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.280
When the enemy is directly ahead of St. Louis,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.360
only one gun can aim at the target.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.240
Just a slight change of course allows four guns to aim at the target.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.540
Change course even more

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.760
and fire a full broadside of eight guns at the enemy ship.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.920
Don't forget to look at the ship status panel from time to time.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.220
It will show you which turrets are ready to fire

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.640
and help you adjust your course to make the rest of the guns available.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.600
To use the ship's firepower to the maximum,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.980
turn perpendicular to the enemy ship.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.340
You should consider, however,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.860
that this maneuver will also make you an easier target.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.320
As soon as you have decided on the line of fire and sight angle,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240
you can lock them with CTRL+X.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.760
This will allow you to look around to perform a maneuver

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.320
or check for lurking enemies,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.580
without the guns swiveling to follow your view.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.420
Press X to reset the lock.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.500
Your guns will stay locked in one orientation,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.720
but you will still have to adjust the reticle to aim accurately.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420
Now you are ready to fire.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.500
This feature is particularly helpful for rotating turrets

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.080
that can fire from both starboard and port.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.400
Try not to get carried away

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300
while firing in Binocular View and lose track of your surroundings.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.020
Another enemy could sneak up on you at any moment.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.760
From time to time,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720
click and hold the right mouse button to keep your guns in place

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.860
while you look around and assess the situation.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.720
This will help you avoid colliding with allies and islands

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.760
and evade approaching enemy torpedoes in time.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.460
Naval artillery combat may be conducted at long distance.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.500
The main guns of battleship Yamato

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.980
have a range of 14.3 miles (26.5 km) in the game.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.980
A shell takes 20 seconds to cross this distance.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.960
The target may easily leave the impact zone during this time.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.520
To have any chance of hitting,

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.240
you have to lead the target and fire at the point

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.040
where the ship will be when your shells arrive.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.860
Calculating the lead is not an easy task.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.140
Try firing a single ranging shot and watching where it falls.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.240
Adjust your aim and then unleash a full broadside.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040
The game features two types of ammunition:

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.000
armor-piercing (AP) shells and high-explosive (HE) shells.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.360
If your target is a well-armored cruiser or a battleship,

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.100
fire AP shells at its hull.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.260
They have a good chance of penetrating the armor belt;

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.440
if they do, they will explode inside the ship,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.020
inflicting serious damage.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.820
However, AP shells will pass right through the hull of an unarmored destroyer

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.300
or the superstructure of any ship, causing virtually no damage at all.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.320
That's where HE shells come in handy.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000
They are capable of causing extensive damage to any lightly armored ship.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.580
Also, if the enemy armor is too thick for your AP shells,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.600
HE hits may set the target on fire,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
thus efficiently decreasing its survivability.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.680
The modules affecting a ship's combat capability are divided into two groups:

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.300
external- those located outside the hull-and internal.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.820
External modules include primary armament turrets,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.660
secondary armament guns, anti-aircraft guns (or AA guns), and torpedo tubes.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.900
If you damage or destroy the enemy's weapons,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.680
the enemy won't be able to fight back.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.900
Internal modules include the engine and steering machines.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.760
Destroy those, and the enemy ship will lose maneuverability

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.080
and become an easy target.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.700
Finally, the quickest way to sink a ship

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700
is to detonate her ammunition magazine.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.320
The secondary armament works automatically.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.380
It targets the nearest enemy ship heading towards you

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.980
and having the least hit points.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.480
Or you can set a priority target manually by pressing Ctrl

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.520
and clicking the left mouse button on an enemy.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.180
The icon denoting secondary armament priority will appear

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.000
above the targeted ship.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.960
If the specified ship leaves

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.000
the effective range of your secondary armament,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
the batteries will automatically switch to the nearest adversary.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.560
Making the most of your secondary armament is important.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.160
Guns with caliber of 6 inches (150 mm) and larger use AP shells,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.980
whereas smaller guns fire HE shells.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.540
Thus, knowing the performance capabilities of your ship

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.720
allows you to seek out optimal targets

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.880
and fight your counterparts most efficiently.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.160
AA guns also function automatically,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
concentrating fire on striking air groups,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
such as torpedo bombers and bombers.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.440
Aircraft that enter effective range first become priority targets.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.800
You may also specify another target for AA guns

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.720
by pressing Ctrl and clicking the left mouse button on aircraft

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720
that you consider the most dangerous at the moment.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.720
It is no coincidence

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.220
that aircraft and ships carrying torpedoes are priority targets for AA

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.720
and secondary armament guns.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.880
Check our next episode to learn why.
