00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:31.339
You know, if I had to do a parody of modern
video games, it would obviously be a shooter,

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:32.339
right?

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:37.691
And I'd have some kind of angry white guy
with a deep voice, as the protagonist.

00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:42.760
And to touch on the industry's predictability,
you'd have to throw in the cover-and-shoot

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.899
mechanic.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.700
As well as some blood, lots of bad language...

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.670
Actually, I...I'd just make Army of Two: The
Devil's Cartel.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.699
This is already a parody of modern games,
only it's not a parody.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.960
I don't know who to trust anymore.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.729
Turns out, the truth is out there.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.049
And to find it, you can either go track down
some cigarette-smoking man in a dark basement

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.100
at E3...or you can play this game.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.470
The Devil's Cartel.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.090
The effects are probably the same.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.300
You'll walk out questioning the experience,
reeking of smoke and wondering if it's really

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.079
as simple as it seems.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.120
I'm here to tell you it is, amigo.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:46.090
So just duck, cover and f*cking fire.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.210
The Devil's Cartel is the third game in the
Army of Two series, following up the 2008

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.880
original and its 2010 sequel, The 40th Day.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.979
Both of those games released to positive reviews,
on the whole.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.180
And that's a streak that's been broken by
number three.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.829
The Devil's Cartel has come under a bit of
fire from critics, but as a guy with no prior

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.370
experience with the series, I gave it a good,
long look down my sights.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:20.180
And now, I have to pull the trigger.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.370
You know, it's not that this is a bad game.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.959
I mean, bad games are easy to review.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.510
You just point out what is usually a whole
freaking list of reasons the game is bad.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.510
This one isn't bad.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.120
It's just...there's nothing exceptional about
it whatsoever.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
Again, it's almost a parody of the current
state of popular video games.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
It has this checklist approach to game design
that hits all the notes it's supposed to and

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.879
never goes off-script.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.879
That's not bad.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.150
At least, not objectively.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.620
It's, just...kind of boring.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.980
I guess one of the big changes is that...the
two-man army is different this time.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.730
The standard duo has been replaced by a new
one.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.220
And again, I can't speak to the prior characters...but
I can't imagine they had any less character

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.550
than these ones.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.190
It's a personal rule, I have, to never be
friends with someone who says "bro" in a serious

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.000
context.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.950
I don't think I could be friends with these
guys.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.210
As a result of the characters' drabness, the
story ends up being the same.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.319
You go through Mexico shooting Mexicans, and
the whole experience feels lifeless.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.120
And it's strange, because...there are some
good ideas, in terms of settings.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.790
But the game's execution misses the mark.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.610
The places end up feeling as characterless
as the characters, and the gameplay.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.270
Speaking of which...holy crap, the gameplay.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.520
I mean, cover-and-shoot city?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.330
Only with no real point.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.930
Like, you're awarded points for pulling off
tactical kills, which then lets you level

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.930
up.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.890
But after a while, you notice that...it doesn't
seem to have much affect on the gameplay.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.600
You just keep covering and shooting.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.410
Until you get bored and just start stabbing
people.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.489
You know, just to shake things up.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.930
There are two kinds of bad.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.470
There's objective bad, and subjective bad.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.230
Although the cover system is a bit wonky at
times, and the AI is kinda rough...I didn't

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.290
find this game objectively bad.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.350
The question is the subjective.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.480
With The Devil's Cartel, it all comes down
to your taste, and just how bored you are

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.580
with the status quo.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:42.950
In other words...you like shooting fools,
bro?
