00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.890
SPEAKER 1: The Getty is part
of a larger community which

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.820
is the city of Los Angeles.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.560
The physical design,
and it seems to me,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.169
needs to relate to the grid of
the city, the form of the city,

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.710
the structure of
the city, which has

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.420
to do with its street
pattern, highway

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.634
pattern, and the topography.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.220
The strongest element
in this location

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.600
and throughout Los Angeles,
of course, is the freeway.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.970
And as I spent
time on the site, I

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.960
realized you have that San Diego
freeway, this powerful element

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.630
running North-South.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.830
And, there was a ridge
which parallelled

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.801
the freeway and another
one which parallelled

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.350
the freeway to the North.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.410
And these vectors of topography,
as well as a third ridge,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.000
which more or less
went this direction,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.330
parallel to this one.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.170
These vectors that seemed to
me, of natural form of the earth

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.090
were the beginning of thinking
about the site and building.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.340
Somehow the buildings
should rise out

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.410
of the ridges that were there.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.990
So, the museum sector took its
location here on the ridge,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.290
on the city side, the downtown
side, UCLA side, freeway side.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.190
And the library, the Center
for the History of art

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.420
took it's vector, as
it were, from the ridge

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.080
on the private side.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440
And it's like two
arms reaching out

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.850
creating a space
in between them.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.530
It seemed to me, that
in between these two

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.650
major portions of the Getty
Center should be a garden.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.210
A garden that belongs
to the museum,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.700
a garden that belongs to the
Center for the History of Art.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.510
And it seemed quite logical that
the places which belong both

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.510
to the museum as well as the
Center, meaning the restaurant,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.970
the cafeteria, the places of
coming together for eating,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.520
would be at the head
of the central gardens.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.810
And so, that semmed in a
sense grow out of the Earth,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.010
out of the topography,
out of the place,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.376
and also be related to
the city of Los Angeles.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:38.340
SPEAKER 2: After five
years of planning,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.720
in 1987 crews broke ground for
the new J. Paul Getty Center

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.790
on a mountaintop
between the Los Angeles

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.800
neighborhoods of
Bel-air, Brentwood,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.830
and Pacific Palisades.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.140
The building process was harder
than anyone had imagined.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.620
A construction
worker explains why.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.090
SPEAKER 3: It's been the
most extremely difficult job

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.410
that any of us have
ever encountered.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.670
One road up, and one road down.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.990
300,000 blocks of travertine
and 40,000 aluminum panels

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.160
had to go up that road.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.620
I don't think anybody understood
the complexity of building

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.590
on top of a mountain.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.600
I don't think the architects
knew, the owners didn't know,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.110
the contractor, the
subcontractors, nobody knew.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.030
It's like constructing a
building on top of a pinhead.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.530
SPEAKER 2: For
almost a dozen years,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.460
the city's residents
watched and waited

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.220
for the center's completion.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.390
Angelenos describe
how they felt as they

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.790
watched the center being built.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.070
SPEAKER 4: It's been great.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.520
I drive up and down the
405 to work every day,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.380
and I watch them take
the mountaintop down,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.950
load after load.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.350
And I saw the tram line
go up and the buildings

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.896
get bigger every day.

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:46.690
Well, a good part
of my life was spent

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.210
watching the Getty get built,
so I'm really looking forward

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.587
to seeing it from the inside.

00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:53.670
SPEAKER 5: We're so used
to seeing buildings go up

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.410
overnight, but I've been
driving by this for years

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:57.790
and they're still building.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.934
This feels really permanent,
like the mountain itself did.

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.600
SPEAKER 6: They went
to a lot of trouble

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.210
to show the world some art.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.340
This shows that LA
has some culture.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.750
We have something to show
people besides amusement parks

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.130
and beaches.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.620
SPEAKER 3: The center opened to
the public in December, 1997.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.570
Chief Operating
Officer and building

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.745
project manager,
Steven Rountree.

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.620
STEVEN ROUNTREE: Building
cultural buildings,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.745
particularly
building art museums,

00:06:21.745 --> 00:06:24.084
is really tough, because
there's just nowhere where

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:24.875
you can compromise.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:27.635
The insides are just as
important as the outsides.

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.260
And I think we've
created a place where

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.540
people in their own ways find
inspiration and energy out

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.820
of the experience.
