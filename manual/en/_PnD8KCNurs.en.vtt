00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.660
Heart

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.200
We see and hear about hearts everywhere.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440
A long time ago, people even thought

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.920
that their emotions came from their hearts.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.700
Maybe because the heart beats faster

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000
when a person is scared or excited.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.300
Now we know the emotions come from the brain.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.340
And in this case, the brain tells the heart to speed up.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.320
So what's the heart up to then?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.240
How does it keep busy?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.300
What does it look like?

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.160
Let's find out.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.500
Your heart is really a muscle.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.720
It's located a little to the left

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.420
of the middle of your chest

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.560
and it's about the size of your fist.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.900
This amazing muscle never gets tired,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.440
even though it opens and closes

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.980
about a hundred thousand times a day

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.820
every day throughout your life.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.980
Your heart is a pump

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.020
that pushes blood around your whole body.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.820
Each time your heart beats,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.880
it squirts out a small cup full of blood

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.980
and refills for the next beat.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.040
Run and your heart beats faster.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.780
This gets more oxygen to your muscles.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.120
Most kids are born with a healthy heart

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.140
and it's important to keep yours in good shape.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.920
Here are some things that you can do

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.880
to keep your heart happy.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.860
If you want it to be strong,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.660
you need to exercise it.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.600
How do you do that?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.560
By being active in a way

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.640
that gets you huffing and puffing.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.100
Like jumping rope, dancing

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.460
or playing basketball.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.920
Try to be active every day

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.540
for at least thirty minutes.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.520
An hour would be even better for your heart.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.220
Eat a variety of healthy foods

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.080
and avoid foods high in unhealthy fats

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.180
such as saturated fats and trans fats.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.040
Try to eat at least five servings of

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.420
fruits and vegetables every day.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.260
Avoid sugary soft drinks and fruit drinks.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.920
Don't smoke. It can damage

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.920
the heart and blood vessels.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.280
So, now, you know that your heart

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.880
doesn't look like a valentine.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.340
But it sure does deserve to be loved

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.980
for all the work it does.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.860
It started pumping blood

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.160
before you were born

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.700
and will continue pumping

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.700
throughout your whole life.
