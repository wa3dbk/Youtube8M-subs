Hi, I'm Laura from youngwritersworkshops.com,
and I want to talk about teaching map skills

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.670
to children. The early foundation of understanding
about maps is just beginning to talk about

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.070
locations, and that everything has a location.
This is a really important idea for children

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.480
to understand. They can begin to understand
that things have a location and that location

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.570
is relative to another location. You can also
talk about maps when you talk about an event

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.710
in the world. You can show on the map where
that event is taking place, they can begin

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.120
to have a concept of where things are in relation
to other things. Then, once kids have that

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.490
basic understanding about location, you can
begin to talk about ordinal directions and

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.579
using words like 'east' and 'south' when you
describe things. You can arrows on your walls

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.250
just showing east, west, north, south so that
kids start to practice doing that. The east

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.509
side of the school building or the east side
of the classroom. They can begin to understand

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.770
those ideas when you bring them into their
daily lives. You also want to have them begin

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
to make maps. They can make a map of their
classroom, or of their school, of their schoolyard.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.759
They can start to plot things out and see
how to represent them on paper. That's a good

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.219
way for them to begin to understand mapping.
You can also have them do games by giving

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.659
them a map and then having them plot things
on the map. They can also play games where

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.109
they have to identify states or continents
on a map, so they might have a blank map and

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.210
they color in the states that they've visited.
They have to be able to identify it and find

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.329
it on the map and color it in. Puzzles and
other objects that have maps on them are a

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.149
good way for them to have more exposure. Assembling
a puzzle of the United States or of the continent

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.530
of Europe can really help them to build their
understanding of the locations of things and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.569
to have practice using maps. So those are
some ideas about teaching kids map skills.
