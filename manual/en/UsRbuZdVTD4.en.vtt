00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.069
How to Create the Ultimate Salad.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.140
The ultimate salad is tasty but good for you,
filling but not fattening, and easy to throw

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
together.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:25.380
You will need Greens Assorted vegetables Protein
Good fats A spray bottle Olive-oil dressing

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.510
and berries.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.789
Step 1.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.320
Start with a good green.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.430
The best salad greens, in nutritional order,
are spinach, arugula, watercress, endive,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.030
and romaine.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.090
Spinach provides lots of calcium, while romaine
contains large amounts of Vitamins A and C.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.090
Step 2.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.610
Add some veggies, keeping in mind that the
richer a vegetable’s color, the higher its

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.820
nutritional content.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.610
Good choices include purple cabbage, bell
peppers, broccoli, carrots, and tomatoes.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.840
Step 3.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.860
Throw in some protein.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.640
Salmon, beans, turkey, tofu, or a hard-boiled
egg are all great options.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.640
Step 4.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.500
Include some “good” fat—some avocado
slices, a handful of nuts, a sprinkling of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.420
sunflower or pumpkin seeds, a few crumbles
of feta cheese.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.420
Just don’t overdo it; it may be good fat,
but it’s still fat!

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.560
In the nut family, pecans, walnuts, and almonds
have the most antioxidants.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
Step 5.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.820
Chop up and toss in some onion, which helps
prevent cancer and lowers cholesterol.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.289
For a sweet touch that packs a load of antioxidants,
toss in some berries, like raspberries or

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.530
dried cranberries.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.869
Step 6.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.399
Put some olive oil-based salad dressing in
a spray bottle and spritz it on the salad.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.829
That way, you won’t ruin your nice, healthy
salad with two zillion fat grams’ worth

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:54.829
of dressing.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.090
Did you know People who eat a salad every
day have substantially higher levels of Vitamins

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.929
C, E, B6, and folic acid, according to a study
conducted by the UCLA School of Public Health

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.909
and Louisiana State University Health Sciences
Center.
