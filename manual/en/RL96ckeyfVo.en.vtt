00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.870
Good morning Hank, it's Friday, and my time
in the Netherlands is almost coming to an

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.970
end, sadly. There is so much that I will miss
about Amsterdam: I will miss the elm trees

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.220
and the amazing public transportation and
my little slivery view of the canal. I'll

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.340
miss the cafÃ©s and the bicyclic abundance
and living in an apartment that is older than

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.570
my country - and those are just the things
that I will miss that I can see outside my

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
window!

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.460
By the way, Hank, if you hear any background
noise, that's mom. Say hi, mom!

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.460
Mother Green: Hey darling. Your mother misses
you.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.730
John: Your mother misses you. She'll come
all the way to Amsterdam to visit me, but

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.699
you don't see her in Montana very often. I
don't know who the favorite son is!

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.120
Right, Hank, so a couple notes about your
last video: first off, your punishments are

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.660
very mean, and I will talk more about that
when I get back to the States; secondly, when

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.250
you had that ice cream truck and it was playing
"Sexy Back", it reminded me of the one thing

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.450
that I won't miss about Amsterdam, and that
is the soundtrack in the stores.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.329
So Hank, you know how, when you're shopping
for stuff, they generally pipe music in so

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.570
that you're happy and you want to purchase
goods and services? Right, but when they do

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.230
that here, they don't use muzak, they use
real music, which is great. But they also

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.481
use a lot of gangster rap, and they don't,
like, edit the lyrics. So basically, your

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:03.899
experience of buying baby wipes and/or shoes
is like this--I'm going to replace all the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.189
curse words with the names of British Romantic
poets:

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.929
"I'm a William Blake gangster, so of course
you want my Samuel Taylor Coleridge, you're

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.420
going to want to be all up IN this William
Wordsworth, like OH Percy Shelley, OH OH Percy

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.639
Shelley! I'm the Lord Byron-ing Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, William Blake!"

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.590
It's just an unpleasant way to buy diapers,
Hank, so I won't miss that. But I will miss

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.520
a lot. I want to thank all the Belgian and
Dutch Nerdfighters who came out to events,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.799
and I also want to thank the Dutch Literature
Foundation for making this possible.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.099
In other news, Hank, I was recently on tour
in Hoogeveen--file under places that seem

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.819
made up but aren't--and a Nerdfighter gave
me this "This Star Won't Go Out" bracelet

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.229
which I've been wearing ever since because
my "This Star Won't Go Out" bracelet was broken

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.709
by a member of my household who will remain
nameless, although he is quite small.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:47.869
Anyway Hank, the generosity of this present
reminded me to tell you that "This Star Won't

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.689
Go Out" bracelets are available at dftba.com.
100% of the proceeds go to benefit This Star

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.950
Won't Go Out, a foundation that was established
in memory of Nerdfighter Esther Earl. All

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.689
the money from This Star Won't Go Out goes
to support families who've been affected by

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.329
cancer. Hank, believe it or not, it's been
almost ten months since Esther died. In that

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.590
time, we've raised more than $10,000 for This
Star Won't Go Out, which I think is pretty

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.790
awesome. Nerdfighteria, thank you for your
support, and there's a link to get your bracelet

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.790
in the doobly-doo.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.120
Also Hank, being on tour in the Netherlands
has reminded me that you and I are going on

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.510
tour in the United States when my new, as-yet-untitled,
but soon-to-be-titled book comes out. Nerdfighters,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.430
we really want this tour to be amazing, but
we're also not that creative. For instance,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.219
Hank, did you know that the probable title
of my new novel was stolen from a Nerdfighter?

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.420
As, in fact, was the central observation of
the book, so... thanks, Nerdfighteria!

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.760
Right, so but we're not that creative, so
we want to know from you, Nerdfighteria, what

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.950
you would like to see happen. Don't tell us
where you want us to go; that's a separate

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.469
conversation. Just what you would like to
see, what you'd like to do, what should happen.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.599
Also, one last question, Nerdfighteria: would
you like it if I read the audiobook? Uh, it's

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.970
a little bit weird because the book is narrated
by a young woman, and I am not a young woman,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.630
so you'll hear my voice being like, "And then
I took off my bra." [laughs] I mean - I don't

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.690
- she doesn't take off her bra in the book
that I can remember, but you know, whatever,

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.329
like, it might be a little weird.

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.120
All right Hank, I've got to go back to editing.
DFTBA, I will see you on Monday - I got the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.639
day right! Nerdfighters!
