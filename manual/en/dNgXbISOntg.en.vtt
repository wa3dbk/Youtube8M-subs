00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:04.411
In this video, I want to share with you how to significantly reduce

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:09.067
the time it takes to create morph targets inside of 3ds max.

00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:13.741
We have a head set up with a morpher modifier here

00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.615
and several morph targets have already been created,

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.751
like the blink for the left eye,

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.185
the left hand side of a smile and we also have an emotion, a fully asymmetric emotion.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.557
I will turn on the Automatically Reload targets feature in 3ds max

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:35.407
by simply clicking in the check box and I will use Copy-O-Matic,

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:41.506
a plugin available as part of Morph Toolkit, which is a series of plugins for 3DS Max,

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.082
to help you with your creation of morph targets.

00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:48.581
So, I'll just go on and apply Copy-O-Matic.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.875
We’ll use the centre of the object to do the mirroring in X,

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.315
so that the left side is going to be on the right side and

00:00:57.315 --> 00:00:59.764
the right side is going to go on the left side.

00:01:00.384 --> 00:01:06.738
We will then set the threshold to 0.01, and save a mirror file.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.233
As you can see, it tells us there is a total of 1446 points in that object 

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:20.265
and Copy-O-Matic has found the mirror pair for 1407 of them.

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:27.030
The reason for this is that this model is slightly asymmetrical…by 39 points to be exact.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.860
Now that we've created the reference point, what we can do is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.494
select this target here and on this target, select the vertices of the closed eye.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:42.779
I can then apply the Copy-O-Matic modifier, choose Position

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:46.997
and click copy to copy the position of the various vertices.

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:54.256
 We can then see in the points’ clipboard that we have copied a total of 138 points,

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.063
and I can then click on the Mirror button.

00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:01.734
And that's it, we don't need to redo it for the other eye, 

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:06.452
we can just collapse the stack, and we have just created a new morph target.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.633
Let’s do the same with our asymmetric emotion, 

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.808
we are going to create another asymmetric emotion,

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:17.071
actually, we're just going to flip it entirely.

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:23.997
So we’ll select the vertices of the face, basically only the vertices that are part of this facial expression, 

00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:29.059
apply Copy-O-Matic again, copy the points,  click Mirror

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.768
and we have just created the exact mirror of our original target.

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:37.041
Moving on to our half smile target,

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:43.198
I’ll just select the side of the face that is actually smiling, apply Copy-O-Matic again,

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:47.702
click on the Copy button, then click Mirror, And that's it!

00:02:47.808 --> 00:02:50.826
 We’ve created the full smile, with just one half,

00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:54.495
instead of manually moving the points to create the smile;

00:02:54.495 --> 00:03:00.658
we created half of it and with the help of Copy-O-Matic we finished the target, in seconds.

00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:06.172
So, if we go back to our head model here, and we go back to Morpher, 

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:09.209
we can see that the smile was fully updated,

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.776
 thanks to the Automatically Reload targets option. 

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:18.927
The blink now affects both eyes and if we want to, we can add a new target,

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:26.063
to have the asymmetric emotion on one side with one target and on the other with the new one.

00:03:27.178 --> 00:03:29.686
So as you can see with these various morph targets,

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:36.444
didn't have to actually manipulate any vertices, I just used the Copy-O-Matic modifier 

00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:43.253
to help me copy the position of vertices from one model and paste a mirrored version of them to another.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:47.811
So, using Morph Toolkit, and especially Copy-O-Matic,

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:52.057
you can really speed up the creation process of your morph targets

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:55.654
and reduce the time you spend on them drastically, 

00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:59.188
without ever compromising on the quality of your targets.

00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:05.381
