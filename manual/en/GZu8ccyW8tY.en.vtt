00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.020
Italy I was reading the pay FiOS web

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.470
a news website today and they have a
story about two authors the authors are

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.099
David powers king who is a Mormon and
that'll be part of the story it's

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.250
relevant to the story

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.440
and Michael Jensen now the two authors
were getting very

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.690
very close to publishing a young adult

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.400
fantasy sci-fi type novel that they had
written together

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.240
and there was a hang-up when the
biographical information from them

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.750
was presented to the publisher so the
information presented by David powers

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.200
King little bio blurb that goes at the
back of the book was fine

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.379
but Jensen's Michael Jansons was all of
a sudden

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.180
missing the line when they got a sample
back from the publisher it was missing

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.870
the line

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.870
he lives in Salt Lake City with his
boyfriend

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
and therefore dogs so the acquisitions
editor for the publisher

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.379
cedar fort wrote in an email why's that
line gone kind of weird to a Michael

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.230
Jensen wrote

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.750
the bio including that line and they got
it back without it and they said

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.240
I was concerned about your bio and
wondered what effect it would have with

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.650
our mormon buyers

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.330
so I spoke with the cedar fort owner
lyle mortimer about it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.740
he says we can't risk ruining our
relationship with then

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.650
the Mormons by stating that you live
with your boyfriend so we need to cut

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.130
that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.290
out so Jensen said okay well what if we
just replace the word boyfriend with the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.380
word partner

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.630
um and they didn't like that either they
said

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.299
anything that might even hint at you
being gay

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.860
is going to hurt us so the authors
rightly refused to have the book

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.240
published by cedar fort

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.549
they've a obtained Avery obtained the
rights to the book that they've written

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.600
and I think Lewis that cedar fort is
clearly siding with bigotry here

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.869
and it is business based bigotry in
other words they know that their

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:54.649
audience that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.219
their sewing Tim with the inherent
bigotry against gays

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.149
from the Mormon church the Church of
Latter day Saints that it's bad business

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700
to even hint

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.990
that someone whose book you published is
gay

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.379
and this is a very very sad state of
affairs for with within the Mormon

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:11.879
Church

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.599
definitely it's it's it's a business
decision we see business decisions like

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.629
this being made

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.360
everyday decisions not just based
bigotry butter against

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.040
the the well-being up the citizens of
this country that's just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.890
that's just the way business runs in in
the United States and I have to add

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.519
if your family structure as a Mormon
family who is against homosexuality

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.519
is so weak that a gay author

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.780
mentioning that he has a partner in his
in in the back at the book

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.920
will cause your family to fall apart
it'll cause chaos for real

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.140
for your children I think it's safe to
say that your parenting is in question

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.590
and your family probably has a
significant problems if simply

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.970
one of two authors referring to their
partner or boyfriend in the back up a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.470
book

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.629
is so damaging I would question what's
happening to families within the Mormon

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.360
Church that's really the concern for me

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.519
yeah and it you know it's kinda it's
kinda hush-hush what Mormons do in their

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.330
private lives and and in the church we
know they do some

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.450
completely crazy things I I don't know

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.440
I really have no idea how this would
make any make the slightest impact on

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.280
any of their lives

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.980
