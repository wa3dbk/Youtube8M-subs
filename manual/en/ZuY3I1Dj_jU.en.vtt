00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Dude, it's the fifth time you've tried to
explain the plot of Naruto Shippuden to me

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.800
Everybody dies and gets revived! If I wanted
that kind of thing, I'd would watch Dragon Ball again!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.900
I'm tired of you! Why don't make yourself
a cosplay of Choji and go rolling to h...?

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.300
* TECHNICAL ISSUES! *

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.700
Hello everyone! I'm Fefe or Tron544, as you
may know me already from Youtube!

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.400
I send you my regards! This is the third video
from the section

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.500
in which I answer the
questions you send me in!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.000
From all the questions you sent me, I chose
some of them because,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100
if not, this video would be endless. So I
apologize to all the people whose

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.500
questions I didn't answer. Without futher
ado, let's get started!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.600
The first question was sent by Saul Sandoval
Rojas, who says:

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
"Greetings from Mexico!" I send you my regards
from Argentina!

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100
"Hey, where did that nickname of yours come
from? I hope you answer!"

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm not sure you know, but my name is Fernando.
My nickname, "Fefe",

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400
was invented by a friend of mine from Elementary
School and it will remain

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
like that for the rest of my life! At first,
he called me "Feferulo",

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.900
but it was shortened to "Fefe", because it's
easier, right?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.100
The following one was sent by Rin Okumura,
and he says:

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.500
"In your opinion, which one is better? Gibson
or Fender? Greetings from Mexico"

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.200
I can't really say one is better than the
other, as both brands specialize themselves

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.600
on different things. But if I were to choose
my favourite guitar,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.300
this would be a Fender Stratocaster American
Standard HSS

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.900
However, my favourite model from Gibson is
the SG

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.000
This question was sent by Yintsu AMV, and
he says:

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.700
"Could you show us the picks you use? Which
is your oldest guitar? When did you buy it? Greetings!"

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.700
I send you my regards! My favourite picks
are the ones that have a gauge of 1.5mm

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.200
because it's easier to pick with them. Regarding
my oldest guitar, this was an Aria

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.100
Stratocaster which I bought in October, 2009.
It wasn't the best, but it was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.800
fine to begin with. I'm not sure you know,
but I don't own that guitar anymore!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.900
The following question was sent by Qristian
El El, and he says:

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.500
"Have you thought of becoming a vlogger? Do
you choose the song for your

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.300
covers or you take into
account your followers'requests?"

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.100
No way! I wasn't made to be a vlogger at all!
As regards the way in which I choose the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.900
songs for my covers, I carry out polls on
my Facebook Page! The options I give are choosen

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.600
by taking into account all the requests you
send me. It's okay to think that I don't

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.900
read your messages as I don't answer most
of them. But the thing is that I should answer

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.200
exactly the same thing everytime, which would
be:

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.100
"Okay... I'm going to take into account your
request and, if more people were

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.900
to request the same song, I'd add it to the
poll next time... So, stay tuned!"

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.600
The following message was sent by Sebastian
Alcantara, and he says:

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.900
"Cool, Fefe! Greetings and keep it like this!
Well, you are and will always be the best for me, okay?"

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.400
Well, thank you very much and I send you my
regards, but I'm not best at all!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
"Well, here's my question: You obviously watch
anime, but since when? And what do

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200
your parents tell you about playing songs
from them? Greetings and take care! Bye bye!"

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.600
I've been watching anime since I was a kid
because I would watch series in Cartoon Network

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.000
such as Dragon Ball Z, Digimon, Pokemon, etc.
But the thing is that I didn't actually know

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.200
what anime was back then. A couple of years
of ago, I realized what anime really is by the time

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.300
I started watching Death Note. Currently, I
don't watch anime that often, because of the covers I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.000
have to make. The latest series I've watched
were Cowboy Bebop and AnoHana!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.700
Then, answering your other question, my parents
really don't have any problems with it!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.400
They support me in everything I do! What should
one's parents do if not?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.100
DIplastic says: "If you had the opportunity
of being famous in the music business (obviously),

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.400
would you do it as a soloist or would you
be in a band? Another thing,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.100
which one do you prefer? Lead or rhythm guitar?
Greetings from Bolivia!"

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.300
I send you my regards from here, Argentina!
I'd love to form a band, but I don't know people who play

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.400
instruments. I've got no problem in playing
the rhythm guitar, but I prefer the lead guitar!

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.000
The following question was sent by Paola Nila
Alvarez Rojas, and she says:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.700
"Hi! I came across your channel through your
cover of Rose, the opening of Nana! I loved it,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.000
but I wanted to know which one of the covers
you've made is the one that you like most?"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.400
That's a tough question, but I can tell you
the cover that I felt most satisfied with!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000
In my opinion, I loved the audio that I managed
to get in the cover of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.400
the ending of AnoHana, that it's called "secret
base ~Kimi ga Kureta Mono~"!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.600
Jony Tincho says: "Hi Fefe! I've been playing
the guitar! Currently, I have a Squier Stratocaster,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.400
but I've been saving up some money to buy
a Fender Stratocaster Standard Mexico. However,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.700
I'm not sure if I should buy that guitar,
or save up some more time and buy myself

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.800
an American one... What do you think? Would
it change the sound a lot? Great video! Greetings!"

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.100
I send you my regards from Argentina! I suggest
you saved up a little longer and bought yourself

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.400
and American Stratocaster. The sound is different,
but what changes the most is the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.100
fact that it's easier to play. It's obvious
that it's going to be more expensive, but it's worth it

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.800
However, if you have a more limited budget,
you can buy a Mexican Stratocaster

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.300
They are great! Not as good as the American
ones, but they are excellent!

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.100
Carlos Carrete says: "Which one of the songs
you've played did you find the most difficult?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.100
Greetings from Mexico"

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.000
Difficulty changes with time, but I think
the most difficult songs I've

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.500
played were "GO! GO! Maniac", "God Knows..."
and "WataMote!"

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.900
Gin says: "Hi Fefe! Which Japanese artists
do you like? (Apart from SCANDAL)

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.400
Have you listened to Tommy Heavenly6? Their
songs are amazing! What do you think? Greetings!"

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.600
Ten Japanese bands apart from SCANDAL? This
is a challenge!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.300
ONE OK ROCK, YUI, Asian Kung-Fu Generation,
Beat Crusaders, Miwa,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.000
MAXIMUM THE HORMONE, Seven Oops!!, nano,
STEREOPONY and Girls Dead Monster!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.300
* APPLAUSE! * I'm going to Bariloche!

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.100
And yeah... I know Tommy Heavenly6! Obviously,
everyone knows the songs "PAPERMOON" or "Pray"!

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.900
I haven't listened to that much of the work,
but I love those songs!

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.600
The following message was sent by Lucas Ferreira,
and he says:

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.700
"Hi! You are great and I love your videos!"
Thank you very much!

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.000
"My question is the following one: What are
your plans for the future?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.100
(As regards the career you want to follow
or the dreams you want to fulfill)"

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.400
I'm planning to study Computer Engineering,
but I'd love to become famous

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
in the Music Industry! Or at least, be able
to earn a living from it!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.000
The following message was sent by Alex Covers,
and he says:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.100
"First of all, I want to congratulate you!
You are an ace!" Thank you very much

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.700
"How do you record your covers? Which audio/video
editing software do you use?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.200
Direct connection with the PC or with an amp
through a microphone? Greetings from Medellin, Colombia!"

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.500
I send you my regards from Buenos Aires, Argentina!
I don't think that it will come

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.900
across if I just explain it right now, so
I'm leaving the link to a Tutorial

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.800
I've made a long time ago in which I explain
every step I make in order to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.700
record and edit both audio and video!
So I hope you find it useful!

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.700
The last question was sent by
Sawako Warai, and she says:

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.100
"Why do you leave your hair long?
Do you like Fairy Tail?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.300
Greetings from Chile! I love your covers!
PD: I'm a girl!"

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.400
Now we're talking! I send you my regards from
here, Argentina!

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.100
I leave my hair grow because I like it and
I haven't watched Fairy Tail

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.000
These are all the questions for today, but
I'd like to give some people shout-outs

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.700
