00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.120
*Caboose crying*

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.180
Hey, what's wrong with you, Caboose?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.480
What?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.260
Nothing...

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.420
Come on, we've been shooting at you for like, 20 minutes

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.430
And you haven't run away screaming once!

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430
It's just not like you.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.110
I'm sad.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.630
Sad?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.820
I know. It's just...do you know what today is?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.959
I have absolutely no clue. What day comes after yesterday?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.120
It's Valentine's Day!

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.840
It is?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.600
Hey, what's going on up here?!

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.980
Caboose is in a depression.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.560
It's called a foxhole, you idiot! Haven't you learned any military terms yet?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.560
No! I mean he's depressed!

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.950
*Caboose sighs*

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.210
See?

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.210
Sad? Who gives a fuck, we're trying to kill him!

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.649
Let him be sad when he's dead!

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.149
Hey, you! Stop having feelings!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.140
Apparently he's upset because it's Valentine's Day.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.640
It's what?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.200
Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day!

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920
The day we celebrate love.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.710
And romance.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.610
You know, girls?

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.129
Oh, oh! Oh yeah, right!  Duh, I totally know about that day!

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:23.760
I celebrate that day all the time, with all kinds of ladies!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.120
You don't have to try and impress me.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.400
Oh, you just don't know any of them, and uh...I don't talk about it because, you know, that wouldn't be cool!

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.160
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.160
So why didn't you know what Valentine's Day was?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.940
Oh, I just didn't understand what you
said.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.720
What'd you think I said?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.260
Valentine's...Doy?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Ah yeah, I can see how that would throw you off.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.340
*Caboose crying*

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.580
Oh, come on, man!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.290
I'm all alone now...

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.350
Church was always my valentine...

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.690
Why don't I believe that?

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.610
It's true!

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.610
We had a tradition!

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.400
Hey, Church!

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.160
Happy Valentine's--

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.930
Get the fuck away from me.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.930
Church!

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.410
Would you be my--

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.410
Get the fuck away from me!

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.159
Hey, Church! Agent Washington.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.359
Nice weather!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.620
I guess. Okay.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.200
I wonder if we'll find all those mean computer people today.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.780
Yeah, whatever. Fine.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.140
You know, because...today would be a great day to find them since today is...!

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.020
GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.340
I miss him so much!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.300
Well, you probably shouldn't.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.660
HE LOVED ME!

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.660
Yeah...I have no idea why you think that.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.190
If he didn't love me, then why on every Valentine's Day did he give me my very own heart?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.220
That was your heart!

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.200
After he pulled it out of your chest!

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.260
Don't you remember?!

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.449
It would always take Doc hours to sew it back in!

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.169
Man, he used to bitch about that so much!

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.881
And now it feels like it's being ripped out again

00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:46.701
But you know, more symbolically this time, instead of like the regular way.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150
Would you feel better if we made fun of you and called you names?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.180
Would you mind?

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.820
Not at all, you stupid fucking shithead!

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.840
Thanks guys.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.440
You're the best.
