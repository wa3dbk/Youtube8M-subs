00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:01.818
- Hey, this is Kendra from J House,

00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:02.890
and I am going to show you guys

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.374
how to make candy parachutes.

00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:06.497
The kids have been very excited about it.

00:00:06.497 --> 00:00:10.214
And what I liked about this
activity is it's not very messy,

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.305
it's super quick and
easy, and it uses stuff

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:13.978
that I already had around the house.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:17.739
So, you need string, or, in
my case, I'm just using yarn,

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.632
'cause that's what I had.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:23.132
You'll also need some tape, some scissors,

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:26.322
and you'll need tissue
paper, the kind, like,

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:27.546
with gift wrapping.

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:29.958
At first, I thought it meant,
like, Kleenexes tissues,

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.738
but those wouldn't be
big enough, so you want

00:00:31.738 --> 00:00:35.171
the full size sheets of tissue paper.

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.139
And, of course, you need candy.

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:39.952
I bought the mini size,
and that does work,

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:42.832
but I think the fun size
would be more better,

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:44.411
and be even more fun.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.081
This activity was inspired by this book,

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:49.265
Christmas from Heaven, and
I'm gonna tell you more

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:50.298
about that in a minute.

00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:51.918
Here's how you make them.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.120
You just take your full
sheet of tissue paper,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.688
it's 24 inches by 24 inches,

00:00:56.688 --> 00:01:00.438
and then, you need about
48 inches of string.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:02.897
And, so, one,

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:05.945
two, three, four.

00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.291
Close enough.

00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.976
What matters is that the
string is the same length,

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:13.143
so then, I'm just going to match that.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:18.232
So you've got your two
strings of the same length.

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.106
Now you're going to use the tape.

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.261
Isaac, can you grab me the tape?

00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:27.944
And you're going to tape
it to the opposite edges,

00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:29.611
like this.

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:32.764
Okay.

00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:38.705
So you're going to tape it to
the opposite edges, like this.

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.150
Okay, now I'm gonna do the other one.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.433
Alright, now that I've
got all four edges taped

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.893
you pull it up together
in the center, like this,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:07.060
and you tie just a regular knot.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.027
Like, just a regular, old knot.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:15.861
And the candy is gonna go in this part,

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.611
the little loop that's left over.

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:22.600
Got it?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.183
And now you have...

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.266
a candy parachute!

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:35.150
Good job!

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.470
Okay, now we're gonna match
it up so it's the same length.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.799
- I'll put it right here.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.085
- Okay, get another one.

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:44.335
She chose the Twix, she's a smart girl.

00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:48.309
Cut it right there.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:51.675
Very nice.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:54.075
(Caleb laughs)

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.308
Now we're gonna put the tape on.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:03:00.475
Okay, I need you to get
me a little piece of tape.

00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:02.390
Good work!

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.646
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas")

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:21.204
The idea comes from this book.

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:22.871
Oh! That's the back.

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:27.418
Okay, this book, Christmas from Heaven,

00:03:27.418 --> 00:03:31.003
the true story of the Berlin candy bomber.

00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:33.412
It tells the story of Gail Halvorsen,

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.969
who was a pilot after World War Two.

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.405
He was flying needed supplies
into the Berlin area,

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:42.466
like flour, and just stuff
that they needed to survive,

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:45.220
and it was then that he
noticed the children there,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.092
and the war-torn city
that they were living in.

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:49.564
And the children had nothing,

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:51.654
and he just wanted to give them something.

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:54.101
So he got his buddies
together, and they pooled

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.813
their candy rations, they
tied them to parachutes,

00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:59.019
and they dropped them from the airplanes

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.814
as they were flying overhead.

00:04:00.814 --> 00:04:04.105
Anyway, the idea caught
on, and by Christmas,

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:07.853
people in America had
donated 21 tons of candy,

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:11.191
that were then tied to
parachutes, and dropped down

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:12.939
onto Berlin.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.190
I love this story.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.621
I'm a sucker for
non-fiction picture books,

00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:20.059
and I love a story that ties
in history, and geography,

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.709
and compassion, and
just, true life heroes.

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:25.502
The kids love the book,
I highly recommend it.

00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:27.781
And in the back it gave
instructions for how to make

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.503
your own candy parachutes, so
we just knew we had to try it.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:32.538
Thanks for watching my
crafty collab video.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.846
This is a collaboration with
other YouTube mommy meetup

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:38.856
mommies, and so, in the links
below you'll find the links

00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:40.322
to all of their channels.

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.987
There is going to be a
Christmas craft posted every day

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:45.899
from now until Christmas, so
go ahead and check 'em out.

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:47.649
Thanks! Bye!
