00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.029
I get a lot of phone calls and emails

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.189
and letters from people who woke
up in the middle of the night thinking

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.669
something terrible was invading their
campground when they suddenly were

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.529
hearing Barred Owls.

00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:51.600
They're often doing that because they're
hearing another pair or individual

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.219
Barred Owl on an established territory.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.609
And thatâ€™s when the pair starts really
revving up and making those 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.650
territorial calls.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.439
One night I was being totally quiet, just
walking along this road and in flew two

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.149
Barred Owls.  There was

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.350
a full moon behind them,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.840
and you could actually see their eyes as they
were calling.  And it was

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.590
just magical.
