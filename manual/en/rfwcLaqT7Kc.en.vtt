00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.050
There are those, you know, who don't understand
A gift we have right here on the land.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.689
It's a precious commodity, an asset to us
all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.300
Yet it's taken for granted and covered by
a mall.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.809
Do you know what it is? Can you make a guess
and tell me?

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.449
No it's not gold, silver, diamonds, or oil.
It has more value and it's called topsoil.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.190
Now you might be thinking, "What's he talking
about?"

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.320
I'll tell you right now so you won't be left
out.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.720
Soil is where it's at. Yea that's what I said.
Soil is number one; let's get that in our

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.300
head.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.160
Many, many people have the mis-conception
That soil is just dirt and a minor distraction.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.750
Those people are wrong and widely mistaken.
So that's why I'm here, to help them re-awaken.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.360
(chorus)
Don't- Don't -Don't

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.329
Don't treat it like...
Don't- Don't - Don't

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.380
Don't treat it like...
Don't - Don't - Don't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.700
Don't treat it like dirt!
No....No....No....

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.330
Don't- Don't -Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.000
Don't- Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.740
Don't - Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like dirt!

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.850
No....No....No....

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.000

Dirt is just something you wipe off your shoes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.039
Before you track in and give your mom the
blues.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.880
The car gets dirty and could use a good wash
You rinse off all the grime and the bug that's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.820
squashed.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.820
Dirt gets on your clothes when you slide into
base

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.869
That's not what I mean when I plead the soil's
case.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.159
Soil is beneficial to us all on this earth
We all depend upon it since the day of our

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:42.189
birth.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:42.530
Soil is full of life with bustling activity.
Consisting of organics and microbes that are

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.549
wiggly.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.159
Soil's a great foundation for holding plants
up strong.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.399
Allowing it to wash away is absolutely wrong

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.259
You, me, we all need soil to grow our daily
food.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.740
It's vital for us every day, so please let's
not be rude.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.189
(chorus)
Don't - Don't -Don't

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.399
Don't treat it like...
Don't - Don't -Don't

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.890
Don't treat it like...
Don't - Don't - Don't

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.229
Don't treat it like dirt!
No....No....No....

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.229
Don't - Don't -Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.590
Don't - Don't -Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.519
Don't - Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like dirt!

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:15.640
No....No....No....

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.870
You can't grow a tomato on a big parking lot,
And trees don't grow tall in a little clay

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.100
pot.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.680
All vegetation needs the soil to grow and
thrive,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680
To put their roots in deep and easily survive.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.889
I hope you've all learned a little something
today

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.500
Soil is important in every way.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.380
It needs to be appreciated, held in high regard.
In fields and gardens everywhere, even your

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.820
backyard.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.720
All life depends on soil and we must take
care of it.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.280
Soils' a natural wonder and I urge you to
commit.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.470
Please - please - don't ever treat soil like
dirt!

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.470
Don't treat it like...
Don't - Don't - Don't

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.769
Don't treat it like...
Don't - Don't - Don't

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.880
Don't treat it like dirt!
No....No....No....

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.709
Don't - Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.850
Don't - Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like...

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.919
Don't - Don't - Don't
Don't treat it like dirt!

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:08.169
No....No....No....
