00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
"UKULELE TRICKS IN TWO WEEKS!"

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.380
"Modern Blues"( Swing stroke )

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.820
Hi!

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.680
Probably you feel pain in you thumb...

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.360
It is always happens when someone practice many hours like you :0)

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.360
For this reason there is a technic to play with a plectrum

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.960
I recommend to buy one

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.400
Soft one

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.380
Simple and cheep.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.060
Let's learn how to stroke the Swing 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.420
This rhythmic pattern is called "Swing" because it is swinging ;0)

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.780
It goes like this:

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.740
And now we'll learn , what is called "Modern Blues"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.260
It is a 12 bar jazz form of blues

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.700
Let's start from the rhythm because it is a root of everything

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
I hold the plectrum between index finger and the thumb.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.020
 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.260
The Swing stroke:

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.660
down

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.160
up

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.260
down

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.740
I stroke and mute the strings at the same time

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.280
so I get a very short stroke

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.260
Blues

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.100
a modern one ;0)

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.640
something like this ;0)

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.000
If you loose or brake your plectrum

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400
Don't worry!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.320
You can hold your index finger and the thumb together

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.580
and continue to play

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.300
Also don't forget to relax your left hand

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.360
It will be very helpful when you take difficult cords like "Bare"

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.220
when you have to bar all the strings with one finger

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160
And now you can jazz ! ;0)
