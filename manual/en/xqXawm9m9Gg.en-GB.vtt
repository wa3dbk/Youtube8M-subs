00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm a bio-geochemist, where biology, geology
and chemistry all intersect. I'm fascinated

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.820
by the questions that are in that zone. The
main words to inject into the theory of natural

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.270
selection is chemistry, and Robert Williams
had written fantastic paper in 1981, the Bakerian

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.960
Lecture, where he argues that if we think
about natural selection and survival of the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.850
fittest, we need to consider what the context
of the fittest is and that context may well

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.510
change. Bob's idea is that there's actually
been a 'handbreaker' on evolution in terms

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.149
of the chemicals that are available to life.
So before oxygenetic photosynthesis arrived

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.649
and before the surface of the planet became
oxidised, there were certain elements that

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.020
were locked away and not available to life,
in particular elements like copper and zinc.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.250
Those elements we see from looking at the
genomes today may well be a key part to being

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.840
able to become multicellular, to being able
to grow. There seems to be a way that the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.229
chemistry is almost informing or feeding back
onto these major evolutionary steps, so we

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.360
can trace the chemical evolution by peering
into the genomes. One idea I had was to look

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.360
at the genome of rubisco to see when changing
carbon dioxide has effected the working of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.390
this enzyme. Rubisco is at the heart of much
of this story, it catalyses part of oxygenic

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.009
photosynthesis and uses carbon dioxide to
fix into organic matter and to make sugars

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.569
that ultimately we eat. What's fascinating
about rubisco is that it only seems to have

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.200
emerged once. There's one enzyme facing these
challenges and underpinning all of oxygenic

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.750
photosynthesis on the planet. That's the solution
that evolution has found, it's a very inefficient

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.179
enzyme in its lack of ability to discriminate
between carbon dioxide and oxygen. So rubisco

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.569
has evolved alongside carbonic anhydrase,
which helps to provide carbon dioxide for

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.680
rubisco as its substrate. Carbonic anhydrase
actually works as fast as the rate of diffusion,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.379
it's the fastest enzyme in the west! Its about
as optimal as you can find in terms of enzyme

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.610
efficiency, but looking at carbonic anhydrase
it's a totally different enzyme. It seems

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.909
to be very easy to evolve unlike rubisco that
it has evolved at least five different families

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.239
with very little genetic similarity across
evolution. It's a fantastic example of convergent evolution.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.940
 I think it would be great to try
and find out how the constraints of chemistry with the idea of convergent evolution may
well play out in Darwin's theory of natural

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.640
selection. I certainly know that my old lecturer
Simon Conway-Morris in Cambridge is a real

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.409
specialist. "Simon, it's nice to see you on
this rather frosty Cambridge day. I've come

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.930
to talk to you about evolutionary convergence."
"In essence, it simply says that from very

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.609
different starting points in the evolutionary
tree of life, you end up with very much the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.480
same solution, the same arrangement, more
or less independently. For instance, you and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.969
I are looking at each other with our eyes.
We don't have an octopus here, but if I had

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:26.150
an octopus in my hand and I looked at its
eye, it would be arranged in an almost identical

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.109
fashion. But we know that the octopus is a
mollusc, we belong to the vertebrates and

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.239
the 'camera eye' we both possess has evolved
independently." "That tells us about evolution

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.400
at the functional level, but some of the work
I've been involved in is looking more at the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.189
molecular level and at the enzymes that are
actually catalysing many biological reactions."

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.430
"There's evolutionary convergence everywhere,
it extends from the molecular level such as

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.159
from the enzymes that accelerate the reactions
within the cell, all the way through to organismal

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:03.159
plants, bodies, that sort of thing. Convergence
happens all the time." "But why is there such

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.909
a limited spectrum to the ways of solving
what life can do?" "Unsolved problem! In essence,

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.930
it's Darwinian. It's a question of adaptation.
These are the best solutions which are honed

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.000
by the adaptive process, but there may be
a little bit more to it than that. Biology

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.980
is part of the physical universe, including
chemistry of course. Could it be that there

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.020
are constraints working at that level? This
would at least, in part, determine what's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.930
going to happen in the biological outcomes."
"I think the chemistry does actually prescribe

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.990
a certain predictability to the course of
evolution and almost in an inevitability to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.180
where we are today. Where natural selection
can occur, it can occur within the chemistry

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.180
that is available at that time. Should there
be a major revolution to that chemistry then

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.780
that could well lead to a novel step of evolution
and life learns to use these things that are

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.430
initially toxic to its processes. The revolutions
and the chemical catastrophes, you could almost

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.349
say, seem to provide opportunities for advancement
and evolution's complexity." "Once there were

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:19.099
bacteria, now there's New York. Things have
changed. Periodic table is populated by life,

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.979
of course, you only need a handful of elements
to make a protein. If you then look at the

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.150
way proteins work, especially the enzymes,
which allow life to do things like photosynthesise,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.060
they're remarkably constrained." "Photosynthesis
is a fantastic example because you have a

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.490
myriad of proteins involved in that, but at
least in the carbon fixation step you have

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.490
this enzyme rubisco. Looking across the rubiscos
that we see in plants and algae in the ocean

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.970
there are very limited variations on that.
It's really one single solution. As oxygen

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.379
has risen and carbon dioxide has declined,
that's made it even more challenging for rubisco.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.349
That brings in that other fascinating enzyme
carbonic anhydrase - where rubisco is inefficient

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.639
something else has popped up that can work
cooperatively." "Carbonic anhydrase is absolutely

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.849
astonishing and yet the evidence suggests
it's evolved three, four or five times independently.

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:22.430
It is one of the best examples of evolutionary
convergence at the level of molecules." 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:31.500
"We're here in Cambridge, Simon. We know that Darwin
was here. What would he say has happened to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.669
his theory with our new knowledge of the geological
record of biological organisms and the diversity

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.270
of life." "What a question! I think he would
be delighted. Darwin principally viewed the

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.300
world through the lens of natural selection
and adaptation, and that's crucial to the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.990
evolutionary synthesis. But it's increasingly
clear that there's a great deal more involved.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.039
One thing about Darwin is that quite frequently
in his works he'll ask a question that says

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.610
'I'm puzzled by this', and almost invariably
that's turned out to be an area of enormous

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.900
importance in later investigations. I think
probably what would have astonished him in

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.629
a sense is how complex biological form is.
He didn't know about the genes, of course,

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.979
but the great thing about Darwin - he was
genuinely modest and he was genuinely curious.

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:20.979
As far as I'm concerned, if we follow in Darwin's
footsteps in that regard we can't really go wrong."
