00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.160
Hello! And welcome to our Top 10 Talented
Dogs featuring the cleverest canines from

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.980
around the world…

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.680
Number 10: Surfing Dogs

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.680
It’s no secret that dogs love water, but
these dogs from California are making quite

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.300
a splash! Numerous dog surfing competitions
take place every year. But… We don’t exactly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.840
know how talented these pooches are. I mean,
let’s be honest if they were riding a barrel

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.920
wave then they would definitely be our number
one!

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.430
Number 9: Dancing Dogs

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.090
Number nine on our countdown are all of the
dancing dogs out there. We’re not saying

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.600
that these obedient and entertaining
dogs aren’t talented, but let’s face it,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.440
we’ve all seen it before. This well-trained
collie dog in Israel is performing a country-western

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.700
dance. Yee-haaaa!

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.660
Number 8: ATM Dog

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.180
Hide your pin! Renae is a yellow Labrador
that learned to use a cash machine using…

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.830
her…. teeth! Renae’s owner unfortunately
suffers from Cerebral Palsy and suffers with

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
everyday tasks, so Renae the dog is at hand
to look after her owner and withdraw cash

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.470
at her every need.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.600
Number 7: Lifeguard Dogs

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.270
In London, these Newfoundland dogs are rescuing
volunteers from the chilly waters of the Serpentine

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.200
River. But did you know that these dogs have
the strength to pull 10-12 people? That’s

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.700
why these powerful pooches definitely deserve
a place on our list.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.800
Number 6: Helicopter Dogs

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.860
But Italy went one step further than London…
Not only do they have Newfoundland lifeguard

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.290
dogs, but they are JUMPING FROM HELICOPTERS.
Wow. In Lake Iseo these brave dogs are practising

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.710
their rescue skills, now that’s amazing.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.700
Number 5: Skateboarding Bulldog

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.460
Peru has a new famous skater, Biuf the Bulldog
and he’s a natural on a skateboard. His

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.140
owner is using Biufs talents for the greater
good by creating a skate school for dogs where

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.890
all the proceeds will go to charity.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.640
Number 4: Parkour Dog

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.069
This really is a cat’s worst nightmare…
TreT the Staffordshire bull terrier from Ukraine

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.289
is skilled in the art of Parkour. Need we
say anymore?

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.870
Number 3: Avalanche Dogs

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.200
In Les Deux Alpes, these talented dogs are
trained life-savers as there job is to rescue

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.480
skiers lost during avalanches. These amazing
dogs can search a hectare of terrain in just

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.639
20 mins. To put that into perspective it would
take 20 humans 2 hours to cover the same amount

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.599
of ground! Search dogs from around the world
are doing an amazing job to save lives. Bravo!

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.439
Number 2: Army Dogs

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.749
This clip had to go number two on our list,
just because it is so great!

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.780
And here is is… Number one ! This Dalmatian
called Momotar really is one of the most talented

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.769
pooches in the world. I mean, when was the
last time you saw a dog riding a bicycle?

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.439
We think he’ll go far… Mainly because
he can’t use the breaks.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.089
Well that’s it folks! Do you agree with
our list? Let us know in the comments. And
