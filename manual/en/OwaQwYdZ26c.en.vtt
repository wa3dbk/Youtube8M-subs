00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.462
-Are you religious at all?

00:00:01.462 --> 00:00:04.033
-I was raised
half Jewish and half nothing.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.330
-I was raised Catholic.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.000
I am at the age of reasoning
and questioning right now.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
-So, we're gonna try
and catch these little kids

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.264
and ask them about faith.

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:13.297
-I have a 12-year yoga practice,

00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:15.330
which is where
my spirituality comes from.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.528
-Is there any yoga thing we can
do right here, right now?

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:24.000
-Om...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.396
-Did that feel good?

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.693
-It was definitely louder
than I expected.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.528
Let's play
some word association.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.132
Breakfast.
-Yes.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:32.660
-Denim.
-[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.726
-Catholic Church.
-Early-morning push-ups.

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:36.528
-How do you feel
about the Catholic Church?

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:38.363
-I feel like the new pope

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:40.495
is a great step
in the right direction.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.396
-Do you follow
the pope on Twitter?

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:44.429
-No, I don't follow him.
He doesn't follow back,

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.099
so I'm not gonna follow him.

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:47.495
-How do you feel about atheists?

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.660
-They have nobody to talk to
when they're having sex.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.165
-What do you think the most
confident misconceptions

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.000
about atheists are?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.726
-People will think,
"Oh, you're an atheist

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.231
because you
think you know it all,"

00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.396
and, "No, you're not.
Just keep an open mind."

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:02.627
-If you were
to ask an atheist one question,

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:05.660
what would it be?
-"How are you doing?"

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.627
-What made you come
to the conclusion

00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:09.000
that there was no God?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.264
Did Justin Bieber have anything
to do with it?

00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:14.627
-Justin Bieber had everything to
do with me becoming an atheist.

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.099
-I thought so.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.132
How do you guys feel
about religion?

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:19.330
-No. Bye.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.660
-Bye.
We're gonna get them.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.198
If you could learn about
one religion, what would it be?

00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:27.066
-I think I would want
to learn a little bit

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.330
more about Buddhism.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.198
-Do you know a lot
about Buddhism?

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:32.000
-No, actually,
and I lived for years

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.528
in a Buddhist temple
and I have absolutely no idea.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.264
-What do you know
about Hinduism?

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:38.066
-I know it's not God.
-What is it?

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.264
Don't, like, they believe in a
lot of gods with a lot of arms?

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:44.396
-But I know it's, like,
some other dude.

00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.528
-And all their gods
are having sex.

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:48.726
That sounds rude now that
it comes out of my mouth,

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:52.198
but I think Hindus believe
in a lot of sex gods.

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:55.264
-What is
the Hindu afterlife like?

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:57.495
-I don't know.
Do they believe in an afterlife?

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.231
-I think they believe
in reincarnation, dude.

00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:02.396
-How do you not know this stuff?
You're the host of the show.

00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:05.396
-I'm just learning.
I'm just learning.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:08.264
-Can we get a host
that, like, knows his stuff?

00:02:08.264 --> 00:02:09.495
-Come back!

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.363
I have important questions
about life to ask you,

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:13.627
you adorable children.

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.297
Do you know what a Wiccan is?

00:02:15.297 --> 00:02:16.561
-I think I used to date one.

00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.693
I kept asking her
what it was like to be a witch,

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:21.759
and she never really told me.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.363
-Is it possible
that she just wasn't one and

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:26.066
you were just assuming things?

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.660
A Muslim, a Jew, a Mormon,
a Baptist, a Bahá'ían, a Quaker

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660
all sit down in a room.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.000
What's the first thing
you think they talk about?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.429
-God.
-Can I ask you a question?

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.660
What's God like?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.297
-God made the world.

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:45.132
-God made the world.
And...

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:46.528
Oh!

00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:48.429
I feel like
we're getting somewhere.

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:50.066
If there was a show

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.297
on the Internet for free
that explored different faiths

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:56.363
and was awesome,
would you watch it?

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.132
-Yeah.
-'Cause, guess what,

00:02:58.132 --> 00:02:59.396
there is one.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:01.000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.396
And you're on it now.

00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:12.264
-Watch "Have a Little Faith"
on SoulPancake.

00:03:12.264 --> 00:03:14.495
-That kid knows
what he's talking about.
