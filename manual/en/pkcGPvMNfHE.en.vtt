00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.439
Hey Rescue Heroes, thank you so much for letting
me spend the day with you all.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.440
Sure, no problem, Mater.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.740
Uh oh boys, I feel an earthquake.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.080
Hold on Mater!

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.270
Oh no, McQueen was in a big skyscraper.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.950
We's better check and help him!

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.090
Okay boys, you heard the tow truck.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.820
Let's get our transportation and find that
red race car.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.630
Don't worry Mater, we'll be right behind you.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.969
Oh, looks like I beat Mater, and this skyscraper's
not looking good.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.050
There's blocks everywhere!

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.670
I don't know where to find his little friend.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.120
Mater to the rescue!

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.339
Thank you for the lift, Rescue Hero.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.699
Oh no, this looks terrible.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.589
McQueen where are you?

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:58.620
He's got to be under this rubble here.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.710
Mr. Fireman sir, can you help me move some
blocks so we can find my friend McQueen?

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.259
Thank you.

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.149
Oh, you're just pushing down the skyscraper
more.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.600
I don't know if that really helps us.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.490
You, sir, you look very strong.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.070
Move the blocks with your arms.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.469
Still no sign of McQueen.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.290
I'm getting nervous.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.200
Looks like a job for Mater.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.840
I'm going in.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.840
Hhhh.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840
McQueen!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.840
There you are!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.219
I'm so glad I found you!

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.310
Thank you for your help fellas, but I'd better
take my best friend home.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.329
He's gotta rest up in Radiator Springs.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.450
Mind if I borrow your motorcycle?

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.450
Whoops.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.439
Uh, Mater, you don't look like a very good
driver.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.539
Um, I'm good.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.939
See ya.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.950
Mater, that did not happen.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.000
Chhh chhh chhh chhh chhh.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.670
Hey, what's that sound?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.640
Mater, we need you for a mission.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.710
Hop on.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.329
Bye McQueen.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.980
Thanks for watching and have a great day.
