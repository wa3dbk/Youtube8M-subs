And by Powermatic, the

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:16.763
(jazzy music)

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:26.910
Aaron: Hi, everybody.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.777
My name is Aaron Marshall.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.318
In this video I'm going
to show a little bit

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:31.358
more about using SketchUp

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:33.321
which is a great 3D-modeling
piece of software

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.147
that you can get from Google.

00:00:35.147 --> 00:00:37.251
It's actually sketchup.google.com

00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:38.783
I believe is the website to download

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:41.173
the Windows version and the Mac version

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.804
all for free.

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:44.123
It's a great little piece of software.

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.367
I use it a lot for creating plans

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.713
before I'll go out into the shop actually.

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:51.327
Many of you probably know by now that

00:00:51.327 --> 00:00:52.914
Marc is working on a steamer trunk

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:55.915
that is based on some
plans he got from Rockler.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.390
The plans as they came from Rockler

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.820
have a curved top on the top of the trunk.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.160
Marc's actually going to change that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.885
a little bit and have a flat top.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:05.375
So I thought it was a good opportunity

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.168
to sort of show a little
bit about SketchUp.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:11.650
I'm going to model the new top,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.599
not the whole trunk but just the top.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:15.491
At the end of the exercise

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:16.777
we should have all the dimensions

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.908
and all the little
details that we would need

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:19.943
to actually go out into the shop

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:21.272
and make the thing.

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:24.184
I'll ask Marc actually
to put that final file

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.810
up on his website,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.356
but in the meantime take
a look at this video

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:30.248
and it'll show you
hopefully a little bit more

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.140
about using SketchUp.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.899
Again, if you want to later you can just

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.159
download the finished product.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.201
We'll make that available.

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.450
The first thing we'll do
is remove the old top.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.950
We don't need it and it's just getting

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.113
in our way right now.

00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:44.370
I'll select it and hit the delete button

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.301
to get rid of it.

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:49.102
Then using the rectangle tool,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:50.645
I'm actually going to just trace the top

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.565
of this trunk and create a rectangle

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:55.816
that's the right size.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.972
In the spirit of getting
rid of your tape measure

00:01:57.972 --> 00:01:59.806
as Marc puts it,

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.342
we want to trace things
and use the SketchUp model

00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:04.506
as much as possible.

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:08.640
Using the move tool I'll
actually grab that rectangle,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.287
move it over here to the side

00:02:10.287 --> 00:02:11.912
where we can work on it without worrying

00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:14.550
about the rest of the trunk.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.951
This is the footprint
for the top of the trunk,

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.218
the dimensions that we'll use.

00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:21.900
It will be two inches tall.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.767
I'll use the offset tool
now to select that face,

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:30.133
and the offset tool draws a parallel line

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:31.842
around the inside, or actually the outside

00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:34.905
of a face or another shape.

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:37.962
I'll bring it inside and just type in 3/4

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:41.762
because the outside of the trunk lid

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:46.889
is going to be a 3/4 inch
by 2 inch high frame.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.676
Before I pull that all the way up though,

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:53.470
what I'll do is get rid of that inside.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.995
Hit delete so we have
just sort of a frame here.

00:02:55.995 --> 00:02:58.643
I'll go ahead and get a
head start on some joinery.

00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:01.928
That front edge is going
to be a separate piece

00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:06.854
so I'll use the pencil tool
to draw a couple lines,

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:11.130
and separate it so now
if I use push-pull tool

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.431
and pull up two inches
it's just that front rail.

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.907
You can see that there's
some extra lines left over.

00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:19.745
Usually that would be a problem.

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.147
In this case they're
actually kind of useful.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:25.834
The front of the trunk
will be joined to the sides

00:03:25.834 --> 00:03:27.952
with some rabbets.

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:30.574
I'll pull in a rabbet that's 1/2 inch

00:03:30.574 --> 00:03:32.526
using the push tool.

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.841
Then on the second end over here

00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.549
I can grab it so I've got it,

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.340
and then actually just
reference this other face

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.414
so I know it's going to be brought in

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:44.990
the same dimension.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.710
I know I'm spinning around quite a bit.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.741
Sorry about that.

00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:49.717
The last thing I'm going to do with

00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:54.373
that front lip is I'll
select everything there.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.290
I'm going to reverse the faces

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.731
because I just like to kind
of see everything white,

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:01.738
my OCD coming out,

00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:03.694
and then I'll make it a component.

00:04:03.694 --> 00:04:07.395
I'll call it the lid front.

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.710
Always replace the
selection with the component

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.159
and hit create.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.212
Now we've got a separate component

00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:17.480
called the lid front that's got

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.367
some of the right joinery, the rabbet.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.166
We'll add some more later.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:26.544
What I can do then is copy that.

00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:28.546
The move tool is actually
a great way to copy.

00:04:28.546 --> 00:04:30.478
You just pretend like
you're going to move it,

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.863
but then hold down the control key

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:34.495
and it makes a copy.

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:36.277
I'll move it to the back here.

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:38.270
Again, using the move tool still

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.606
I'll hover over one of
these little plus signs,

00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:46.361
rotate it around 280 degrees.

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.638
Now that is the back or our trunk.

00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:53.327
I'll move it into position grabbing it

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.854
at that bottom corner,
moving it to right there

00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:57.570
on our template if you will.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.317
Now we've got the front
and the back all set up.

00:05:02.317 --> 00:05:04.436
Now it will be fairly easy to work on

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:09.225
the sides of the lid with a rectangle.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.333
Just come in here and draw a rectangle

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.393
from one edge to the other.

00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:18.154
Push-pull tool, push it up

00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:27.250
to the same height, 2 inches.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.299
Select tool again. I'm
going to flip all the,

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:29.166
reverse all the faces
just to get everything

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:32.164
consistently colored.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.576
That will help eventually if I do add

00:05:33.576 --> 00:05:36.782
textures, wood textures to the faces.

00:05:36.782 --> 00:05:39.196
That will help keep everything nice.

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:44.435
I'll select that whole
part, right-click on it

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:46.120
make it a component,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.467
and I'll call this a lid side, and create.

00:05:53.602 --> 00:05:56.671
Now to create the second side,

00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:00.695
I'll just select the
component we just created,

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:05.830
and using the move tool grab it,

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.976
hold down the control
key to get a fresh copy.

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:09.570
I'll put it over here.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.380
I actually do need to spin it because

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.161
I am going to add some
joinery to it later.

00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:14.761
If I do that, the good
thing about components

00:06:14.761 --> 00:06:17.655
is if you edit one they all change,

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:20.390
but I would hate for a rabbet to show up

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.549
on the wrong side of a component

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.965
so I'll show you that in a second.

00:06:24.965 --> 00:06:28.864
Now we have the roughed in top,

00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:33.448
frame of the top, and that's all we need.

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:36.438
Voiceover:This is just one
part of a three-part series

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.140
on SketchUp basics,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.190
but if you've never
used the program before,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.632
you might need a more
in-depth introduction.

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:43.797
For that I recommend going to

00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:46.570
SketchupforWoodworkers.com.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.922
Rob will take you through the basics

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:48.929
of setting up a project

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.110
from a woodworkers perspective.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.434
So I highly recommend
checking his site out.

00:06:53.434 --> 23:59:59.999
Thanks for watching, everybody.
