If you'd like to enable YouTube Live Events
on your YouTube channel, stay tuned watch

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:18.050
this video and I'll show you what you need,
to do so.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.429
Hi there, David Walsh here, from DavidWalshOnLine.com
and in this very short video, I'm gonna show

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.289
you how you enable YouTube Live Events, on
your YouTube channel.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.340
When you go in your channel's settings area,
you can see an icon for live events and like

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.750
with most things on YouTube, they don't tell
you how you enable it. So, you are left wondering

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.760
what to do to have that green light on your
channel settings area.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.110
Well, I am here to help you to get that enable.
Unfortunately, there isn't any button that

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.670
you can click or anything to verify that allows
you to enable Live Events on your YouTube

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.390
channel.
There's only one thing that you need to have

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.280
on your channel in order to get it enabled.
And that is to have 100 subscribers or more.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.809
When this first came out it was actually,
1,000 subscribers that you needed to have

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.150
the enable button pop up on your channel.
But they reduced this to get more and more

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.319
people to use live events across YouTube.
So, today you, actually, only need 100 subscribers

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.600
to have the enable button pop up on your channel,
so you can have live events.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.670
Now, if you're unfamiliar with what Live Events
does, it allows you to connect multiple cameras

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.749
to your computer and basically become your
own TV studio.

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:34.579
And since it has started, there has been thousands
of channels using Live Events to broadcast

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.500
everything from sporting to music to all sorts
of events on YouTube. So, you now have the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.619
ability to become your own TV channel, all
from the comfort of your own home.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.680
So, there you go, that's how you basically
enable YouTube Live Events on your YouTube

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.179
channel. You, basically, get those 100 subscribers,
then you have an enable button pop up on your

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.240
channel settings area and once you enable
that, then you have YouTube Live Events pop

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.850
up on the left hand side of your channel area.
I'd love to know if you have YouTube Live

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.310
Events running on your channel and what you
use it for. Stick them in the old comments

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.420
area down there and let me and everyone else
know, what you're using it for and we might

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.700
even pop by and have a look sometime.
