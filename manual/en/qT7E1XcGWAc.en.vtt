00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.370
NOW, WE CAN'T HAVE TACO NIGHT
WITHOUT TORTILLAS, RIGHT?

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.710
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW EASY IT IS

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.660
TO MAKE YOUR OWN CORN TORTILLAS.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.460
NOW, THERE ARE A FEW SECRETS.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.269
TO MAKE YOUR TORTILLAS FLUFF,

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.740
YOU HAVE TO USE WARM
OR HOT WATER.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160
SO, TO 2 CUPS OF CORN FLOUR,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.990
I'M ADDING 1 1/2 CUPS
OF WARM WATER.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.930
THIS IS REALLY FUN.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.610
YOU CAN GET REALLY MESSY.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.570
THE BOYS LOVE
PLAYING WITH DOUGH

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.200
AND WITH MASA.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.219
NOW YOU CAN SEE
IT'S GETTING TO BE SO SOFT

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.219
AND MALLEABLE.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.969
GONNA ADD A PINCH OF SALT.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.200
OK, THE MASA IS READY,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.120
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST TRICK,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.109
AND THEN YOU GET
YOUR TORTILLA PRESS.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.699
ANOTHER TIP OR TRICK

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.329
IS THAT YOU NEED
VERY THIN PLASTIC.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.800
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A TORTILLA PRESS,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
GO FIND A TORTILLA PRESS.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.962
OK, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET ONE,

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:08.420
YOU CAN USE A ROLLING PIN
IN BETWEEN PLASTIC,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.540
BUT THE TORTILLA PRESS
IS REALLY SO MUCH FUN,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.400
AND THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY CHEAP, TOO.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.030
SO, YOU'RE GONNA ADD
A LITTLE BIT OF WATER

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.140
TO THE BASE
OF THE TORTILLA PRESS

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.980
UNDER THE PLASTIC
SO THAT THE PLASTIC STICKS.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.070
SAME THING ON TOP.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.230
AND THEN I'M GONNA MAKE A BALL

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.600
OF AROUND ONE INCH.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
FLATTEN IT A LITTLE.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.450
YOU PRAY TO WHICHEVER SAINT
YOU LIKE THE MOST

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.670
FOR THE TORTILLA
TO NOT BREAK

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.490
WHEN IT LAYS ON THE COMAL,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.610
SO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS
GENTLY, SOFTLY.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.250
AND YOU LAY IT DOWN,
AND, YAY, IT DIDN'T BREAK.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.430
THIS COMAL
HAS TO BE HEATED 10 MINUTES

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.840
BEFORE YOU'RE GONNA START MAKING
THE TORTILLAS,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.530
BUT AT MEDIUM HEAT.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.159
NOT HIGH HEAT, OR IT'S
GONNA BURN THE TORTILLA.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.170
WHEN YOU START SEEING
VERY, VERY LIGHT BUBBLES

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.000
POP UP ON THE SURFACE,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.700
AND ALSO, THE EDGES
START TO COME UP,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.720
THAT MEANS THAT YOU'VE CREATED
A CRUST IN THE BOTTOM.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.650
WHEN YOU MAKE TORTILLAS,
YOU DON'T ONLY FLIP ONCE,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.970
OR THEY WON'T FLUFF.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.310
YOU HAVE TO FLIP THEM TWICE.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.510
SO THE FIRST TIME,
IT WAS 30 SECONDS

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.620
THAT YOU WAITED.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.170
FOR THE SECOND FLIP,
YOU WAIT, LIKE, A MINUTE.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.730
BUT YOU HAVE TO MESS UP
A FEW TORTILLAS,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.170
BUT ONCE YOU NAIL IT DOWN,
YOU GOT IT.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.590
NOBODY CAN TAKE THAT
AWAY FROM YOU.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.370
SAYS ME,
PRAYING FOR THESE TO FLUFF.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.050
OK, SO I'M GONNA FLIP IT AGAIN.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.540
YES, AND NOW I'M GONNA
WHAT YOU CALL IN MEXICO

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.720
TEASE IT, WHICH MEANS...

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.300
YOU PRESS LIKE THIS...

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.890
FOR IT TO FLUFF.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.370
YOU CAN SEE IT FLUFF A LITTLE.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.800
OK, THIS IS PERFECT.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.800
SPRINKLE A LITTLE SALT.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.990
AND THIS IS WHAT
WE IN MEXICO CALL

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.770
A TAQUITO DE NADA,
A NOTHING TACO,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.000
AND IT IS ONE OF THE BEST
TACOS EVER.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.880
MMM.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.090
SEE HOW SOFT IT IS?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.440
MMM.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.150
FEW THINGS COMPARE, REALLY.
