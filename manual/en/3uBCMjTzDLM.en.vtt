00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.200
Before 1919, cars were sold for cash.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.110
That changes as a guy named John
Raskob comes to GM from DuPont

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.210
and begins to realize
that, in fact, there

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.740
needs to be a way to sell cars
to people who can't afford them.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.570
How do you sell into a saturated market?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.509
How do you sell to people who
don't have the cash on hand?

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.710
And so Raskob develops General Motors
Acceptance Corporation, or GMAC.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250
 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.770
It begins as a way at first to finance
wholesale credit to car dealerships--

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.370
those same dealerships that sold
two-wheeled carts for Durant.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.320
But it evolves into a way to
sell, give credit to consumers.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.020
And this expands GM's market
share throughout the 1920s.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.070
They rapidly and easily deploy this
credit to push not just cheap cars,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.610
but expensive cars.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.710
Part of Sloan's genius is realizing
that Americans by the 1920s

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.610
don't just want the cheapest car.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.870
They want the car that they want.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.390
And they're willing to pay more for
it, even if it means going into debt.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.590
And so what GM does is create
an evolution of price points

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.070
for its different brands.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.220
Where Ford focuses on making the Model
T cheaper and cheaper and cheaper,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.110
GM realizes that Americans
want different kinds of cars.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.430
While GM made all these
different kinds of cars

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.200
and developed new ways to sell them,
Ford focused just on the Model T.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.750
He never developed finance.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600
He never developed variety.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.550
Now the finance part in
particular is quite interesting

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.200
because it dovetails with
his anti-Semitic world views.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.390
Now for Ford, it was the Jews that were
behind all the failures of capitalism.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.030
That the Jewish bankers
of the East were parasites

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.230
on the American economy
that were destroying

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.920
his traditional view of the
mechanic-- of men who made things.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.820
Now he wasn't very
self-aware that in fact, it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.860
was his factory system that was
reducing men from versatile mechanics

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.900
to single-minded drones in a
factory that had terrible lives.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.920
But that aside, for
him the idea of the Jew

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.330
dovetailed with the idea of finance.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.460
And so as Ford grew, he didn't
rely on New York finance in the way

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.330
that either Alfred Sloan
or William Durant did.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.130
While GM set up GMAC to offer
credit to its customer base,

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.690
Ford instead-- and this
is kind of amazing to me

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.360
that anyone did this at all-- actually
set up savings plans at the Ford

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.910
dealerships, so that you could come
in and open up a savings account where

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.870
you could save for your Ford car.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.890
The Ford weekly purchase
plan would give you interest,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.140
only if you completed the
savings for the Ford plan.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.750
Now this is part of
an ideological program

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.680
that Ford had, a vision
of how America ought

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.530
to be rather than how America
was in an era of mass production.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.250
In 1927, Ford wrote that, "I sometimes
wonder if we have lost our buying sense

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.140
and fallen entirely under
the spell of salesmanship.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.020
The American of a generation
ago was a shrewd buyer.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.360
He knew values in terms
of utility and dollars.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.830
But nowadays the American people
seem to listen and be sold.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.960
That is, they do not buy.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.060
They are sold.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.430
Things are pushed on them.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.610
We have dotted lines for this,
that, and the other thing.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.260
All of them taking up
income before it is earned."

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.690
This whole system of selling
and credit was an anathema

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.170
to Ford's values, which were--
I think we might give him

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.440
a little credit-- rooted
less in antisemitism

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.810
or a particular kind of
antisemitism but also part

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.510
of a worldview that
privileged production

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.980
and skilled labor over a world of
consumption and de-skilled labor.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.300
By 1927, GM controls about half of
the American automobile industry.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.280
And Ford, which had basically invented
the American automobile industry,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.620
now controls only a fifth.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.420
By the end of the 1920s, Ford is almost
on the brink of going out of business,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.730
while GM is triumphant.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.630
And this is largely because of how
they differently thought about sales

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.460
and how they differently thought
about credit, and in the end,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.370
how they thought about what
the American consumer needed.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.590
In fact, Ford focused
too much of what he

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.440
thought they needed, whereas
Sloan focused on what they wanted.
