00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.970
Man: So I was going to do a card trick for
you guys.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.970
You guys want to see a card trick?

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.970
Children: Yeah.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.340
Man: But I don't, I don't have any cards.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.340
Oh!

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.340
You know what?

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.340
I'm a magician.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.170
So we'll just pull one right out of thin air.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.170
Do you guys like that?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.120
I'll tell you what, we'll take that card,
we'll take that same card here and we are

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.289
just going to make it disappear for a sec.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.300
Pretty cool, right?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Alright.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.499
We're going to teach you how to do that.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.499
You guys ready?

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:37.650
Alright, here is how you pull a card out of
thin air and make it disappear, just this

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.670
quickly.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.120
This move is actually a really cool move.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.710
It was popularized by a really, really old
school magician named Howard Thurston who

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.430
was like Houdini's big rival.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.399
Thurston actually learned this in New York
himself and he's the one who kind of made

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.399
this move popular.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.399
It is called the Back Palm.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.399
Alright.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.399
You guys have heard of palming, right?

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.870
You know where magicians, we palm things.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.780
This is called the Back Palm because we're
actually using the back of our hand to hide

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.899
the card.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.910
Right?

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.980
Just like that.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.170
Now, you probably wondering how I got it.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
Right?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.640
Well, I didn't let you know that I had it
from the beginning.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Right?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.530
So you didn't know what to expect.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.520
But when I bring my hand up here you can't
see it at all and the reason is it's pinched,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.159
right, it's pinched right here between my
pinky and my ring finger and then between

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.530
my index and my middle finger.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.160
Like so.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.670
Now, the way I conjure the card, right, the
way I pull it out of the air is I actually

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.710
retract these fingers.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.490
These two fingers, right, they curl in and
they go behind the card.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.270
So that all I have to do is, yeah, all I have
to do is flick it out just like that.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.270
Right?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.840
So I do that, and I do that.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.450
And that's how you make a card appear out
of nowhere.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.460
Now, to make it disappear, it's basically
the same motion but in reverse.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.460
Right?

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.100
I start here, three fingers on the back, thumb
right there.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.159
And what I do is as I curl these two fingers
in kind of like Spiderman doing the web slinging

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
thing.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.159
Right?

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.190
As I curl these fingers in I'm actually pinching
it with my pinky and my index.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.690
Maybe I can hold the card just like that.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.740
Right?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.030
So that all I am doing, right, from here it's
just that.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.160
It's really just that simple.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.060
This move requires a lot of practice.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.720
Go slow when you're starting out, you don't
need to do it fast.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720
Right?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.300
You guys know that.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.730
Practice makes perfect, you know, but practice
it slow so that you can get the hang of it.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.640
All you're doing is taking you're card, you're
making it disappear and you're bringing it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.659
right back.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.209
You want to add some flip, you know what's
really cool.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.540
You can take a card, right, and you can just
toss it into the air and you catch it as it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.540
falls.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.800
Pretty cool, right?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.120
And that's how you do the Back Palm.
