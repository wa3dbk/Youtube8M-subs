he he was interviewed and that's why he plans
on naming the album i'm gay especially considering

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:27.710
the fact that he is a heterosexual male who

there

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.360

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.380
the maybe can i get some of these days

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.320
idea morally bread

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.910
on the world a credit really understand what
he's receiving death threats now i mean really

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.390
why do you care about people people were giving
uh... or sending rebecca black

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.850
death threats because our friday song fiercely
people need to find something better to be

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.910
okay 'cause they just one issue death threats
to anyone that you know they fight even a

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.020
little questionable so dot by the story really
gets on my nerves but as far as giving him

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.010
credit let

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.490
i don't really know what his real reasons
are behind doing it part of me feels like

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.020
this has nothing to do with activism or it
has nothing to do with the political messages

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.600
just kind of trying to do it to stand up and
i'd never heard of them will be

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.439
uh... until this story so maybe this is his
way of grabbing a little publicity classes

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.150
at school explanation made absolutely no sense

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.069
how is this activism in anyway you're not
gauge you're heterosexual but you're pretending

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.279
like you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.969
instances using the word that we

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.059
eighteen pieces in the fifties

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.329
happy he went on with the same line of are
not uh... it's promote and activism is he

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.529
did this because of the sky

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.849
is this is really get them with place in

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.019
so my common citizenship

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.649
but on the it's i mean look images bring about
an open and people can see clearly how they

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.779
react tell word

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.399
you know how scary

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.409

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.740

women talk about it

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.659
these at people who get it should

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.459

editors who cares why does it bother you

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:39.409
litigation is so obvious to people who really
either bothered by is because it's personal
