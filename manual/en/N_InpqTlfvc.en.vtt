00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.410
and goes to wrap around has pulled in
and after eight received a lot of

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.980
criticism for promoting rate

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.010
now the print add after you shared a man
looking like he's trying to seduce a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.760
woman

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.410
and in texted said avoid the french zone
offer her a real drink and then

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.679
underneath it says we know good taste

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.759
uh... so the added questionnaire will
put it up in just a second

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.729
uh... has been taken down they're no
longer using it for commercial use i'm

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:31.439
wondering whether or not this could
really be interpreted as something that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.899
uh... encourages free

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.290
this is the word that leads and i said
before the friends on offer real drank

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.470
so the idea is you getting her more
drunk and that is

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.040
implies

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.560
you know that you want to be there and
she will be coherent enough to write

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.570
consent the fact that you can have
whatever you want like i won't have a

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.690
wonderful went through that because it
means he returns

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.130
on what i mean what me and i like what
you've been

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.420
exactly on by a real dream

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.010
with some real good it's a nice thing

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.490
with that info and she's thinking about
this guy isn't he spends money citizen

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.999
like that

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:09.499
instead of being is giving me champagne
with the realtor excelled yeah actually

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.580
when i first read the ad that's what i

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.990
initially thought out

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.990
uh... so it was a big is it could be
interpreted both ways which is why the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.370
company decided listen she acted baghdad
yet but they got he forced me into down

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.920
immediately this matter so but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
what's your take place as soon

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.190
then it meant like fire by her strong

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.080
does that mean towards suggesting rate

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.409
if it's if they art specifically saying
by your strong drink

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.729
then i think that it could be suggested
definitely yeah and i don't agree with

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.570
that at all

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.979
metallicity link on one of your own
statements so it is a picnic

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.440
so infused with the one that is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.620
incapacitated or anywhere near it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.500
indian going under if you don't have no
percent everybody agrees is freakin

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
poorly a million personal example

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.300
that's arts right

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.119
but the flip side to that it is it's not
really a flip side it's everyday

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.840
but that doesn't mean that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.810
you could ever by a woman who drank

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.129
or you can fire a strong drink

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.609
or that across this country or try to
get women drunk

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.559
twenty four seven

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.599
which they are

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.259
in the cold all that rate you never rest
like

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.289
and middle mum according to people in
the country

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.259
i mean it is not reality

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.669
dot

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.110
to look indefinitely suggests like

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.610
if you give her a strong drink then she
won't think straight and then you can

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.760
get her pants you know i mean like she
didn't know you guys have been treated

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.159
for

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.939
on this is not the right way to think
now is that ok like is it ok to

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.679
purposely get women drunk so you can get
into their pants when you know that if

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.109
she's not ranch is probably not going to
sleep with the india ideas of missus

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.319
only really controversy where i guess in

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.409
the year twenty thirty years to come
with a contraceptive say yes visit

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.329
part of getting drunk is twofold ok you
get drunk and hence you get the

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.139
confidence of proach when

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.009
you can save all you suck your loser you
should need that confidence

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.819
okay i know you you're better than
everybody else in

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.230
locate you got no prob

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.500
but a lot of guys do feel that need
bright now i didn't drink until i was

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.199
twenty two and i hope that with plenty
of women right

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.669
it was it easy for a couple of minutes
aper

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:19.520
i got drunk for the first night i got
drugged every strong

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.340
countries like the applauding temple

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.069
you've got to meet with one thing if the
woman is willing to play ball right and

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.799
i think in situations like that words
like i wanted john correct cell out

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.469
ordered the strong drink or he'll
offered the strong drink and know what

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.619
i'm getting myself into and i'll do it
right

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:39.099
but if you're like purposely going out
of your way to make sure that she gets

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.750
drunk but is you're going to try to
sleep late last night

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.050
that's i don't think that's right

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.290
okay now but european absurd scenarios
in which i think the course agree with

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.740
you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.030
if she's not willing to trade in your
focus if you drink on strong of course

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.800
that's wrong

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.989
it was slipping or things that somewhat
everybody no matter what i just think

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.799
that is looking for things

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.290
but if is the accent something like
twelve make sure you operate strip on

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.040
train in a nineteen

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.659
go natchez suggests

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.669
now turning to try to get the woman to
do something when she's a little legal

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:12.909
here in our region

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.709
yellow so this it is an important
decision

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.859
what i do you guess that if i was i
company would say no that's

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.910
that's not the right message we want to
send

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.529
and even if i was in the company has it
looked i'd pull that out that's not

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.310
the suffering way to go ok kisses to
suggest that

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.490
but is this is just that bal rate

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.699
activity well with the line

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.050
because then you could call that day

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.050
and like i said every frat party in the
country we should have a hundred squad

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.159
cars around it

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.020
as i can't believe the guys try to get
the growth of dick trong authorised

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.380
oversight

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.190
but then you can say hey shouldn't do
that i don't agree with that

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.870
but you can suggest it's a break

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.780
outlets the one that using capacity did
you go something yes our world its over

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.240
all these things in which case i'd come
in though it was on your side okay

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.970
that's fair that dot i agree with okay
so maybe it's not suggested of rate but

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.259
they're definitely like ethical issues
there

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.100
when you have an

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.350
at saying like make sure you get a
result because if you do increase your

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.820
chances of getting inteqnet like these
people are offended by that and of

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.509
course

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.879
they have all the right to be affected
by that

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.800
in this particular at the one that does
not take it down i've had no problem

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.350
with it

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.560
yes it could be made that interpreted

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.900
in two different ways

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.909
but i don't think that they meant it to
see my colleagues okay to rape women or

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.169
anything like that so i'm not a problem
with this act

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.919
well i do have a problem with make sure
you offer her a strong drink

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.139
you can be definitely consider a little
questionable
