00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.110
Communism was a totalitarian regime
so it demanded the whole human being.

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:13.415
It was a demand not to seize bodies,
but to seize souls,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.006
to take souls by force.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:21.427
Until 1989, there had been 
220 000 political prisoners in the whole Czechoslovakia.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:26.049
Everyone was scared, shaking, when 
"secret police officer" had been mentioned

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:27.439
or when one was summoned 
to secret police office.

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.997
There were 12 000 secret 
police officers.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.288
Monstrous apparatus had grown up.

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:37.974
Those people could not even stand; 
they were shaking;

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:40.040
they could not even sit down
as they were afraid.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.952
But even in the State police "betrayers" 
were found who refused to participate

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:42.694
in its dirty tricks.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:43.555
Bernard Jasko and Pavol Kalinaj.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:49.766
Three days after his arrest, Bernard Jasko
was most likely thrown out of a window.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:56.119
Pavol Kalinaj has never plead guilty, 
even at court.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.182
They "betrayed" because they delivered 
secret messages to people

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.335
who were in a risk of being prosecuted
by the State police.

00:00:58.335 --> 00:00:59.151
They were sentenced to death
and executed.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.106
They were hanged on February 17, 1951.

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:04.547
This is how I looked like just before 
his execution.

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:06.858
He has never seen me since then.

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:09.180
Even the bells rang that time, my God.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.642
Whole village was mourning after him.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:16.624
Cruel injustice! That I was instructed
how life looks like in the communism.

00:01:16.624 --> 00:01:19.932
Besides two death sentences, another 20
men were sentenced to 144 years in prison.

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.022
I bend down in front of these people 
with deep respect

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.631
because they were not 
in passive resistance

00:01:26.631 --> 00:01:30.857
but they fought the regime 
in its core.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:36.544
We may speak about them as the heroes
of the Third Resistance.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:52.410
New documentary movie - 22 heads - 
in premiere (2012).

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.312
I had about 500 dreams with Bernard Jasko.

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:59.377
Even now I dream about him:

00:01:59.377 --> 00:02:01.329
I cover him; 
I hide him.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.760
Don´t be afraid.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.715
They won´t catch you.
