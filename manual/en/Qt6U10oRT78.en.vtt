00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.050
So right now I'm going to show you how to
make a honey and egg facial mask.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.969
This is going to be great for anybody who
is interested in anti aging, even if you're

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.990
in your mid-twenties and you're worried about
anti aging, this is a great mask for you to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.990
use.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.699
So it's pretty simple.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.780
We are going to use one tablespoon of organic
yogurt, one egg white.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.730
I separated it off camera because it sometimes
can be a little bit tricky getting the yolk

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.730
out.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.950
And I'm going to do one tablespoon of warmed
honey.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.260
I like to use warmed just because I think
it's a little bit easier to work with when

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.629
it's a little bit warmed.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.579
It's a little bit looser in the bowl.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.710
And we're also going to use almond oil.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.130
Almond oil is an incredible ingredient for
the skin because it is anti aging, it's anti

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.949
inflammatory, but it's also very hydrating
for the skin.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:10.130
You really only need half a teaspoon of the
almond oil.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.900
Then I'm going to add my egg yolk to my honey
and my almond oil.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:33.010
And finally I'm going to add my yogurt to
the mix.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:44.270
So I like to use a fork when I'm blending
masks that have egg yolk in them just because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.080
I find it easier to use.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.920
You can use a whisk or whatever implement
you think is just easiest to blend everything

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.920
together, but you really want to make sure
that all the ingredients blend together properly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.310
so that your skin can get the benefit of everything
that you're using.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.189
And it just takes a minute.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.790
And so you just want to apply a thin layer
of everything.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.700
And if you've blended it properly, your skin
is really going to get the benefit of every

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640
ingredient that you put.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.569
So it's going to kind of a clear looking mask
once it's on the skin.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.870
The almond oil is hydrating, it's anti inflammatory,
and a really good anti aging ingredient.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.560
Egg white is actually really a clarifying,
which is why this mask is safe even if you're

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560
25 to 55.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.540
The yogurt is very soothing.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.790
It also has acidophilis in it, which is antibacterial.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.060
So if you do have a blemish on your face,
this mask will still take it away.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.130
And the honey is super hydrating.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.150
So all of those together kind of make the
perfect mask for anybody's skin.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.040
It's going to get rid of any pimples you have
on the face.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.909
It's going to be really anti aging and anti
inflammatory.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.350
And the result will just be a really beautiful,
glowing palate.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.349
Leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and rinse
with tepid water, which means not too hot

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.349
and not to cold.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.390
And you're going to look great.
