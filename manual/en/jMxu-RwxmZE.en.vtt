00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.540
How to Make Chicken Pot Pie. You need a little
more than a chicken and a pot to make this

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.079
pie, but this homey, comforting dish is worth
it. You will need 1 ½ lbs. boneless, skinless

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:22.359
chicken breast 1 stick unsalted butter ½
c. flour 4 c. chicken broth Salt and pepper

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:34.550
to taste 3 carrots, diced 1/2 c. sliced mushrooms
1/2 c. pearl onions 1/2 c. peas 2 sprigs rosemary

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:45.920
1 sheet frozen puff pastry Egg wash 13&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;
x 9&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; glass baking dish,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.850
buttered and whisk. Step 1. Poach the chicken
breast by putting it in a shallow pan filled

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.140
water and bringing it to a simmer over medium-high
heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.230
the chicken for 15 minutes. Drain the water.
When the chicken cools, shred the meat and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.800
set aside. Step 2. Melt the butter in a large
pot, and then whisk in the flour to form a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.011
roux. Slowly pour in the chicken broth, whisking
with your other hand the whole time. Simmer

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:20.360
on low heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
The cream sauce is ready when it looks like

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.120
cream of chicken soup. Step 3. Add the chicken,
salt and pepper, carrots, mushrooms, pearl

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.711
onions, peas, and rosemary. If you're using
fresh onions and peas, warm them in the microwave

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:37.580
together with two tablespoons of water in
microwave-safe dish. If you're using frozen,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.100
run them under cool water for two minutes.
Step 4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.450
Fill the baking dish three-quarters full with
the chicken cream sauce mixture. Cover the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.780
top of the dish with the pastry, pressing
the dough around the rim to seal. Trim the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.350
excess dough. Step 5. Brush the egg wash over
the pastry top. Bake for 30 minutes, or until

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.630
the pastry is puffy and golden. Did you know
Did you know? In 2006, Americans consumed

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.700
approximately 88 pounds of chicken per capita
– twice as much as they did in 1977.
