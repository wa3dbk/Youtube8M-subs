How to Compost Autumn Leaves.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.840
Composting autumn leaves requires a little
knowledge of chemistry and a little work.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.021
Recycling the leaves into new soil is a great
way to keep leaves out of the landfill, or

00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:17.640
leaf ash out of the air.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:27.630
You will need Autumn leaves Rake Lawn mower
Bag Compost pile and chemical balance.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.689
Step 1.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.369
Wait until the leaves have started to turn
brown before you rake them up.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.860
If you have a lawn mower or a leaf shredder,
shred the leaves before raking them.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
Both of these techniques help the leaves to
compost more quickly.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.860
Step 2.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.860
Place the leaves in a burlap bag and set it
near the compost pile.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.860
Step 3.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.770
Add a few handfuls of leaves from the bag
to the compost pile at a time.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.110
If you add too many at once, they mat together
and slow down the composting process.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.510
Step 4.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.740
Maintain a balance between carbon-rich and
nitrogen-rich materials in the compost pile.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.550
Brown leaves are rich in carbon.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.299
Kitchen scraps (not meat), fruit and vegetable
peelings, coffee grounds, and grass clippings

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:11.939
are rich in nitrogen.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.900
The nutrient-rich compost pile should consist
of two-thirds carbon-rich materials and one-third

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.340
nitrogen-rich materials.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.539
As nitrogen-rich materials are added to the
compost pile, toss a few leaves on top.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.560
Step 5.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.819
Build a 4-foot diameter by 3-foot high leaf-only
compost pile if you have too many leaves to

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.329
put in the main compost pile.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.229
Place a layer of soil between each foot of
leaves.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.109
Keep the pile damp, but covered so that it
does not become waterlogged.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.270
Leaf compost is best used as organic soil
amendment and conditioner rather than as nutrient-rich

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
compost.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.590
Did you know In fall, cork-like layers of
cells between the leaves and the stems in

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.799
deciduous trees block the production of the
green chlorophyll, making the leaves turn

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.180
yellow or red.
