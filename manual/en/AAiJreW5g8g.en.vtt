[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.890
I'm Neil Young, and this is
my fantastic model, Derek.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.102
And I want to take you
through some male grooming.

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:16.560
What I'm going to do is take
you through some really simple

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.280
steps to create a really
fresh, healthy complexion,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.790
but in an invisible way.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.790
So we're going to start
with a bit of skin care,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.198
because that's really
the key element to this.

00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:28.740
So I'm going to spread a little
bit of Fix Plus onto the skin

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.075
before I put on some emulsion.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:33.950
This is back Prep and
Prime Moisture Infuser,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.760
and it's an amazing product.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.300
It's a really
lightweight product.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.510
And I actually use it on
men because it kind of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.480
is a moisturizer.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.870
You don't need to put anything
too heavy on a man's game

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.318
because it has a lot of oil.

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.110
But what you need to
do is put water in it.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.860
So this is going to
put a lot of water in.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.000
So you just pump
it into the hand.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.500
You just rub it into your
fingers and get a bit of heat

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.960
into it, and that will activate
the ingredients in there.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.330
And it will really put a
lot of water into the skin

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.780
and plump out and pump
out the skin a little bit.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.880
One of my favorite rescue
products-- and this

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.760
is my go-to product
for guys because it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.470
an amazing texture.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.440
It's called Prep
and Prime BB Cream.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.780
And it's really important
when you're looking, as a man,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.430
at your own skin--

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.390
especially deeper skin tones,
like Derek's-- is that if you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.320
see different tones in the skin,
it's important that you use

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.750
different colors to respect
those different tones.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.690
Because unlike doing
makeup for women,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.290
a man can look really
artificial and really synthetic

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.110
if you completely unify his
skin from forehead to the chin

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.157
and he's too even.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:39.990
So it's really, really
important that if you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.867
see darker areas or deeper
tones on the forehead,

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:44.700
you use something a
little bit deeper there.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.992
So I'm going to use two shades.

00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:48.143
Let's use Dark and Deep Dark.

00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:50.060
So I'm going to use a
little bit of the darker

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.480
one over the forehead.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.875
I'm going to work it
all over the areas--

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.750
all over the face,
really-- probably avoiding

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.542
any part of the face
which has a little bit

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.020
of stubble or facial hair.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.840
This is a great texture.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.090
It's kind of a light emulsion,
like a creamy texture.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.030
But what it's going to do is it
has optical diffusers and oil

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.660
absorber, so it's going
to mattify the skin.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.140
Now, one of the
things I want to do

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.473
is just really go into a
little bit of concealer,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:22.890
because if you
have got a blemish,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.030
you do want to be
able to conceal it.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.910
So I'm using an amazing product.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.823
This is a Pro Palette.

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:30.240
The great thing
about this palette

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.030
is there's lots
of different tones

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.067
and undertones of concealer.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.900
And so what's great
about this, particularly

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.775
when you're working on
deeper skin tones that

00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:42.120
has many more natural
undertones and different tones

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.460
across the skin, it enables
you to customize the concealer.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:46.950
I am using a brush
because I think

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.950
it gives you slightly
more precise application.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.810
I mean, you can use your finger.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.390
I often think that men aren't
as delicate as women are,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.140
and they can be a
little bit heavy handed.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.870
So the idea is that
it looks invisible.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.932
So if you've got just
the one tool that's

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:01.890
going to give you a really
precise application,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.460
I think it's worth investing in.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.590
So this is a little 242 brush.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.128
Now, when you're looking
at men's eyes, the tone

00:03:10.128 --> 00:03:11.670
around the eye, it's
really important

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.490
that you don't conceal an
eye area in the same way

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.592
that you would a woman's eye.

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:19.050
Most women want to brighten
and lighten and around the eye,

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.520
but that obviously
can look really

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.965
synthetic and artificial looking
and very makeuppy on a guy.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.340
So it's really important that
you leave that natural skin

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.320
tone under the lashes.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.400
So when I'm going to
use a bit of concealer,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.520
I'm taking a couple
of these shades.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.010
So I'm just going
to work it just

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.892
into this deeper
undertone of his eye area,

00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:40.350
and then just blend
with my finger.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.670
And I think the next
thing to do is just

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.920
pop a little bit of powder on.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.500
So I'm going to use one
of my favorite products.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.688
What it does is it has sheen
to it, so it doesn't look flat.

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.480
And the worst thing
you could do with a man

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.970
is to be too flat and
too powdery looking.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.600
too chalky.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.220
So I'll use a big brush.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.720
And I'm just going
to work this just

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.970
over the middle of the face.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.230
So, nothing technical
about this big brush.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.420
Just work it all over the skin.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.462
And that will just give him
a nice, really natural matte.

00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:16.670
You don't want it to be flat.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.690
It needs to be natural.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.709
Sheen is really good.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.070
It means healthy skin.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.208
No one is completely matte.

00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:23.500
When you look at someone
skin, it looks really healthy,

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.710
there's always a nice,
natural sheen to it.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.710
And I think that was it.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.460
And I'm going to finish with
just a little bit of brow gel

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.780
just to groom the brows.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.570
This is optional.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.520
You don't always
have to do that.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.700
But if you've got thicker
brows, or unruly brows,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.420
it's probably a good idea
just to groom them into place.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.338
And there you go.

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:42.880
Look at that.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.295
Invisible grooming.

00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:45.170
Doesn't he look good?

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.680
Looks good.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.400
Do you feel good?

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.145
I feel great.

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:48.020
Mission accomplished.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.370
