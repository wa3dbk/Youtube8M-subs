CES 2009

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.700
Here we are, we're at the Sony booth at CES 2009,
and they're showing off some really cool stuff.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.170
One of these being 
the new Walkman W series,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.270
is this the W series that we'reholding right now?
-Exactly, right here.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.800
You're caught up 
in your music experience, 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.900
not caught up in any wires.
You know, you go to go the gym,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.400
you get caught up 
in the treadmill,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.700
and you're not looking too cool like that.
- Right.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.430
-So, what this allows you to do,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.960
you just put it on,
and you wear it like that.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.400
And  there is nothing else?
All the music and all the controls

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100
are right there.
- 3 GB internal memory.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.170
Windows media player,
just drag and drop like we have

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.930
in previous models. 
-Ok.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.570
Volume, it's got a shuffle feature right there. 
So, you go through that 2 gig

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.900
and you just want to mix it up...
-Very nice. 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.530
You're good to go.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.470
Fast forward, pause
play, power, on and off.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.230
It's got a great feature called "Zapping",
so if you buy a new CD,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.570
because you heard a great song on the radio,
if you've got the track listing,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.330
you can go through and basically zap
through certain sections of the songs

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.300
in certain increments of time.
-Oh cool! 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.030
So you get to the meat
 and potatoes of the song,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.300
like, "yeah, that was
 a double kick drum I remember".

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.000
So, you can skip past 
the boring intro if you want

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.060
and get right to
where you want to be.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.140
You hit the button, it starts 
the song from the beginning.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.470
Very cool. And now, how are these held
 together? I saw you break it apart.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.940
Are these magnets in here?
-It's a magnet, so it kind of acts

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.200
as a background... 
-OK.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.770
-So, you know, if it's in a bag, 
if it's free floating 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.300
eventually it will lose its form.
- Right.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.400
But the magnet is kept like that.
Then you have your docking station charger.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.560
You know, the charger right here.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.300
How much is something 
like this going to run us?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.770
You're looking about a $70 price point,
coming out in spring.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.370
Very nice, thank you very much.
