Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and in today’s PcT Mini Tute, we

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.710
are talking about Polymer Clay color mixing
and specifically, color saturation.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.110
Now, as you’re learning more about Polymer
Clay color mixing, one of the things that

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.289
you’re gonna need to keep in mind is the
strength of the color.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.460
Now, not all colors in polymer clay are equal,
some are stronger, some are weaker, this is

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.579
really similar to color mixing when you’re
working with things like acrylic paints and

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.039
oil paints and water colors and things, and
I don’t know if they’re actually using

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.269
pigment based…

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.780
I mean earth based, pigment colors in polymer
clay.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.129
But it is…the Premo line of polymer clay,
they are using the same kind of color palette

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.519
as the artist’s palette in the art… painting
line, and Premo specifically has lots of different

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.320
colors, and they’re based on the artist’s
palette, and I’m gonna talk today, first

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.181
about Blue, now, I’ve got two colors of
Blue here, one is Ultramarine Blue and I’ve

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.930
got Cobalt Blue.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.250
Ultramarine is on the cool side, it’s a
lit...which means it’s a little bit closer

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.620
to the Purple on the color wheel, and Cobalt
Blue is on the warm side which means it’s

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.980
a little closer to the Green on the color
wheel.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:45.590
But, as you look at these two colors here,
you may just think that the Ultramarine Blue…

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.710
because it’s darker, you may just think
that it is a stronger color than the Cobalt

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.220
Blue which is obviously a lot lighter, and
in this particular case, the opposite is true,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.300
now, I’ll show you how to prove that.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.230
Now I’ve got…I’ve rolled out a little
bit of the Ultramarine Blue and a little bit

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.009
of the Cobalt Blue, and I’m going to take
a little cookie cutter here and cut out equal

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.099
parts of these two colors and mix them together,
now when I do this, we get an idea of what

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.019
a 50-50 mix of the color would be, now I would
keep blending this for a little bit until

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.909
it was really thoroughly mixed, I’ve got
one here that’s already been mixed, Now,

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:39.459
if I take this 50-50 mix and lay it up on
top of the Ultramarine Blue, you can see…or

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.849
hopefully the camera picks this up nicely,
you can see that there’s quite a color contrast

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:52.340
between the two Blues, the mixed and the Ultramarine,
when I lay this same mix on top of the Cobalt

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.340
Blue, they’re… that difference isn’t
as obvious, it’s a bit different, you can

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.360
see it’s a little bit...got a little bit
more Purple in it, but the color differences

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.389
are not very strong.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:13.279
Which means that basically, visually, between
the two here, it’s not really a 50-50 mix,

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:18.469
it’s more like a three quarter, two parts
of this and one part of this.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:25.560
I’ll show you another mix, I’ve done two
parts of the Ultramarine and one part of the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:34.579
Cobalt Blue, and this laying up against the
Ultramarine, has some contrast, as well as

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:42.639
it has some contrast against the Cobalt Blue,
so this actually…even though it’s not

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:50.540
technically a 50-50 mix physically, visually,
it is, it’s basically the middle part between

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.529
these two colors, because you can see enough
of a contrast between the two of them.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:02.689
So what… in actuality, even though this
color here, the Ultramarine Blue, looks like

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:09.069
it’s about twice as strong in strength as
the Cobalt Blue, it’s actually half the

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:16.389
strength, because it took the two parts of
the Ultramarine to the one part of the Cobalt

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.040
to make a 50-50 visual mix.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.940
So, I hope that’s making sense to you, it
means that when you go to make your color

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.040
recipes…you’re going to mix something
together, you can be a little less stingy

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.290
with the Ultramarine, and you need to be a
little more careful with the Cobalt when you’re

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.470
mixing it, because you make it a different
color than what you’re expecting.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:46.480
Just because it’s visually dark, doesn’t
mean it’s visually strong...I mean physically

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.480
a strong color, and that’s just because
of the pigment levels that are in these particular

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.450
formulas for these particular clays.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.450
And that will be true for a lot of the other
clays, you’ll find some of the colors are

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.560
strong and some are weak, and you’ll get
to know that if you play with these 50-50

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.100
mixes and look at them against each other.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.250
So I hope you learned something from that,
if you did, please press that like button

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.340
we’d really appreciate it.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.510
And my question for you today is, were you
aware that there was different color saturations

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.150
in polymer clay?

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.370
And would you like to learn more about color
mixing in future videos?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.690
Please leave those answers in the comment
section below we’d love to hear from you.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.990
And also, please subscribe to our channel,
