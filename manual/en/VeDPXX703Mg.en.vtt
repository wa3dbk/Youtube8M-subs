da Vinci 1.0 - Extruder Module Replacement

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.200
To allow da Vinci 1.0 use PLA filaments

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.900
Please replace the extruder and ensure that different materials are printed using their own extruder modules

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Before replacing the extruder, please first unload the filament within the old extruder

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.300
Once the filament has been removed, switch off the power and pull out the power plug

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.600
Cut the cable ties on the extruder module

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Unplug all heating wires

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.500
Gently press the lock to remove the extruder module.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.100
Install the new extruder module

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.400
The two cables provided with the box have different connector sizes

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:25.300
The bigger connector should be plugged to the extruder

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.200
Use cable ties or insulated tape to secure the new cables above the extruder module

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.900
Please ensure that the connection section of the white cable is fully secured to prevent them from coming loose.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:54.800
Insert the organized cables through the cable guiding holes of the printer chassis.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.400
Follow the original cables and guide the new cables to the back of the printer.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
Remove the rear cover of the printer to continue the process of cable replacement.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.000
Use a T10 star screwdriver to open the rear cover.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.300
Unscrew the two star screws from the rear cover.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.000
Remove the rear cover

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
Take the two cables that have been inserted through the guide hole

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:33.600
Follow the on-screen instructions to replace the original cables at the two ports

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.500
You do not have to remove the old cables as they will not influence printing

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:53.800
After connecting the cables, please move the extruder module to the farthest end to ensure that the cables do not obstruct its movement

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.700
Cut away the unnecessary parts of the cable tie to ensure smooth printing operations

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.600
Reinstall the rear cover to complete the printer extruder replacement process

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.600
After replacement, please initiate the calibration process

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200
and register your printer

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.200
When you are printing with PLA for the first time, the software will remind you to register the newly installed extruder module

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:39.200
Follow the software instructions and install the update package

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:53.700
The update package must be fully decompressed to the desktop to run

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:01.700
Open the update package. Please follow the instructions and close XYZware.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.600
When updating, please ensure that your computer is connected to the Internet to complete the update.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
During updating, you will be required to enter the print module serial number to finish registration

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.100
The serial number is provided on the label at the bottom of the packaging box.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.000
Verify that you have entered the serial number correctly to continue the update process

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.900
The printer will then automatically perform a series of calibration and updates

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Do not switch off the printer's power and ensure that the computer remains connected to the Internet

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.500
Once the update is complete

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.000
Congratulations, you have successfully replaced your extruder module.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.400
You can initiate yet another series of wonderful printing experiences!
