00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.959
Over the last decade we've seen standard placing
wildfires that are uncharacteristic of their

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:18.959
historic fire regime moving across the landscape
and the y continue to get larger and larger

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.990
as the years go buy.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.449
Fires are a very useful tool and here in the
Pacific Northwest especially on the east of

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.980
the Cascade Mountains, those forests over there
are fire-adapted forests.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.980
It's a very visual experience; I mean you
see the change instantly.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.350
We really need to think about its habitat
on the landscape and maybe creating

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.350
fire sheds. You know, these are really creating
a home for fire.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.280
The more you mess with fire, the more bases
you better have covered.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:17.359
Part of my fascination with fire is tied to
that scale issue you have, because at that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:24.229
small scale, fire is imminently predictable.
But at that largest scale, fire is ultimately

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.229
unpredictable. We really have no idea in that
it makes it magical.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.509
To me fire is like water, it's like oxygen,
its like soil, it's like microbes in the soil.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.490
Its part of the whole picture. Its part of
the whole environment.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.229
I think that it is a true benefit that the
College of Forestry is now offering a complete

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.869
fire science curriculum. I think it will help
guide and engage the students in what they

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.649
need to know.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.889
We now have multiple perspectives in one house
that are all very strong programs and we can

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:10.590
work together to really look at how we transition
into this future where fire becomes a part

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.090
of how we live, part of what we do, part of
our pubic acceptance.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.390
I mean- some of these fires that we've been
at are thousands and thousands of acres and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.580
its not that they're gone, it's that they've
been instantly transformed.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.580
If we don't have the ability to understand
fire and its effects on landscape, then we

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.590
aren't able to treat the landscape in an economically
feasible way, or an ecologically appropriate

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.629
way. I think the Fire Science program is very
important.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.629
I can come out here and years from now I will
be able to reference what I've seen and learned

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.730
out here.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.079
We can give them concepts in the classroom,
but until you actually place it on the landscape,

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.390
you never really understand fully how those
concepts fit into this bigger picture in the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.640
forest.
