My objective was never to become the best player in the world

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.200
But I'm very glad of being considered as one of the greatest

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.060
I want to do my job, I want to represent the brazilian team

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.260
I want to win titles and I hope everything works out right

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.720
Lucas, you can already speak japanese, right?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.140
Each one of you has to learn a new language, ok? I will learn english, what about you, Gil?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.620
Spanish

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.360
No!

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.220
Joclécio should learn portuguese!

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.380
Yeah! Joclécio should learn portuguese!

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060
Is my necessaire there?

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.840
It's in the baggage!

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.680
I just spoke with Duda and he said that he'll probably be at the hotel at 8h

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.460
I'll give you the hotel's name and then you can ask the president to meet him at 8:00 PM. Ok?
