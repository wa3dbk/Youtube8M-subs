00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.560
Hello friends, I am going to show you how
to  refill

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.490
HP 678 black ink jet cartridge. Here I
have taken the cartridge and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.950
the ink for refilling and this is SUCTION TOOL and this is syringe

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.460
that is 2.5 ml syringe

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.470
Here I have taken this cartridge

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.060
you can see that there are five
holes in this cartridge

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.810
these holes, you can use any of these holes for refilling this cartridge

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.180
remember that this is a large cartridge

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.679
that is why you can use all these holes

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.719
if it was a small cartridge like

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.829
HP  802 you cannot use all these
holes

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.909
but in this case you can use all
these holes

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.979
now I will take the ink

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
this is 2.5ml syringe

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.159
and one more thing you have to remember that
as it is large

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.639
cartridge you can

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.050
you can put more ink into it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.250
I'm going to put about 5

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.250
to 7.5 ml of Ink

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.560
here I am

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.180
inserting 5 ml of ink. I am using different holes to insert this ink because

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.100
as the you use many holes

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.570
the in get distributed evenly or throughout the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.350
cartridge equally. I have inserted almost

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.869
5ml, now I am inserting

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.200
another one. This will add up into

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.890
7.5 ml. Now I am using another hole

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.720
for refilling. Use various holes

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.959
as you can. I have inserted 7.5ml of ink.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.410
Now this is enough and now I am going to
use the suction tool.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.930
The purpose of suction tool is to bring the ink into this nozzle.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.489
because and the ink I have inserted in
this cartridge

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.120
is not come till  now into this nozzle
and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.840
the print will not be smooth. That's why I am using SUCTION TOOL.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.560
here is the whole for suction tool and I
am inserting this

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.890
syringe without this needle to absorb

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.290
few amount say 0.5ml

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.310
of Ink.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.310
The Ink is not coming

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.409
You can see few amount of ink has come.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:13.680
into the nozzle. Let's find out. You can see a smooth

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.200
strip of line.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.799
you can see this line. If you get

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.560
this kind of line of Ink you have to
understand that

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.049
the cartridge is refilled properly
and now it can be used for the refilling:

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.819
now it is large cartridge it can almost print almost

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.010
150 to 200 pages- A4 pages

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.180
of printer

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.260
this is SUCTION TOOL , it is very necessary , because it helps the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.329
helps to bring the ink into these
nozzle

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.919
always use branded ink like Prodot or Desmat or Japanio

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.579
never use the chinese or local market ink

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.049
you can buy this Tool

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.319
