00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.000
What's going on everybody! My name is Jack Jenkins 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.030
and this is Academy of One. 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.160
Today I'm gonna be talking about elementary number 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.250
theory and more number identities. 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.340
In this video, I'm gonna be refreshing 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.380
your memory. Then I'm gonna be talking

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.500
about rational and irrational numbers.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.570
And lastly, I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.740
complex and imaginary numbers.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.830
[Music]

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.900
[Music]. The natural

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.080
numbers are all positive numbers.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.180
For instance, one, two three

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220
centra. The whole numbers are

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.340
all the natural numbers plus zero.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.340
The integers are all negative numbers, zero

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.350
and positive numbers. And the real numbers

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.460
are all numbers that are not imaginary 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.510
and that are not positive or negative

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.650
infinity. For more information on this, go ahead

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.740
and watch the video on number identities. It will 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.790
provide more information for you. [Music]

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.960
[Music]

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.000
[Music]. The rational

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.170
numbers are all numbers that can be written as

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
a ratio. Notice the first five

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.220
letters of that word. Rational, ratio. 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.230
That's how I remember it. For instance

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270
is two a rational number.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.430
Of course it is. You can write 2 as 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.520
2 over one. How about point 1.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.560
yup. You can write that as one over

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.680
ten. How about let's say... 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.750
pie. No, 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.900
pie is not a rational number, because 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.020
a first of all, it's a constant, and b you

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.030
can't really write that as a fraction. The closest

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.160
you can get is twenty-two over seven. And that's not

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.260
really... it's not really pie

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.350
so you can't. As you can guess, an 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.370
irrational number is a number that can not be 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.500
written as a ratio. For instance, 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.510
let's take the square root of five

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.680
is that a rational number or an irrational 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.680
number, sorry. It is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.720
it is! Because you can not write

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.840
that perfectly. The square root of five

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.920
equals 2.333333

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.930
33 and it countries on forever. You can not write that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.050
as a ratio. 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.090
How about 64 or the square root of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.220
sixty-four. It is not irrational. 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.300
Because the square root of 64 is eight and you can write

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.330
eight as eight over one. How about 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.440
pie. Of course it is. Because

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.500
it can't be written as a ratio as we talked about last slide

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.660
it is an irrational number. 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.670
And pie is equal to 3.1415

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.730
9 and it continues on forever.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.840
[Music]

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.870
[Music]

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.970
A complex number, remember

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.970
is a number that has both real and 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.090
imaginary parts. 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.160
Go back and watch the imaginary video in the college

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.170
algebra series. So, let's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.280
take two i is that imaginary. Yup.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.320
How about seven times the square root

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.470
of negative one. We'll I equals

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.540
negative one so of course this is imaginary. 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.550
How about 789.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.660
That has the real part but it doesn't have the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.730
imaginary part. So it is not considered a 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.820
complex number. That's it for today's tutorial

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.830
on number Identities. Tune in 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.950
next time for when I'm gonna be talking about mathematical

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.990
elements and there inverse. 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.140
Alright, time for the plugs. You can go ahead

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.230
and visit academyofone.org for more information 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.250
on all our videos as we'll as to download the sides

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.360
and comment on the videos. You can go 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.380
ahead and email me at jack@academyofone.org.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.550
jack@academyofone.org if you have any questions. And I'll answer

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.650
them either in the conclusion video at the end

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.700
or I'll answer them in the Q&amp;A. 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.840
Just remember to email me

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.920
with the subject line of elementary number theory.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.930
That way I can sort it easier. 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.060
Third is don't forget to subscribe to the youtube channel

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.100
and lastly, don't forget to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.260
donate cause donating will help us produce better

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.270
quality videos. Alright, so have a great

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.360
day. [Music]
