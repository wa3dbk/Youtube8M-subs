00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.340
Crohn's disease is one of two chronic inflammatory
bowel diseases.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.200
Usually, the immune system helps you fight
off infections, in inflammatory bowel disease,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.500
it attacks the digestive tract, and causes
inflammation. And, what happens is, is that

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.039
your body is unable to get rid of the bacteria
and viruses that are helping with the inflammation.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.429
Basically, your immune system never turns
off. And because it doesn't turn off, you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.439
perpetuate inflammation in the gut and form
ulcerations in the gut.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.510
The chronic inflammation is what leads to
symptoms in Crohn's disease. The most common

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.010
presenting symptoms are abdominal pain and
diarrhea. Other symptoms that patients may

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.010
get is weight loss, appetite loss, fevers,
chills, fatigue, anemia.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.219
Crohn's disease can also manifest in other
parts of the body. Symptoms that can occur

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.500
in other organs include joint pains, joint
stiffness, eye pain, eye redness, skin lesions.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.980
People can get mouth ulcers as well as liver
problems.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.810
So, Crohn's disease primarily affects people
in their twenty's and again, in their fifty's.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.310
It affects nearly one to two million Americans
in the United States, and there's ten thousand

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.509
new cases per year.

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.049
Many of the patients have a family history
of Crohn's disease, or they may have family

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.210
history of other autoimmune diseases.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.329
There are also, environmental factors involved
with the development of Crohn's disease, and

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.229
those include, infections, non-steroidal and
anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen,

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.740
stress, antibiotics, and so, some of these
things we can control, which may prevent triggering

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.990
of the disease.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.240
We're able to make an accurate diagnosis with
the history and physical exam, endoscopy with

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.500
biopsies, lab tests, and imaging tests.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.049
There are three clinical patterns of Crohn's
disease: inflammatory stricturing, fistulizing

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.780
disease, and micro-perforations.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.799
Treatment options for Crohn's disease fall
in three basic categories. Anti-inflammatory

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.649
medications, immunomodulating medications,
and then we have the newer biologic agents.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.620
Steroids are very effective and work very
quickly, but, of course, it does come with

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.030
side effects.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.690
Surgery may be effective and necessary in
some cases. The problem is that Crohn's disease

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.280
can come back. It is appropriate in certain
situations, especially if you develop a complication.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.610
It's important for doctors to individualize
their treatment for each patient, and, our

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.860
Stanford Inflammatory Bowel Disease program
does that. We have goals and management. And,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.860
those are to get people in remission quickly,
maintain them in steroid free remission, avoid

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.230
complications, hospitalizations and improve
their overall quality of life.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.340
Having a multi-disciplinary approach to this
complex disease is very important.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.580
We involve our dedicated gastroenterologists,
colorectal surgeons, pathologists, radiologists,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.480
dermatologists, dieticians, as well as rheumatologists,
to help get the best care to our patients.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.830
Additionally, we collaborate very closely
with basic scientists so that we can bring

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.940
newer therapies to the bedside.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.940
It would be great in the future if we would
be able to target therapies to certain parts

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.290
of the gut. Also, be able to predict who's
going to respond to which therapy so we don't,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.820
use time, money, and the patient's quality
of life that's wasted on these sort of things.,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.060
we are doing some of that research at Stanford,
and, we're hoping to develop newer therapies

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.050
that are safer, as well.
