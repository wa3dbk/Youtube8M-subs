Hi!
This is the complete video of painting a commissioned

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.750
portrait from start to the finish of the painting.
The size of the canvas is 24 by 30 inches.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:28.670
The commissioner had some requests after the
first sketch I did on the painting so that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.150
I had to make them directly on the canvas.
After these changes on the drawing, I started

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.789
making a sort of underpainting using burnt
sienna.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.789
Then, I started to work at the left woman
face when, I remembered that the color of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:01:01.319
the background have a big influence on the
main painting subject, especially on portraits.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.010
A greenish background gives a more reddish
hue to the skin and also, a reddish background

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.240
turn the skin to green.
So that, I painted a first green layer of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.350
color over the background as I intended to
paint a forest edge.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.429
I used Sap Green and cerulean blue.

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:37.429
Well, I continued to paint the skin , using
the wet in wet oil painting technique, but

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.990
more as a base for the future glazing color
layers than a final look of it.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.399
I painted the red dress of the left women
using a painting technique about I read in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.439
an old book "The secret of the Old Masters"
by Albert Abendische.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.979
According to this technique, painting of a
red fabric must start with light hues of red

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.810
then continuing with glazes of deep red hues.
The last layer of glaze over a red fabric

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.030
consists of white accents for lights and dark
reds or even ivory black for shadows.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.760
As you can see yourself, the background is
a forest edge.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.760
I was inspired for doing it by a William Bouguereau
background painting.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.770
I don't know the title of the painting but
it's a girl in the front of a forest edge.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.380
The forest is pretty impressionistic done,
quite loose in details.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.100
The champagne glasses are painted with semi
transparent colors and few accents of white.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.570
Well, we don't depict the glass itself. We
paint the light reflections and the things

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.220
behind the glass as they looks through it.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.220
The 
white dress is done mostly wet in wet or alla
prima painting technique.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.460
Dresses on this painting are the same as those
on the reference picture and this was a specific

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.970
request not changing them.

You 
may see that the commissioner wanted an almost

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.090
completely different look of the characters.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:34.880
