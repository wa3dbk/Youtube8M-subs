Hi I'm Sophie and welcome to my world

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.180
the other day i was chatting with some
of my co-workers about the holidays and

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.180
I was kind of taken back to discover how
many of them don't know how to wrap a

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.049
present

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
so I love wrapping presents and I
thought that I'd share with you my easy

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.480
techniques for wrapping a simple box
present

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.929
so here we go so what you're going to
need to wrap your present is a present

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
I've got a nice little box here you're
gonna need some tape

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.480
you need a pair of scissors and of
course you're going to need some

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.410
wrapping paper

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.570
now the first thing that you're going to
want to do is you're going to want to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.829
measure out your wrapping paper as a
couple ways to do this some people like

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.300
to use lots of wrapping paper

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
I mean so if i was going to do that i
could measure it this way but i'm going

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
to end up with a lot of extra here so
i'm going to actually wrap this present

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.670
this way

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.609
so line it up at the end flip it up and
over and I clearly have enough

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.850
wrapping paper to cover the end so
that's great and i just want to fold up

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.430
on the side here now I don't need quite
that much you need about enough that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
would go at least past halfway so i
usually try to make it so that goes

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.570
about three quarters of the way and then
on the other side i'm going to eyeball

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.549
it and I'm gonna say cut it about here
so I'm just going to cut my paper

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.600
and then
center my box right in the center

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.930
now i'm one of those people that likes
to fold over her ends because that way

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.400
if I've got any ragged edges from
cutting that will make sure that that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.560
goes away so you fold over my ends and
fold it up and fold the other end up to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.200
meet it and then I'm just going to take
one piece of tape and place that right

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.270
in the center

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.090
now i'm going to take the edge here and
you see how there's this empty space in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.190
here what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to take the edge

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm going to crease it along the top
part of the box and as I do that you're

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.790
going to see that these little triangles
form so i put my finger down there and I

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.550
create a triangle here creates the
triangle there now I'm going to take my

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.570
edge here

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.750
my edge of my triangle and i'm just
going to push it in almost like a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.950
hospital corner and i'm just going to
crease that edge there crease that

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.239
edge right next to the box and once
again i'm going to do the same thing I'm

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.200
just pushing my finger in at that edge
creasing it here

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.190
creasing it down there I'm going to get
myself a little piece of tape set and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.440
ready just going to fold this up and I'm
gonna put a piece of tape right in the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.079
center most people are surprised to
find out that it actually only takes three

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.560
pieces of tape to wrap the present one
on the top one on either side

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.480
that's really all you need okay once
again i crease the top made my

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.810
triangles fold it in and fold it in you
end up with like a little parallelogram

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.850
there take my little piece of tape

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.850
tape it right there

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.380
and there you have it a beautifully
wrapped package that about wraps it

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.600
