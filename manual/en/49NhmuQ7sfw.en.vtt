Hi, this is Luke Abell with GuideMyJailbreak.com.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.200
And in this video, I'm going to be showing you how to jailbreak your

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.140
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch firmware 5.1.1.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.260
This jailbreak is untethered, so it's a full jailbreak

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.400
and you'll be able to use Cydia and all that great stuff.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.990
Since you're on YouTube, you're going to need to go to GuideMyJailbreak.com

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200
to get all the download links you'll need for this video.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.300
So let's get started.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.620
Okay, step 1 is to open up Absinthe, and I'll show you how to do that on Windows first.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.200
If you have Mac, skip ahead 30 seconds.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.700
Okay, so let's go ahead and scroll down to those download links.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.700
Click on Absinthe for Windows.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.400
Click on 'Open'.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.790
I'm using Windows 7 so it may look a little bit different if you're using Windows Vista or Windows XP

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.000
But it's generally the same.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.600
Double click on that and click on 'Extract All'.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.800
I need to go ahead and browse to my desktop to make it easy.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.800
Click 'Extract'.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.800
Click 'Yes' if this pops up.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.300
And double click on that Absinthe icon on your desktop.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.800
Click 'Run'.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200
And it'll do some extracting.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
And when it's done, you should see a new folder on your desktop.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.590
Double click on that. And then double click on Absinthe.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500
And you're ready to go.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.909
Just go ahead and skip past the Mac part to the actual jailbreak part.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.920
Okay, for Mac users, go ahead and scroll down to the download links.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.500
Yours is much easier than Windows.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.800
Click on Absinthe for Mac.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.990
Go ahead and go to Finder. Go to your Downloads.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.630
And double click on absinthe.mac.dmg.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.900
And then double click on Absinthe. That's it.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.500
Now you're ready to jailbreak.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.939
Okay, so this part's for Mac and Windows. This is the next step.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.020
Go ahead and plug in your device and click on that Jailbreak button.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.100
I'm going to show you what the screen looks like.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.400
I'm going to speed it up a bunch so you don't have to watch the whole jailbreak process.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.810
I'll show you the iPod Touch screen that I'm using

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.759
and also the screen on my computer so you can see exactly what's going to happen.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.000
So this is what it'll look like.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.000
When it's finished, it'll say 'Done. Enjoy.'

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.240
One thing to note is if you do have a problem at it saying

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.400
'Unplug to Retry', and you retry, it's not working

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
Go ahead and do a fresh restore in iTunes.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.630
Open up iTunes, click that Restore button and make sure you back up your stuff

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.920
And then try again and use this process and you should be good to go.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.500
Assuming it did work, let's move on to the next step.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000
Slide to Unlock and tap on Cydia.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.500
Wait for it to prepare the file system. It'll exit when it's finished.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.500
Go ahead and slide to unlock again.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.700
Tap on Cydia once more.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.600
You're a user so tap on User. And then Done.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.900
Once you've reached this step, you're finished jailbreaking your phone

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.900
iPad or iPod Touch. Go ahead and install the great apps and click on that Learn More button below

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.350
to learn more about Cydia.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.620
