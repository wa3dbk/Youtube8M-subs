00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.130
Hi, I'm Tim Gibson and I'm going to show you
how to measure for carpet. Now there's two

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.010
type of things we get into when we're measuring
for carpet, that is in this case we have a

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.530
standard carpet that is a wall to wall type
of carpet. So in this case we're going to

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.660
measure the width and we'll look at this landing
area. If I measure this landing area, I'm

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.260
going to measure from the base of this stair
to the baseboard and I get 40 inches. Now

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.420
actually what we're going to do when we install
our carpet and I'll show you on this spare

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:51.579
piece, is that we'll actually are going to
fold an inch of this carpet over when we install

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.659
it. So as you can see that on the profile,
that's actually how it installs with an inch

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.229
of that rolled over. That goes into your pull
or is stapled in. That makes sure we have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.580
a nice finished edge on our carpet. So with
that in mind, when I measured that width,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.720
I need to add two inches to that width, to
the measurement, and that's the actual width

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.950
of the carpet that I need to carpet this area.
Now the second instance we run into is when

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.520
we have wood stairs that we want to run a
carpet runner down. In that case I'm going

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.700
to measure the tread length of my carpet and
in this case they're 45 inches. So if I want

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.010
a runner that leaves me at least three inches
on each side, I'm going to take off six inches

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.280
for the width of the carpet so that my runner
will be 39 inches. So it's very important

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.750
if you're doing a wall to wall type of carpet,
you want to add two inches on to the dimension,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.540
so you know how wide a piece to cut in order
to install because you're going to roll those

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.799
edges in. For a runner you're actually going
to take off the width from your actual treads

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.750
to get your actual width of your runner. So
I'm Tim Gibson and that's how to measure for

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.540
carpet on your stairs.
