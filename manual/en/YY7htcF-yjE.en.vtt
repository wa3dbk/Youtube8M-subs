I'm Ralph Grizzle, the Avid Cruiser. For more
than two decades I've cruised the seven seas

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.530
on some of the world's most luxurious ships.
I write about my experiences on AvidCruiser.com.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.220
My goal is to help people like you make informed
decisions about your cruise vacations. Join

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:39.059
me today as I explore one of the world's finest
cruise ships. Welcome aboard Seabourn.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.510
When Seabourn Square was introduced on Seabourn
Odyssey a few years ago, it was an innovative

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.460
concept. Seabourn Square is the hub of the
ship, its heart and soul. Let me take you

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.660
for a quick tour.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.579
Seabourn Square is like a large, elegant living
room. It's a well-used space but never overly

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.559
crowded, thanks in part to Seabourn's generous
space ratios. Simply put, that means you'll

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.850
never feel crowded on a Seabourn ship.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.430
Seabourn Square took inspiration from the
private lounges of luxury hotels, where guests

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.400
sit instead of stand when being served. While
Seabourn Square functions as the hub of guest

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.860
services, the area also features computers
with internet access, as well as a library

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.600
with a good selection of books that you're
free to read in the comfort of the lounge

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.759
or take back to your room to read in privacy.

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.400
You'll find hand-crafted cafe lattes in Seabourn
Square as well as freshly baked pastry items

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.610
and a selection of specialty coffees and teas,
all served in that friendly but professional

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.680
Seabourn style - and at no additional charge.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.740
Seabourn Square also features shops with sundry
items, clothing and even fine jewelry in a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.909
private showroom for highly personalized service.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.770
You’ll find that Seabourn Square is a great
place to sit back and relax, or even lay back

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.840
and relax, as you cruise from one exciting
port of call to the next.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.479
Well, I hope you’ve learned a little bit
about Seabourn Square. This is a great place

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.619
to have a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, to
relax and read a newspaper, and if you don’t

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.149
mind, I think I’ll do that just now.
