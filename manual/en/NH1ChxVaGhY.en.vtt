00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.150
This Well Speck and Josh Gordon sports comedy
film almost tripled its $53 million dollar

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.810
budget following its March 30th release in
2007.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.900
Will Ferrel and Jon Heder star as talented
figure skaters who resort to the unorthodox

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.769
solution of pairing with each other in order
to compete on the national level again, following

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.480
a lifetime ban from the sport.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.660
The curious pairing of Ferrell and Heder as
disgraced skaters works surprisingly well,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.660
the former's trademark, abrasive and improvised
humor works well against the latter's more

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.410
subtle annoyed straight-man style.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.649
The supporting cast includes a bevy of familiar
faces, including the then-married couple of

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.879
Will Arnett and Amy Poehler as scheming and
ruthless skating competitors, the gorgeously

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.909
cute Jenna Fischer as the nervous potential
girlfriend, William Ficthner in a quick role

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.909
as an uncaring millionaire father, Nick Swardson
as a creepy stalker, and Craig T. Nelson as

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.510
who else... the coach.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.729
Real-life former skater and renowned color-commentator
Scott Hamilton appears as himself alongside

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.020
Jim Lampley, both of whom add a great deal
of credibility to the absurd events, and deliver

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.841
some great jokes themselves, providing exposition
early by describing Ferrel as the "Only skater

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:09.610
to win four national championships and an
adult film award."

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.680
The 93-minute film is quickly paced, and its
parallel narratives keep either from getting

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
too boring.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.310
There's even a few quick visual effects shots,
namely when our unathletic protagonists perform

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.570
computer-assisted triple-axels.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.220
The PG-13 rated movies makes some inventive
use of pop music throughout, like when Heder

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.940
questions the meaning of the Black Eyed Peas'
"My Humps"... but the original score from

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.420
Theodore Shapiro is largely inconsequential.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.140
When I saw this film in theaters the week
of its release, I recall laughing quite frequently,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.910
and really enjoying the humor and style of
this picture... but sadly, it has not aged

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.910
well.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.830
Only seven years later, the jokes feel stale,
forced, and far more immature than necessary.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.130
Playing out like an unfunny SNL sketch that
doesn't quite know when to end.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.470
There are moments, gags, and gimmicks that
definitely work well however, like when Arnett

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.240
is chasing Ferrel through the streets and
stores of Montreal, while still clumsily wearing

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.240
their skates.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.400
For fans of Ferrel's zany and aggressive delivery,
or figuring skating, this is an average comedy

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.810
worth watching at least once.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.080
"Blades Of Glory", is "Witty and amusing,
but familiar."

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:16.650
Here are your reviews now from the YouTube
comments.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.109
Audience vote is a SEVEN, and I rated "Blades
Of Glory" a SIX.

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.159
While many were quick to point out some of
its faults, you also praised the humor, calling

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.790
this a COOL movie.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.430
Far less enjoyable than I remember it - this
is a crude, but decent comedy.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.400
I thought it was GOOD.
