00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.889
ULINE's H-2957 Automatic Stretch Wrap Machine
is perfect for large operations looking for

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.910
a quick and efficient way to secure loads.
With a capacity of 4,000 pounds and speed

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.910
of 12 RPMs, the H-2957 securely wraps up to
20 loads per hour, increasing productivity

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.840
while eliminating operator strain and fatigue.
Your Automatic Stretch Wrap Machine arrives

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.810
fully assembled and ready for set-up. After
uncrating the unit, transport to the desired

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.950
location by placing forks through the pockets
at the rear base of the machine. Place the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.680
machine close to an area where you will be
wrapping your pallet loads, making sure there

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.149
is sufficient room to load/unload the machine
and the floor is able to bear the weight of

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.149
the machine, load and equipment. A standard
120 VAC, 15-amp outlet will be needed to provide

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.059
power to the unit. To finish set up, power
on the unit and release the emergency stop switch.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.070
Adjust the turntable, carriage speed
and film force to desired level depending

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.400
on the weight, size and shape of your pallet.
Now, turn the Wrap/Reset knob to Reset and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.200
push the Start button. This returns the turntable
and the carriage to their home positions.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.799
To load film, open the film carriage door.
Place the film on the core holder. Pull off

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.549
about 5 feet of film and thread it through
the rollers following the threading diagram

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.549
and close the door. The H-2957 comes pre-set
to stretch the film 200% and can be changed

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.680
to 250% by adjusting the stretch selector.
Open the stretch selector cover by removing

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.680
the lock nuts. Push the safety lock in and
slide the knob up to achieve 250% stretch.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.520
The down position will operate the machine
at 200% stretch. Now you can select your wrap

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.280
mode. The Wrapping Mode knob provides the
option of having the pallet wrapped in just

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.670
the upward direction or both upward and downward
for added strength. Once you have selected

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.810
your wrap mode, choose the number of top and
bottom wraps. Make sure the Turntable and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.810
Film Carriage knobs are set to Auto. Press
the Start button to begin wrapping your pallet.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.330
The photo sensor will read when the stretch
wrap carriage has reached the top of the load.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.270
If you need to add more wrap to the top of
the load, lower the photo sensor. If you need

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.960
to reduce the amount being applied at the
top of the load, raise the photo sensor. To

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.650
manually control the machine, turn the Turntable
and Film Carriage knobs to Manual. The film

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.340
carriage can manually be adjusted up or down
and the turntable can be turned on or off.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.950
When the machine has finished the wrapping
process, the film will automatically cut.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.370
You're now ready to wrap the next pallet.
The optional H-2958 Ramp is ideal for use

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.370
with manual pallet trucks and jacks, allowing
closer access to the turntable. The H-2957

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.900
comes with a 2-year warranty on parts and
is made in the USA. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.280
You can rely on ULINE for all your shipping
needs.
