[Music]

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.210
[evil laughter]

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.469
Mario: Nice of the princess to invite us over
for a picnic, eh Luigi?

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.459
Luigi: I hope she made lotsa spaghetti!

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.949
Luigi, look!

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.220
It's from Bowser!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.710
Dear pesky plumbers.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.160
The Koopalings and I,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.940
have taken over the Mushroom Kingdom!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.960
The princess is now a permanent guest

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.660
at one of my seven Koopa Hotels!

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.759
I dare you to find her if you can!

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
We gotta find the princess!

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.530
And you gotta help us!

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.090
If you need instructions on how to get through
the hotels,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.670
check out the enclosed instruction book.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.010
[Music]

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.190
Mario: Looks kinda peaceful.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.989
Looks are deceiving, when Koopas are involved!

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.530
[Music]

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:21.610
Hey, princess!

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.860
How are we gonna find the princess with the
power going out?

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.420
Maybe there's a switch in one of the rooms!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.799
Remind me to check.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.360
[Music]

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.930
Aha!

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.590
Here's the problem.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.639
Too many toasters!

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:52.320
You know what they say: All toasters toast
toast!

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.520
[toasters popping]

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.119
[Music]

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:10.520
That oughta do it!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.670
Where'd she go?

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.459
[Music]

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.620
-Gee, its kinda dark.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.330
-You bring a light?

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.650
No.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.830
Well, maybe a Koopa will lend us his!

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.090
If we 'persuade' him.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.220
Uh oh!

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.910
Where am I?

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.040
Peach: MARIO!

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:55.430
Mario: Get ready to catch her!

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.250
Luigi: She's not coming down!

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.910
She's up there!

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.910
[Music]

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.349
It's hard to see through those clouds.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.489
I hope we can get rid of 'em!

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.050
Get the hint?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.530

[Music]

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.940
Hey you!

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:45.360
Get off of my cloud!

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.840
It's been one of those days...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.850
Come on, Luigi!

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.260
Whoa!

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.980
We ain't afraid of no Koopas!

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.450
Hurry!

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.930
Aha!

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.459
Maybe this will keep that lizard king from
playing with the doors!

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:24.099
[Loud noises, Hotel collapsing]

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.259
Spooky...

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.979
Mario: Where's the Princess!?

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.250
Luigi: Over there!

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.250
Look!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.580
Wendy's Hotel!

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.309
Be careful!

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.839
When you pinch Wendy's pennies, they pinch
back!

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:55.460
Mario: So this is where Wendy hid the real
coins!

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.569
That wasn't so hard, was it?

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.069
Princess Peach: Boys!

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.729
[Evil laughter]

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.680
Luigi: That's that creepy Bowser's laugh!

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.770
Mario: Look!

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.399
[Music, Thunder roaring]

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:24.569
This is it, Luigi!

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.110
Remember!

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.740
Where there's smoke...

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.830
There's fire!

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.460
[Bowser's Hotel Collapsing]

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.969
Thanks to you two, I can safely rule the Mushroom
Kingdom.

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.029
Free from the terrible Koopaling Clan.

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:55.530
And my thanks to YOU too.
