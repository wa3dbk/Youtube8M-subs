The Print command allows you to print text,
variable data or HTML tags on a web page.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.650
If you want to simply display “Hello World”
on your web page you would type print “Hello

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:25.300
World”;.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.679
Do not forget the semicolon at the end of
the line.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:39.559
Save your file and view the results in your
browser.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.250
You can also incorporate HTML tags using the
Print statement.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.910
To add a couple of Horizontal Rules and make
the text bold, modify your print statement

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:15.910
to add the break and horizontal rule tags.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:25.540
Save your file and view the results in your
browser.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:34.460
Here you can see the two horizontal rules
and the bold text.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.240
Use the HTML break tag to cause text to begin
on a new line. Modify your print statement

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:59.460
to add the break tag and the new line of text.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.410
Save your file and view the results in your
browser.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.640
You can see how the text “I am starting
over” is on a new line after the break tag.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.950
I will explain how to print variables in the
variables video.
