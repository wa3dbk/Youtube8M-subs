00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.050
this has been a good event for BeOn motorcycles

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.310
we accomplished our goals that were to test the 2 bikes

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.740
with all the motorcycle press testing the  2 bikes

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.020
and finally race them both in the Trophy Cup

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.100
and we are very happy with the fast lap times that were set today

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.990
all the riders were impressed with the bikes

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.970
so...

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.130
we will carry on promoting the bikes and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.430
with more races still to come, we hope people will get to know us better

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.430
by leading races like we were today

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.880
...the pre-moto3 (250cc)

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.590
is a fun bike to ride!!!

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.070
you can feel the bike is 
made for young riders

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.369
it's very small and lite

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.959
they certainly spent a lot 
of time on this chassis

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:16.649
it's very good

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:21.929
and the engine runs
stronger then I expected

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.749
but you do need to keep the rev's up
to have it in the best power band

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.389
however
you still can get fast laps on this bike

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:37.389
since it's so lite, our lap times were very interesting

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.730
the GP450 with it's 450cc engine

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.339
is a bigger bike that fits any rider

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.469
I felt good on the bike

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.809
the engine is more powerful so it picks up speed faster

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:03.029
coming out of corners

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.569
allthough I noticed

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.369
a slight rev gap between 4th  5th gear

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:13.869
that can easyally be corrected with a different gearing

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.299
the suspension still needed further adjusting

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.499
besides that!!!
 this is definitely a fun bike to race

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:19.909
and..

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.579
may make many riders switch from

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.109
bigger bikes to this small bike
that doesn't have so much top speed

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.949
but is definitely more fun when braking and turning corners
