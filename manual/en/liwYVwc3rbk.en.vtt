00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.840
Hello friends!

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.500
In today's video we will be seeing

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.870
How to grow the Giant Tomatillo

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.350
Now before we move on to this video of growing
Giant Tomatillos

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.590
And if you've not already seen it, I'd like
to remind you that

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.140
We've posted a video earlier

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.869
About growing Tomatillos

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.679
You can click on the link on your screen right
now to watch this video

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.370
It gives a lot of insight on growing Tomatillos
in general

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.190
So these are our tomatillo seeds from Robs
Rare And Giant Seeds.com

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.320
And these seeds are really good

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.110
I've not bought from this dealer before but
the seeds were of really good quality

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.790
So out of all these seed starting techniques
that I've used

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.790
I think the most cost effective and easy solution
is to use these seed pellets

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.869
What you basically do is just immerse them
in water, let them expand to their full size

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.110
And then start planting the seeds in it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010
Remember to get the larger sized seed pellets

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.220
I'll provide a link in my video description
as well

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.830
For yout o buy these seed pellets

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.610
And just make a little hole on the top

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.750
You don't need to really make a big hole

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.970
Just enough for the seeds to settle down

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
And then just drop in two seeds in each seed
pellet

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.780
Now some people like putting 1 seed as well

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.310
But I wasn't sure about the germination rates
for the seeds

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
SO I just went on the safe side and put two
seeds

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.420
I anyways had a lot of seeds to use for this
season

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.979
So once you've planted the seeds, don't forget
to label the seeds

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.640
I think that's a common mistake that a lot
of us do

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.130
So the seeds should germinate in about 7 days
or so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.479
But they need to be kept in a green house
or indoors in a sunny location

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.040
For about 4 weeks

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.659
And now let's plant these int he ground as
well as in containers

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.129
I usually spread out the plants both in containers
and in the ground

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.290
And this is how it needs to go

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.609
It just needs to be that much deep

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.779
And since the roots have already started growing
out of this pellet

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.269
I'm just going to plant it right in the ground

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.049
Just like that

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.939
The pellet cover will decompose over time

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.810
So you don't have to worry about it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.739
So I've staked this tomatillo plant with the
same stakes I've been using for my tomatoes

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.489
and eggplants

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.950
And its done a great job so far supporting
all of these plants

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.620
So as the tomatillo plant grows, you gotta
have a lot of nutrition provided for the plant

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.279
Especially Nitrogen in the earlier phases
so you can use a lot of manure, compost

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:14.150
Or if you are using balanced fertilizers,
all of them work pretty well

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.480
This is the other Tomatillo plant growing
in a container

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.549
Now in the previous season, when I harvested
Tomatillos

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.700
I learned that Tomatillo plants cannot pollinate
their own flowers

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.489
Which means that it will pollinate but with
flowers from other Tomatillo plants

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.029
Which means that you need to plant at least
2-3 Tomatillo plants

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.699
To get a decent fruit production

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.370
Now in my previous season, I did grow tomatillos,
just one

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.629
And it did produce a lot of Tomatillos - I
don't know how

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.980
But int his season and for this Tomatillo
plant

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.419
I made sure that I planted at least 3 plants

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:03.870
So that there are sufficient flowers available
for pollination

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.669
So as you can see we are now harvesting our
giant tomatillos

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:14.319
And they are significantly larger than the
tomatillos that are of regular size

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.360
And I think that growing giant tomatillos
are

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.909
A better value for the space you are growing
compared to the small tomatillos

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.139
Because although the plant doesn't produce
a lot of tomatillos

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.060
The tomatillos that it produces are pretty
big in size

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.450
So let's look at this tomatillo

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.520
This is one of the largest ones I got

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:47.060
And this is actually as big as a tomato or
mayeb even a small green pepper

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.919
And these giant tomatillos are just as flavorful
as the smaller tomatillos

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.569
And a lot easier to handle

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.990
So that's how our harvest looks like

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.830
It's very late in the season here

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.379
I actually started these plants very late

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.740
Ihope to start them sooner next season

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.419
But its a pretty decent harvest

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.240
And its definitely usable at least a few times
if you get this kind of harvest let's say

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.610
every few days

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.120
So I hope you liked this video

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.949
Happy Gardening!
