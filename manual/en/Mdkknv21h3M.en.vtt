&gt;&gt; What's that known for?

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.045
&gt;&gt; Low riders and gangs.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:57.820

is that

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.300
growing up in America
you follow hip hop.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.950
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.270
&gt;&gt; You watch movies, you
always see low riders but

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.480
I never got to ride in
one like going down

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.620
the freeway in L.A.
doing my thing,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.750

enter lowriders.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.000
Cuz you get in and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.240
you feel like
you're a kid again.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You remember riding in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.965

they had what were called
cigarette dispensers.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.390
You would put your
cigarette in here, and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.410
as you're driving, you
would actually open it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.010
and it, and it would
light your cigarette,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.570
and you smoke it
while you're driving.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.770
&gt;&gt; These cars are like
time machines.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.550

time when there was

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.570
you know, the whole era
of the car club wars.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.370

there's still that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.715
stigmatism that's
leftover and.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:08.625
They associated
low-riding with

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.387
gang-banging, and all
this other stuff, but,

00:03:11.387 --> 00:03:13.450

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.120
can't flavor
the meat too much,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.840

the flavor, right?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.950

It's definitely not to be

&gt;&gt; It was a sad
time in low riding.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.260
If you disrespected
another club,

I don't need nobody
