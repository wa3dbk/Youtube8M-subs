00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.970
Made from fortified glass, this ultra-thin screen protector provides premium scratch

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.170
and drop defense with a glass touch. Just
like your actual touchscreen.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.550
And this one is precision cut to fit OtterBox cases. So

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.250
you can pair it with your OtterBox
Resurgence, Symmetry Series or Commuter Series case

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.460
for 360 degree protection. Follow these
instructions to install your

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.340
Alpha Glass Precision Cut for OtterBox
Cases screen protector.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.829
First make sure your OtterBox case is
already installed before installing your

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.109
screen protector and gently lift the glass
from the tray.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.450
Next, thoroughly clean the touchscreen
with the included alcohol wipe and then

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.280
dry it off with the included microfiber wipe.
Once your touchscreen is clean and dry

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.940
hold the glass along the edges and peel
back the film labeled

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.930
"Step 1." Center and align the cut-out
over the earpiece 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.020
on the device. Press and hold at the
earpiece

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.830
and gently apply the glass to the screen
aligning it with the home button.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.170
Now peel back the film labeled "Step 2"

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.320
Use your finger to press any bubbles out
toward the edges, 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.120
and your touch screen is now protected.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.860
If your first attempt just doesn't go as planned, you have up to five minutes to remove and reapply your screen protector.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.029
Just be careful not to get any dust or
debris on the sticky side.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.120
