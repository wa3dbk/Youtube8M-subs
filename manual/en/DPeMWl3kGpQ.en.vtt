00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.590
Item #: SCP-147
Object Class: Euclid

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.370
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-147 is
to be kept in a simulacrum of a 1950s-era

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.610
living room.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.189
Its current container contains a throw rug,
two armchairs, a phonograph, a rotary telephone,

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.929
and other suitable decorations.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:30.369
SCP-147 will reject any items dating from
later than late March, 1965 (See Addendum

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.220
0-40).

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.520
It requires no external power source or connection.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.609
Description: Discovered 1983 in a civilian
home in Detroit, Michigan.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:48.590
SCP-147 appears to be a 1957 General Electric
brand black-and-white television, model 17TO26.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.750
SCP-147 has been observed to exhibit two different
behaviors:

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.039
Optimal: When SCP-147 is in an acceptable
room, it will display broadcasts of 1950s-era

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.100
comedies, such as The Burns and Allen Show,
Father Knows Best, and I Love Lucy.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.370
In every case, each broadcast has been completely
unique: archives of the programs, none of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.110
which are still being produced, have failed
to find any record of the episodes that SCP-147

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.110
plays.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.260
No commercials are shown, and there is no
indication as to which station would be broadcasting

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.730
these shows.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.220
All broadcasts are in black and white.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.870
Subjects exposed to SCP-147 in its optimal
state reported a pleasant feeling of relaxation.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.200
In this state, the item's volume and channels
can be adjusted, though the off switch appears

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.990
to have no effect.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.830
Hostile: When modern-day items are present
in SCP-147's environment, the item will only

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.580
display extremely violent and gruesome color
footage; beheadings, rapes, executions, and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.260
torture have all been observed, but as of
yet no footage has been broadcast that indicates

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.270
when or where the scenes depicted took place.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.960
The footage is invariably of high visual and
audio quality.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.900
Subjects exposed to SCP-147 in its hostile
state almost invariably vomit due to the graphic

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.410
nature of the broadcasts after ten to fifteen
seconds; one subject suffered a nervous breakdown

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.820
after two minutes of exposure.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.740
Every subject has displayed an extreme reluctance
to recall the contents of the broadcasts,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.320
and two out of the fifteen subjects tasked
with viewing SCP-147's hostile broadcasts

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.830
have since committed suicide.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.110
None of the item's controls respond during
hostile broadcasts.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.940
Attempts to examine the internals of SCP-147
have been unsuccessful, as the item's shell

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.690
resists any and all attempts to crack it open.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.740
Placing the item in a Faraday cage in order
to negate any possible transmissions it could

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.850
be receiving had no effect.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.470
The effects of long-term exposure to SCP-147
have not been documented.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.430
Addendum: Any and all recreational activities
involving SCP-147 are to be scheduled at least

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.069
one week beforehand with approval by Level
4 personnel.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.580
Addendum [0-40]: See File TC-147-B for further
details.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.459
After [DATA EXPUNGED] suggestion, several
objects manufactured throughout the 1960s

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.010
era were brought in.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.530
Objects made past March of the year 1965 have
resulted in a hostile behavior.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.730
Exact dating is difficult due to troubles
of obtaining materials precisely made on testable

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.569
dates and times.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.170
Reasons as to why it acts in such a way depending
on a specific object's date are unknown, and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.440
being tested by [DATA EXPUNGED].

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.099
Addendum [0-40a]: As has been verified repeatedly,
the presence of persons born after March 1965

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.200
does not in and of itself trigger a hostile
event.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.250
For reasons still unknown, SCP-147 objects
mainly to manufactured items.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.310
Dr. ████████ ████ recently
conducted an experiment in which he clothed

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.250
himself with vintage (pre-1965) articles of
clothing, with the caveat that he had three

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.280
Bic Flair pens (invented in the 1970s) in
his shirt pocket.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.201
What he saw while seated in front of SCP-147,
he would later describe as "a bizarre episode

00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:10.930
of I Love Lucy featuring a surprising amount
of gunplay."

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.600
Addendum [1-80]: Recent tests that involved
exposing convicted rapists and psychopaths

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.309
to the object while it was hostile has indicated
that the object is able to tailor the images

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:22.309
to the viewer.

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:28.460
A rapist was strapped into a metal chair manufactured
in 1986, and during that time not a single

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.509
rape was shown on the screen, while scenes
of genital mutilation (primarily male) occurred

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:34.520
more often.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.190
Similarly, a psychopath who had tortured someone
to death saw fewer scenes of torture, and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.130
more scenes of botched executions.
