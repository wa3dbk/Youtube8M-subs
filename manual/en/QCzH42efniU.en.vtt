00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:01.960
Thanks, Tim.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.980
Yeah, thank you.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.520
So, you don´t get sticky fingers.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.620
Tim, can you help us?

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.900
We´re trying to settle a bet.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.720
Uh-oh.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.380
You ever heard of Jonas Salk?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.940
Sure. Cured polio.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.060
And you´ve heard of Albert Einstein?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.600
Heh, hey.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.640
How about Gerrard Lambeau? Ever heard of him?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.800
No.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.000
Thank you, Tim.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.000
So who won the bet?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.760
I did.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.420
This isn´t about me, Sean.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.900
I´m nothing compared to this young man.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.820
You ever hear of Gerrard Lambeau?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720
In 1905 there were hundreds of professors renowned

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.420
for their study of the universe,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.440
but it was a- it was a 26 year old Swiss patent clerk

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.520
doing physics in his spare time who changed the world.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.780
Can you imagine if Einstein would have given that up

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.220
just to get drunk with his buddies in Vienna every night?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.980
We all would have lost something.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.160
Tim would never have heard of him.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.660
Pretty dramatic, Gerry.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.900
No it isn´t, Sean.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.660
This boy has that gift.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.440
He just hasn´t got the direction, but we can give that to him.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.940
Hey, Gerry. In the 1960´s there was a young man

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.840
gratulated from the University of Michigan.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.780
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.980
Specifically bounded harmonic functions.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.700
Then he went to Berkeley, was assistent professor,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760
showed amazing potential, then he moved to Montana

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.620
and he blew the competition away.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.220
Yes, so who was he?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.480
Ted Kaczynski.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.320
Never heard of him.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.160
Hey, Timmy!

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.120
Yo!

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.480
Who´s Ted Kaczynski?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.880
Unabomber.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.360
That´s exactly what I´m talking about.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.620
We gotta give this kid direction.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.580
Yeah.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.040
He can contribute to the world and...

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.880
and we can help him do that.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.560
Direction´s one thing. Manipulation´s another. All right?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.060
Sean!

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580
We have to let him find his own...

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.700
Sean! I´m not sitting at home every night twisting my

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.960
mustache and hatching a... hatching a plan

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.580
to ruin this boy´s life.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.500
I was doing advanced mathematics when I was...

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.020
when I was 18, and it still took me over 20 years to do

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.580
something worthy of a Fields medal.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.360
Well, maybe he doesn´t want what you want?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.840
There´s more to life than a fucking Fields medal.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.960
This is too important, Sean.
