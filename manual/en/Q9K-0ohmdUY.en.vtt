00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.879
The holy scriptures were inspired by the Holy
Spirit but they were written by men like me

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.210
and like Paul, people who loved Jesus Christ
and who dearly wanted to bring souls to Christ,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.269
but they were not perfect, neither in what
they spoke, neither what they thought

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.079
because man is imperfect.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.519
The only perfect person is Jesus Christ Himself.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.159
God Himself is perfect, we are not perfect.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.009
We are imperfect vessels.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.940
Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 13, he says that
we know in part and we prophecy in part

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.399
but when that which is perfect has come then
all that is temporary will be done away with,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.030
and in scripture there is no perfection.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.960
Perfection is in the words of Christ.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.190
The words of Jesus Christ, that is perfection.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.219
Those are the words that are neglected and
most preachers will tell you that its not

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.390
practical
but those are the words by which we will be

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.390
judged.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.990
People keep themselves busy with the rest
of the scriptures instead of keeping themselves

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.280
busy with Jesus and His words.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.780
I want to read for you from Hebrews 6:4.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.040
It was written by the writer of Hebrews, who
was a man like me, he says “for it is impossible

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.110
for those who were once enlightened and have
tasted of the heavenly gift and were made

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.030
partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted
the good word of God and the powers.. if they

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.520
shall fall away, to renew them again unto
repentance”

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
With man it is impossible, yes, but with God,
nothing is impossible.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.649
Many people have read these scriptures and
have given up on going back to God

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.619
but with God nothing is impossible
people are keeping themselves busy with scriptures

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:04.549
and with teachings made by people like myself
who are imperfect

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.259
and they use that as a limitation as to the
grace of God.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.069
Jesus Christ has never turned away anybody
who came to Him, never once

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.840
Everybody that came to God with repentance
in his heart, he accepted

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.430
And he took him back like the prodigal son
he gave as the parable of the prodigal son.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.120
The Father said that the son of Mine who was
dead has come back to life.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.409
There is joy in Heaven for one sinner that
comes back

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.769
For one backslider that comes back to Jesus
Christ.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.450
It is not impossible my friends.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.110
With God all things are possible.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.170
And I want to admonish you today, you that
are backslidden,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.050
you to whom satan has quoted these scriptures
and told you God will never take you back.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.310
Satan is a liar my friend.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.930
Your insight in the Scriptures are imperfect.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.810
The Bible is not the Word of God, it is the
Holy Scriptures written by people like us

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.730
It is Jesus Christ who saves
Jesus is Lord

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.319
Jesus is the One whom we have to cry out and
say Lord save me, Lord help me, He is the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.550
Savior
Do not let anything or anybody put you off

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.480
going to Christ my friend
Do not let satan lie to you

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.200
do not let a preacher lie to you, let nothing,
allow nothing to come between you and Jesus

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.980
Christ
Cry out to Him, He is your destiny

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.439
Don’t give up
Cry out to God and Jesus will hear you

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.880
He will listen to you, He will pick you up.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.520
Jesus loves you my friend
His Holy Spirit is knocking on the door of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.310
your heart, He wants to come in
God has no pleasure in the death of a sinner

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.689
Jesus Christ died for sinners
Jesus is calling you and He is calling me

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.569
as long as you’ve got life
And you’ve got breath in your body

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.099
You must cry out to God for mercy
That sinner hanging on the cross next to Jesus

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.489
He cried out, he said Lord think of me when
You get into Your Paradise

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.890
My friend, never, never ever stop crying out
to Christ

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.541
Not good people go into Heaven, people who
call out to God all day and all night they

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:21.380
are the ones that are saved
There is nobody good on this earth, none of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.700
us none of us is without failure
None of us is without a flaw but we must cry

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.720
out to Christ
The condemnation is not that we are not good

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.280
because we are all bad
The condemnation is that the Light has come

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.320
into the world but man loved
darkness more than Light, because their deeds

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.910
were evil
John 3:19 Seek Jesus with your whole heart

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.060
and He will accept you my friend
He is waiting for you to come to Him.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.050
Jesus loves you
It does not matter what you’ve done

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.110
It does not matter where you are where you
come from

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.730
Jesus loves you my friend
He died for you

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.220
And He is waiting for you to come to Him
To just put out your hand to Him and say Lord

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.520
help me, cry out to Him
Say Lord I am a sinner help me.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.380
He will accept you
He will not chase you away.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.660
He won’t reject you
Jesus is calling you.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.440
People might reject you, the church might
reject you, the community might reject you

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.090
but Jesus Christ will accept you my friend.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.610
He loves you
He’s got no pleasure, no pleasure in one

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.670
sinner going in to hell
It is His good will that all be saved and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.670
come to Him and be part of His Kingdom
Call out to Jesus today, don’t let anything

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.150
stop you
Call out to Him today and He will accept you

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.060
Repent of your sin
Follow Jesus and He will save you my friend

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.920
And He will give you eternal life
He is waiting for you right now to come to

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.270
Him
To lay down your sins and to accept Him into

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.340
your life
Jesus is waiting for you

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.060
Jesus bless you.
