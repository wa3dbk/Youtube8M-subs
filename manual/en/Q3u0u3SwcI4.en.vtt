00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.720
Jon: Remember- microwaves are serious business.

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:04.841
Riley: Please, don't try this at home!

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.479
Jory: Once, I burnt my tongue on a Hot Pocket!

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.850
Jon and Riley: (wincing in "pain") Ooh!

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.379
Hello, and welcome to "Is it a Good Idea 
 to Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:15.905
And I'm your sidekick, Riley McIlwain.

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:21.836
Jory: Recently, we celebrated Easter. That's the day where Jesus Christ 
 landed at Plymouth Rock. And that's why women can vote!

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:24.168
Jory: Oh, and Peeps and [beep]!

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:25.754
*theme song plays*

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:26.374
Jory: It smells like victory!

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:27.945
Jory: All hands to the deck!

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.349
Jory: Nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:31.327
Jory and Jon: WHOA!

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:31.884
Jory: You got that on camera, right?

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:33.165
Riley: I don't trust this bitch!

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:34.485
Jon: Are you out of your mind?!

00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:35.772
Jory: The masks- they do nothing!

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:37.364
Riley: You TOTALLY could have died!

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.981
Riley: The tin foil shield- it actually worked!

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:40.385
Jory: Stopping, stopping!

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:41.521
Riley and Playlist Live crowd: 3.5!

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.560
Jon: YEAH!

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.362
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:52.772
Jory: Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Microwave Laboratory, safety is our 
 #1 concern. And that's why we hide behind this giant tin foil shield.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.384
Jory: It's to protect our nuts...

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:55.568
Jory and Riley: ...because nobody likes roasted nuts!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.305
Jory: But you know what we DO like? Easter [beep]!

00:00:57.945 --> 00:00:59.945
Riley: Easter [beep]!

00:00:58.213 --> 00:01:00.213
Jory: In our microwave!

00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:02.234
Jory: Our microwave over here, the beautiful Rapunzel, has been through a lot.

00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:06.898
Jory: She's black on the inside, but who really cares about the inside?

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:07.538
Jon: But she has a cream filling!

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.441
Jory: It's mostly the white outside that we love!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Riley: (mouth full) Oh, yeah!

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.569
Jory: (about chocolate bunny) Oh, she's hollow? Easter love!

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:11.544
Riley: (mouth full) Yeah!

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:12.084
Jory: Is it "he" or a "she"? Can you check?

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.355
Jon: Definitely a "she"! Anything you would bite into is a she!

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
Jory: Yeah, but what's THIS?!

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:16.028
*Jory and Riley laugh*

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:17.599
Jory: Just, uh...

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.034
*Riley smashes chocolate bunny*

00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:18.903
Jory: That's good!

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.901
Riley: (in "Home Alone" voice) Merry Easter, you filthy animals!

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
Riley: So, as you notice, we have a basket, Peeps, and a chocolate bunny.

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:25.731
Jory: Every Easter!

00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:26.103
Jon: It's a Christmas miracle!

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:28.634
Riley: Quickly, quickly, before the thing springs out and kills us!

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:30.408
Riley: That looks deadly!

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.210
*Jory and Riley laugh*

00:01:30.848 --> 00:01:32.848
Riley: Yeah!

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.149
Jory: We're gonna open it, and it's gonna whip us in the face!

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.695
Jory: Okay, how long should we put that in there for?

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:40.295
Jon: Uh, well, Jesus rose again after three days, 
 so put it in there for 3:33!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.280
Jon: Alright, Jory, Riley, you guys ready to roll?

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.850
Riley: (in raspy voice) Let's do it!

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:45.490
Jory: I got black [beep] on me! Yeah, let's do it!

00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:46.990
*springs hopping*

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:48.200
Jon: Come on in!

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.300
Riley: (in exaggerated Boston accent) Get the [beep] outta 
 there! Those Peeps are gonna be pretty big!

00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:54.180
Jory: The Peeps aren't making a peep!

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.420
*Riley chuckles*

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.890
Jory: I wanna see that bunny go to Hell!

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.470
Jon: So, do you guys believe in the Easter Bunny?

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:02.700
Ryan: Hell, yeah!

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:03.670
Jory: Hells, yeah!

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.070
Jon: Do you guys believe in Jesus Christ?

00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:06.990
Jory: No!

00:02:05.643 --> 00:02:07.640
*all chuckle*

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:08.300
Jon: What's your favorite part about Easter, Jory?

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.370
Jory: Cadbury creme eggs!

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:12.710
Riley: Those Peeps are gettin' pretty...

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.910
Jon: So, are the Peeps expanding?

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:14.170
Riley: Yeah, of course they are!

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.650
Ryan: Yeah, slowly.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.720
Jory: Uh, yeah! The little one in the 
 middle is stealing all of the food!

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.420
*Riley and Ryan laugh*

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:22.730
Jory: Actually, because there's chocolate in there and there's 
 marshmallow Peeps, all we need is graham cracker.

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:24.720
Jon: (disappointedly) Aw, and we forgot it!

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:25.820
Jory: Mmm!

00:02:24.753 --> 00:02:26.750
Ryan: No fat chicks!

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:28.290
Jory: (laughing) What?!

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.240
Ryan: The chicks- they're gettin' fat!

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.540
Jon: It's an Easter miracle!

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:33.040
Jory: Okay, let's do this!

00:02:34.013 --> 00:02:36.010
Jon: Right, Riley?

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.220
Jon: Open her up!

00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:38.160
Jon: (disgustedly) AW!

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:39.090
Jory: At least this didn't flick us in the face!

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:40.460
Riley: Careful!

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.300
Jon: (laughs) Look at that! It's just kinda, like, holding on with Spiderman strength!

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.480
Ryan: UGH! (laughs)

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:48.260
Jon: It looks like you just got diarrhea poop all over the side!

00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:50.790
Ryan: (laughs) Pull that back out!

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:55.030
Jon: Get it into the victim's tray! Aw, it 
 smells delicious, but it looks like terrible diarrhea!

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.430
Jory: Chocolate what?

00:02:55.427 --> 00:02:57.430
Jory: Oh, it started to turn black there!

00:02:57.222 --> 00:02:59.220
Jory: (to Riley) What part's okay to eat? Are you sure?

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:04.300
Jory: (mouth full) No! No, it's not!

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:05.270
*Jon and Ryan laugh*

00:03:04.242 --> 00:03:07.240
Jory: So, you may be wondering, is it 
 a good idea to microwave Easter [beep]?

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.340
Riley: (mouth full) Sure!

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.630
Jory: (hesitantly) I don't know!

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:15.540
Jory: Like, unlike Jesus, these won't just come back! Like...

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.860
Jon: You ruined perfectly good food!

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:19.380
Jory: That bunny is dead! He's just dead!

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:22.160
Jon: I don't know. I thought it smelled good, but it looked terrible!

00:03:21.428 --> 00:03:23.430
Jory: Oh, it SMELLED good, but, like...

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340
Jon: You can't eat it anymore!

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.210
Jory: You can't eat this!

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:27.780
Jon: Well, I mean, most normal people can't eat it anymore!

00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:29.610
Jory: What's that black stuff? Tell me! What IS that?

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.990
Jory: So, that's about it for this episode of...

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.470
Jory and Riley: ..."Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?"

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.810
I'm your host, Jory Caron.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:34.560
And I'm your sidekick, Riley McIlwain.

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:38.830
Riley: Thanks, babe!

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.710
Jory: No problem!

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:45.620
*end credits play*

00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:51.680
Jory: Rapunzel was a good girl while she lasted, but alas, she's 
 too dark in there. We can't see inside of her.

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:54.890
Jory: So, we're retiring her, because she has no visibility, and that sucks!

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.970
*marching band-type retirement montage music plays*

00:03:54.605 --> 00:03:56.600
Jon: Yes!

00:03:55.908 --> 00:03:58.910
Jory: So, thanks, old girl, but, uh, next!

00:03:58.616 --> 00:04:00.620
Jory: Well, you don't want to put your microwave on a pedestal!

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:02.660
Jon: Reputa!

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:03.760
Jory: Rapunzel!

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:05.100
Jory: (coughs) Some of the burnt bits!

00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:06.300
Riley: Hit the "start" button! Now! NO!

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.620
Jory: Oh, no!

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.040
*champagne explodes*

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.520
Jory and Jon: WHOA!

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:13.940
