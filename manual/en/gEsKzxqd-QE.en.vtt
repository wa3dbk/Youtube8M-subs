00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:07.900
Welcome to BAU-T.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm Enes Aktel.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.000
Today is Thursday the seventh of June.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Let's have a look at our school.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Let's get to know a little bit about you.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
What's your name and what are you studying?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm .. Çakır.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.199
I'm a fourth year student of Journalism.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.300
The finals are going well.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.949
Because I'm in the fourth year,

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.600
I don't actually have that many finals.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
So I can say that they're going well.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.699
So let's say that the finals are over.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.800
It's summer now and what are you plans for the holidays?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm planning on going to summer school.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.450
It's not really going to be much of a holiday.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.000
That's way I took a week off in May so that I could have a break.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.950
Is that all or

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.799
are you planning on going somewhere?

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.000
Just summer school. I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Are you interested in sports?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
No.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.159
At all?

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.159
Nope.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.159
Tennis, Volleyball?

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.159
Have you played any sports at all?

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.159
No.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.299
The most I've ever done is go to the gym for about a week.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.299
We have another student with us now.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.299
Let's get to know you a bit better. What's your name and what are you studying?

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:59.859
My name is Atilla.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.859
I'm studying Cinema and Television.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.579
It was the finals week,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.299
how is going?

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.299
It's going well.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.900
It's going great and

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.500
my parents are really proud of me.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
I see you have a project here. Can you tell us about it?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.989
We shot our film

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.480
and we're going to hand it in now.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.480
I hope that we shot it right though.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480
OK, Atilla the question of the day is sports?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.980

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.200
I used to be.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
Now, I'm only doing body building.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
I'm not doing anything else.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.299
Yes, now we're here with another student. 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.599
How is your finals week going?

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.599
It's not going well at all.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.599
I'm really stressed.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.379
I can see that you're studying really hard.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:38.599
Not exactly.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.799

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.400
Exactly.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
It's really difficult.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.500
How has this term been?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Not very well.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500

Let's say that the finals are over.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.700
What are your plans for the summer holidays?

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.799
