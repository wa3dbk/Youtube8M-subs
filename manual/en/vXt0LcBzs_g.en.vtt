00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.010
So now let me show you want i bought to make
this happen.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.809
most of the stuff i picked up at the local
hardware store.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.890
a couple things i had to order online.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.800
one was these light stands that you see on
the screen i got them from amazon there are

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.840
about $27 $28 and they just worked for me
cause i do photography and wanted something

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.119
to put my flashes on as well.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.810
but any light stand or stand will do.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.490
the next thing that you can get at your hardware
store is called a work light or a clamp light.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.170
There is 2 different there is one with a rounder
dish and one with a smaller dish.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.210
they both have clamps there both good and
thats what i used.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.039
The next thing you need is clothes pins. you
need some clothes pins, and if you happen

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.060
to have some you can just grab them from your
lardy room. and then your going to need some

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.509
type of paper to defuse the light.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.670
its probably in your tip able pantry.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.900
i just grabbed some Wax paper.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.110
one sheet or two or three clipped it right
on.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.420
then of course you going to need a light bulb.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.330
