00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.359
Here we have a musical puzzle game, developed
by Q?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.880
Entertainment’s Tetsuya Mizuguchi (AKA the
god of Musical Puzzle Games), and modeled

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.210
after a Wonderswan game originally developed
by Gunpei Yokoi (AKA the dude who invented

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.210
the Game Boy).

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.300
That’s some history.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.110
I haven’t the slightest idea, though, what
that history has to do with a dog wearing

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.989
a hoodie, pursuing fugitives in a wild-west
kinda space... kinda... thing?

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.030
If that made any less sense, the Steve Miller
Band would’ve had to bust in here and start

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
performing.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.570
I don’t particularly want that to happen,
primarily due to the rights issues involved.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.710
So, instead, please enjoy more footage of
this very strange puzzle game.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.369
The goal is to complete lines that connect
the left and right sides of your stack there,

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.360
while preventing the pile from reaching the
top of the screen.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.780
Sounds kinda familiar, right?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.289
Here’s the rub: Like Meteos, you can’t
move pieces laterally across the screen, only

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:16.840
vertical travel is allowed.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.560
This leads to many situations where you have
one column completely devoid of anything,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.649
and thus can’t actually clear pieces.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.759
And that’s woefully frustrating.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.540
Also, for a head-to-head puzzle game (as this
sometimes is, and the best games usually are),

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.110
there’s a distressing lack of interaction.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.160
You’re mostly just focused on your own stack,
hoping you can get another piece in that one

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.220
column you’re missing, and frantically dragging
lines from the top down to the bottom.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.030
Once a line is created, it lingers for a few
seconds, during which time you can branch

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.800
the line around a bit.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.630
Create a loop or a forked connection to the
opposite side, and those add to your combo

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.440
and get eliminated at the same time.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.250
Thus, there’s a bit of pre-planning that
you can manage while waiting for pieces to

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
appear, but more than often you’re just
frantically trying to drag your topmost pieces

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.330
down and stay alive.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.860
This is rectified a little bit in the Break
mode, which automatically drops pieces if

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.580
a reaction occurs below them.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.360
But I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention
the music, which...

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.480
well, for a guy who’s got Rez and Lumines
under his belt, feels a lot weaker than it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
could’ve been.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.440
For each piece I thought sounded pretty good,
like this casino-themed course, there was

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.260
at best a misstep, and at worst, a cacophony
of strange sound effects and faux-tribal beats.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.980
Just did NOT work for me.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.070
The PSP version of the game abandons the Space
Cowboy aesthetic - thank Altana - and opts

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.620
for a much more modern-looking interface,
similar to Lumines.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.480
Unfortunately, that version suffers from sluggish
controls - a cardinal sin for intense puzzle

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.480
games - a complaint that’s completely avoided
by the DS’ touch screen.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.069
Gunpey DS is an interesting historical note,
but in the context of its groundbreaking designer

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.810
and equally groundbreaking namesake, it comes
up just a bit short.
