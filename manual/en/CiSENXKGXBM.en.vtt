00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.280
Crystal blessings, everyone!

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.730
For this video I wanted to introduce
you all to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.600
Botswana Agate. I love Botswana Agate
because you can really see

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.990
the great banding and color varieties
that agates

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.560
exhibit just within this one variety of
stone.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.180
So you can see on the far left these
three stones are the apricot Botswana

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.790
Agate.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.399
The apricot Botswanas are known for
their connection with creativity.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.110
They have this swirling energy that
corresponds to the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.809
orange of the Sacral Chakra which
many of you know

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.520
to be the center for our creative mind.
Our subconscious creativity arises from

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.379
this center.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.940
Then the next group, these three small
stones and this larger one in back,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.420
are brown Botswana Agates. These are
sometimes called lavender Botswana Agates

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.119
because they do have a beautiful,
somewhat lavender tinge to the energy.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.350
So you can see there's almost a lavender
color to these.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.450
These are known to help

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.890
stimulate meditation and deeper levels
of awareness.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.700
The next group of Botswana's are the pink
Botswana's.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.189
These are known for their ability to
regenerate tissue growth

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.299
after tissue damage, so they're fantastic
for people recovering from

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.040
surgery or who have recently had
stitches. They're also

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.250
deeply connected with the female
reproductive organs and with fertility,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.340
so they're wonderful to use to enhance
fertility in both men and women.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.540
This last grouping is very intensely
colored stones that are almost similar

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.570
to the color of Rhodochrosite,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.670
are in-between the color of the pink
and the apricot Botswana.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.670
So they exhibit a combination of the
healing properties.
