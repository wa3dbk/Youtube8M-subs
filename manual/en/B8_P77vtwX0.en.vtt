00:00:03.562 --> 00:00:06.023
This is actually some kind of scoop for us,

00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:10.028
...it is not the smallest car that we've driven, 
because that was the Smart.

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.893
But, it is the cheapest and least powerful car for us so far.

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:17.094
I'm not sure if this is the most efficient one..
Well, I don't think so.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.951
up! with the p extra emphasized, 
because of the exclamation mark behind it.

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:28.079
This is actually a comeback 
for Volkswagen in the small car segment.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.845
A real Volkswagen which must be compact
 and affordable for everyone.

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:40.724
After Volkswagen introduced the Lupo,
it seems that they lost this segment out of sight.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:42.982
This while the small car segment 
is really popular in the Netherlands,

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:50.942
... with for example the C1, Aygo, Fiat Panda, Kia Picanto
and a lot of other boxes.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:56.871
Most of them are (in the Netherlands) free of road tax,
have a reasonable price and are quite efficient.

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:04.304
They are also designed for four persons,
but that's not entirely true.

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:07.946
Everything is very compact,
so there's not a lot of space available.

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:14.658
There are also things on which Volkswagen
wanted to save money.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:24.228
For example: there are power windows installed,
but I'm only able to control my own window.

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:29.954
But the up! also comes with something cool:
a Personal Information Device.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.422
In other words: a navigation unit.

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:36.219
You can place it on your dashboard 
and take it off as you wish.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.006
We're already familiar with a system like this,
which you can buy at every car accessory shop.

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.910
The only difference with those systems
is that this one is more integrated in your car.

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.475
So it's possible to display the tachometer,

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:54.052
...or a very needless program called Blue-trainer
which displays how efficient you're driving.

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:57.594
I don't understand the program at all,
so it's probably pretty worthless..

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:00.733
Something innovative in this segment
is City Emergency Braking.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:03.862
This system is able to brake independently, 
when driving under 30 km/h (19 mph),

00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:06.267
... when an object is in the way.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.448
And this is very applicable in Rome!

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:18.810
The engines are all of the type lawn mower.

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.369
There are 3 cylinder engines with 60 or 75 hp.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:28.951
The woman behind the counter said 
that she gave me the 75 hp edition,

00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:32.605
... but I doubted so much, that I decided
to look it up in the car registration papers.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:38.746
That pointed out that she was right,
but it's not a bowl of fire at all.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:45.599
The sprint from 0-60 mph takes 13.2 seconds,
which is what we are going to test next.

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.959
It takes some time though,
so you can do something for yourself if you like..

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:05.135
Do you have, for me:
from the candy, the chocolate letter?

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:07.827
You don't?

00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:08.428
That's a pity.

00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:10.514
Cookie?

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:29.643
You're probably very curious what the price is..

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:35.591
Well, you're already driving the Take up!
with 60 hp for 8.500 euro.

00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:37.631
If you want more hp, than you can get 75 hp.

00:03:37.632 --> 00:03:39.985
This is, by the way, an unnoticeable difference..

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:49.227
The 75 hp edition is called the Move up! and
costs a considerable amount of money: 10.110 euro.

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:54.268
And especially for the Dutch government an
edition with a lot of useless functions will be available:

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.311
The Fuck up!

00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.802
It drives and steers pretty good.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.484
It's of course not a mega sportive car,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:08.551
...but for a small car like this: pretty comfortable,
even on these Roman roads.

00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:14.981
This makes the up! the best car that I've ever driven
that has an exclamation mark in the name.
