00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.621
Science fiction writers, film makers.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.070
They haven't imagined what we're able to do today.

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:12.217
We've been experimenting with something here.

00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:15.237
I'd like you to meet a boy, called Milo.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.985
He's a character that can recognize us.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:23.819
He can recognize our faces, he can recognize our 
 voices, he can recognize emotions in us.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:27.888
And this is Claire, she's going to introduce you to Milo.

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:29.757
Claire: 
Hi Milo, how're you doing?

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:31.564
Milo: 
Hi Claire, you okay?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.700
Claire: 
Actually, I'm a bit nervous.

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:36.058
Milo: 
You? Nervous? I don't believe it.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.139
Claire: 
This is the first time that thousands 
 of people are going to see this.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.850
Milo: 
Thousands of people?

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:48.144
Molyneux: 
Here we're seeing Claire being recognized, and 
 the emotion in Clare's voice being recognized.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:51.215
And that emotion being reflected in Milo's face.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:53.689
Those are all being seen for the first time.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:57.733
Claire: 
So listen, I was thinking that you could 
 let me beat you at football again...

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.190
Claire: 
That is, if you finished your homework.

00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:03.488
Claire: 
You have finished your school project?

00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:09.505
Molyneux: 
What happened there is that Claire knew Milo so well.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.090
Molyneux: 
She knew when he was worried about something, the head 
 was down, he wasn't looking at the camera so much.

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.461
And this is about you meeting a character, a person.

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:22.528
Claire: 
Well, why don't I help you with yours', then yours' will be brilliant.

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:25.174
Milo: 
Hmm... alright

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Milo: 
I could just try to catch some fish, and draw some 
 pictures in my journal. Maybe I'd do okay this time.

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.114
Claire: 
I think that's a good idea.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.900
Milo: 
Lift off!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
Milo: 
Don't know until I try, do I?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.940
Claire: 
Exactly.

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:42.980
Milo: 
See, I've got everything we need.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.120
Claire: 
Great, let's get started then.

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:47.160
Milo: 
You've gotta put these goggles on.

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:48.350
Claire: 
Goggles?

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
Milo: 
Put 'em on like this.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.590
Claire: 
Okay... well... like that?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.830
Molyneux: 
Claire has been thrown a pair of goggles, 
 notice what she did? This wasn't acted.

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:03.420
She felt the need to reach down, for those goggles.

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:08.440
Now, everybody, every single person that has experienced this reaches down.

00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:12.180
Because, they feel so connected to Milo's world.

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.660
Claire: 
Cool, so what are we doing? 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.000
Claire: 
Do I have to stand at the edge?

00:02:20.777 --> 00:02:25.550
Milo: 
Go on, put your hands in. It's not too cold.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.510
Milo: 
*laughter* I bet the fish think you're a monster.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.560
Claire: 
Cheeky!

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.000
Milo: 
Swish the water around a bit.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.340
Milo: 
See if you can catch a fish.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.440
Molyneux: There Claire is, in MIlo's world. She's in that pond.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:54.490
Molyneux: 
Every hand movement is being recognized; being able to touch, 
 fish, being able to swish the water with her hand.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300
Everyone who's experienced it, the hairs are standing 
 up on the back of their head.

00:02:58.538 --> 00:03:02.090
Molyneux: 
Now, what's about to happen, is some real magic.

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:04.140
Claire: 
Well, you're good at drawing.

00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:06.910
Milo: 
They're only fish. But, they're trickier than you think.

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:08.510
Claire: 
Well, here, I'll have a go.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:15.620
Claire: 
Right. I'm gonna do a body, and a tail, and a big fin...

00:03:15.687 --> 00:03:20.690
Claire: 
And a smiley face. There we go, what do you think?

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.100
Molyneux: 
Look at what just happened.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.790
Milo: 
Orange.

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:25.130
Molyneux: 
Claire drew a picture on a piece of paper.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.200
The piece of paper was held up to Milo.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:34.500
Natal recognized the piece of paper, scanned the piece of paper in.

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:38.520
Milo looked at that piece of paper, recognized the shape, recognized the color.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.560
Molyneux: And able to get on with his project.

00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:44.780
Molyneux: 
This is true technology, that science fiction has not even written about.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.280
Molyneux: 
And this works, today, now.
