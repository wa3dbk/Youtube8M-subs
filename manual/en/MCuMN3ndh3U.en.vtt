00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:04.991
In Terry Goodkind’s new book, The Law of Nines,

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:15.246
the hero saves a beautiful woman who’s being attacked by large men.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Very funny. Stop pulling my chain and tell me the real plot.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Sir, that is the real plot. And…

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The hero’s name is Alex Rahl. The story takes place in the town of Orden.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And the large men are driving a plumbing truck flying a pirate flag.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Everyone who isn’t a fan of Goodkind leave the room.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is a FUCKLOAD OF CRAP!

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:14.055
What sort of scam Goodkind trying to pull?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That’s the exact same plot as his first book!

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:21.055
Fuck, that’s the same plot as ALL of his books!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What sort of hack steals from himself?!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I bought that man’s books for over a decade.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Not softbacks, either, but hardbacks!

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.950
Now he expects me to buy it AGAIN under a different name?! FUCK!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I’m sure there’s original material in the book-

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Pirate plumbers do not count as original material!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
But the important human themes-

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Stuff those important human themes up your ass!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.666
That’s where Goodkind got them from in the first place!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.800
I defended that douchebag against h8ters on the internet!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.400
I stood by that man even after the evil chicken.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.550
Even after the boring masturbatory philosophical speeches!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I flamed anyone who said Goodkind used way too many deus ex machina!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I was such a fucking tool!

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I even said I thought Betty the fucking wonder goat was cool!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.500
I’m through with Goodkind!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.000
I’d rather read Das Kapital fanfiction written by Stalin!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I TiVoed that awful TV series AND I ordered the first season DVDs.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I feel so stupid.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
At least I didn’t even make a bigger ass of myself.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I’ve had a girl slaving to make a costume of my favorite character for the next FurCon.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:55.500
It will be a cold day in Hell before I cosplay as Gratch now!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
If you let out the waist, Goering might buy the outfit.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Goodkind’s not getting another penny from me.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Cancel my amazon.com preorder.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Get me that Twilight series everyone is talking about.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I hear the books are about vampires.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I’m in the mood for some horror. No one
 can screw up a good vampire novel.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Vampires are inherently cool.
