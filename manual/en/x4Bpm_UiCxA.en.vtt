I'm Jonathan Ayres with Network for Success
and today we're going to talk about how to

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.009
make a printer wireless. This is a very interesting
question and I know that today's age of wireless

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.340
everything we want to know "well, gee can
we make our printers wireless?" Well, yes

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.980
you can but let's talk about what the choices
are and how the easy way is to do it as opposed

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.790
to a hard way. What's the easiest way to make
a printer wireless? The easiest way is to

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.590
buy a printer that is wireless. It's already
set up by the manufacturer with a wireless

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.280
module in it. You bring it home. You plug
it in. You connect it to your network. You

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.220
give it a name and then you can access it
on your home network from whatever computer

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.840
is connected to that home network. Well, let's
say for example, you have a computer and it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.280
connected to your home network and then you
want to connect to your current printer wireless.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.350
How do you do that? Well, let's think about
this for a minute. Here's what your going

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.570
to need in order to be able to do that. First
of all, you're going to have to have a wireless

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.850
router in order to broadcast wirelessly inside
your house. Here's an example of a wireless

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.650
router. This is probably one of the most common
routers ever made in the United States. It's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.470
a Linksys model and when you plug your computer
and your printer and anything else into this.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.799
You will broadcast those devices onto a network.
If you set yourself up that way. So, how would

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.909
we use this to connect to a printer to broadcast
wirelessly? Well, here's the next step you

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.560
have to think about. Your printer has to be
able to connect to the back of a wireless

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.210
router. How do we do that? We do that by cable
and that cable is called an ethernet cable.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.720
Here's an ethernet cable. This ethernet cable
is connected on one end to a printer and we

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.009
are going to take the other end and plug in
right into the back of this Linksys wireless

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.379
router. So, we're going to plug that into
here and because the printer is ready to go

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.829
onto the network because it has an ethernet
cable. It's going to be very easy for it to

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.870
become wireless using this router. What's
going to happen is it's going to go onto the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.560
network and we're going to give it a name
and an address. Then you're going to be able

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.129
to use that printer from whatever computer
you have in your house wirelessly. Now, what

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.939
if your computer is a wireless computer but
your printer does not have a network cable

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:43.159
like this ethernet cable? Well, in that case
your printer is going to be connecting to

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.590
your computer by a USB cable most likely,
could be another cable but that's probably

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.430
what it is. Can you connect this to operate
wirelessly? It's going to be very difficult

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.090
and I would recommend not to do it that way.
Instead, get a wireless printer or a printer

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.200
that is network ready.
