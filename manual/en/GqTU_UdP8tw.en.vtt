Your church has a mission, and The City can
help you accomplish it by making it easy for

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.650
you to organize, lead, and equip each group
in your church to be more effective in ministry!

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.380
After all, The City was built specifically
for the church, so it gives every group in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.700
your church a private space where they can
interact in life and ministry throughout the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.700
week.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.220
When you start something in a group, it will
be posted in The City and sent out by email,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.780
so it’s easy for group leaders to keep everyone
in the loop. So, when someone in your group

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.040
knows of a need and posts it in The City,
you’ll be notified, and you’ll be able

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.610
to respond right away -- even right from email
 -- to let them know that you can help meet

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.300
the need. Other people in your group can respond,
too, and The City will keep the details organized

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.070
for you. People who sign up to help will even
get a reminder email the day before they’re

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.070
scheduled to help.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.860
Or, let’s say you want to invite everyone
in your group to come to the neighborhood

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.300
cookout you’re planning. Just post it in
The City, and everyone will be notified. You

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.119
can even make a list of things you need people
to bring, or roles you need them to fill.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.869
The City will keep track of who’s coming
and what they’re bringing and send them

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.420
a reminder email before the event, so you
can spend less time on last-minute details,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.259
and more time getting to know your neighbors.

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.260
All of this interaction happens in the privacy
of your group, so it’s easy to maintain

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.460
trust and build deeper community. Of course,
when your group needs to network with other

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.240
groups in your church, or connect with people
outside your church, The City makes that easy,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.979
too.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.310
People can even start new groups on their
own to help them connect around specific ministry

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.439
needs or shared passions. And with built-in
oversight and reporting, you’ll always know

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.859
the pulse of life in specific groups and your
church as a whole!

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.289
The City makes it easy for you to delegate
authority and provide oversight. You’ll

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.130
know how many people are engaged in community,
and be able to measure how engaged they are.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.479
The City even lets you create custom metrics
for evaluating the health of your groups.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.090
Your mission doesn’t end with community.
But The City makes it easy for you to organize,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.820
lead, and equip all the groups in your church,
so you can accomplish your mission.
