00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:04.472
(piano music)

00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:08.403
Steven: At the Museum of Modern Art there
is this tiny painting by Salvador Dali,

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.777
which is the painting that
everybody wants to see.

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:14.760
That and Starry Night by
Van Gogh are the two stars.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.112
We thought it would be really
interesting to talk about why this
painting is so wildly popular.

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:23.604
This is the Persistence of
Memory by Salvador Dali.

00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:27.388
Sal: And here I understand why
people kind of connect to it now.

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:30.129
I mean anybody who has
ever tried to make an album

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.704
for a rock band is
inspired by Salvador Dali.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.306
There is also this kind of fun
of, "What are you looking at?"

00:00:37.306 --> 00:00:39.434
is really playing with reality.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.097
It's kind of like a visual brain teaser.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:43.263
Steven: Is that it? Is it so popular?

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:49.639
Is it on album cover art because
it's this attack on the rational
and that's such a seductive idea?

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.657
Sal: Yeah, it's mind trippy.

00:00:51.657 --> 00:00:53.826
I like the way you put it.
It's an attack on the rational.

00:00:53.826 --> 00:00:57.565
I guess I don't ... There might
be more to it. That's my sense.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:02.799
Steven: You know, you were
talking about album cover art
and posters in maybe a dorm room.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.707
What's interesting is that these artists
took these ideas really seriously.

00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:09.773
This was Surrealism.
This was painted in 1931.

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:13.411
Dali, the Spanish artist,
this Catalin Artist,

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.981
had just come to Paris and had
joined the Surrealist group.

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:20.810
Sal: I'm assuming he's
considered significant because
he was the first person

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.956
to essentially do dreamscapes, and as
you mentioned, attack on the rational.

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:29.778
Steven: When you walk into this painting
visually, you enter into this really deep

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:34.009
open and lonely space, and
is this really quiet image.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.633
Sal: Yeah it's kind of this desert-scape,
ignoring the melting clocks for a moment,

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:44.264
you feel that okay if you
were in this landscape, yes,
time really does not really

00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:48.350
carry a lot of weight. You
could just kind of wither there
and die and no one would care.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.572
Even that kind of water in the background.

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:51.949
There's no waves in it.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:53.538
It's like they've had time to settle down.

00:01:53.538 --> 00:01:55.024
There's literally no activity.

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.245
Steven: There's this
unbearable sense of quiet.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:02.306
There is almost no movement and I think
it does feel very desert-like, very hot.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.478
Literally time has melted, right?

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.834
But we have this absurd environment.

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.768
We do have this very
naturalistic rendering

00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:11.969
but the things that are being rendered

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.611
are not naturalistic at all.

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.566
You mentioned the dead tree on the left

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:19.889
but it's growing out of
something that seems clearly
man-made or at least geometric,

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.454
a table top perhaps.

00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:24.776
You have ants that seem
to be eating and attracted

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:28.892
to a piece of metal as opposed
to a piece of rotted flesh.

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:31.197
Sal: Oh that's what that is.
I couldn't fully make it out.

00:02:31.197 --> 00:02:34.044
Okay so they're eating away at a
time piece. That's fascinating.

00:02:34.044 --> 00:02:36.389
Steven: And of course you
have the drooping clocks.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.002
And that's such an interesting
and provocative idea

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.210
because time is something
that is so regimented.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:49.307
Time is something that rules us,
that is so associated with the
industrial culture that we live in,

00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:51.530
and here it responds to the environment

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.780
as we respond to the environment.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.012
Sal: Well one you have that tabletop.

00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:58.148
There's another one in the background.

00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:01.195
And even the way the light is
set up, especially on the cliff,

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:03.433
it looks like it's sunset
so it's kind of like,

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.118
"Hey another day has passed, who cares?"

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:08.273
Steven: Now there are
some identifiable things.

00:03:08.273 --> 00:03:10.771
For all the absurdity and
for all of the impossibility

00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:15.516
of what we're seeing, there
are some things that our
historians have recognized.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:21.767
The cliffs in the back are,
we think, the cliffs of the
Catalonian coast in Northern Spain

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:25.395
where Dali is from and so
this is his childhood perhaps.

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:31.840
Some art historians have
concluded that that strange
figure, almost a profile face.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.304
Can you make out an eye with
extremely long lashes and
perhaps a tongue under the nose?

00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:39.588
Sal: This is the whole
optical illusion part of Dali.

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:42.805
Yeah I thought it was a blanket but
now I completely see the eyelashes.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.030
I thought it was a duck for a second too.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.618
I see the eyelashes and the top of a nose.

00:03:48.618 --> 00:03:53.536
Steven: Yeah, Dali does that
fun thing where one object can
actually be several things at once,

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:55.409
sometimes really convincingly.

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.224
Some art historians think this is his face
but elusive and very much a kind of dream.

00:04:00.224 --> 00:04:05.688
Sal: That goes back in the category of is
this more that kind of dorm room optical

00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:07.454
illusion type art.

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:09.664
Steven: Well that's right.

00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:12.437
Surrealism positive to that, the rational
world that we have so much faith in,

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:15.868
was perhaps not worthy of all that faith.

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:18.650
The irrational was just as important

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.505
but was something that we had sublimated.

00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.277
Something that we had tried
to drive out of our life.

00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:27.234
And the way that these artists
and writers thought about it

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.194
was if only they could retrieve
the world of the dream.

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.101
Some of the artists have read Freud.

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:35.232
Some of them had only heard sort
of secondhand accounts of Freud.

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:38.116
But the idea that the dream was a place

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.781
where the irrational mind
came to the fore unrestricted.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.555
Sal: This is something
that often confronts me.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:47.298
Even the notions that how
we perceive what we think

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:50.401
is objective reality is really
based on how our brain is wired.

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.760
We see these causes and effects.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.428
We see linear time. This
is how humans are wired.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:57.808
I think that's what's fun
about these type of things.

00:04:57.808 --> 00:05:03.794
Look, there are different forms of reality
and who are we as creatures that are wired

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:06.864
one particular way to be all that
judgmental about what's real.

00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:10.091
Steven: When people have looked at
this painting they have sometimes,

00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.872
I think unconvincingly, tried to
link it to fine signs earlier,

00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:16.213
ideas of the ...

00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:17.974
Sal: Time dilation.

00:05:17.974 --> 00:05:20.528
Steven: Exactly and time in
fact was not a strict thing.

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:24.084
I think there is more evidence
that Dali is thinking about,

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:26.731
ideas of a philospher's
name who is Berkson,

00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:31.267
who thought about time as something that
was not simply what struck on a clock,

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:34.337
but that there was something
that kind of unit of time

00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:37.205
that was more subjective and
that expanded and contracted

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:39.276
according to our experience.

00:05:39.276 --> 00:05:41.884
Sal: Time is this thing
that sometime scares us.

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:45.216
We completely don't understand it, even
though it's kind of the most fundamental

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:47.044
component of our existence.

00:05:47.044 --> 00:05:48.792
We fundamentally don't understand it.

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:50.502
We try to measure it out.

00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:54.624
We try to constrain it and define it
in some way that makes sense to us.

00:05:54.624 --> 00:05:58.427
Actually I think that's what
this piece is maybe trying to do.

00:05:58.427 --> 00:06:00.660
It's like, "Look these clocks are stupid."

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.572
These are just our futile
attempts to try to label.

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:04.047
It's kind of like if you label something

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:05.666
or you measure something,

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.648
you feel like you actually
understand it even though you don't.

00:06:07.648 --> 00:06:09.458
Steven: I think this is that moment when

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:12.260
all of those safe ideas
of objectivity are being

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.919
blown out of the water
and we're seeing an art

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.205
that is in some really
interesting ways confronting that.

00:06:17.205 --> 00:06:21.205
(piano music)
