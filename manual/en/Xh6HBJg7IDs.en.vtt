00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.230
Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.100
Over a year ago, I did a tutorial on
an earlier version of Photoshop

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.449
showing how to put a face and name onto paper money.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.910
In this tutorial, I'll show you how to do
it quicker

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.320
and better.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.619
I provided a Photoshop file for you to
download, so you can follow along.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.470
Its link is located in the video's
description or project files.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.130
It includes this ten thousand dollar
bill template

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.230
and a channel in which you can use to
place your engraved portrait into.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.350
As before,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
I'll use the actor, Zach Galifianakis in the
place of honor.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.600
Open a photo of someone you'd like to
place into the bill.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
It can be color or black and white.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.100
If your photo is in color,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.100
desaturate it by pressing Ctrl + Shift + U on a PC

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.210
or Cmd + Shift + U on a Mac.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.790
We need to make a selection around the
head and shoulders so we can cut it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.659
out from its background.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.659
I covered how to do this in many of my
other tutorials,

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.280
so choose the method that's the easiest
and most effective for you.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.270
Once you make the selection,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.740
press Ctrl + J on a PC or Cmd + J
on a Mac...

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.060
to cut and copy it from the background...

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.860
and place it onto its own layer.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.170
Type in the name of the person.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.760
Click on your new layer button to
make a new layer.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.420
We'll fill it with white...

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.160
and since white is the background color,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.000
press Ctrl + Delete on a PC or Cmd + Delete on a Mac.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.020
Click on your foreground color

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.460
and type in 50% for the
Brightness.  Then click, OK.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.229
Now...

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.159
your foreground color is 50%
gray.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.900
To fill the layer with the foreground
color, press Alt + Delete on a PC...

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.610
or Opt + Delete on a Mac.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880
We'll make the foreground and background
colors...

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280
default to black and white, respectively...

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.510
by clicking on this overlapping box icon

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.629
or by pressing "d" on your keyboard.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.570
At the top,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.919
go to Filter and Filter Gallery.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.059
Open your Sketch folder

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.729
and choose, Halftone pattern.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.989
Make the Size, 1...

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.349
the Contrast, 50...

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.630
and the Pattern Type,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.499
Line.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:35.790
Then, click OK.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.619
Go back to Filter...

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:41.529
Distort and Wave.

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.189
Make the number of generators, 1...

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.309
the Wavelength, 159 and 160...

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.900
the Amplitude 20 and 48...

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.799
the Scale

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.469
100%...

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.419
the Type, Sine...

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:03.419
and Repeat Edge Pixels for the Undefined
Areas.

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.230
Ctrl-click

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.180
or Cmd-click on the thumbnail of
the person to make a selection of its

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.809
shape.

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:17.809
Click on your layer mask button to make
a new layer mask next to the active layer.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.639
Click on the thumbnail of the wavy
lines

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.739
and change its Blend Mode to Overlay.

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.300
Make a copy of the layer

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.999
by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + J.

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.950
Click off the chain link of both layers.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.099
This allows us to move or re-size the
wavy lines and the layer masks

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.389
independently of the other.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.080
Hide the original wavy line layer and press
Ctrl or Cmd + T

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.559
to open your Transform tool.

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.969
Go to a corner

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.260
and when you see a double-curved,
arrow,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.599
press and hold, Shift

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.400
as you rotate the transform

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.229
90 degrees.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.289
Press Ctrl or Cmd + Zero

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.949
to see the entire transform on your
screen.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.439
To expand it past the shoulders,

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.809
go to a corner,

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.049
and when you see a straight
double-arrow...

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.949
press and hold, Shift + Alt on a PC

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.170
or Shift + Opt on a Mac

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.130
and drag it out.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.430
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.280
Make the layer visible

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.990
an active.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.300
Hide the top layer.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.679
To make the wavy lines cover the bottom
of the body,

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.899
open your Transform tool again

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.559
and drag it out.

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.830
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.260
Make the top layer visible

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.729
and fit the document on your screen.

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.129
Click off the eyeball of the white
background to hide it.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.010
Make a composite snapshot of your image

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.000
and place it on its own layer.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.089
To do this,

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.619
first, make the top layer active

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:01.160
and then press Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E on a
PC...

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.889
or Cmd + Shift + Opt + E on a Mac.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.410
With your Move tool,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.259
drag it to the tab of the money template.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.379
Without releasing your mouse or pen,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.940
drag it down onto the image and then,
release.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.080
Open your Channels panel

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.319
and Ctrl-click or Cmd-click on
the inner frame thumbnail to make it

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.900
into a selection.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.479
Open back up your Layers panel

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.300
and click on the layer mask button

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.479
to make a layer mask next to the
portrait.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.890
Click off the chain link

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.889
and make the head active.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.340
To reduce its size,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.110
open your Transform tool

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.879
and fit it onto your screen.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.550
Reduce it to a size you like.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.159
To reposition it, click inside the
transform and move it.

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.539
Continue to re-size and position it until
you're happy.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.990
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.469
Next, we'll Colorize the head, so it
matches the rest of the bill.

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.479
Fit it onto your screen

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.759
and click on the Adjustment Layer button.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.300
Choose Hue Saturation.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.089
Click on the clip-to-layer icon.

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:20.879
This restricts the adjustment layer to
effect only the one layer beneath it.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.519
Colorize it

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:25.409
and make the Hue, 95...

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.710
the Saturation, 8...

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.559
and the Lightness, -3.

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:35.759
The last steps will be to add the name
onto the bottom banner.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.620
Press, "z" to open your Zoom tool

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.189
and drag across the banner to zoom into it.

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:43.950
To reposition the image,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.689
press and hold the Space bar as you
move it.

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.689
Open your horizontal type tool and
choose a font.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.519
I'm using, Legal Tender.

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:58.769
You can download it from the link I
provided in the video's description or

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:00.489
project files.

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:02.980
If you're not sure how to install fonts,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.629
watch my tutorial on how to do this.

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:08.099
I provided that link, as well.

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.669
Make the Size, 11 points...

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.079
Smooth...

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:14.020
Center Alignment...

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.889
and black for the color.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.160
Click below the center of the banner

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.629
and type in a name.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.739
Click on the Text Warp button.

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:28.900
Make the style,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.550
Horizontal...

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.949
and the Bend, 25%.

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.099
Then, click OK.

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.549
Click on your Move tool...

00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:40.169
go to, View...

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.000
and make sure "Snap" is not checked.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.929
If it is, simply click on it.

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:48.720
Center your text on the banner.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.659
Reduce its opacity to 85%...

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:57.020
and fit it back onto your screen.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.250
Have fun putting someone you know

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.050
onto paper money.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.770
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.250
Thanks for watching!
