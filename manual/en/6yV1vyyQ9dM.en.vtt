00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.380
This is a cluster of 100,000 stars.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.560
We see stars that are a bit yellow, like the sun. We see stars that are red, which are cooler than the sun.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.120
We see stars that are blue, which are hotter than the sun. And in some sense,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.240
the whole story of stellar evolution, if you like, is encapsulated here in this cluster.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm Dr.Mario Livio, I am an astrophysicist here at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.193
This is institute that runs the scientific program of the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.020
and it will run the scientific program of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.060
I've been here for more than twenty years, twenty-some years.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.720
I'm a theorist: I don't work with the screws of the telescope, I work with the science that comes out from the telescope.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.820
I definitely wasn't one of those amateur astronomers that, you know, in childhood already had a telescope or was looking at the stars.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.840
We were a fairly poor family and I never had a telescope as a child. But I was a very curious child, there is no question about that.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.900
I was interested in everything and I was reading almost everything I could read.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.500
In particular, what maybe was a little bit unusual was that I used to read entire encyclopedias. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.080
So I would read all the volumes, you know, one volume after the next of encyclopedias. I was very interested in many things.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.460
I didn't know that I will become an astrophysicist. I liked mathematics, very very much.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.340
I did actually a masters thesis, and I did that actually in theoretical particle physics. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.760
And only from a PhD I went into astrophysics.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.600
Now, as it so happens, the two fields of the very small, the subatomic world, particle physics, 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.240
and of the very large, of astrophysics, have now become so close together - in studying the early universe and so on - 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.673
that it almost doesn't matter anymore if you came originally from particle physics or astrophysics. 

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:26.153
We're dealing more or less with the same questions now.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.300
When the Universe started,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.640
there was only hydrogen, helium and little bit, traces, of a few other things like lithium and so on.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.400
All the materials that we know and love - carbon, oxygen, iron - all these things that make our bodies,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.060
They were made inside stars: Inside the hot furnaces of the centers of stars.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.500
Like the Sun and more massive than the Sun.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.913
So what happens is that those stars, they fuse those elements from hydrogen and helium,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.840
they fuse them together and they make all those elements - iron and oxygen and carbon and all those things.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.440
Then when those stars explode, or when they eject their outer layers, they eject those materials into interstellar space.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.440
From those materials that now formed, new stars and planets are being born, including our solar system,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.680
including the building of us, from those elements. 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.800
So every atom in my body was once at the center of some star. 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.420
Plus, some atoms in my body may have been in this star and others may have been in that star.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:58.140
As we advanced in our knowledge of the Universe, we realized that our physical existence in the Universe becomes less and less significant. 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.160
We live on a small planet which is around a very ordinary star,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.420
of which there are hundreds of billions of such stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.200
The Hubble Space Telescope has shown us that in the observable Universe alone, there are something like 200 billion galaxies.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.740
So we are very very small in that respect.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:29.300
We now even talk about the possibility that our entire Universe is just one member of a huge ensemble of Universes.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.673
So in that respect certainly our physical existence has become less and less significant. 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:45.040
However, there is something in all of this that makes us actually very significant - and that is that we have discovered all that!
