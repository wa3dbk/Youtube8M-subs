00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.810
Hello my name is Christine Picheca. As a food
expert and chef, I get very excited for the

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.970
holiday season

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.370
and it's fast approaching.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.400
What better way to kick off this special time
of year then to celebrate with some peanut

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.580
inspired recipes that are tasty and healthy?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.510
Drop in guests are the best, especially around
the holiday season.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.500
And it’s nice to have something on hand
to serve with a drink.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
These dressed up peanuts go perfectly with
beers or with cocktails.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.339
To begin, in a medium bowl, I’m going to
whisk one large egg white just until it’s

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:36.339
frothy.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:44.030
And to this add a quarter of a cup of sugar,
a teaspoon of kosher salt, a teaspoon of dry

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.210
thyme leaves and ¾ teaspoon of cayenne pepper
and garlic powder.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.399
Just whisk this all together so that its really
nice and combined.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.879
This is going to be the spice mix on the peanuts.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.640
Now we’re going to add two cups of unsalted
peanuts.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.110
You’re going to want to stir these till
the peanuts are all nice and evenly coated.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:20.010
Next, these peanuts are going to go onto a
baking sheet lined with parchment paper,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.630
and you just want to spread them on here.
Then pop the peanuts onto a 300 degree F oven.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.229
And they’re going to roast for 20 to 25
minutes.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.810
Just give them a stir every 10 minutes or
so.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.479
You want to break the peanuts up and keep
them from sticking together.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.680
You know they’re done when the peanuts are
golden brown and the mixture is barely sticky.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.560
Let these cool completely and just make sure
to break up any peanuts that might be stuck

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
together.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.729
You can store the peanuts in an air tight
container for a couple of weeks. You will

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.329
always have a welcome snack on hand for drop
in friends and family.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.859
Thank you so much for watching. I hope these
tasty peanut cocktails canapés make your

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.710
next holiday party a great success.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.380
And remember, its easy to incorporate more
peanut goodness into your diet.
