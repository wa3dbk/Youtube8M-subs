00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.800
Omega-3 Fatty Acids

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.649
Now, ah, an essential fatty acid

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.669
like an essential amino acid the
essential part means you have to get it from diet

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.319
because your body can't make it.

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:20.529
And so there are two very important
essential fatty acids left

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.769
in terms of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.289
brain function

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.669
also have an impact on cardiovascular
functioning as well but we're

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.370
talking about psychiatry here, so Omega-3 and Omega-6 and it's certainly not that one is bad and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.470
the other one's good.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.690
they're both absolutely essential for
building and maintaining an operational

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880
nervous system, okay.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.400
Omega-3 fatty acids you see can come
from ah,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.240
seed and nut oils, flaxseed oil, or walnut oil
or fish oil

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.620
and Omega-6

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.970
you get from seed and nut oil, and
this the main source right here is corn oil.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.170
Ninety percent foods and regular
grocery stores processed food

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.430
and ninety percent of processed food has corn oil and sometimes soybean oil in it.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.229
I made some coffee, ah,

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.830
during lunchtime

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.790
What's the main ingredient?  Corn syrup.  Corn syrup (something).

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.170
Go to your grocery store, go to your pantry.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.570
You're gonna see corn is in almost everything that's processed, okay.  And it'a   a source

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.979
of Omega-6 fatty acid.  Now

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.000
you need some of it, but Americans
are ingesting

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.360
way too much of this stuff, okay.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.220
Now, Aricadonic acid

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.600
is a form of Omega-6.  Animal
tissue which of course is meat.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.420
But you know another major source of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.689
of,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.549
animal tissue is

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.190
my favorite snack food when I was a kid Hostess Twinkies.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.400
Not any more, okay.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.540
Maybe once a year

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.050
But you look on there,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.950
white bleached flour

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.530
sugar, okay.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.140
The third ingredient is called animal shortening.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.520
Now what is animal shortening?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.729
Lard!  That's right.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.780
yeah and i have a friend of mine who's a vegetarian and she'll eat
a Hostess Cupcake or

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.249
Twinkie and I'll say, you know you're eating animal right now, you just don't know it. Oh, my God, you're right!  So,

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.799
okay and here's a problem and
that is that

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.629
it's not just adding Omega 3 but
It's reducing Omega-6 and the

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.219
average American

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.139
the ratio of 3:6 is probably somewhere about 1:20

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.079
like way too much Omega-6, okay.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.199
So when we look at strategies for treating mood disorders with Omega-3 fatty acids, it's

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.809
not only increasing Omega-3, but

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:51.609
it's decreasing, pretty dramatically, Omega-6, okay.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.639
The original studies include bipolar
disorder

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.760
and with bipolar, it's

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.689
turning out not to really be very helpful.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.549
This is just uh... trivia but the first
studies they did showed up a little bit

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.950
of efficacy

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.149
they're having people take fish oil capsules

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:15.199
they took nine grams, and so
these fish oil  capsules were

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.759
five hundred milligrams so they'd be taking 18 of these a day

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:23.849
And they got diarrhea and upset stomach, and they gained weight, and when they burped they smelled

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.339
like dead fish and you know.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.329
And then they found out it actually didn't really work that well.  Too bad.  okay.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.939
Now

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.259
but where you really see some

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:39.669
efficacy showing up is in two areas.  One is  depression

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.819
and the other is impulsivity.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.979
So here ah,

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:49.909
bad news for vegetarians the Omega-3 fatty acids are derived from

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.749
seed and nut oil

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.489
has decreased by availability in the brain.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.780
In plain English it just

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.480
doesn't yet through the blood brain barrier very well.
It's okay to help

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.679
cardiovascular

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:02.639
health, okay

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.829
In fact the American Heart Association says take a gram a day of Omega-3 fatty acids

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.970
It's fine for keeping your arteries

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.539
in good shape and that kind of stuff.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.349
But in terms of having an effect on the brain, ah,

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.669
it just doesn't cut it.  And I don't have a slide

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.360
here in this class.  I have one in one of the other classes I

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.520
teach

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.350
shows that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.070
people that eat three servings of fish
per week have significantly

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.189
decreased rates of depression and
dementias, you know.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:37.799
And this is the Mediterranean diet and you know there's a lot of support for this.  So, now

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.050
in treating

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.129
depression studies depends on which study
it is but you're looking at total one

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.439
or two grams a day, okay.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:53.169
The studies, all of these studies are Add-on studies, meaning they're in addition to an antidepressent

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.340
we'll see in a minute.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.969
sometimes just alone could make a
difference

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.899
Yeah, in this one here, look at this.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.659
this was no antidepressants at all.
these were depressed women who are

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.539
pregnant, okay.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.150
Eight weeks double-blind, placebo-controlled

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.150
and it's a total of
three grams basically.  Total of 3.4

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.319
grams of Omega-3 fatty acids.  And look at the difference

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.519
between the Omega-3 and Placebo and that
is statistically significantly different

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.840
and here in terms of full remission
thirty eight percent

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.590
it's good for your fetus, too

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.920
so

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.689
you know, this is one of those things says

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.199
this is too good to be true , we'll see a replication.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.419
looks promising

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.739
If you eat too much of it you could get some diarrhea.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:44.679
Taken with food you get a little bit of nausea.
ginger root or the best thing you can do is drink

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.680
glass of gin ale or eat a ginger snap.  Ginger
calms down some of that nausea that might

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.589
pause for this.

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:55.840
And mercury you don't have to worry about it
if it's got that that approval

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.900
Now, let's take a look at this.  Where did I buy this fish oil?

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.650
Costco, that's right.  Very good.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.559
Okay

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:07.179
let's see here, a thousand milligrams

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.739
which is a gram, okay, now

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:13.439
okay, that's good right - I don't have to worry about mercury

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.669
that's good.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.870
but let's take a close look here.  Wait just a minute... a thousand milligrams

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.330
Natural fish oil concentrate

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.099
if you take two thousand milligrams,

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.069
it contains

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.330
only a total of five hundred milligrams of

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.569
Omega-3 fatty acids

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.609
You can take two of these pills and you get that.  so that means if you're gonna take a gram you're gonna have to take

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:42.599
four-a--day

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.550
Now, is this false advertising?  Not exactly, but kind of.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.789
this is the weight of the pill

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.330
and this is this dose of Omega-3.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.000
Get it?  So you've got to look on the back

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.490
and do the math.
