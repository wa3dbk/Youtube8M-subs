00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.549
For most dog owners that pet is a loved and valued member of the family, and just as a family member,

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.388
many dog owners become concerned when their pet is in pain due to surgery or old age. Now a local animal hospital is

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.409
offering a unique way to manage pain and pets. Their formula? Just add water. Fox 29's Joe Colepan reports.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.718
If Foxy here seems to be having trouble, well, you would too. The pooch is recovering from hip surgery and the aftermath hurts.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.119
We're just trying to get her to use this back leg, see how she's not using it?

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.949
And so it's up to Mary Culmary to take Foxy for a swim in one of those Endless Pools

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.469
we've all seen advertised. The pool creates its own current and once Foxy's in, her natural

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.149
instincts to dog paddle take over. Which is just what Mary wants.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.979
She gets daily swims for, you know, muscle buildup, and she's doing pretty good. Every time she swims, she gets a little more comfortable.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.370
When her, when she has better

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.390
control and more power in her leg,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.970
it'll feel better to her. And feeling better is the whole point. The Endless Pool is part of the new hydrotherapy unit for dogs,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.080
located here at the Windcrest Animal Hospital in Wilmington. Just like with um, with people physical therapy after

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.419
surgeries, orthopedic type surgeries, can make a big difference in both the rate of recovery and the extent of recovery. This sort of hydrotherapy is

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.089
relatively new for Rover and very few animal hospitals have this kind of equipment.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.119
Therefore people and their dogs are coming to Windcrest from Southern Jersey, and Philadelphia,

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.359
even as far as the hinterlands of Maryland.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.489
It might seem a bit much to some but if you've ever had a pet in pain

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.940
it seems just right. And I bet if Fred could say so he'd tell those doubters "Hey. You're all wet!"

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960
