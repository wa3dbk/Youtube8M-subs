00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:34.210
Here we have a fifty inch Panasonic plasma
TV, model number TC-P50X5.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.680
In this video we are going to go over what
symptoms can possibly be caused by a bad power

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.030
supply board and how to replace that board
in this Panasonic plasma TV.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.260
Most Panasonic plasma TVs have the X Sustain
board and the power supply board separate,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.710
but on this TV they have added the X Sustain
onto the power supply board.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.679
There are also other model numbers that have
the X Sustain and the power supply board combined

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.219
onto one.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.360
This board is located here on the panel.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.520
Some common symptoms that could be caused
by a bad power supply board, are if your TV

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.520
has no standby and will not power up.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.590
Other symptoms can include if your TV has
backlights, has sound, but does not have a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.929
picture on the screen.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.670
One other symptom that could be caused by
this board being bad, is if you have a distorted

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.710
image on the screen.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.880
For all of these symptoms, it is recommended
to start your repair, by replacing the power

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:49.120
supply board for TVs that use the following
part numbers on the power supply.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:04.869
N0AE6JK00005
N0AE6JK00006

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.979
Be sure to take all proper safety precautions
including unplugging your TV before doing

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.140
any work.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.600
I will begin by disconnecting all of the cables
and ribbons from the board.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.230
I squeeze on the connection and then pull
it away from the board.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:35.120
Be sure to use caution when disconnecting
any cables.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.250
These last two ribbons are very fragile.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.940
We will show a video from a different board
that shows how to properly remove the ribbons.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.000
For these two ribbon cables, there are two
plastic pieces on the inside of these connections

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.160
that hold the ribbon in place.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.750
You will see them highlighted here in the
image.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.530
The plastic piece is pushed down through the
holes in the ribbon to hold it secure in place.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.610
To begin removing these ribbons, I will pinch
in on the side of the connection and pull

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.010
it out just a little bit from the board.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800
Do this very gently.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.090
Next, I will apply pressure pushing downward
so that I can release it from those plastic

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.329
pieces inside the connection that are holding
it secure.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.560
If you feel any resistance, it may be caught
and you need to put more pressure pushing

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:39.460
downward in order to release it from those
plastic pieces.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:55.810
Next, I will remove all of the screws that
secure the board to the panel and then remove

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:21.650
the board.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.790
Your board could still be holding a charge
in it and as a safety precaution, you should

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.940
lift it off of the panel by holding the aluminum
heat sinks that are highlighted on the screen.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:56.629
Now, I can put my replacement board onto the
panel and secure it in place using the screws.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:32.180
Next, I will reattach all of the cables and
ribbons to the board.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.000
Here again is a video from a different board,
showing how to reconnect the ribbons.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.290
When reinstalling the ribbon, I will want
to again, apply pressure downward, to push

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.219
it below the two plastic pieces on the inside
of the connection.

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.780
I will apply pressure down and then push it
in.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.780
Once the ribbon is in, I will then pinch the
sides again and push it back towards the board

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:15.199
to lock it 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.300
in place.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:29.380
