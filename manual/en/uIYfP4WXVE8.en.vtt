00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.970
i'm mark williams for pickup trucks.com
and we're here at the 2013 chicago auto

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.329
show for toyota has just revealed the
2014 tundra a lot of changes on the

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.890
exterior lot of changes on the interior
let's start by taking a closer look

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.640
right up front the biggest changes
you'll notice right up front a brand-new

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.950
Grill this is the personality of the new
truck its wider it's taller it's more

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.870
chiseled they want to give this new
tundra a more dominating stance and they

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.350
start with the new grill on each of the
five trim packages sr sr5 limited and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.510
two new luxury option packages the
platinum and the 1794 another key

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.940
feature for designers character lines on
the side of the 2014 tundra fender Wells

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.700
side character lines through the doors
the lower valance and especially over

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.710
the front and rear wheels they've made
special definitions with the stampings

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.760
and also included a brand-new tailgate
that incorporates a win diffuser and a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.100
very cool embossed almost bill its stamp
like tons your name on the back tailgate

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.720
as interesting as the new exterior is on
the tundra the interiors where we think

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.820
the biggest drama is happening

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.990
they've gone away from that bisected
look at the tundra started with and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
they've gone to a more t-shaped more
conventional looking interior that is a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.600
huge improvement

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.130
also in the gauge cluster huge
improvement from the big barrels they

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.030
used to have on the previous generation
we think this is going to resonate much

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.420
better with Toyota buyers and maybe a
lot of new truck buyers in the segment

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.170
as well

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.560
the other big news to new luxury trim
packages one called the Platinum a more

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.650
classy upscale almost urban feel to it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.570
the other the 1794 which is a more
Western feel that should play very well

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.050
throughout the southwest

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.730
so there you have it all new exterior
all-new interior the interior is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.510
probably the home run for us but maybe
the biggest part of the story here is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.490
what's not at this party

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.020
it's the same chassis and suspension
same set of powertrains same cab

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.020
configurations we're going to take this
as a first step in a very slow and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.090
methodical process from Toyota on
improving this new tundra and it's ok

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.560
where patients were willing to wait but
in order to play in this segment which

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.790
is getting very violent lately they're
going to need to step up their game once

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.960
again we expect that to happen maybe
next year maybe the year after

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880
but until then we'll see how this
vehicle does against the competition in

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.170
one of our future showdowns for more
information about this truck and the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.530
