00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
- HELLO, TWITCH.

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.566
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.700
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M EXCELLENT.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.533
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.233
I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE LAST WEEK,

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:08.766
SO CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE OSCARS.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.900
- THANK YOU.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.333
- INCREDIBLE.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.666
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- SUPER HILARIOUS.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.666
AMAZING.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.366
- I HAD SO MUCH FUN.

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.866
IT'S--I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT QUITE
OUT OF THAT BUILDING YET.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.333
I STILL FEEL LIKE
I'M STILL HOSTING.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.733
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT DONE OR SOMETHING.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.933
I'M VERY, VERY TIRED,
BUT IT WAS FUN,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.233
AND IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE.

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.833
- AND IS THE SELFIE
THAT STANDOUT MOMENT FOR YOU,

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.466
OR IS THERE SOMETHING
CONTENDING?

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.466
- THERE WERE SO MANY.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.600
I MEAN,
THE SELFIE WAS DEFINITELY--

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.433
THE FACT THAT
THAT MANY PEOPLE JUMPED IN,

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:41.133
'CAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.433
YOU CAN PLAN ALL YOU WANT,

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.366
BUT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE,
THEY'RE NERVOUS,

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.700
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET UP
FROM THEIR SEATS,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.600
AND IT WAS SHOCKING TO SEE
THAT THAT HAPPENED.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.700
- RIGHT.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.733
- THE PIZZA GUY, EDGAR,
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE--

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.266
I LOVE THAT GUY SO MUCH.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.400
[cheers and applause]

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.666
I LOVE HIM.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.366
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN KNOWING THAT
HE WAS GONNA END UP ON STAGE,

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.166
AND HE HAD NO IDEA THAT
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.166
- THAT'S AMAZING.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.133
- SO--AND HE TURNS OUT TO BE
THE SWEETEST GUY

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.000
WITH AN AMAZING STORY,
SO EDGAR IS MY FRIEND NOW.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
HE'S A SWEET GUY.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
- FANTASTIC.
- HE IS.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.733
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.233
SO THE SELFIE TURNED OUT TO BE,
AS WE WERE SAYING, JUST CRAZY.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.433
IT BROKE TWITTER,

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:24.633
AND IT'S BEEN RETWEETED
OVER 3 MILLION TIMES, AND...

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.933
[cheers and applause]

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:32.400
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
TAKING THEIR OWN VERSION

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
OF MY OSCAR SELFIE,
AND HERE'S JUST A FEW.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.566
THIS FIRST ONE, KEVIN SPACEY
WAS ON JIMMY KIMMEL'S SHOW

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:42.000
RIGHT AFTER THE OSCARS,
AND HE TRIED TO BREAK TWITTER.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.466
[laughter]

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.466
THEY GOT 20,000 RETWEETS.

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.066
HASHTAG NICE TRY.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.700
[laughter]

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.166
THIS WAS POSTED BY MATT GROENING
FROM "THE SIMPSONS."

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.166
THIS WAS VERY COOL.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.866
[laughter]

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.200
SOMEHOW HE REPLACED ME
WITH ANDERSON COOPER.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[laughter]

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.933
HERE'S--PEOPLE GOT CREATIVE.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.600
THIS IS THE LEGO VERSION.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.433
[laughter]

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.400
- SO COOL.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.200
- IT'S REALLY FLATTERING.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.800
AND THIS WAS TAKEN BY
THE BRITISH LABOUR PARTY

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.500
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.033
[laughter]

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.966
THEY PUT THE "PARTY"
IN "BRITISH LABOUR PARTY."

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:31.433
I'LL TELL YOU THAT,
FOR THOSE WILD AND CRAZY PEOPLE.

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:35.100
AND HERE'S A VERSION WHERE
SOMEONE REPLACED EVERYONE'S FACE

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.966
WITH KEVIN SPACEY.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:39.966
[laughter]

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.600
I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT THAT.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.333
I WANT TO STOP,
BUT I CAN'T.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:56.633
IT'S CREEPY AND WONDERFUL
AT THE SAME TIME.
