Hi I'm Angel from FleeceFun.com. Today I'm
going to show you how to make this really

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.600
cute Pinwheel Pillowcase. It's fun. It's vibrant.
It's like bringing spring inside. For this

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.940
project we're going to be using the "Very
Vibrant" Cuddle charm pack by Shannon Fabrics.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.320
So for this project you will need the following:

Ok Now that you have all those items, it's

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.079
time to get started. And basically this pillowcase
is based off of a quilt block. So conceivably

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.750
you could even just use this quilt block to
make an entire quilt if you chose to. But

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.129
today we're going to make the pillow case,
but keep in mind that if you really like it.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.860
Potential quilt idea there.
This pillow case is made up of six of these

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.860
pinwheel blocks. Each block is made up of
six 5 inch squares. First decide how you want

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.700
your entire pillow case to look like. Each
block has four squares as the base and four

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.860
“blades” (each blade is half a square)
of the pinwheel. Now that you know how you

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.860
want it laid out. Let’s make each block.
All right looking good next step.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.119
Take the two squares that will make the four
blades of the pinwheel and cut in them in

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.119
half, diagonally. You should now have four
triangles . Then using an iron son low heat

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.700
fold the triangles in half (with wrong sides
together) and press ( you might want to use

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.700
a pressing cloth for this).
Ok looking good next step

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
Layout your pinwheel. Place one blade on each
block with the longest side of the triangle

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.219
lining up with the edge of the square it’s
sitting on. Make sure all the blades are pointing

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:17.450
in the same direction. Note: On of the exposed
edges of the blade will be raw – since we

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.419
are working with a knit fabric it’s fine.
Pin and baste each blade to the square it

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:29.419
sits on using a slightly less than .5 inch
seam allowance. Then using a .5 inch seam

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:39.129
allowance, sew two of the squares together
to form a row, twice, then sew the two rows

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:00.629
together to sew a block. Trim seam bulk in
the center, and making sure blades are laying

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.299
in the correct direction, sew on the center
button. Repeat five more times to make a total

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.389
of six blocks.
Now the rule of the day is Pin. When in doubt

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.409
put in another pin. You just need to use lots
of pins. When it comes to this . And something

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.290
that I found that worked really well is especially
on the really bulky seams that you have to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.819
go accross - if you put a pin on each side
of the seam. Like rright next to it, it helps

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.819
it line up a lot easier. So just a trick I
learned. Then, Sew the blocks together.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.819
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.249
Alright it's coming together, let's keep going.
Two block isn't quite wide enough for a pillow

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.409
so we need to take six squares and cut them
in half to add a little width to each side

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:11.409
of the pillow. Take the half blocks and sew
them into two rows to match your pattern.

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:18.019
Add one two to the top and bottom of your
pinwheel blocks.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.270
To make the pillowcase long enough we will
add a column of squares to the end. This will

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.740
be four blocks tall with a half block on each
end. Sew the squares together. Taking the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.740
long column take the edge that will be end
of the pillowcase and turn on edge under .5

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.750
inch. Sew onto the end of your pinwheel blocks.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.819
Out of you solid back you will need to cut
a rectangle that is 21 by 28 inches. Turn

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:53.169
under the end of the pillowcase .5 inches
and sew using a straight stitch.

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.939
With right sides together, Sew the solid back
to the pillowcase front using a .5 inch seam

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.939
allowance. Trim your threads!

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.939
 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.939
 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.520
And You're finished! You have this beautiful

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.680
pillowcase that I'm sure will just brighten
someone's day. It's just fun. Its the embodiment

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.710
of fun. and I love how it has those flaps.
it has that 3 dimensional thing going on.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.129
And it's just really fun and happy to work
with. I'm sure it could really brighten someone's

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.729
day. Actually my little girls have been asking
me "So yo're going to make 2 of those right?"

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:42.729
I have to make 2 of everything for my kids.
