00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.059
Hi, I’m Jonah with Magnanimous Media,

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.059
and this is the Atomos Samurai. The Samurai is a 10-bit 4:2:2 HD SDI recorder.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.219
It records Apple ProRes files at three different data rates to a 2.5-inch laptop hard drive.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.730
The 800x400 pixel touch screen interface also functions as a monitor,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.720
which is certainly a benefit when comparing the Samurai to other recorders.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.610
The Samurai includes 3-2 pulldown removal, GenLock timecode, unit synchronization,

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.539
and start-stop flag record triggering, for simultaneous record,

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.600
and an extremely simple and easy-to-use interface.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.489
he Samurai is a great solution for broadcast appliance. You can use it with

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.469
an AF100 or even an EX1 or EX3.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.840
And those higher data rates are going to meet broadcast specifications.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.210
In addition to that, it shoots to an edit-ready format. You can take the Apple

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.300
ProRes straight off of this recorder and take it straight into Final Cut,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.720
so you skip all that time you would have spent transcoding before. For some cameras, this

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.590
recorder’s high data rate will eliminate

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.580
artifacting due to compression. In addition to that, the 4:2:2 color space

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.830
will give you a little bit more space with your grading, as well as make

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.940
green screen or any other chromakey a little bit easier.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.970
Another great thing about this recorder is that it allows you to modernize an

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.280
outdated camera with a modern workflow.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.480
Any camera with an SDI output can benefit from this.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.440
The Atomos Samurai package includes:

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.880
2 BNC to mini-BNC cables, SDI cable,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.860
a drive reader with USB 2.0 and FireWire800 interface,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.170
2 Sony lithium ion batteries and battery charger,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.200
and the Samurai SDI recorder. To use the drive reader to dump your footage,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.030
you’ll need a computer with USB 2.0

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.470
or FireWire 800, NOSX 10.6

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.440
or above, or Vista or Windows 7. The Samurai has a 1/4” mounting

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.399
point on the top and bottom that also function as heat sinks.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.890
It can be mounted on an articulating arm, shoe mount,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.440
or any 1/4” mounting point. Once the Samurai is securely mounted, connect the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.370
mini BNC cable to the input,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.310
uppermost connector. The lower connector is a loop-through output;

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.120
simply connect the second mini BNC cable, and use a standard SDI cable if you wish

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.660
to output from the Samurai to a monitor or other device. Once the mini BNC input is

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.220
connected, you can connect the SDI cable to the camera.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.310
Next, connect the batteries to the rear

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.070
f the recorder. They will snap into place. The Samurai will pull power from one battery

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.220
and automatically switch to the second battery for continuous operation,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.340
but we’ll cover that later. Now, it’s time to power up your camera.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.050
Be sure to go into the menu, and make sure that the SDI output

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.360
is set for the desired output format. The Atomos can accept

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.520
1080 HD, 720 HD, and standard definition.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.810
The Samurai accepts embedded audio from the SDI output.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.250
Most cameras automatically have this on, but you want to make sure that your

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.250
audio is on if you want audio recorded through the Samurai.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.800
Another thing to be conscious of is that some cameras

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.990
automatically have data display out

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.040
o the SDI, and you want to make sure that’s turned off. Once the camera’s set up, power on the Samurai

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.230
by momentarily pressing the power button on the right side of the recorder.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.030
First you’ll see the Atomos logo,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.700
which will be followed by the main menu. If the camera’s SDI output is active

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.950
and connected properly, the “rec” button will be red,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.150
and the “mon” icon will be yellow. In the upper left-hand corner,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.800
you’ll see the recording format. Pressing this will toggle the available formats

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.250
based on the camera’s output.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.950
In the top center is the data rate selection. You can choose between ProRes HQ

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.709
with 220 mb/s, ProRes 422

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.110
with 145 mb/s, and ProRes Lite.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.400
The upper-right icon represents the battery voltage.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.420
When one battery drains and the second is connected, it’ll automatically switch to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.190
the other battery for continuous power.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.610
A yellow highlight represents the active battery. To switch batteries, simply select the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.829
battery option and select the desired bay.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.690
You can then remove the unused battery, charge it, and reattach it.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.690
The lower-center option displays the reel name for the inserted drive.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.410
Press on this option and give the disc the desired name.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.210
Once this is done, select OK and return to the main menu.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.580
If you wish to utilize reel naming to archive your footage,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.530
you’ll reset this name each replacement of the drive.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.060
The lower-right will display record time available on the drive. It may display

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.710
blank before footage is shot,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.590
even if the drive is inserted. Under media, it should display the make,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.740
model number, and capacity of the inserted drive.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.639
To format the drive, press format HDD/SSD.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.680
Once the drive is formatted, it will return you to the main menu.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.080
Accepting embedded timecode can be toggled from the main menu.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.660
To access the timecode menu, simply press the arrow next to the timecode readout.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.499
Within this menu, you can set the camera trigger type and the timecode source.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.790
Under the menu option, you can set scene and shot numbers,

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.720
date and time, display options, and timecode. Scene and shot numbers will be

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.330
reflected with the reel title in file names generated through each clip.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.490
To go to the monitor view, simply press the “mon” button. The monitor view will show you your audio levels

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.840
and record states. It’s important that you don’t make exposure decisions based on

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.020
the image that you see in the Atomos monitor.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.810
Even at its brightest setting, it’s still fairly dark. And just keep in mind

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.930
that the image that the camera is recording internally will be identical to the image that the Atomos is recording.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.180
To access the audio monitoring, simply press on the icon

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.370
in the lower left-hand corner. This will allow you to set your audio monitoring

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.220
and gain for each input. If you leave it at 0, it’ll follow strictly by

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.449
the settings that you have in the camera for levels.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.509
Recording can be manually engaged from the main menu by pressing the record button,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.830
or recording you can also monitor unimpeded.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.500
Recording can also be controlled through the monitor view.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.180
If you’re utilizing start/stop flag triggering for simultaneous recording,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.479
simply set your camera to record run for timecode,

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.159
set the Samurai to accept timecode, and the Samurai will mirror the camera when recording.

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:47.099
For playback, utilize the play button

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:53.519
on the main screen. The play button will take the recorder

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:57.779
into the file directory. This can be a very useful tool for image playback.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.409
It has more functionality than most cameras do, and is very easy to use.

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.039
You can access any clip and scrub the image. Under the menu,

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:10.329
you will see the shutdown option. To shut down the Samurai, simply press and hold down this

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.659
shutdown button. The button will turn white.

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:17.039
Continue to hold it until the unit powers off. We will be conducting tests

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.160
with the Atomos and the cameras that we have

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.420
in-house, so stay tuned for new videos, tests, and more information at magnanimous.biz.
