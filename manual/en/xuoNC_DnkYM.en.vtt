00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.990
Hello boys and girls. This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.770
Called, "The Little Maid Serves God"

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:20.040
Today's memory verse is from 2nd Thessalonians, chapter 2, verses 16 and 17

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.920
"“May God strengthen you in every good deed and word.”

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.710
The message for today's story is: We serve God by what we do and say.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.960
Do you know how to serve God?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.700
The Little Maid served God by what she did and said.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.860
The little slave girl carefully lifted the perfume bottles and dusted them.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.630
The bottles usually sparkled in the light that streamed through the bedroom windows.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.170
But not today.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.220
Today the curtains were closed.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.670
And Mrs. Naaman was sitting on her bed in the darkness, crying softly.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.670
The Little Maid knew why.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.020
Captain Naaman had leprosy.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.830
The leprosy made white spots on his skin. And he could not feel things with his fingers and toes.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.880
And this made Mrs. Naaman was very, very sad.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.150
The Little Maid tiptoed quietly to the bed.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.830
“I wish Master Naaman would go to see the prophet in my country,” she whispered.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.820
“Prophet Elisha would heal him of his leprosy.”

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.200
Mrs. Naaman wiped her eyes. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.230
"What?"

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.440
“What are you talking about, child?” she asked

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.220
So Little Maid told Mrs. Naaman all about the prophet Elisha, who lived in Israel.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.710
“The Lord of heaven works miracles through the prophet Elisha,” she said.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.550
Then Little Maid told Mrs. Naaman all she had learned from her parents about the true and living God.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.970
Mrs. Naaman scooted off the bed.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.040
“Bring me some water to wash my face,” she said.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.040
“I must talk to my husband.”

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.700
Captain Naaman was the commander of the king’s army.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.600
So Naaman told the king what Little Maid had told his wife.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.020
“Go!” said the king.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.860
“Go and visit the prophet."

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.180
"I will send a letter to the king of Israel for you.”

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.140
Captain Naaman took silver and gold coins and 10 sets of beautiful clothes with him.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.650
These would be gifts to people in Israel who helped him.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.570
But when the king of Israel read the letter from the king of Syria, he was deeply troubled.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.750
The king of Israel knew he could not heal Naaman.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.030
He didn’t understand why the king of Syria thought he could heal Naaman

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.030
He was very worried

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.340
What if Naaman wasn’t healed?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.700
Would the king of Syria attack Israel again?

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.270
Prophet Elisha heard about Naaman’s visit.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.130
Elisha sent Israel’s king a message.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.130
“Why are you so upset?"

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.130
"Have Naaman come visit me"

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.780
"and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.660
Prophet Elisha knew that he couldn’t heal Captain Naaman, but God could.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.520
Prophet Elisha and Little Maid both wanted Captain Naaman to know about the true God.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.720
The Little Maid showed her love of God as she helped Mrs. Naaman and in everything she said.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.280
She loved to share God with others.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.290
And you can serve God too by what you do and say.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.250
That is how others will know that you love God.
