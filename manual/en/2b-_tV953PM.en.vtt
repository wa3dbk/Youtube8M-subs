00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.510
All right, you guys, we're going to do the
Michael Jackson James Brown Shuffle.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.380
Now, there's two different versions of this
shuffle.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.820
One shuffle, you can actually count it.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.540
The second one, you can't.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.270
So, I know I'm unable to count it.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.970
Let's not say, "can't," let's just say "unable
to at the moment."

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.640
So, you're going to go, One.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.110
Now this is the main stance that you want
to hold, right here.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.280
This one right here because this is the pause
of all of it, which is on the three, the five,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.310
and the seven.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.079
You start it on one.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.920
One, snap and turn in.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.660
Two.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.559
Now the right is going to come on the, And
turn out.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.179
The left is going to turn out as well.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.180
But on the right, you're going to be on the
ball of the foot.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.780
Now, on the three, you come back to this position.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.660
You're going to go, four and five.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.660
Six.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.930
Now, I'm going on the heel.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.610
On the left, and I'm picking up my right foot.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.880
And, now guess what, I'm going to pick up
my left foot this time.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.880
Seven.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.470
And my right toe comes out, staying on the
right heel.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.510
I know.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.880
I know what you're thinking.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.010
What's going on?

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.040
I got ya.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.190
Here, you step out.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.680
Your right foot is going to pick up.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.630
The left heel just shifted, this way.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.500
You have here, shift, [pick up the left foot
and just move the right toe.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Shoot.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.610
See what's happening?

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.520
So, here.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.470
Step.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.430
Here.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.340
Causing, shoot.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.989
Now, the other shuffle, you just gotta go.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.230
You know what I mean?

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.350
You just gotta go.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.000
So, basically, in slow motion, this is what's
happening.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.110
The heels are swaying from side to side.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.900
Hands are on the waist, and you can use your
hips to kind of help you guide through.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.300
So, here..

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.730
Slow motion for you.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.420
And sometimes, one foot kind of trickles.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.230
And then sometimes, he has another foot that
goes here, and this one is kind of coming

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.230
here.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.230
Together it's like.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.880
See what's happening?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.540
There you go.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.530
It's crazy, I know.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:27.280
You can do it.
