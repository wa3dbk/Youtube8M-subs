KRISTAL: Hi, Kristal Wick here with Artbeads
Café, and we are here to share with you coffee

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.430
talk and beads. So I have Cynthia with me,
and Cynthia, I am so excited. She’s going

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.310
to share with us inspiration. This is Queen
of Inspiration here, and when she shares this

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.480
story – oh my goodness, tell us all about
this beautiful piece and how you came to create

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.939
it.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.380
CYNTHIA: Okay. I made this piece for summer,
and I was really inspired by this beautiful

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.220
Crazy Lace Agate.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.140
KRISTAL: Oh, Crazy Lace Agate. I already love
the name, so this is good.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.140
CYNTHIA: There is a beautiful blue, and the
design on the piece reminded me of the lagoon

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.150
where I come from, because I came from a small
island that is east of Australia, and we have

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.520
a beautiful lagoon. So I started with that
piece first.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.430
KRISTAL: Oh, okay, so your focal was what
inspired the whole rest of the piece.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.540
CYNTHIA: Exactly. And I had some pictures
about some of the island and the lagoon, and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.970
that helped me to finish the necklace. So
as you can see on this picture, you have the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.179
island, and around there is a small lagoon,
and you can see this brown piece here. So

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:23.240
this is why I chose this beautiful ribbon
that reminds of the water and also the lagoon

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.289
part with the reef.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.009
KRISTAL: I love it.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.030
CYNTHIA: And then I remember a small island
where we went, and I wanted to represent this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.030
island on the necklace, too, so I used the
fern green Swarovski crystal to show that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.479
it’s the bush of the island, the rose gold
pearl to show that it’s like the sand of

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.359
the island –

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.899
KRISTAL: Yes, it’s a perfect color for sand.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.840
CYNTHIA: Yes, and I thought that the luminous
green was also beautiful with it. And of course,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.969
I was thinking, okay, you’ve got the lagoon,
you have the island; what is inside? Well,

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.969
you have fish inside, you have shells inside.
So I put a starfish and a shell and a fish

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.510
charm. And I love the silver chain because
it has some little round beads, and it reminds

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.350
me of the bubble of the fish.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.040
KRISTAL: Oh, that’s adorable. I noticed
that you did combine colors on this, which

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.640
is a really great idea. The coppers and the
golds and the silvers, and even including

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.770
the bubbles of the fish. Cynthia, that’s
cute. That’s so cute. What a gorgeous piece.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.060
CYNTHIA: Thank you.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.980
KRISTAL: Oh, I love it. And then even the
toggle is gorgeous, because it’s a little

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.160
fish toggle.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.620
CYNTHIA: I had to finish with a fish, yes.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.110
KRISTAL: Finny fun at its finest. Well thanks
for sharing that with us. That is absolutely

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.200
stunning. Now, what is the name of the island?
I don’t think you told us.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.450
CYNTHIA: Well, the whole necklace for the
name is Tiga Lagoon.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.730
KRISTAL: Tiga Lagoon.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.890
CYNTHIA: Tiga is an island also close to New
Caledonia.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.220
KRISTAL: Great. Thank you, Cynthia.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.630
CYNTHIA: You’re welcome.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.030
KRISTAL: That’s wonderful.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.020
KRISTAL: Okay, so Cynthia, now I have some
Kristal Wick’s Picks. These are, again,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.090
my favorites that I like to share with you
and everybody else out there, my beady peeps.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.190
And it’s a little blingy, it’s a little
sparkly – it’s time for summer.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.680
So I picked out butterflies. I picked out
all kinds of butterflies, and I did some really

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.560
fun chain. I just took purple jump rings and
made my own bracelet out of purple jump rings

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.400
with a magnetic clasp, and then I added these
beautiful Lassero butterflies that have gorgeous

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.400
Swarovski crystals in the middle of them,
and then embellished with little butterflies

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.900
here, bigger butterflies there, little ones
here.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.850
I like the color combination for summer, springtime,
because it just looks really festive. And

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.880
doesn’t it remind you of time for summer,
to break out all the colors? So again, Kristal

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.370
Wick’s Picks are Swarovski butterflies.
Yay!

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.180
And the other thing I love about the butterflies
is did you know that they mean transformation?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.500
So a lot of times I make my friends butterfly
bracelets or necklaces with the Swarovski

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.910
butterflies to indicate they’re going through
a transformation in their life or something

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.009
difficult to deal with, and it gives them
a little bump of inspiration.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.949
CYNTHIA: That’s nice. That’s really nice.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.930
KRISTAL: Thanks.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.600
KRISTAL: Cynthia, we have a real treat from
one of our viewers. Bonnie sent us these fabulous

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.790
chocolates, which we would love to share with
our beady peeps, but I think we’re going

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.350
to have to keep them here. So coffee, chocolates,
and beads – how much better does it get?

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.570
Anyway, Bonnie sent us these chocolates and
had a question. She’s from California, and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.050
she asks, “Do you mix chain finishes in
your design?” I thought that’s a great

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.490
question for you, since I know that you do,
Cynthia. So tell us about it.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.650
CYNTHIA: I do, and I really like it, actually.
I like to mix different colors together. I

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.150
really like it for bracelets; it’s so easy
to just take different colors of chain and

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.000
just put them together.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.260
KRISTAL: Yeah, so you just took three different
colors there, and – oh, what an easy project.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.500
That’s wonderful. What else did you make
here?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.060
CYNTHIA: Then what you can do is have one
chain on one side, and like I did here, I

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.050
put two other chains with different colors
on the other side. And I put those two little

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.450
links on the other side to tie the colors
together.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.260
KRISTAL: Oh, those are great TierraCast pieces.
I love how you did that. Nice.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.580
CYNTHIA: And here, I just chose one – the
gunmetal chain, and I wanted to add some colors.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.360
So I used the gold-plated and the silver-plated.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.520
KRISTAL: Oh, that’s great, and it looks
like you have initials, some little danglies

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.910
off the end of those.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.230
CYNTHIA: I do. And of course, those are my
kids’ initials.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.330
KRISTAL: What a sweet idea. The family tree
in the middle, and then your kids’ initials

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.680
on the ends. Love that. And so it looks like
these little kits here come with a combination?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.620
CYNTHIA: They do, and you have the jump ring
inside also, and the clasp.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.690
KRISTAL: Oh, so you can actually do the finishing,
because you have your lobster clasp, your

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.880
jump rings. So what you did is mix two of these
sets to come up with your designs, because

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.860
each kit – or I should say each set, because
they’re not really kits, but each set comes

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.590
with two different finishes, right?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.260
CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.430
KRISTAL: That’s really great. So you actually
have four finishes in these pieces. Beautiful.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.669
Oh, I love that. Nice job.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:15.790
CYNTHIA: Thank you.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.720
KRISTAL: And you can wear it with everything,
so you don’t have to worry about matching,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.990
right?

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.520
CYNTHIA: Exactly.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.030
KRISTAL: Oh, that’s great. Well, thanks
for joining us at Artbeads Café, where we

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.470
