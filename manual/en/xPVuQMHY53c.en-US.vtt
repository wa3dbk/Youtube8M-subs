00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.500
and the announcement of RollerCoaster Tycoon

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.279
and 3 new maps inspired by European cities

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.349
such as : Liverpool, DÃ¼sseldorf and Prague.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.719

Crytivo Games are working on a planet management
game called Universim.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.219
In Universim, research is of the upmost importance,
developing everything from fire

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.399
to curing deadly viruses, to developing spaceships
to explore new, different planets.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.609
Planets in the game will have air, weather
effects, and varying temperatures

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.500
as well as natural disasters and natural resources.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.439
The developers are looking to incorporate
multiplayer for the game

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.320
with up to four users working together in
a co-op mode.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.590
Early access is coming shortly for GasLamp
Games' newest title, Clockwork Empires.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.159
This game is set in the steam-punk styled
Victorian era and players will be required

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:21.700
to dealing with

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.920
industry, science and unimaginable horrors
from the cosmic realm.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.409
The pre-release version of the game should
be available for purchase in spring of this

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.399
year.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.280
Early access has been available for Theme
Park Studio for about a month now.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.840
The game's toolset allows users to build
or import

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.130
custom terrain, scenery, rides, coasters and
even the trains themselves.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.619
Pantera Entertainment also plans to add the
ability to script portions of the game and

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.929
to share finished parks by uploading them
to their server.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.380
The business management game, Post Master,
released in early March.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.289
In this game you'll be purchasing vehicles,
setting routes, hiring staff and

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.420
trying to expand your service coverage over
the city. At the same time a computer-controlled

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.780
rival delivery company will be competing for
the same customers.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.190
The long requested offline mode for SimCity
has finally arrived with Update 10.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.739
The Origin launcher will still be required
to download, install and launch the game,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.489
but the new mode allows the saving and loading
of cities as the player wishes.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.099
This update should open up more options for
community to modify the game

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.110
while still maintaining a level playing field
for players in multiplayer regions.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.150
22Cans has gone back and done a large rework
on their game Godus.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.330
The changes are largely due to the amount
of user feedback they have received

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.120
since the game was available as early-access.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.930
Along with a few new god powers and game-play
modes, beta 2.0 features a more natural interface

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.030
with less repetitive clicking to gather resources
and more a responsive terrain sculpting tool.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.290
Atari announced RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 will
be coming out this year,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.069
but it might not be the sequel you've been
waiting for.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.730
RTC4M, will launch as a mobile game for iPhone
and iPad

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.959
with the ability to visit and share parks
with friends.

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.159
Atari has qualified their announcement, saying
that a PC experience is also coming out this

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.620
year,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.730
but whether that means a brand new game or
a simple mobile port is yet to be seen.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.000
There are a couple notable web-based free
alpha's you can try out now.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.870
In Painters Guild you take the role of Leonardo
Da Vinci and his teacher,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.670
Verrocchio, painting scenes for paying customers.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.049
And what started as a Ludum Dare entry under
the theme of 'minimalism',

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.260
Minimetro by Dinosaur Polo Club is being developed
into a full featured game.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.620
In this simple, yet addictive game, you connect
stations together with a limited number of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.920
subway lines.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.049
As the city grows you unlock upgrades for
your lines and stations to make your system

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:32.750
more efficient.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.349
