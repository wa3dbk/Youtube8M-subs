00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:01.420
- [Voiceover] Hi everyone,

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.577
and welcome back to Disney Toy Club.

00:00:03.577 --> 00:00:05.176
Today we're going to open two of the

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.150
Donutella and her sweet
friends mini plushes,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.601
a Tokidoki Moofia Latte milk cartoon,

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:13.824
a classic My Little Pony,

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:16.534
and Unicorno Frenzies Blind Box,

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:18.995
and the My Little Pony fashems.

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:21.912
So, let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.490
So, I think there's only a
couple that we're missing,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.711
and that would be probably the Fluttershy,

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:30.329
and the Rarity,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.412
so let's see what we get,

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:42.389
and we have another
Princess Twilight Sparkle.

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:44.389
She's still really cute.

00:00:45.626 --> 00:00:46.793
Very stretchy.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:04.757
Okay, so these are new to our channel,

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:07.174
these Donutella mini plushes,

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:11.165
and it looks like there's
quite a few different

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:12.304
ones we can collect,

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.387
so let's see what we get.

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:25.765
Okay, so it looks like
we got a little dog.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:29.848
He has a doughnut with
sprinkles around his neck,

00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:33.922
sprinkles on top,

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:38.759
and his name is Donutino,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:42.751
it's so cute.

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.885
Okay, let's move onto
the Unicorno Frenzie box.

00:01:57.056 --> 00:01:59.121
I like to get this (mumbles).

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.121
Okay, so let's see which one we get.

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:09.640
Aw, this one's cute.

00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:12.648
Okay, so we got Sunny Day,

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.231
and she is so cute.

00:02:15.713 --> 00:02:17.489
Look at the polka dots.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.284
That's a little Tokidoki,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.201
some more on her chest.

00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:24.367
Okay, so let's move on.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:27.284
Let's open up the Moofia Latte box.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.013
These are always really cool to open.

00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:37.289
Here are some of the characters
that are in these boxes,

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.847
and I think previously
we opened the yogurt,

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:43.180
so let's see which one we get this time.

00:02:47.564 --> 00:02:48.731
Okay, oh cute,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.977
and we got an organic rice milk.

00:03:00.518 --> 00:03:03.227
It kind of looks like a little cow,

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:04.387
it has horns,

00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:05.887
and a little tail.

00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:10.285
Okay, on the back it has a
little picture of Donutella,

00:03:10.285 --> 00:03:12.452
and says have you seen me?

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.257
So, that's really cute.

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:18.507
Up next, let's open this
Classic My Little Pony

00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:22.343
Firefly box, and it says
it has an illustrated book

00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:23.425
inside as well,

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:27.008
so I'm excited to see
what that looks like.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.866
Cute, so inside it comes with

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.566
a little miniature Firefly pony.

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:44.333
It shows her little,

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:47.166
it has her key mark on both sides,

00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:53.018
and it also comes with this
cute little purple brush,

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.185
so you can brush her hair.

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:01.722
Okay, so it also comes with

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:04.472
this Classic My Little Pony book.

00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:09.619
Made in the 80's.

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:16.514
Firefly, Starshine, Snuzzle, Glory,

00:04:18.681 --> 00:04:20.358
friends forever,

00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:22.657
it shows the original packaging art,

00:04:22.657 --> 00:04:24.946
so that's really neat,

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:25.779
and last up,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.946
I'll open our last Donutella
and her friends mini plush.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.759
Hopefully we get something different,

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.101
oh cool, it looks like we got Ciambello,

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:50.756
and it looks like a little boy,

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:54.403
and he has a little bite out of his ear,

00:04:54.403 --> 00:04:57.026
and his ears are donuts.

00:04:57.026 --> 00:05:00.109
He has a little doughnut on his belt.

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:04.585
These little plushes are so cute.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.976
Okay guys, that's all for today.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.424
Let us know in the comments
which one's your favorite.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:13.532
I think for sure,

00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:15.768
today my favorite is Donutino,

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:18.849
he's just so cute with the
little doughnut around his neck,

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.474
and then the sprinkles on top,

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:22.246
so he's definitely my favorite.

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:23.285
