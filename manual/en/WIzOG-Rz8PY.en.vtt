00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.001
The President: As
many of you know,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:07.474
one of the great legacies
of this incredible country

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:11.444
of ours is our national parks
and national monuments.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:15.215
It is something that we pass on
from generation to generation,

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.918
not only preserving the incredible
beauty of this nation,

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:22.689
but also reminding us of the
richness of its history.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.261
And I am especially pleased
to be able to announce three

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:32.065
new designations that are
going to be taking place

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:36.569
in varied landscapes, but
all of them speak to some

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:37.937
incredible history.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:42.275
The first, we are going
to be designating

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:45.245
the Waco Mammoth
National Monument.

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.781
This is one of the most
incredible collections

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:53.319
of mammoth fossils
anywhere in the country.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.357
And for us to be able to
preserve this space is going

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:01.327
to be important not only to
scientists but also to many

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:06.166
people who are able to take
a look at this incredible

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.701
landscape down in Texas.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.605
We're also designating
the Basin and Range area

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.307
of southeastern
Nevada -- the Basin

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:16.209
and Range National
Monument.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.646
This is one of the most
undisturbed corners

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:24.417
of the Great Basin region,
and its topography is unique.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:29.355
It is a place that attracts
already a large number of

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:33.426
visitors because of some of
its unique geological aspects.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.162
And we're going to be able
to make sure that even more

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.666
visitors are aware and
take advantage of this

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.633
incredible landscape.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.635
And finally, we're
going to be designating

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.971
the Berryessa Snow
Mountain National Monument

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:50.810
in California's wild
Inner Coast Range.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.946
Once covered by ocean
waters, it's a landscape

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:57.183
that is shaped by geological
forces that are unique,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:02.822
and it has been a refuge for
Native American inhabitants

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.725
for 11,000 years -- so
it gives you a sense

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:09.896
of the time scales that
we're working off of with

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.832
some of these
national monuments.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:18.271
Teddy Roosevelt, it's been said,
had America's best idea when

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.908
he talked about preserving the
incredible natural heritage.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.011
And for me to be able to
add to that heritage

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.846
is greatly appreciated.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.350
I want to thank our outstanding
Secretary of the Interior,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.419
Sally Jewell, and everybody
in the Park Service who

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.420
does such a great job.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.792
One of the wonderful things
about our use of the Antiquities

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:44.864
Act is we've had the opportunity
to engage local communities

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:49.269
consistently throughout
this process -- businesses,

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.441
residents, people who are
profoundly attached to the land.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.079
And as a consequence, the
local communities have huge

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.182
buy-in to these things and
are absolutely confident

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.451
that not only is it going
to be a real economic spur

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:08.388
in these areas but it's
also going to be able

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.390
to preserve everything
that they love about

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.391
the places where
they live.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.393
So you guys have
done a great job.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.394
I'm very proud.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:16.930
And with that, I'm going to
start signing these things.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.043
All right, there we go.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.779
That's for the Basin and Range.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.861
That's for Berryessa
Snow Mountain.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.842
There you go.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.310
That's for Waco.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.311
Thank you so
much everybody.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.513
(applause)
