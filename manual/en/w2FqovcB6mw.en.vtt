00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:02.348
(slow synth music)

00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:03.134
(explosion)

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:04.004
(metal riff)

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.365
- [Men] Guys review Disney MILFs!

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.582
(heavy metal music)

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:10.370
- [Voiceover] Andy's mom from Toy Story.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.786
- Andy's mom was responsible for

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:14.294
two kids, a dog, and a
bunch of talking toys,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:15.618
so that's, like, sexy.

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:16.859
- This looks like a lot
of girls that I know

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.978
that I see in West Hollywood.

00:00:17.978 --> 00:00:18.907
- She's a little plain.

00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:22.869
- On a MILF scale, I'd put
her at like a three or a four.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.121
- I would have loved to see
her when she was like 23.

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.694
- College-aged Toy Story Mom? Oh my God.

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.271
- I don't wanna do any
dirty things to her.

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:30.942
- If they made her too hot, it'd be weird.

00:00:30.942 --> 00:00:32.137
- I don't care about Buzz and Woody,

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:34.129
I just wanna see Andy's mom...

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:35.079
swimming.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.654
- She seems like a wonderful lady,

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:38.233
but, no, I don't wanna (bleep) her,

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.177
if that's what you mean.

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.486
- [Voiceover] The Evil Queen,
that's really original.

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:42.711
(explosion)
- Oh, way hot.

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.006
Are you kidding, way hot.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:45.350
- She's got those sexy eyes.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.198
She looks Italian.

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:47.107
- She'd be a devil in the sack.

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:47.776
- Oh my God.

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:49.877
- But just that look
she's giving me right now,

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:51.456
man, it's just like...

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:52.872
- She's clearly on something.

00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:56.065
- If she's not messed up,
like on drugs or whatever,

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:57.307
I think it's a yes.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.908
- I would eat the apple off of her,

00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:01.022
wherever she would place it.

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:02.729
And I don't even like apples.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.922
- Elasta-girl, ow!
(explosion)

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:07.454
- She can get it.

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:10.663
- Before I even knew she
was a superhero, absolutely.

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:12.191
- Yes, absolutely, are you kidding?

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:13.162
- It's all in the hips, too, by the way.

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:13.888
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:13.888 --> 00:01:15.140
- She kinda had a sexy voice.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.578
- She's loud and abrasive and confident,

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.029
I'm into all that stuff.

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:21.246
- And imagine the crazy things she can do

00:01:21.246 --> 00:01:22.743
in the bedroom.

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:24.205
- Put the uniform on,

00:01:24.205 --> 00:01:26.882
maybe cut some holes in a few places.

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:29.396
- Oh man, I forgot my cell phone upstairs,

00:01:29.396 --> 00:01:31.021
and she's like, "Don't worry, babe."

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.714
(modulating voice noises)

00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:35.971
(men laughing)

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:36.742
(explosion)

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.426
- If I was into a mixture between pottery

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:41.261
(man with hat laughing)
and an elephant, maybe?

00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:43.850
- Gun to your head, you had
to (bleep) Mrs. Potts, okay?

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.837
- Mmm hmm.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.033
- How would you (bleep) her?

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.580
- Through the lid, lukewarm tea.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.382
- You know, I'm down with

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:49.620
the big round thing in the back,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.522
so you know, I could be
down with a teacup booty.

00:01:52.522 --> 00:01:53.845
- Oh, Mrs. Potts, yo.

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:55.065
You need to get out.

00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:56.114
- I'm a maybe.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:57.596
- She's gotta be hot, she's a teapot.

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:58.500
She's always hot.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.745
(serious piano music)

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:01.439
- [Voiceover] Oh, come on.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.227
- Let us not speak ill of the dead.

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:04.724
- This is a animal.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.768
- I gotta say, this is
the first time in my life

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:08.822
that I've thought about
(bleep)ing Bambi's mom.

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:10.045
(heavy metal music)

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:10.875
(explosion)

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.083
- If we were deer, yes.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:14.793
- I have a feeling she's
kind of a dead fish in bed.

00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:16.135
- I'm gonna call you Thumper.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.619
- You know what, at this
point in my life, why not?

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.726
- I'm gonna pass on this
one, it's an animal.

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.616
- Yeah, I'm glad she's dead. (laughs)

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:23.326
- [Voiceover] She's a fine-ass bitch.

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:24.051
(explosion)

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.449
- There's no way you don't
think that dog's hot.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.672
- Got a lot of kids, so I'm kinda scared

00:02:26.672 --> 00:02:27.790
about that one, though.
- [Man with glasses] Yeah.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.290
- Personally, I don't
think I was ever into Lady.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.895
Yeah, she thought she was better than me.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:32.844
- I'm a no on Lady.

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:33.687
- You're crazy!

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:35.088
- She'd win in a dog show.

00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:36.651
- [Men] Oh!

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:37.191
(explosion)

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.556
- This is where I draw the line.

00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:40.428
- Even with the lights
off, that's a gorilla.

00:02:40.428 --> 00:02:42.471
- You were down for the deer,
you were down for the dog,

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:43.830
but you stop at a gorilla.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.991
- Not in this situation.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.336
- The gorilla would crush me, in any...

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:48.776
- Well that's why you get on top of her.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:50.017
- This is a big no for me.

00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:51.213
- Hot!

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.185
- No.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.355
- I think it's safe to
say we're (bleep)ed up.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:05.539
(explosion)
