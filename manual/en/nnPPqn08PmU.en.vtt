00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:01.020
- [Voiceover] Hey friends,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.654
today I'm doing something different,

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:04.221
I am doing an unboxing video

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.758
which I don't think I've
ever done on this channel.

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:08.660
I bought a new Erin Condren planner

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.429
and I'm so excited to share,

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.498
so I wanted to show you
my initial unboxing.

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.134
So of course the box is super cute

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:18.637
and then over here is a postcard

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.505
that came with the box,

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.207
and then this is just a piece of paper

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:25.343
that says, "without change
there would be no butterflies,"

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:28.713
and then that is my receipt
showing what I purchased

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:30.732
and then um,

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:33.885
great packaging, has a sticker, a seal,

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.706
bubble wrap, very nice.

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.023
And I ended up getting their starter kit.

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:44.023
It was like $25 and it
came with a ton of stickers

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.634
and all these fun things

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:49.250
so I'm gonna just go through
the pages to show you.

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:54.868
(techno music)

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.282
It also came with a welcome kit

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:12.972
which comes with the planners,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.732
and this is what's inside of it.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.171
And now to the planner!

00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:25.620
There was a code for a free cover,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.280
so I'm gonna actually get a new cover

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.759
that you can add on,

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.574
and as you can see,

00:01:29.574 --> 00:01:32.450
this is the limited edition rose gold.

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.788
Look at the colorful monthly tabs,

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:38.901
it's like about an inch thick.

00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.539
And I just wanted to
go ahead and open it up

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.794
and show you guys the various pages.

00:01:45.794 --> 00:01:48.571
This is my first time getting
an Erin Condren planner,

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:51.568
and the only planner that I had prior

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.111
was my Lilly Pulitzer,

00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:55.975
and I noticed that the
Erin Condren planner,

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:58.994
the paper isn't as thick
as the Lilly Pulitzer,

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.016
but it has more content to it.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:04.134
I like the whole thankful
thoughts in the bottom,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.054
and I also love the goals section as well.

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:23.745
On the back there is a ton of stickers.

00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:28.500
Even blank ones that you can customize,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.070
which I really like.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.802
I like that there's a folder,

00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:37.419
and then inside there's
even a calendar book

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.411
which is just like a bonus.

00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.007
I didn't get that from
my other planners before,

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:43.555
so that was pretty neat.

00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:45.427
And then it also came

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:50.490
with this pouch and it has
stickers and business cards

00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:53.055
and cute little cards that says stuff like

00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:54.724
"I love what you do."

00:02:54.887 --> 00:02:57.562
Nice, cute little bonuses
which I haven't seen

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.161
from other planners.

00:02:59.243 --> 00:03:02.511
Only comparing with my
Lilly Pulitzer which I had.

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:05.793
And I just wanted to
show you the calendars

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:07.332
in context again,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:08.729
just going through the pages.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.947
So that is the Erin Condren planner,

00:03:12.947 --> 00:03:13.702
the rose gold,

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:16.720
and what I currently have
is the Lilly Pulitzer,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.018
and as you can see,

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.976
it's very colorful as
well as the Erin Condren,

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:23.723
but it has a lot more pop of color

00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:25.172
compared to the Erin Condren

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:27.526
and the paper feels a little thicker

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:29.579
and it does come with stickers as well,

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.166
but it doesn't come with the extras

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.894
like all the fun customizable like,

00:03:33.894 --> 00:03:38.755
like the empty customizable
stickers and things like that.

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:41.079
Overall the Erin Condren has more to it

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.226
than the Lilly Pulitzer,

00:03:42.226 --> 00:03:44.984
but I honestly do love both.

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:49.018
I love how colorful and
sturdy my Lilly Pulitzer is

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:50.678
compared to the Erin Condren,

00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:53.495
but I like how you can
customize the Erin Condren,

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:56.623
so I hope you guys
enjoyed this quick review.

00:03:57.043 --> 00:03:59.945
Also do, do it yourself fruit infused ice

00:03:59.945 --> 00:04:01.454
which is really cute and easy.

00:04:01.454 --> 00:04:03.809
Chopped up fruit in an ice cube tray

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.837
and then you just add water and freeze.

00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:10.699
It makes your water look so
cute for some reason. (laughing)

00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:12.894
Next, do it yourself blueberry ice cream

00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:15.831
which is so easy you just
make it in a blender.

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:17.834
So you're gonna add frozen.
