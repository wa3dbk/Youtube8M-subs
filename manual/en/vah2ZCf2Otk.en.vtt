Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com.
I’m going to discus some bow maintenance

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.080
that can be done by the individual player
and some other things that need to be done

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:23.300
by a bow technician. One thing about a violin
bow is that it gets dusty, and there’s nothing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:36.059
like a piece soft cloth to make it look a
lot better. Eventually violin bow hair gets

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.100
dirty, and it gets dirty when it’s attached
to the tail of a horse also so I don’t tend

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.660
to loose a great deal of sleep over it, but
hair looks nice when it’s cleaned. This

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.829
is actually horsehair—it’s from a tail
of a Siberian horse—and there’s some discussing

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.640
in the world of fiddlers now about where bow
hair is going to start coming from… if Siberian

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.340
bow hair is all purchased by companies in
China. and one can only wonder. Violin bow

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.149
hair is also made from fiberglass, and it’ll
probably eventually come from carbon fiber

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.630
as well, but most people consider horsehair
to be the industry standard; you’ll see

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.310
what happens in the future. A couple of things
happened over time with a bow, one is that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:52.090
it’s inevitable that bow hairs break when
one plays a violin, there’s friction and

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.650
impact between the hair and the string, and
that causes wear, and sooner or later some

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:12.860
bow hairs break. And there’s various opinions
about the speed with which the actual nodules

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.989
on the surfaces of hairs wear down and loose
their ability to grip and abrade against the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.170
violin strings enough to generate tone. I
personally have had bow hair last for quiet

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.940
a long time; but sooner or later because of
breakage or a perception that the hair is

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:46.489
lost its bite, bows go to violin technicians
or bow technicians who replace the hair. It’s

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:54.050
just a little, it’s about 125 hairs I think,
and as I say it comes usually from the tail

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.739
of a horse, the horse isn’t harmed in the
hair harvesting process, and it’s free to

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.280
grow more hair. How long it takes to grow
hair this length, I don’t know.
