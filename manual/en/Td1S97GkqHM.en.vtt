00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.880
We're going to do a red velvet cake. It's
a two layer cake with a cream cheese frosting.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.270
I'm just going to start with some of the ingredients
here. We have a little bit of yogurt and we're

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.440
going to add some vanilla to that yogurt and
then also the red food coloring.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.230
Now red velvet cake is a really popular thing
in our cafe. People go crazy over just about

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.780
anything that's red velvet. And it needs to
have that red color, so the red food coloring

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.640
is an integral part of that. We don't use
a lot of food coloring in the cafe, but for

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.300
the red velvet cake you do want to add a little
bit to get that color that people love so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.390
much.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.769
The recipe calls for vinegar, just regular
white vinegar. Strangely, chemically, it helps

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.239
the food color get into the cake. You're going
to get a richer, redder color by using the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.080
yogurt as opposed to just the food coloring,
which will kind of be a little streaky. So

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.730
you're going to have an awesome red color,
like red, so that's a lot of fun.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.550
Then we're going to just get started with
creaming the butter and sugar. Again, this

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:28.580
is classic cake making. A little bit of butter
and a little bit of white sugar. And I would

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:37.630
mix that on low to medium speed.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.640
While that's mixing, I'm going to crack the
eggs and get the rest of the ingredients together.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.160
Always crack your eggs on a flat surface.
It will avoid some of the little bits of shell

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.800
if you can help that. It's a nice thing not
to have to go fishing for eggshells all the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.350
time. All right. So I've got those four eggs.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.560
Right now I'm going to take a quick look at
my butter. And I like to scrape down the bowl

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.550
just to make sure it's all getting in there.
All right. I am going to increase the speed

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.349
just so I can get this going. What you don't
want to do is you don't want to whip that

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.890
at high speed. It brings up a little bit too
much, but a nice medium speed is OK.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.910
While that's mixing, I'm going to combine
the dry ingredients and I'm going to use a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:46.780
pretty good sized bowl. I've got my all-purpose
flour and a rich cocoa powder. There' s a

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:55.860
little salt, baking powder and some baking
soda. When I've got this many ingredients,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:05.170
I'll use a whisk, just kind of briefly combine
them all. I like to do that so all the leaveners,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.540
the baking powder and the baking soda and
the cocoa, get distributed evenly when you're

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.099
mixing the cake batter. And then you don't
have to overmix the batter because all those

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.240
ingredients are already mixed in.
