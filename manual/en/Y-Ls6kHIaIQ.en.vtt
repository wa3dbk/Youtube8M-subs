00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.589
Hi my name is Carey Kepler I'm a functional
training coach and I also work with triathletes

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.820
today I'm going to talk about and give tips
for the first time triathletes to the intermediate

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.660
triathlete and we're going to talk about training
goals, for more information you can go to

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.220
my website at www.boundless-energy.com. For
swimming in triathlon if once you pick your

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.860
race if it's Olympic distance, sprint distance,
half iron, or iron man distance the key is

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.910
that you can swim the distance of the race.
So if your swimming if the race calls for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.090
500 meters, you want to make sure you have
the swim endurance for 500 meters so your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.390
swimming goal in the pool is to swim 500 meters
and beyond, maybe up to a 1,000. So make sure

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.190
you are capable of swimming the distance of
the race. Second you want to make sure that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.330
you open water swim all triathlons are done
in open water, some of the very very short

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.659
ones are done in a pool but you want to be
able to swim open water. So I recommend that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.170
you always swim at least once before race
and open water. Number 3 make sure that you

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.409
can you equipment properly when your swimming,
primarily make sure that you swimsuit is comfortable

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.530
for you that your not going to get snagged
or pulled on anyone else or people are always

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.700
around you. And make sure that you if your
goggles you know that your familiar with your

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.290
goggles if they leak that you know how to
properly adjust them while swimming or get

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.040
them back on your face quickly. Make sure
that you are able to get in and out of a wet

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.090
suit if the temperature of the water is below
78 degrees they can wear a wet suit, but if

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.470
you when your putting getting out of you want
to make sure that you can easily get that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.049
off. So those are some key tips to your swimming
segment of the race.
