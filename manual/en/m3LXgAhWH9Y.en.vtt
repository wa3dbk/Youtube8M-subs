00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.870
Hi. Alan Stratton from AsWoodTurns.com. My
granddaughters are here and they want a special

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.030
treat; they want me to make them an egg. So
here we go. A piece of walnut.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.800
Girls, say Hi.
Hi.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.670
Let’s make an egg
The woodturning that I’m showing is actually

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.749
the second egg. I filmed the first egg and
started to produce it. With all of the difficulties

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.989
of the first egg, the video was turning out
to be a blooper film. So, I went ahead with

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.640
the second egg still from the same piece of
walnut limb wood. This one turned out much

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.360
better.
The wood is walnut I collected when we lived

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.590
in Texas. It is very dry. However, this piece
is from a limb of the tree and dried without

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.670
being sawn in half. Years ago, I turned it
round and painted the ends to get rid of the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.740
bark. The problem that showed up time and
time again was from the shrinkage as the wood

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.530
dried. Since the limb was intact, the wood
could not move as it dried. Consequently,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.220
it was like the growth rings delaminated from
each other. You’ll catch glimpses of this

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.759
as sections fly off during the during. I had
to use liberal amounts of CA glue to retain

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.469
and fill the gaps and stabilize the wood.
Even so, I think I had a beautiful piece of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.450
wood despite its issues.
While starting the first egg, I had turned

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.369
the wood round and turned dovetail tenons
on this half of the wood. There was not much

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.340
more trueing up to so. Just a little on the
tenon and a little on the circumference.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.210
Then I parted off the big end of the egg.
My granddaughters were not very familiar with

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.600
Gulliver’s Travels. So they did not yet
appreciate any jokes about big enders and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.590
little enders.
Then to turn the big end. But first, I stabilized

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.619
the wood with thin CA glue. I used a ¼”
gouge and a ½” round nose scraper. I turned

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.070
the rim recess with a ½” skew at first
but had to trim it a bit more after sanding

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.750
the interior. Then I finished the interior
of the big end and mounted the little end

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.700
back into the chuck.
Most of the tools I used, came with my original

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.000
lathe many years ago. They were old when I
acquired them. They’re probably older than

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.280
I am.
The little end went about the same. Trim the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.229
surface then hollow out the interior. Despite
being the little end of the egg, the interior

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.970
goes a bit deeper into the egg. I had to stabilize
several sections of the wood with CA glue.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.190
After the accelerator was applied, it showed
white bubbles on the outside. I used a diamond

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.010
point tool to turn the rim.
Alas, I overshot the fit on the rim between

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.230
the two ends; it was too loose. I turned it
a bit shorter and redid the area. So the egg

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.150
is about ¼” shorter than it could have
been.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.670
Once the two halves could fit together again,
I brought up the tail stock to stabilize the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.100
whole thing while I turned the exterior. I
had just a little extra wood to accommodate

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.950
the point on my tail stock center. I had to
stabilize the outside of the big end again.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.620
I used a combination of shearing, scraping
and shear scraping to sneak up on the final

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.180
shape of the egg. Then on to sanding and finishing.
I sanded thru 400 grit. That’s enough for

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.340
this walnut with its grain and defects.
I parted off the little end with a large skew

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.530
with the tip under the wood. I did not want
any chance of a catch despite Stuart King’s

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.880
promotion of the versatility of the skew.
After parting off the little end, I wrapped

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.820
the egg with masking tape and mounted it again
in the chuck to touch up the very point of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.010
the egg.
With a woodturning project of this sort, this

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.640
is the sequence I followed.
1. Rough turn and turn the tenons

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.810
2. Part off the big end.
3. Hollow, sand, and finish the interior of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.800
the big end.
4. Hollow, sand and finish the interior of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.650
the little end.
5. Ensure the two halves fit together as desired.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.270
6. Turn the outside of the two halves to establish
the overall shape.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.500
7. Finish the big end exterior.
8. Finish the little end exterior as much

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.850
as possible
9. Part off the little end

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.000
10. Finish the little end tip.
An alternative would have been to make a jamb

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.320
chuck from the little end. For this wood egg,
this is enough.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.931
I used a lot of CA glue to stabilize the wood.
But in the end, the egg turned out nice. I

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:57.440
think I’ll make a nest of eggs from different
woods. Maybe that’s a good way to use the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:21.020
short scrap pieces that always tend to accumulate
in my shop.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.530
Here we are. Started out to make two eggs,
enclosed small wood containers.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.870
This was a tough one; had not made one for
a while. The wood was really tough. Miscalculated

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.090
on a few things, like the tenon. Whatever.
So it’s a little bit different. It evolved.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.560
It is a tight fit.
So girls, what is it? An egg? Or what is it.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.680
Ice cream.
Balloon.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.650
Whatever it is. They can make it what it is.
But one big problem remains. So far only one.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.780
How many do I need?
Two.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.700
Ok. Here’s one.
