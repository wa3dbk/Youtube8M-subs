Hey what’s up guys, it's your girl Keiko
Alingas back with another product spotlight

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690
right here on GearAddix.com.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.849
So as you can see, I have a pretty killer
sound system set up right here on the table.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.250
However, this is not what I’ll be reviewing
today.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.560
What I am taking a look at, is this little
guy.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.560
What is it?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.450
Well, it’s the HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth
Audio Receiver, and it single handedly breathed

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.000
new life into my time tested, yet still amazing
sounding home speaker system.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.010
Now as we all know, portable bluetooth speakers
are definitely the craze now, which have made

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.530
the days of docking or wirelessly connecting
your phone to your speakers a thing of the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.530
past.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.040
And as a result, slightly older, yet still
awesome sounding non-bluetooth audio systems

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.340
have become somewhat obsolete.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.540
But the HomeSpot Bluetooth Audio Receiver
is specifically designed to give any speaker

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.399
system with a standard RCA or 3.5mm inch output
full wireless bluetooth capabilities that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.110
you can easily control with your smartphone
or tablet.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.140
So in addition to the receiver unit itself,
you’ll receive a standard 3.5mm male to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.030
male audio cable, and an RCA to 3.5mm male
audio cable as well.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.570
And to power up the device, it comes with
a micro USB cable along with a standard USB

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.570
power brick.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.160
To set up, the first thing you want to do
is power up the receiver, and simply connect

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.650
it to your audio source using the appropriate
cable.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.643
In this case, I’ll be using the dual 3.5mm
cable.

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:23.670
To sync it with your mobile device, simply
press the pairing button on the back of the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240
unit, and go to the bluetooth settings on
your device to connect.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.570
And that’s pretty much it.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.650
Now that we’re paired, let’s go ahead
and see if this guy works.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.810
(Select Song)

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.810
And there we go.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.390
And now without the hassle of wires and cables,
I could stream music from my phone to the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.240
speakers from up to 66 feet away.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.549
And in addition to home stereo systems, this
guy can also be used in any car sound system

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.299
with a standard auxiliary output.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.700
Anyways, that pretty much covers it, for more
