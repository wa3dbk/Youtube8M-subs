00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.670
Justin: What's up everybody, Justin with AmericanMuscle.com.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.019
We're back here at MIR here in Maryland with
our BAMA tuned 2015 GT chasing down that nine

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.200
second time slip.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.679
Now, guys, we've been following this car,
and chances are you've probably seen it recently

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.620
go 106 at 123 all motor fall by 102 at 128
on a 150 shot.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.420
But we're not happy, right?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.369
We're going for nines, and that's what we're
here today.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.370
Now we're here with Paul from BAMA Performance
as well as Mike Jay from the BAMA team, and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.940
these guys have been doing a heck of a job
with the car, but quick rundown on the car,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.940
guys.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.040
Basic bull tones, JLT cold air intake, long
tube headers, mid-pipe exhaust, of course.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.260
Our friends over at the drive shaft shop hooked
us up with a nice drive shaft along with the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.219
level five half-shafts.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.220
Pretty basic suspension stuff going on there.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.980
We have rubber bushings, some adjustable shocks
on the rear, Cobra jet springs, and other

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.422
than that, of course, that BAMA tune with
this guy here next to me.

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:52.550
We'll talk about it in a minute.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.700
We've done a lot of work to this car as far
as making it lighter, right, Paul?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.570
So why don't we tell these guys at home what
this thing's weighing in at?

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.309
Paul: We recently weighed the car after taking
out some more weight, and it comes in at 3450

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.300
pounds with driver and a quarter tank of gas.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Justin: So, Paul, today the car has the Boss
manifold back on it.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.620
We explained to these guys in a recent video
why we switched back to the stock manifold,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.500
but why are we back here revisiting the Boss?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.720
Paul: So it was exactly what we experienced.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.940
The stock intake works very well naturally
as we said it did, but we said we were running

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.840
into some nitrous issues.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.260
After getting the car back on the Dyno [inaudible
00:01:25] wheel working on our tune, we discovered

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.030
that we were having some nitrous distribution
issues with the factory intake.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.240
So we decided to put the Boss intake manifold
back on, and it seems to have cured our problems,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.310
and we're going to find out when we take it
down the track.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.820
Justin: Yeah, absolutely, 100%.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.940
Now as far as the tune is concerned, what
kind of gas are we using here today?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.270
Paul: You know, we really want to take this
car as fast as we possibly can.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.610
When we went 1060s we had E-85 in it, but
we've seen some great results with FTW purple,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.360
so we decided to put some FTW purple in the
car, and we picked up about 10 to 15 wheel

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.740
horsepower after adjusting our custom tune
for it.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.740
Justin: There you go.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.200
This thing is pretty much maxed out horsepower-wise
for now.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.000
I mean, we've done all of our homework.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You guys have done a great job.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.290
We've got a great driver, of course, but now
it's the moment of truth, man.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.970
Let's get this thing to the line and see if
the nines are in the air.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.720
Males: Whoo-hoo-hoo.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.340
There it is.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.840
Justin: That is awesome.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.470
That is awesome.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.100
991 at 135.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.740
Hot damn!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.920
All right, Paul man, awesome day, brother.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.940
991 at 135.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.890
We solved our nitrous problem, but that's
a helluva dip going from a 102 at 128 to a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.890
991 at 135.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.000
We picked up a lot of mile an hour.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870
Tell these guys at home how we did that.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.410
Paul: After our last track outing at Cecil
when we went the 1020s, we decided to get

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.730
the car back onto the Dyno.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.670
We did change the fuel, and we just really
focused on getting every last horsepower out

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.319
of this thing when we were doing our tune
on it.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.319
Justin: Absolutely.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.710
And the Boss manifold seemed to solve our
nitrous issues, right?

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.710
Paul: It did, yeah.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.430
You know, after looking at all of the data
logs on the Dyno and then backing it up with

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.770
what we saw on the track, all the distribution
issues are definitely solved.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.991
Justin: I know this guy's on top of the world.

00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:21.991
I know I am too.

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.010
It's been a helluva day here, but we always
tell you guys to subscribed to our YouTube

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.010
Channel, right?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.390
Well, this is why you should do it because
you get to see awesome stuff happening, cars

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.690
going nine seconds.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.110
And this thing, I guarantee you, will be back
bigger and better.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.270
So in the meantime, guys, stay tuned and for
all things Mustang, keep it right here at
