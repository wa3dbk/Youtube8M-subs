00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:14.693
Welcome

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:17.560
to Showtime Gaming's: Clan War -- Tactics.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.426
Episode 1: "The Distraction" on Satellite.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:25.690
This aggressiv tactic is designed

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.986
for 4 team members

00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:28.980
-- we just named them player A to D.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.600
You can see their roles and equipment here:

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.320
This tactic aims at an early placing

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320
of the bomb with subsequently preventing

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.580
the enemy from disarming it in time. 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.840
Player C and D form a single unit

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
while player A and B are on their own

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.346
those two should therefore be good at aiming.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.580
Right at the start,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.320
player C and D go straight into the server room.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.060
 It's no problem making some noise

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.253
and indicating to do a frontal assault.

00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:57.250
he Defenders on position A

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.960
really need to get the impression

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.733
hat 3 or even all 4 of you are in the server room.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.730
They'll probably not rush for you

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.730
but instead set up defensive positions

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.160
and maybe throw some grenades

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.426
-- advice: you should avoid getting blown up.

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:13.520
Since they now very probably expect you to rush

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.173
they call in reinforcements

00:01:16.173 --> 00:01:18.170
and withdraw their guy from position B.

00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.786
Player A watches this happening

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:22.780
from the room below bomb spot B.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
As soon as he sees the defender leaving

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.346
it's his time to act.

00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:28.340
Best thing to do is eliminating the guy

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.340
from behind while he runs to A

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 good aiming is absolutely necessary

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.520
 to make this shot.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.250
As soon as player A has eliminated the defender,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.920
the enemy is suddenly outnumbered

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.440
use this advantage!

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.746
Player A has to place the bomb at B

00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:44.306
 and then withdraw from the position

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.300
as fast as possible back to the room below. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.933
The enemy will now "see through" your tactic

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.930
and rush to B to disarm it in time. 

00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:53.930
Now it's showtime for player B:

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.930
 He has to catch up with the enemy

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 on their way from A to B.

00:01:58.973 --> 00:01:59.930
After doing so,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 he has to get to B via the central corridor

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.413
and hide behind the machine,

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.410
aiming at one of the exits.

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:07.770
Now player C and D

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.560
 rush via the base of the enemy to bomb spot B.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.560
If everything went well,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.960
 there should only be one or two enemies be left.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.960
Since B is quite easy to defend

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.093
and there aren't really any good spots 

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.250
for your enemy to hide,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.106
you only have to hold the position

00:02:22.106 --> 00:02:24.100
 for a couple of seconds to win this round.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.600
Sometimes the enemy is too afraid

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.690
to go to the bomb spot because of being outnumbered.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.360
n addition, using this tactic may be risky

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
cause it only works if you really know

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.066
where your enemies exactly are

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.060
and know where they position themselves.

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.060
Therefore it is adviced

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.586
 to not use this tactic

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:43.580
right in the first round of the clan war.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.693
Well guys,

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:47.690
that was our first tactic video. 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.306

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:52.300
