00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:10.190
Integration Services Support Pursuit for Perfection
at Eagle Manufacturing

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.481
We make at our facility in Florence, Kentucky
engine blocks and cylinder heads for two of

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.620
the three big OEMs in North America.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.590
We have high volume production and we typically
use a lot automation, robots and gantries,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.480
in order to produce our parts for our customers.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.780
Typically we’re operating with takt times
of 30 seconds or less due to the high volume

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
nature of our business.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.489
We rely heavily on our vendors in order to
come back to us with a creative solution that

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.910
meets our needs and will allow us to succeed,
and we expect a high level of performance

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.559
from them in that regard, with regards to
creativity and performance.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.290
Working with Makino is great.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.610
I typically measure all of our other vendors
against their level of enthusiasm and workmanship.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.680
For example, their strategy of attacking the
job with a large group of installation technicians

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.750
combined with their expertise of doing it
right the first time gives Makino an advantage,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.890
for us, on short lead time jobs of being able
to get up into operation quickly, which means

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.939
we start making money sooner.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.110
With the increase in demand recently in manufacturing
the lead times for certain vendors have become

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.110
extended, which means getting into production
takes longer and longer.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.880
Makino has been successful in that regard
by producing machines now so they’re always

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.080
available for the short lead time projects,
which helps us win business but also helps

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.630
us get up and running quicker and provides
a win-win situation for us and Makino in this

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.430
business environment.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.200
In our high volume production environment
we need our machines to be up as much time

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.700
as possible so that we can make as many parts
as possible for our customers.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.430
And Makino equipment is robust and allows
us to run it as long as possible.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.799
The bottom line for us is that we need equipment
that is robust and runs, and allows us to

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.029
be competitive in the marketplace.

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:19.930
The Makino equipment is economical for us,
yet it also provides us with a high OEE so

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.890
that we can achieve our goals and objectives
as a corporation, one of which is getting

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.890
to $10 billion in sales by 2020, and in order
to do that we need to continue to expand.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.760
Partnerships with companies such as Makino
allow us to put together competitive proposals

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.029
for our customers in order to win more business
and achieve our goal.
