00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:10.900
Now, the second thing I want to talk about
is your training environment.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.900
Training environment is huge.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.100
You know, one of the things I've learned from
the the USGA is what we call progressions.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.279
Progressions are very important, and I'm going
to take you through what is a basic progression.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.919
The first stage of progression is having a
very closed environment.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.539
What a closed environment is is where you
have it where if I'm working on my forehand

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.260
or my contact, I'm not working on anything
else, and the way they'll do this, or the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.410
way you can do this, is just pitching the
ball.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.300
You know, in some of my videos you've seen
where I've had someone pitch me a ball.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.640
That's a great training tool, because when
they're pitching the ball, they're going to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.039
have more control over how you get the ball,
giving you more of an opportunity just to

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.039
work on that one thing.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
You know, by pitching and being this close
over on this side of the net, then they can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.039
be really accurate, even if they're not, let's
say, a tennis player.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.070
You can get someone that has no history of
playing tennis, and get them to come out and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.739
pitch you a ball, and it's the best situation
ever, and I'm going to take you through this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.739
in a second.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.839
The second environment is where they're feeding
you the ball.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.140
This is kind of the classic way of training
that we've used over and over again, but the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.500
problem sometimes if you don't close the environment
close enough, you never really get a chance

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.719
to give the person the type of ball they need
to get better, unless you're usually a pro.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.770
You have to go to a pro to do it because they
have experience in feeding the ball exactly

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.770
where they want it.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.000
The other problem with, let's say, going to
a kind of semi open environment is that they're

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.229
so far away.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.260
When I'm pitching, as a coach, I can correct
things instantly.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.869
I don't have to holler across the net or try
to get them to do something.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.399
I can instantly go over there and touch and
change things, so you know if you're helping

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.770
someone else get better, pitching the ball's
a great way of learning to play because it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.479
gives you opportunity to work on things very
close up.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.039
The third way is a complete, open environment.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.009
A complete, open environment is where you're
hitting with somebody, OK, it's where we're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.409
stroking back and forth.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.820
There's no ball feeding, there's no pitching.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.289
There's the opportunity where I'm going to
have to react to their ball, and still do

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.969
all the things I've worked on, where hopefully,
it's become unconsciously competent.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.630
It's really important that you understand
this.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.380
You know, when I'm out doing videos, and I'm
either working on something, once I start

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.550
hitting the ball, I never think about how
I'm doing stuff.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.760
I'm never thinking "OK, my take back here."

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.780
My only focus is the ball, and that's where
you need to be, where you're only focus on

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.180
what you're doing is the ball.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.070
