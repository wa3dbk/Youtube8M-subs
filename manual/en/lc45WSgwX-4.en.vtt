00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.420
Nihaaooooo, I'm Greg Le Geek! My bosom buddies call me GLG!

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.750
If many of you know me already from my YouTube’s High Tech and smartphone video presentations live from China.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.650
We still would like to restart our SHENZEN HD reports.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.640
What is SHENZHEN HD about?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.310
It's simply some short reports from Shenzhen, China but also from everywhere in mainland China.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.810
To show you around and make you discover China with another point of view.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.420
A point of view brought to you through the eyes of a Geek! 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.540
And definitely not in the journalistic fashion which provides stereotyped and formatted video ordered by Majors Companies.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.050
In a nutshell...It should be COOL, FUN and INTERESTING!

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.950
Since our High Tech gadget and smartphone video presentations are funded by our affiliate’s shops or by brands and announcers...

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.480
For the Shenzhen HD reports it will be different!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.970
Because we would like to take it up a notch at every new video reports...and to always try to go further

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.480
Going further and deeper in the quality of contents provided off course...

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.870
But also regarding the distance in order to not reduce our field of action to Shenzhen City.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.980
Consequently we registered to Tippeee.com so as to propose every one of you a way to tip us.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.740
This way you can support our spirit of initiative for this project!

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.420
Starting from 1€ per video the tips could make the difference for us!

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.040
Because 1€ per person replaced in the context of a thousand viewed video, this could help up for many things :

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.030
We could get new equipment, financing some trips i.e. going to Shanghai, taking a cameraman with me!

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.310
Or organizing a swimming pool party with a lot of babes and freely flowing Champagne! ^^

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.150
It's not an investment for you but more an encouragement!

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.360
You won't be our producers neither our Majors,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.090
But to thank you for your support you will be able to see our evolution on our YouTube Channel...

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.800
And also you'll have concrete things in return!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.490
So for 1€ you will see your name in the credits at the end of the SHENZHEN HD videos!

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.980
For the most generous, of you let's say now 5€ ^^, I’ll take 5 mins at the end of each video to thanks everyone personally!

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.700
After that, the more you tip the more you get!

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820
For example we can send you a love text message from China!

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.080
Don’t worry ill pay for it ^^

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.320
Also we have some JTGEEK goodies pack that includes a Pangeek plush toy, a mini silicon Pangeek, a JTgeek mouse pad, a JTgeek wippee.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.140
More over this you can receive a phone call from me!

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.870
This way you can give me your ideas, your point of view, what you would like to see, what you didn't like or what you loved

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.380
Like this it will give me power and influence me for the next reports!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.180
Because after all you're the one who pays! ^^

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.580
And finally the last step of those compensations

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.990
You become the partner of that day Shenzhen HD!

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.490
After the theme video and Pangeek ^^ It wil lbe like :

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.310
“This Shenzhen HD was brought to you by ...YOU..."

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.430
Or "special thanks to ...YOU... Who funded this report"

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.530
i duno in example for a bday party, a barmitzva...

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.190
i duno...

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.920
For a wedding with a message like "Je t'aime Mon Amour welcome at JTGEEK.com" etc... Things like this! ^^

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.880
Alright! Let’s put on some music and finish this trailer!

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.470
We did quiet a bunch of video for this first report that i'm sure you will love!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.770
I personally encourage you to go at Tipeee.com! 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.700
And once again a big gratefull "thank you" to everyone who tipped us already!

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.810
Also I set an approximate date with you…

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.420
