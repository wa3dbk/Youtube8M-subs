Hello!
So, do you want to know how to beat everyone

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.970
else and win lots of Quakecraft games? Well
here are my top ten tips!

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.840
10. Sprint a lot
Always keep on your toes. The more you move,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.160
the harder it is for other players to frag
you.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.980
9. Be unpredictable
Try and switch things up a bit. Make sure

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.480
you don't run around the same routes or patterns
or you'll be a much easier target!

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.489
8. Be aware of your surroundings
It's important to be aware of every angle

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.760
of the map you're in. Frequently look up,
around and behind you to maximise your map

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.449
awareness.
7. Don't camp

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.870
Camping limits you to a small part of the
map, exposing you to less potential kills.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.129
Camping in one spot also reduces your overall
skill and map awareness. It only takes someone

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.319
with better aim and reactions to make camping
difficult.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:06.969
6. Shoot slightly ahead of players
Shooting ahead of players, or "leading shots",

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.909
can often be very useful, especially when
a player is moving around a lot. Aim slightly

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.560
infront of the player to increase your hit
count.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.990
5. Use crouch
Crouching, or sneaking, can be incredibly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.859
useful in Quakecraft as it will hide your
name plate from view. Crouching is one of

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.380
the best ways to stay hidden, reducing the
chance of being fragged!

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.369
4. Strafing is your friend!
Strafing, or side-stepping using the A and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.969
D keys, is your best defense mechanism. Use
strafing to avoid the shots of other players

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.109
but don't use the same strafe pattern or you
will be an easy target.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.460
3. Remember where players spawn
If you can memorise the spawn points of each

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.319
map, you can use these points to your advantage.
While sprinting, head to known spawn points.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.590
This is where you can grab a few extra kills
on unsuspecting spawners.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.599
2. Follow name plates
The name plates above each player are one

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.019
of the best tools for a Quakecrafter. Be aware
of each name plate and time your shots to

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.640
hit players who are obscured by walls or obsticals.
This way, you can frag them before they even

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.489
know you are there!
1. Aim at players feet!

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.099
This is one of the most important factors
of playing Quakecraft well. The Quakecraft

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.090
plugin registers shots to the feet far more
clearly than shots to anywhere else on a players

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.170
avatar. If you always aim at your opponents
feet, your kill count will increase dramatically.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.110
So ,these are my top ten tips for winning
Quakecraft.
