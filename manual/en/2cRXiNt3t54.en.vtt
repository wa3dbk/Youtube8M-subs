Hello, and welcome to Your Money 2.0. I’m
Thomas Fox, Community Outreach Director at

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.050
Cambridge Credit Counseling. Growing up in
my grandparents’ home made for some interesting

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.000
financial lessons. One of the most memorable
was the argument I made for the household

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.980
to get a cable TV subscription back in the
early 80’s. After a fair amount of my bellyaching,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.050
my grandparents conceded and we joined the
growing cable community. At first, we were

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
amazed by all the viewing choices; however,
after a fairly short amount of time it wasn’t

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.840
uncommon to hear someone shout, “We've got
28 channels and nothing worthwhile to watch!”

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.079
Well, a lot has changed. Now, we have hundreds
of channels and, arguably, the same gripe,

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.250
just on a larger scale. More important, the
costs of cable television and its bundled

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.550
products and services have gone up substantially.
When we first subscribed in the early 80’s,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.239
the cost was under $10 a month. In 2011, the
average American household spends roughly

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.330
$70 -- not including fees for DVR, high-definition
content, or cable box rentals. When all the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
charges are considered, many of us spend well
over $1000 each year -- a dollar amount that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.420
would stun my Depression-era grandparents.
The high cost of cable television has many

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.180
American second-guessing the expense, mainly
because of the amount of free and low-cost

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.200
content available via the Internet. Many of
your favorite stations stream programming

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.140
on their website, generally within a day of
a show’s original air date. There are also

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.600
wesbsites such as Fancast and Hulu that offer
collections of TV programs and even some movies

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.260
from major networks for free. For a nominal
monthly fee you can also subscribe to a service

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.729
such as Netfilx, or Hulu Plus, where you can
catch up on past seasons of TV shows and access

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.119
thousands of movies. Access to these services
will run you under $10 – a trip back in

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.600
time for some of us older cable subscribers.
I know, some of you may be leery of sitting

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.619
at your computer to watch your favorite show,
but you just might be surprised at some of

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.819
the ways you can access this content on your
television. If you have purchased a television

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.400
in the last year or so, your set might have
internet access built in. According to a recent

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.640
research report, roughly 16.5 million Americans
own Internet-enabled TVs, but only two percent

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.040
of us realize that fact. By 2014, it is predicted
that 47 million of us will own Internet-enabled

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.819
televisions, with roughly seven percent of
us using the Internet to get most of our content.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.680
You can also access Internet content through
the many gaming devices you may already own.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.070
Devices work best, and some only work with
a WiFi connection, so be sure to do your homework

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.830
before switching over to console viewing.
All three of the popular gaming platforms,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.790
the Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii, and the PlayStation
3 allow users to access Netflix. If you are

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.080
a Hulu Plus subscriber, you should have no
problem watching content on the 360 or PlayStation

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.820
3; however, the Wii is currently unable to
stream media from the site. If you don't feel

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.920
like subscribing to either service, not to
worry. You can access the Internet directly

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.100
from these consoles as well, which makes it
relatively easy to watch most of your favorite

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.400
programs from the comfort of your couch.
If you're still interested in saving money

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.550
by cutting the cable, and you’re uncomfortable
watching from your computer or don't own a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.210
gaming system, you can purchase an indoor
or outdoor antenna that is compatible with

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.909
a digital TV. You'll be able to enjoy most
of your local stations and may be able to

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.170
pick up a few additional ones based on how
good the reception is in your area. Before

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.879
you make any drastic moves, you have to conduct
some research to evaluate the various alternatives

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.769
that are available. There are plenty of blogs
and news articles that talk about what you

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.730
should experience when cutting cable-television.
You'll also find information about the latest

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.019
Internet TV devices and different ways to
configure your hardware to meet your media

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.970
needs.
Well, that’s it for this edition. As always,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.320
we welcome your feedback and ask for your
thoughts and suggestions by e-mailing us at

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.409

for watching. Until next time, I’m Thomas
