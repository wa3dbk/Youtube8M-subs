00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.020
Today I'm going to show you the Zar *mumble* A variant of E-mail worm.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.960
It will drop itself 3 times on Windows folder with 3 names (non-sense) we'll see later.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.620
It will send a message to each...

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.276
Eh...

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:19.316
...contact.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.280
And, finally it will...

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.200
Add itself to startup *gibberish* registry.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.420
In "Run" section.

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:39.173
Let's run it...

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.800
*mumbling non-sense*

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.340
Okay, here's the message that would be sent.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.720
The subject is: "Tsunami Donation! Please Help!"

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.380
"Please help us with your donation and view the attachment below! We need you!

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.180
The attachment is called "tsunami.exe", it's the same copy of actual worm.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.978
It drops itself...

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.640
...as "raz32", "tsunami"...

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.900
...and it should drop itself on something else (couldn't find 3rd dropped copy)...

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.460
Maybe I've mistaken. Let's see here...

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.560
Oh, there it is, it's "crssr".

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.180
Sorry for long delay, my mistake.

00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:55.361
Okay...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.840
And yeah, it drops itself on registry.

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.413
As "CaptionMgr32" (more likely said CaptionManager32)

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.300
But that's fake,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 it's a path to... worm.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.700
Okay.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.000
In addition it should actually attempt to ping one more site to attempt a...

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.480
...attempt a denial of a service (DDoS) attack, ...

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.820
... but I haven't / I didn't connect this virtual machine to...

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.860
...The Internet so that won't happen.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.094
Argh.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.020
If I try to run it again, it will repeat same thing, but...

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.060
...it's kinda wrong, it should send to all contacts, but it didn't.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.220
I don't know why, but... nevermind.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.340
Well, that's pretty much about it.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.840
Okay, maybe not.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.240
Let's just... where the hell is that...

00:03:04.135 --> 00:03:06.135
Uh...

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.740
Ah. If we try to run from here, it will...

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.720
...say "Permission denied". 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.000
It's kinda bugged, so I don't have no idea how to fix it.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.600
Maybe it's not designed for Windows 98...

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.600
...but it works, at least.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.380
Somehow.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.380
Uh, okay.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.660
That's it, and bye.
