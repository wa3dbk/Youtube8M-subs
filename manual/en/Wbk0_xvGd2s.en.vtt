Hi.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.740
My name is John Webb.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.349
I've been a badminton coach for over 15 years
and I'm going to show you some tips on how

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.580
to play badminton.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.050
Hi.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.349
I'm going to talk to you about some badminton
techniques which really help improve your

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.800
game.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.990
Some techniques really, when you're just coming
in as a beginner, really want to improve your

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.420
game or you improve or just want to get to
the next level.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.790
Badminton techniques I'm going to talk to
you about are the overhead, forehand and backhand

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.269
overhead shot.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:50.250
It's the shots all above you on the forehand
side and the backhand side, they equate for

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.050
about eighty percent of shots you're going
to play in badminton.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.710
So it's probably the most important technical
shots, the forehand and backhand overheads.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.830
Just split it into two.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.670
Let me talk to you about the forehand overhead
shot.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.870
The forehand overhead shot is a really powerful
shot and you could play it clear, a smash,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.450
a drop or a drive.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.960
They're all forehand overhead shots.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
And the only difference with each of these
shots, it's the point of contact with the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.979
shuttle.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.110
Let me talk to you through some basics of
the overhead shot.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.110
Start with all these shots you're going to
be playing in the rear court by the boundary

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:47.979
line so preparation for these shots are going
to have forehand grip, hand grip, your racket

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.880
is going to be up, your non-racket arm is
up also to support.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.310
You want to be slightly sideways on.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.399
By sideways on, you're like an arch with a
bow and arrow so you're coiling the spring

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.369
sideways arm.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.420
Racket head nice and high and flat face and
the racket arm up.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.679
So that's the preparation.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.110
The ways you're in the balls of the feet from
foot down there, you're nice and turned and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.990
the next is the execution of the shot, you
want to be playing as high as possible so

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.330
get your full range in, so you're back there,
turn around and then you're playing that and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.330
you can see once you're playing that, follow
through the racket leg, the dominant leg is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.770
coming right the way through and then you're
recovering to the middle of the court and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.690
you're receiving stunts.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.760
Let me show you that again.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.990
So you're back here, you turn round, you're
coiled, take it up, the weight transferred

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.970
to the front foot comes through and you're
coming forward there.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.090
That's one of the overhead shots, forehand
overhead shot and you can play that, different

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.250
shots of that.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.550
Second one, players often find this most difficult
is the backhand overhead shot.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.260
Let me talk to you through this though.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.190
Okay, so you start with the backhand grip
which is the thumb down and you'd start in

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.760
this position that you want to be with the
right foot back, your racket up and your sideways

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.970
on to there, backhand's played on the left
hand side of the court.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.510
Once you're here, so you're sideways on to
the court.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.660
The racket is back with you're backhand grip
up there and you're on the dominant foot is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.290
at the back with the knee bent.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.380
That's the starting position.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.430
So the actual execution of the shot, you're
actually going right up with the racket really

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.990
high, right up but playing that, your arm
is turned, you're pivoting back in and what

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:06.480
you're doing is you're transferring from your
racket foot back on and then you're coming

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.510
back into the court.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.550
Let me show you this in the full.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.620
Starting, turn, hit up, and then coming back
there.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.680
So just like that, turn and then you're back.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.219
That's all about timing precision.

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.229
That was the backhand overhead shot.

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.319
So very important techniques to master.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.400
It's going to take a few lessons to get into
it.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.370
You can get the overhead forehand and backhand
shot if you've got really good basics to a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.500
game. .
