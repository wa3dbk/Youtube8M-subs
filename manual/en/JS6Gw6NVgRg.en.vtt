00:00:01.952 --> 00:00:03.686
I've got
scotch, vodka,

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:05.521
A nice chablis
in the--

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:07.690
Cut the shit,
will you?

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:09.192
Just cut it!

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:14.130
I don't know
what you're up to,

00:00:14.198 --> 00:00:16.866
But it's
going to stop now.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.868
No. It's going
to go on

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.003
Until you face
your responsibilities.

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:22.272
What responsibilities?

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.408
I'm pregnant. I'm going
to have our child.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:28.411
Your choice has nothing
to do with me!

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.281
I want to be
a part of your life.

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:34.050
By showing up
at my apartment?

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.653
What am I
supposed to do?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.156
I mean, I'm not going
to be ignored, dan.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.160
You don't get it.

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:46.229
You just don't get it.

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:49.165
Don't you remember
our weekend?

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:52.168
I mean, wasn't
that wonderful?

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.171
Why can't we just
be like that again?

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.674
I know
you feel it, too.

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.209
What are you
so afraid of?

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.713
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
flatter yourself, alex.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.181
Go ahead. Hit me.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:08.184
If you can't fuck me,
just hit me.

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:10.253
You're lonely
and very sad.

00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.988
Don't pity me,
you smug bastard.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.658
I'll pity you
because you're sick!

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:19.195
Why? Because you can't
treat me like some slut

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.599
You can bang twice
and throw in the garbage?

00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:28.705
I'm going to be
the mother of your child.

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.274
I want a little respect.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:36.212
You want respect?

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:40.466
Respect.

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.651
What are you doing?

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.219
Please, dan, don't go.

00:01:43.287 --> 00:01:44.654
I didn't mean it.

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.356
I'll tell your wife.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.224
Aah!

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:52.228
You tell my wife,
I'll kill you.

00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:57.032
It only takes
a phone call!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.635
[door slams]

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.173
Hello?

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:06.175
Hello.
