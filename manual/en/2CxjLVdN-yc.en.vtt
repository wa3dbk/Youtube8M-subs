Hour of Code at Avenues is a week in December
where every student on campus spends

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.400 line:56%
at least one hour doing some kind of 
computer programming-related activity.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.140
I’m going to show you guys a cool video.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990
It’s actually really easy to learn.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.410
Girls should learn this too.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.660 line:78%
Programming is a lot easier today.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.820 line:78%
Don’t just play on your phone. Program it.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.780
Code.org and the Organization for Computer
Science in High Schools is promoting this

Code.org and the Organization for Computer
Science in High Schools is promoting this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.300
idea of everyone doing just an hour of code
to get comfortable with programming and see

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.420
that it can be fun and not just for geeks.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.980
So, all of the sixth graders today are making
interactive holiday cards with Scratch.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.400
I’m making a video of Christmas,
a ‘Merry Christmas’ card.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.040
They can do it for any holiday they want and
the idea is that they’ll make something

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.260
that isn’t just a picture, but it
actually does something.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.359
So, you click on it and the character spins
around or it says something.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.820
We are doing this because we think that computer
science is very important in K-through-12 education.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.250
What we did this morning with the preschoolers
was we had them pair off into teams where

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.230
one kid was a programmer and one kid was a robot.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.640
The programmer had a series of instructions
on graphical cards—so they didn’t need

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.200
to be able to read—that they could program the robot
with, and then the robot had to follow those things.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.219
Just the beginning of an idea of how code
happens without really putting it in those terms.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.220
So let’s pick up our iPads again and try to
do the same thing with your creature

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.420
that you guys just told me to do.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.520
I added characters and put ‘move’ and
‘rotation’ on everyone, and then they all moved.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.220 line:60%
I was in a music class and we 
worked on the musical aspect of

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
I was in a music class and we 
worked on the musical aspect of

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.619
how computers can make
sound and make synthesizers.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.220
In world religion, we had an almost 30-minute

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.950 line:63%
round-table discussion about how these days,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.700
round-table discussion about how these days,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.420
such as the day of code, affect personal passions.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.980
I could see myself going into a job with coding.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.230
I like the way it made me feel at the end.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.030
Once you actually look at it and you’re like,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.820
‘Oh my God, I did 30 lines,'

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.000
then you feel the sort-of accomplishment

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.620
that I coded 30 lines.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.800
Any profession, if you have that in your toolbox,
you’re going to be a more valuable employee.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.040
We all use these computers all the time, 
every day, but we really don’t have that much

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.860
awareness of what they really do, and
that you can actually be more than a user,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.209
that you can actually be a creator with computers.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.229
And one way you can do that is with programming.
