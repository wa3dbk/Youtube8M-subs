00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.733
Pedro the Second Of Brazil

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.618
Good enough for me

00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:01.618
More marble!

00:00:01.618 --> 00:00:03.558
There's a reason it's called Tradition

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.078
Let's fill out this tree!

00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:08.188
+15% towards the Great Library I'm trying
to build

00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:11.357
6 turns left, I just might get it

00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:12.808
My land is much better

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:14.328
Three turns til' I'm rolling in books

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:15.978
I actually did it!

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:17.957
Ya straight to Drama &amp; Poetry

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.688
Might as well put our Unique Ability to good
use early

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.467
Must finish this tree!

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:23.467
Land the elite

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:24.717
Education: always a good goal

00:00:24.717 --> 00:00:27.877
I doubt I'll get this but wors t case is free
gold

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:29.708
Oh great, it begins

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.238
I can philosophize AND colonize

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:34.058
Helix save the queen

00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:37.438
Complete the National College before the settler
settles the settlement

00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:39.618
I never asked for this?

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.368
What a happy little community

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.398
The garden helps the UA

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:44.398
Finish the tree!

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:45.398
Finish the tree!

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:46.398
Hey Bill

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:47.398
Water mill?

00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:48.407
Nah I think I want the...

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:49.407
Oracle!

00:00:49.407 --> 00:00:50.887
13 turns to go.

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:52.997
Sao Paulo has minuscule production

00:00:52.997 --> 00:00:54.837
Protect with archers (before we need them!)

00:00:54.837 --> 00:00:57.598
All the wonders are being built by others!

00:00:57.598 --> 00:00:59.358
What a strange sight, better make it pretty

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:03.988
50% longer Golden Ages will not make us unstoppable
(spoiler alert)

00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:05.378
Use these trees!

00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:08.638
Construction means composition of bowman rather
than archers

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:09.967
Covet Lake Victoria!

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:10.967
Oooohh

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:12.568
An equestrian academy

00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:15.348
Golden Age Lengthening Complete

00:01:15.348 --> 00:01:16.988
Soon we'll fill these boxes

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:19.618
Printing Press, so we can be the host with
the most

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:22.607
I don't know why anyone would want to attack
us

00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.888
Cultural Centers - all with horrible parking

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:26.518
Sao Paolo really needs some production

00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.238
Oh great

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:29.458
Well then violence it is

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.438
I think I'll complete the Chapel regardless

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:33.967
Ya I could use a friend right now

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:36.418
Ok we need more death for the other guys

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:38.138
Purchase some crossbows

00:01:38.138 --> 00:01:39.198
Flourish in the Arts!

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.478
Ya you better accept

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:42.818
Back to my Wonder-acquiring

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:45.698
Dooby do la la la

00:01:45.698 --> 00:01:47.677
Harbor for boosting trade

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:49.007
Almost done our beauty tree

00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:51.018
A golden age extension is in order

00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:52.208
I was waiting for this

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.247
But am I prepared?

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.478
If we can't see the enemy, they aren't there

00:01:56.478 --> 00:01:58.067
To the keep!

00:01:58.067 --> 00:01:59.528
This seems calm

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:00.528
Just some naval warfare

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:02.558
Ya but for how long

00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:04.918
Finish the tree with cultural exchanges!

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:06.768
It's too quiet out there

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:08.307
Amphitheatrics for the drama club

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:10.658
Ya that isn't suspicious at all

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:11.798
WAR

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.278
Pew pew pew

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.568
BRING IT ON

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.008
Upgrade here and there

00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:17.748
Economy for wartimes

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:19.568
The city begins to burn

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:20.718
YAY PEACE

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:21.888
For an afternoon maybe

00:02:21.888 --> 00:02:24.358
Ok, rebuild, protect

00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:25.838
Where is my worker?!

00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:27.258
Up coastal production

00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:29.867
We need trade for industry, and industry for
trade

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:30.867
More tradition!

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:33.748
And WAR, Gatling Guns will intimidate the
foes

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:37.128
The foes go unintimidated... bye Sao Paolo

00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:38.947
Rio De Janerio is our only hope

00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:40.798
Finish the exploration tree or else!

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:42.768
Hmm... how can I prevent certain death

00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:44.337
Oh, like that

00:02:44.337 --> 00:02:45.337
REBUILD

00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:46.388
Get that trade going

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.798
Seriously we need cargo ships yesterday

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.358
An archeologist to find new tourism

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:52.508
Peace has gone on too long

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:55.248
I am appreciating the lack of smoke

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:57.587
Yes more positive percentages!

00:02:57.587 --> 00:02:59.117
Subs to avoid submission

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:00.378
Here we go again

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:02.648
Well at least it isn't raining fire from the
sky yet

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.678
Trade amidst the chaos

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:06.858
I guess I should be Rational at some point

00:03:06.858 --> 00:03:08.007
Bring on the hurt

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:10.178
Attila's worker is asking to be shot

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:13.178
The sky is falling, the sky is falling

00:03:13.178 --> 00:03:14.498
I don't know how I feel about this

00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:15.498
Oh.

00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:16.498
Defeat

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:16.499
Sigh.
