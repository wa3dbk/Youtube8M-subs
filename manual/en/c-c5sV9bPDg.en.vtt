00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.800
Embryo of Dicot Seeds

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.110
A seed is a small embryonic plant structure
which is capable of growing into a new plant.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.110
A typical seed has a three basic parts: an
embryo, storage of nutrients for the embryo,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.730
and a seed coat. All seeds are different in
size, shape and colour. Under proper condition

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.420
for germination, the embryo develops into
a mature plant. It is nourished by the food

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.239
reserves in the storage structures called
cotyledons. The embryo has one cotyledon in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.239
monocotyledons and two cotyledons in almost
all dicotyledons.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.290
Materials required:

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.290
Watch glass containing seeds of bean, gram
and pea, forceps, needle, three small beakers

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.770
containing distilled water and a dissecting
microscope.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.540
Procedure:

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.540
Put the seeds (pea, gram and bean) into three
different beakers containing distilled water.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.280
Soak the seeds overnight. The seeds imbibe
water through the micropyle when soaked in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.180
water.
Take one seed from each beaker and put it

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.180
into a watch glass using forceps.
We can see that the bean has a kidney shape:

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.500
a gram and pea are round in shape.
On each seed we can easily identify a scar

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.250
called hilum. The seed is attached to the
inner margin of the fruit by means of the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.799
hilum.
Taking a look at each seed carefully; we can

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.799
observe a micropyle on the seeds of bean,
gram and pea. Water is absorbed via the micropyle

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.319
during the germination of seed.
Carefully remove seed coats of each seed,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.319
using forceps and a needle.
Place seed onto the stage of the dissection

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.989
microscope using forceps. Separate the two
cotyledons of each seed using forceps and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:43.709
a needle to locate the embryo between them.
Examine each part of the embryo of the seed

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:52.139
through the lens of the dissection microscope.
An embryo consists of an embryonal axis to

00:02:53.529 --> 00:03:00.529
which two thick fleshy cotyledons are attached.
The cotyledons are food storage organs.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.639
One end of the embryonic axis lies enclosed
between the two cotyledons, and is called

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:16.639
plumule. It develops into the shoot.
The other end of the embryonic axis protrudes

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:24.689
outside the cotyledons, and is called radicle.
This develops into the root.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.579
Since two cotyledons are seen in bean, gram
and pea seeds, they are dicot seeds.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.680
Precautions

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.900
Seeds should be soaked overnight in distilled
water.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.840
Be careful that the seed is not damaged when
removing the seed coat.
