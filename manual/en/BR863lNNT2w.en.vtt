00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.840
Hello everyone Michael here with the daily
note 2 and 3 YouTube channel and today is

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.180
all about S note for the galaxy note 3 so
the big question has been are all the functions

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.340
of S note on the galaxy note 2 are they present
on the galaxy note 3 yes but couple of functions

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.930
on the galaxy note 2's S note have moved away
from the S note app so let me give you an

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.680
example the galaxy note 2's S note used to
be the popup note reader well all the pop

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.370
up note functionality it is now called action
memo it has been moved away from the S note

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.880
app and you do it all inside the action memo
so this has been completely separated from

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.680
anything related to S note
you manage all your notes in there and it

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.130
accesses the files really quickly send makes
a big difference and another thing that has

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.530
been moved away from the S note you used to
be able to long tap on this shape icon called

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.520
productivity tools and then click on the function
button there then used to be able to do this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:28.170
and then you could do search and then it used
to open up Wolfram alpha and then it used

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.479
to do that math equation for you
well that does not happen on S note anymore

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.219
so you can do this on the galaxy note 3 but
it is just really buried in there and I'm

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:47.170
not kidding just open up air command go to
S Finder on the search field hover over the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.280
cursor you'll see that pen icon.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.079
Just click into that click on the function
there

00:01:52.079 --> 00:02:02.719
and now you can do this
and you can go to search and you go Wolfram

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.619
alpha
other than the wolfram alpha thing everything

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.069
else has been pretty nice so let's look at
S note so you could see it came with this

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.750
big large widget when I first got my note
3 so let's tap into that same thing as clicking

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.760
on the icon there but comes this nice video
intro and here you could just select a couple

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.569
of cover styles that you would like to use
later preferably

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.629
sure
and I would recommend just picking the blank

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.431
canvas here because a lot of these are nice
because you know they are styled then you

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:45.570
could just tap into it and a picture but it's
not going to be useful for everything new

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.900
that you write
and your selecting the default template for

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.620
everything you that you create so white makes
sense

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.790
you can see you can sync the S notes that
you create into Samsung account or Evernote

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.739
so I'll just select evernote, but it probably
works the same

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.660
so one thing that I really like the galaxy
note 3 is the eraser function so let me write

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.170
my name and if you want to erase it's really
quick

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.769
go through it and it just gets rid of the
strokes

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.530
so I spent a lot of time with S note today
and I could say for certain that all the functions

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.920
that you had on the galaxy note 2's S note
is indeed in here

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.370
so let me just go over the ones that you might
be looking for that are a little bit harder

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.219
to find
so for example you want to make this into

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.599
a perfect square and you want to make this
the perfect circle well, you need to first

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.590
selected it
so I'm going to select and then I'm going

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.920
to transform info and then I'm going to shape
same thing for here I'll select it, transfer

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.170
info shape and now they're perfect squares
and circles

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.459
or I guess that's a rectangle so let me show
you a hidden gesture on the S note so hover

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.110
over this icon on the bottom left and you
see that it's kinda glowing just click with

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.720
your clicker on the S pen and now you can
select pictures out of your gallery and just

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.930
in case you haven't seen I thought it was
cool effect this is present on the galaxy

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.230
note 2 but you could add effects to the image
that you add to your S note and I thought

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.610
that looked cool so I just wanted to show
you that

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.510
ok, moving on
here's another one see that you want to rotate

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:47.060
some text 
and select the selector tool but you can't

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.970
put a box around that you need to do a long
tap because it is an object and you can move

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:02.450
this and with here you can rotate it so let's
look in here and I'll talk about what's new

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.580
on the s note for the note 3
so easy chart is a new thing

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.350
so let's create a pie chart
you can draw a pie in here and then you could

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:23.880
select slices and then you could give these
names and you could change the name from item

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:38.130
1 to something like pizza
and then say you want change this to 17% 17.1

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:46.340
and it took that
so yeah, it's pretty cool

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.530
let's resize this a little bit
every other functionality other than maybe

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.750
scrap book is inside your galaxy note 2 and
you could see all the stuff that I've been

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.050
playing with
with the scrapbooking tool from this right

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.210
just scrap book something it ends up in there
and now I can place it into the S note

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.650
and from the menu button here you can record
your sketching

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:21.500
so I'm going to hit that record button and
draw couple of squiggly lines

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.170
and then I'm going to hit this checkmark to
save it and to play back your recording you

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.590
have this icon here
and another thing that you'll be able to see

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.770
is if you did a voice recording they'll be
a similar type icon there oh and one last

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.120
thing there's this gesture here so say that
your drawing and you want to get rid of these

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.870
tools here
with your three fingers you just spread out

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.550
and supposedly could bring it in by doing
that reverse motion

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.910
so I've exited out of my S note app and you
could see the widget now shows a couple of

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.110
here
you could see the recent notes here there's

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.440
a preview can flip through different notebooks
that you created

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.680
and inside the S note app directly you could
do this

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.440
you can drag the S note down and you can get
a preview of what's inside by dragging it

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.000
down
and one lasting remember we synced this with

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.930
Evernote's so go inside your evernote app
and now you could see that it has the note

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.090
that we created and it just kind of ends up
in there so anyway that's the end of today's

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.860
episode and make sure you check out my other
