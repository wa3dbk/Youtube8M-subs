DENTON TARVER: Today
on Urban Gardener--

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.100
we're headed to a Brooklyn
patio garden.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.230
This wall this extraordinary.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.420
It starts from the floor
and goes as high

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.050
as anybody can reach.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.950
It contains all levels of
plants, all kinds of blooms.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.720
We have vines.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.970
Even trees.

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:55.090
This looks like we have a bunch
of different kinds of

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.550
vines growing up here.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.460
They've all been put together
in a really interesting way.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.480
If you look at this wall long
enough, you keep seeing new

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.489
things that jump out at you,
which is really interesting,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.395
especially in a small
space like this.

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:10.955
This is called nasturtium.

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:13.270
But it has these interesting
round leaves.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.490
It's really beautiful bloom,
which is also edible.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.190
MALE SPEAKER: This was our
rooftop, and for the first

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.790
year, we never used it 'cause
it would get too hot.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.830
Eventually, I was like, I'm
gonna bite the bullet and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.784
spend the money and
build a deck.

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:39.470
c This wall is aluminum
siding.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.370
And as you can see, it's
really boring.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.240
And that's my window
right there.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.500
That's where we started.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.130
DENTON TARVER: So you
made a little bed.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.780
MALE SPEAKER: A little bed--

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.120
DENTON TARVER: And then you
started layering up.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.460
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.840
Yes.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.360
DENTON TARVER: And now we
have vines everywhere.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.520
MALE SPEAKER: This whole
thing, actually,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.030
has a lot of purpose.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.010
There used to be a couple that
sat in that window all the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.100
time looking over here.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.370
DENTON TARVER: A little
leering going on.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.480
MALE SPEAKER: So I wanted
to block them.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.890
So this is like a
privacy wall.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.789
This is what I call
my rock garden.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.360
It reminds me of
a quiet corner.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.300
I spent hours chiseling
holes in the rock.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.390
DENTON TARVER: Oh, wait,
you made this?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.970
With the rock here?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.220
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.410
DENTON TARVER: Well, it
seems like you have

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.080
everything in here.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.700
Are you like a garden MacGyver
or something like that?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.950
MALE SPEAKER: Kind of.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420
I work with small spaces
as a living.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.470
Every time I shopping
for plants, I'm

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.440
shopping for myself.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.690
I like to go a lot to vintage
shops, garage

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.925
sales, Salvation Armys.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.200
You never know what
you can find.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.730
And that's where you find all
this interesting stuff.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.350
It's all about keeping it tight

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.298
and keeping it organized.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.340
