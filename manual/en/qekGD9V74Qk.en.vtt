Hi, I’m Rachel Dayan for Expert Village.
Now we’re going to make two trees, this

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.910
is a little bit harder, so we’re going to
have here, Hilliah, which is five years old

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.541
and Elishivah which is seven years old, gonna
make the trees to decorate our zoo here too.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:31.189
Elishivah, this is gonna be the stem of the
tree and Hilliah, we’re going to roll, roll

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:41.460
the, uh, the clay, into a thick, into a thick
part, very good Hilliah, not too much, not

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:51.000
too much, very good, very nice. Now fold it
up and we’re going to open it a little bit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.800
Open it and this is going to be the stem for
our tree. We’re going to take now green

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:14.430
clay, and, and make little long snakes, longer
snakes, longer and thinner snakes. Those are

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.060
going to be our leaves. Hilliah, what we do
with our long snakes, I’m gonna squish it

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:33.690
like this, squish it gently, very good, squish
it Hilliah, very good, put it on the table

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.000
and squish it, not too hard and now after
you squished it, you’re going to start folding

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.250
it up, you take it out, and stuff a little
bit, we’re going to take it off the table,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:58.810
and you start folding it like, up this, fold
it up, okay, fold it up, very nice, very good

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:19.200
Hilliah. Very good, fold it up, these are
going to be our leafs, take the folded clay

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.530
and put it around the branches here. You have
branches too, Hilliah, you just take it and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.150
put it around, around like this, you just
stick it to the, to the clay. You need another

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:43.200
one, so do some more; it needs to cover all
the branches over there. Now you can either

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.350
make fruits for your tree, you can leave them
like that, you can make little fruits oranges

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.460
or apples as you wish.
