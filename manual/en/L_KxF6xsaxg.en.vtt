00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.469
Duryodhana's angry...

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.709
We cannot continue to sustain such casualties, my king.

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:24.409
All these since this morning?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420
He has every right to be.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.080
The bodies reach as far as the horizon.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.440
Sire, there will always be casualties.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.780
His troops are being annihilated...

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.839
Casualties?! These on my men!

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.890
How can I win this war if you let them
get wiped out?!

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.540
...But the commanders don't care about the lives of common men.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.640
What can you expect? These men lack
quality their worth is in their quantity, sire!

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.620
if you hurl enough rocks at a wall, it
must eventually break.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.020
These "rocks" are dying in their thousands, General.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.540
It is their duty to die, Karna.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.140
You should not concern...

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.300
Ugh!

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.920
These men shed their blood for you, General.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.740
Show them some respect.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.020
How dare you?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Who do you think you are to lay your hands upon me?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.950
I should...

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.820
Should what, General?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.820
Enough! I shall not have my generals
bickering like a washer women.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.900
We shall return to the command tent to discuss

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.950
a new strategy. One that does not
involve so much....

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.200
... Waste

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.040
- Drink this. - Lord Karna. Lord, don't worry yourself.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.370
You have far more important matters to be dealing with... surely.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.369
You think your life is of no
consequence?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.660
I'm no great warrior, Lord. What
difference does my life make in this war?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.140
Even the lowliest of us can rise and shake the dreams of princes.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.860
