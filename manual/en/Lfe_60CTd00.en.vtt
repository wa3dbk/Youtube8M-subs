Hey guys Dabearsfan06 here and today we have for you The Lonely Traveler Tutorial.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.180
Higher level completed the higher the capture rate.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.540
She is a light fighter and bringing a mono dark team would do the most damage but you will also be weak to her.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.960
With strong dark fighters you can kill her pretty quick. If you don't have strong dark fighters bring a different element mono team.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.480
For item setup you would want seals and ores of the element for your mono team. Also recommend revive, divine light and strongest single target healing.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.580
For the battles its random trash mobs till battle 4 where you will fight the "mini boss". Battle 6 has the group fight of Pegasus's .Boss on battle 7.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:41.740
Here is the "mini boss" fight, you will fight Wyvern or Atro. You have a small chance of catching Atro but not wyvern.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.780
Group of Pegasus can paralyze you. 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.480
The boss does single target and area effect moves. With divine lights you can help recover from the aoe moves. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:14.660
We are gonna start the battle off by using a ore and a seal. And just attack away. Keep healed up to stay alive. She will increase her attack and defense.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:17.100
For higher level players the fights are fairly easy. But for new players these fighters can be useful to your team.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.660
Alright guys that is it for this tutorial. I hope I was able to help some new players potentially beat The Lone Traveler and add her to your arsenal!
