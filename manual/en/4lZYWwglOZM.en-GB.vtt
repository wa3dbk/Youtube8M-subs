00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.650
The tackling the terrace project was an opportunity
to see how you could bring a group of people

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.500
together to do an external wall insulation
project, and to see if there were any cost

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
savings that could be made, whether there
were any social issues that went with it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.360
And it was really looking at it as a sort
of very early Green Deal pilot. The bigger

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.360
scale you can do it, the more savings you
will get on costing and delivery of materials

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.650
to site. For example putting the scaffolding
up all at once there was a cost saving in

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.570
that for the four home-owners. The other benefit
for doing a multi-property solid wall insulation

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.220
project is that if you were to do it on a
single house one at a time different neighbours

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.960
might use different products so they might
be different thicknesses, and then you have

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.000
joint problems, potential joint problems where
you could get water ingress or you've got

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.259
air that could come in or out which makes
the insulation not as good as when you do

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.610
it all in one go. And actually from an aesthetic
point of view I think it probably looks better.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.610
Projects like this do provide work for local
people and we used a lot of local people.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.180
All of our neighbours actually got on really
well. They do spend time with each other,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.510
they've got children around a similar age
that play in the back garden so we were very

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.570
lucky with the people we got. But if you haven't
got neighbours that speak to each other maybe

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.020
don't consider using them for a multi-property
project.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.070
Projects like Tackling the Terrace give an
opportunity to encourage others to go through

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.760
and do this type of work themselves.
In terms of funding future projects like this

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.340
the Green Deal may be an opportunity for some
community groups to set up similar type projects.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.000
The ECO funding that goes alongside of it
might be an opportunity where they can help

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.239
people do solid wall insulation on hard-to-treat
properties or there are other simpler things

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.700
with people on lower incomes that are really
struggling to pay their heating bills so it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.940
might be heating upgrades that they'd do,
or possibly double glazing. Draughtprooofing

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.230
is an excellent way where communities can
get involved and help people save money on

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.909
their electricity and gas bills just by really
simple measures.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.909
Community groups have a lot to do with community
buildings such as schools, churches, village

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.549
halls, that sort of thing. You can come together
as a community group and look at grant funding

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.790
that you can find that could improve these
sorts of facilities which have a huge effect

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.749
on local communities whether it's the mother
and toddler group or it's a yoga class or

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:53.159
it's the scout hut. I mean if you can save
energy for all of these groups then it's

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.340
gonna be better because they can spend money
on different things.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.659
Community groups have a huge role to play
with helping people understand energy efficiency

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:07.400
in the home, whether it's from just understanding
how to work out your boiler controls through

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.430
to helping them with projects like the Tackling
the Terrace project. People tend to trust

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.799
others in their community, so if you know
somebody and they're saying this is how

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.559
you can improve your home so that it's a
warmer place to live in without your bills

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:28.559
being astronomical then I think that's a
really good opportunity for other community groups.
