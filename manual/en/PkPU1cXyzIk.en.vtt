Hi, I'm Dan Garcia.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.809
We're going to talk about flamenco scales.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.180
There's some scales you can use when you're
playing flamenco.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.880
There is such a thing as a flamenco scale
and I'm going to show you what it is.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.860
Flamenco is very commonly played in what we
call Phrygian mode.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.930
Phrygian scale is the scale that rises from
the third degree of your major scale.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.079
That means, if you take,for example, the white
keys on a piano and you go from a C to a C,

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.469
without touching any of the black keys, that's
a major scale.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.699
Now if we start that same scale, instead of
from C to C, we go from E, which is a third

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.229
note, so C-D-E.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.710
We're going to start from E, and we would
go up all the white notes to the next E. That's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.440
called an E-Phrygian scale.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.609
One of the features of the scale is the half
step between the first note and the second,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.449
that will be between the E and the F, okay?

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.850
And that's one of the main harmonic features
of flamenco, is that Phrygian sound that we

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.939
hear all of the time.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.140
Kind of like...

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.229
So basically a flamenco scale is a Phrygian
scale, but we're going to include one more

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.329
note there.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.810
The flamenco scale also accommodates the major
and the minor key.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.270
Whether we're playing in A major or A minor,
we would use the same scale, and that means

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.160
that Phrygian scale is going to include an
extra note to make that accommodation.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.750
Let me play you just a Phrygian scale.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.770
If I was in the key of A, I'm going to play
A-Phrygian.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.830
The flamenco scale's an eight note scale.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:09.079
A Phrygian scale, with an added major third.
