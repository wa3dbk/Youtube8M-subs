Multiple reps with a higher weight you can use it for muscle building as well

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.689
This exercise can also be applied to a wide variety of sports

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.159
But it's more than likely going to help you out the most with the sports that involve a lot of pulling

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.380
So let's move on to demonstration

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.990
This exercise can be performed with the use of a weighted vest or a belt

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.130
When performing this exercise there are a few things you want to avoid you want to avoid swinging or using too much momentum

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.660
short reps

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.459
And you also want to avoid kicking your feet as you pull yourself up to the bar

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.490
Try to come into a full retraction and hold that contraction for at least one second

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.919
You can choose to do this exercise with an underhand grip or a neutral grip

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.379
You also want to make sure that you're controlling the negative reps as well

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.409
When performing the negative reps try to remain stiff and keep them from swinging or swaying

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.479
When in a full retraction your chin should be up and over the bar

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.389
if you're not strong enough to pull yourself up with the additional weight a

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.089
Great way to get stronger with this exercise is to jump into the top part of the movement

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.400
and then slowly let yourself down really focusing on controlling the negative

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.639
Find a box or an elevated surface that you can use to stand on in front of the bar

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.059
