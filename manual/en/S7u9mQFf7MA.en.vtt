00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.130
Hey what's up YouTube!

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.130
This is El Tiro.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.330
Today's tutorial Thursday where I'll teach
new dance concept to learn; and in light of

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.600
everyone kind of being back in school, I'm
going to give you three awesome dance moves

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.010
you can do in school, at school, around school
and you're gonna need three things too, a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.680
pencil, a backpack and a piece of paper.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.120
Once you got those things, let's get started!

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.130
So my backpack move goes like this.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.560
There's lots of times where you need to pick
up your backpack.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.920
And if you just reach out to pick it up, that's
lame.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.180
What we're gonna do instead is use a hand
isolation combo to pick up our backpack.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.149
It looks like this.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.710
So I'm gonna go (whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,
shoop).

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.760
This move is guaranteed to get you all the
ladies.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
Not really!

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.690
But it goes like this, I'm gonna have my right
arm out like this, I'll be using my back to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.129
bend low, my legs are gonna stay stiff and
I'm just gonna move my neck forward and my

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.120
rest of my shoulders and my back stays back,
and then I'm gonna bring my shoulders forward.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.969
When I do that, then my neck goes back.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.229
So it's really like those two steps, neck
only, then all the body comes, and then your

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.510
neck goes back.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.170
Neck only, all the body, neck, all the body
until you got your backpack then you can pick

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.570
it up.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
Backpack move!

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.920
So you got your piece of paper ready.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.320
Here's what we're gonna do on this one.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.109
I'm gonna stick it out flat like this.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.280
I'm gonna start a wave with my fingertips
which is gonna wave through my paper and go

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.630
to my other fingertips.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.140
It's gonna go around to my shoulder and move
to my neck, all the way to the right.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.500
It's gonna to my shoulder and back to the
wave.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.500
So you're kinda doing this cycle.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.380
You can also go reverse (whoop) and back and
forth.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.670
So your paper is like a continuation of the
wave.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.670
Paper move!

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.659
If you got your pencil ready, this is probably
the coolest one out of all of them.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.740
So I'm gonna do three different variations,
mechanical kind of robotic movement.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.650
First one, I'm gonna take the pencil on a
part of my forehead, I'm gonna twist and when

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.890
I do, I'm gonna open my jaw like this.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.310
Part one!

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.860
Second step, I'm gonna put the pencil right
under my chin and the same kind of twisting

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.690
motion, I'm gonna now cycle from right to
left, using my twisting.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.240
I can do that in intervals too (whoop whoop),
back and forth.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.500
And the final one, I'm gonna take the pencil
and put it on my chest, everytime I twist,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.830
my left arm is gonna shoot up like this and
they can go backwards too.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.580
Or it can go (faster) and kick the pencil
of (arm down), falls down.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.290
Well there you have it, that's tutorial Thursday
for today.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.380
If you'd like to have kind of back to school

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.000
more of stuff you want to do in the classroom
or during recess or whatever, comment below

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.930
cause I got plenty more of where that came
from.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.530
Otherwise, I'd really appreciate it if you'll
share this video with maybe some friends of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.690
yours that would like to dance.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.250
