00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.226
- Hi YouTube friends!

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:11.817
- Hey everyone.

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:13.867
- Justin and I are back from our vacation.

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.295
That means Tasty Tuesday
actually on Tuesdays.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.206
Today we're gonna show you
how to make lemon bars.

00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:22.624
I one day just had extra lemons

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:25.367
and I tried this recipe
and it was good, so.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:25.997
- Bomb.

00:00:25.997 --> 00:00:28.475
- Every single time it
tastes a bit different

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.730
depending on the lemons you
have, but give this a try.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.550
Stay tuned.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.363
We'll need lemons,

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.878
flour,

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:42.596
sugar,

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:46.842
butter,

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:48.358
eggs,

00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:50.072
and this is optional, but you can also

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:52.707
in the end sprinkle some powdered sugar.

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:53.810
So let's begin.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.923
In a large bowl, you are going to add

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.301
one cup of butter that is softened.

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:01.566
You can soften your butter in
a microwave for 20 seconds.

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.867
Then you are going to add
a half a cup of sugar,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.346
and then two cups of flour.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.292
Then, using a hand mixer I'm
just mixing it all together.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:12.136
You can definitely mix it by hand.

00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:15.468
And then in a square pan I'm
placing the crust mixture

00:01:15.468 --> 00:01:18.917
and I'm going to press firmly
to create the crust bottom.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.543
And then you're going to bake that

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:24.164
for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:28.040
And now to the lemon bar
part, or the yummiest part.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.716
You're gonna crack four eggs,
and then I'm gonna whisk away.

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.659
And then add a half a cup of sugar,

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.549
sorry about that throat sound.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.032
And then you're going to mix,

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:44.095
and then I'm adding a
quarter cup of flour.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:46.919
Then you are going to
squeeze your two lemons.

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:49.885
That's one lemon and then I'm
gonna squeeze another one.

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:52.567
And then you are going
to thoroughly whisk away.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.757
And the crust should be
baked after 15 minutes,

00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:57.179
so you're just gonna grab that.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.942
Be careful cause the crust
part is hot and the pan is hot.

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:02.198
And you're just gonna
pour the lemon bar batter

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:06.525
and bake for an additional
20 minutes at 350 degrees.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.415
And then when you remove it, you should

00:02:08.415 --> 00:02:12.193
just let it cool for a bit,
and then slice into squares.

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:13.677
And then, of course it's optional,

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.221
you can add powdered sugar.

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.583
And your lemon bars are
ready to gobble up and enjoy.

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:20.320
Thanks for watching!

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.348
Alrighty it's tasting
time and it's so funny,

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:26.233
it takes a while for us to
like, film the tasting part.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:30.038
And Justin was like, "I
have to reheat it again!"

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:30.885
Are you ready honey?

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:31.515
- I'm excited.

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:34.309
- Alright, it's tasting time.
- Here we go.

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.856
- No, mine, just kidding.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:37.204
- No, it's mine!

00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:39.093
You have a whole batch for you.

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:44.762
- How are you liking it?

00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:50.573
This is like a dance, what does this mean?

00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:00.223
- That is so good, it's
really, it's very moist.

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:05.078
It's not too tart, you put a
good amount of lemons in it.

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.077
- Two.

00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:07.534
- Oh, two.

00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:09.334
I love the powdered sugar on top.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:13.937
And I normally don't
like lemon bars really,

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:15.440
but this is, it's very good.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.264
I like it because it's got, it's kind of

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.504
like a subtle lemon flavor.

00:03:19.504 --> 00:03:20.743
- Yeah, it's not too much.

00:03:20.743 --> 00:03:22.368
- It's not too tart, which I really like.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.486
It's great, thank you.

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:25.274
- Thank you, now I'm
going to take the rest

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:27.529
and you can't have any more, it's mine.

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:28.890
(laughs)

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.210
Just kidding.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.735
- You have a whole pan full over there!

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:35.247
- Just, I know how much he loves it.

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:35.676
- I do.

00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:37.037
- I'm so mean.

00:03:37.037 --> 00:03:38.805
- The last time she made it, I ate, like,

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:42.727
literally the entire
thing, I ate like 15 bars.

00:03:42.727 --> 00:03:43.806
Anyways.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.022
- Anyways, thanks for watching.

00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:47.838
And there's one important
part of the recipe.

00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:49.735
It's very important, you
guys ready to hear it?

00:03:49.735 --> 00:03:51.401
You guys gotta come back next Tuesday!

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.031
- You gotta do it.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.169
- (laughs) Bye!

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:56.440
- Hi, YouTube friends

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.253
- Hey everyone!

00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.427

So what are we making today?

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:03.496
