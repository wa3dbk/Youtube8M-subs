00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.800
I Mason from Vertex Effects, today I'm
here to talk to you about the Vertex Boost.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.209
With the Vertex Boost, we set out to
solve two critical problems faced by

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.349
guitar players.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.090
The first problem is having a boost
pedal that imparts

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.570
a tone to your signal, either adding more
compression or

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.669
adding a different EQ to the already
existing signal that you have.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.369
We didn't want to do that.  We wanted to
be able to take the tone that you had,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
and either increase or decrease the
output

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.280
of that signal without any total
characteristic whatsoever, just your tone

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.570
made louder.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.219
The second problem that we solved was
the issue of using a volume pedal

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.670
in line in your signal path.  For most
guitar players,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.570
they experience a lot of "tone suck" as a
result of using a volume pedal

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.590
with their signal, and this is because
they have a second volume pot in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.289
addition to what's on the guitar

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.200
that's going through their signal at all
times.  What we've done with the Vertex Boost

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.310
is removed that, by creating an
expression port

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.100
which completely isolates any volume or
expression pedal that is connected to the Boost

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.420
so it is not seen by the guitar signal,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.950
and all the guitar is seeing as the 100% analog circuitry

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.000
of the Vertex Boost.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.970
There are a number of ways that you can
use the Vertex Boost.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.090
The way I recommend is that you use it after any distortion devices.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
The reason for this is, you can maintain
the sound of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.850
your signal, however you've set it up with
your distortion or overdrive devices,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.000
and then you can use the Boost to simply
take that sound

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.720
and either boost it or you can take that
sound and attenuate it,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.530
so you can make it sit perfectly in
the mix for whatever the sound is that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.000
you're trying to achieve.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.209
A second application of the Vertex Boost
is to use is the first thing that your

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.200
guitar hits

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.629
when it enters your signal path.  The benefit of using it in this location

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.810
is you can either attenuate or boost the
gain

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.230
going into your distorted pedals or
your overdriven and pedals.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.719
The affect that it will have here is, as you
take back the volume pedal and attenuate

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.810
the signal,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.860
it will start to clean up, just as your
volume pot would on your guitar.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.260
Another application for the Vertex Boost
is to use it

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.030
as a master volume in your Effects Loop
of an amplifier that has a dedicated

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.959
Effects Loop SEND and RETURN,

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.730
with the SEND going into the input and the
RETURN going into the output.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.100
This would allow you, again, to use the
Boost as a Master Volume for your entire system

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.100
without any tonal coloration or
characteristic being added to your signal path.
