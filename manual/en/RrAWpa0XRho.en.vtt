00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.290
What boy didn’t grow up dreaming of one
day owning an Italian sports car?

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.870
I know I did.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.270
As a kid, I came across a review in a magazine
of the Lamborghini Countach; a singular moment

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.050
which actually inspired my love of new cars.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.840
But unless you’re filthy rich, machines
like that remain on a poster at Spencer Gifts.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.140
So what other Italian choices do you have?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.130
Well, you could get a Fiat but that’s not
quite the same thing, or for the first time

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.910
in the U.S. since 1995, an all-new Alfa Romeo
awaits that doesn’t carry a 6-figure price

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.200
tag.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.810
One could argue that there’s already a lot
of Alfas driving around ever since the 2012

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.790
introduction of the Dodge Dart – a car built
upon Fiat architecture and adapted from the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.250
Alfa Giulietta.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.790
But the 4C – an alphanumeric name referencing
the number of engine cylinders and its coupe

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.620
bodystyle – is certainly more of what Americans
envision when they hear the name Alfa Romeo.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.230
Of course, it’s red, racy and ridiculously
quick.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:13.920
A lot of sports cars today try to also exude
a luxury presence.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.960
But there are compromises being made in that
arrangement on both sides of the equation.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.969
The 4C on the other hand is a true sports
car.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.560
Its purpose is speed and handling with all
of the visceral goodness that accompanies

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.689
them.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.789
You sit deep in the carbon fiber tub, the
seats have little padding and even less maneuverability,

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.299
and creature comforts are highlighted by this
bargain basement radio.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.960
But as a pure driver’s car, the 4C provides
everything you could want; rapid responsiveness,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.979
the awesomeness that is the sports exhaust
and the go-cart-like handling of a lightweight,

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.319
mid-engine car without power steering.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.729
It is one of the most enjoyable cars I’ve
ever driven.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.759
Sitting transversely behind the seats and
visible from inside and outside the car, is

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:13.209
a 1.8-liter direct-injected turbo 4, or as
Alfa prefers a 1750 cc motor.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.110
This mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout lends
to near perfect balance in a car that weighs

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.849
less than 2,500 pounds.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.730
For reference, that’s less than a Mazda
Miata, a car in which it shares a similar

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.060
toy-like size, with the 4C’s roofline remarkably
3” lower.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.170
So the 4C makes getting in and out of a Viper
seem like child’s play.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.260
Once situated, the non-height adjustable upright
seats provide a commanding view through the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.319
windshield with the road appearing right before
your eyes.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.750
Interacting with the 4C’s 6-speed dual-clutch
transmission requires the pressing of buttons

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.790
with ‘1’ acting as ‘Drive.’

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.300
The shifts are blisteringly fast and can be
executed in full manual mode through the paddle

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.319
shifters.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.260
Each gear change elicits a cacophony of sound
featuring blats and snorts as revs build feverishly

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.090
from the turbo’s thrust.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.579
It’s surprisingly smooth around town too,
but loud is the name of the game, particularly

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.660
with the optional Racing Exhaust, a $500 extra
that is so worth it.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.290
Everything about the 4C is incredibly organic
and mechanical, from the exposed carbon fiber,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.269
metal and bolts to the manual steering that
demands both hands on the wheel and a bit

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.219
of muscle, particularly in low speed maneuvers
– the experience of driving a 4C is as close

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.230
to motoring a race car as most will ever get.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.769
Its neutral handling and firm brake pedal
provide the confidence to drive for fun without

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.700
a steep learning curve.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.219
This is the Alfa DNA selector with pre-configured
settings for the engine, transmission and

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:01.180
differential ranging from the safety of ‘all-weather’
mode to the uninhibited, it’s all up to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.590
you ‘race mode.’

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:15.480
And within that setting is launch mode, which
takes the 4C from 0-to-60mph in 4.1-seconds.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.850
Its 258 pound-feet of low to mid-range torque
and 237 horsepower are a testament to the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
achievements of aerodynamics, small-displacement
and low weight.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.470
And I bet you didn’t think it would net
24mpg city/34mpg highway, making it considerably

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.690
more fuel efficient, faster and less expensive
than a Porsche Cayman S.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.980
You don’t buy the 4C to be your only car.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.130
Its small trunk space allows for a bag, the
ride can be brutally firm on the wrong type

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.290
of pavement and the words comfy or well-appointed
will never be used to describe the cabin.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.970
And if there was ever a car that could use
a back-up cam it’s this one.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.940
But that’s also part of the Italian car
charm, along with the gaggles of admirers

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.250
who follow you everywhere.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.450
Alfa dealers are few and far between and initially,
there aren’t a lot of 4Cs to go around,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:18.390
but with a base MSRP of $55,195 and as tested
price of $66,545 this is the right car at

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:26.540
the right price to reintroduce Americans to
the Alfisti way of life.
