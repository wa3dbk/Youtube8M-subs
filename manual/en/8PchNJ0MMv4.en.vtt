Hey, guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer, and I
want to update you

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040
guys real quickly about a new change to your
monetization

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.849
analytics here on YouTube.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.100
YouTube stated that at the end of
February, they're going to eliminate monetizable

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.650
views, because
they said they were having a hard time figuring

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.920
out monetizable
views on mobile.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.779
So, instead, they're going to roll that metric
into playback monetizable views, the estimated

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.250
one that they
give you in your YouTube analytics there,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.800
and hopefully you can
just use that to kind of figure out which

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.079
views are monetizable
for you and which ones aren't.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.980
You can find those analytics for
you YouTube channel, if, like you're looking

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.050
at your video
manager on YouTube there's a bar across the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.140
top and one of those
links in that bar says "Analytics."

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.550
You click on that and then
on the left side bar you'll see, I think it's

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.040
like second or third from the
top, it says "Add Performance."

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.440
You can click on that, and
it'll give you a whole bunch of different

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.560
stats, depend-, you
know, that show you what kind of money you're

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.980
making from
reviews and what kind of ads are making what

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
and all that kind of
stuff.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.510
In case you're not familiar with everything
on this page,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.151
let me give you a quick rundown on everything
that's here and a

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.750
really brief explanation on what each of these
things mean.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.130
If
you want more information, I'll link to the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.000
help page for
YouTube and description below that'll kind

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520
of walk you through
each of the things on this page in more detail.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.860
One of the first
things you'll see there is playback based

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.829
reports, and basically
that takes the idea that if someone's looking

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.729
at your video on
YouTube, there's probably a couple different

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.729
ads that are being
shown.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.060
One there's like the one that kind of starts,
you know,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.979
the pre-roll ad, then there's also like a
little banner icon

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:27.979
above it.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.179
There could be like a couple different ads
on your

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.479
page at any given time, and so that is looking
at the amount of

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.090
money you're making per playback of each video
that you have, and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.289
taking into account all the ads that are showing
there.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.920
The
other option there, which is the impression-based

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.579
report, it
takes kind of the other approach and says

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.969
this is how much money
you're making per ad that's showing up.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.989
This is how much you're
making off of the pre-roll.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.639
This is how much you're making on
the ad that's displayed to the, like, top

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.189
right of your video,
and so, for example, on that one, you could

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.669
have one video show
three different impressions of ads, because

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:08.459
you have a couple
different ads showing, and so, for one playback,

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.810
you could have,
let's say, three ad impressions.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.709
If you scroll down towards the
bottom, you can see exactly what different

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.350
types of ads are
doing, how they're performing.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.560
CPM is basically how much money is
being earned per thousand views against your

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.709
video content.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.409
Gross revenue is the amount of money that
an advertiser has paid

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.030
to YouTube total for their ads that are displayed
against your

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.030
content.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.030
That is not how much money you make.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.500
That is how much
the advertiser has given to YouTube, and now

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.730
YouTube's going to
take a cut of that, and then YouTube's going

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.690
to determine, you
know, now much of that you actually get based

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.939
on, like, let's say
you had some copyright content and one of

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.819
your videos, and so
YouTube's going to take a chunk of that and

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.799
give that to the
rights holder of that copyrighted content

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.130
and a whole bunch of
other things, and what's left over is actually

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.290
what you get, and
the estimated monetized playback is how many

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.269
times a video on
your channel has been viewed, that could be

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.159
monetized by YouTube.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.319
Now, you would think that, like, doesn't every
time someone watch

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.299
one of my videos, isn't that a monetizable
view, and it's not,

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.280
really, because, you remember like on Smart
TVs, sometimes like

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.840
those YouTube apps on those devices don't
play pre-roll ads.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.609
They could be on third-party apps for YouTube
that ignore pre-

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.019
rolled ads, so that's becoming less and less,
thankfully, but

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.469
they're still a lot of ways to not monetize
views out there.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.879
If
you go into the impressions-based report,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.709
you'll see a couple of
other things there, such as like impressions-based

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.920
CPM, and
that's basically how much money you're making

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.830
per thousand ad
impressions, and so, like I said, remember,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.280
you could have one
video play that shows three different ads,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.170
so that's how much
money you're making, you know, per thousand

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.170
ad impressions.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.670
We
could actually spend a lot of time digging

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.940
into each of these,
and I know there's probably a lot of questions

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.349
out there about
them, but this isn't meant to be an in-depth

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.349
review.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.390
It's just
kind of to give you guys a quick overview

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.549
and let you know that
YouTube is changing how they report some of

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.030
the monetization
features for your channel.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.069
If you have other questions, you can
comment below.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.209
I'll do my best to answer them in the short
little box that YouTube gives.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.060
I promise you that this takes a
lot more space than that, but maybe we can

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.450
talk about it on live,
you know, Google hang out sometime when we

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.799
start planning those.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.109
Also, make sure you check out our Facebook
page and our Google

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.500
Plus page, because I'm also posting other
updates there, just

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.489
like kind of smaller ones that I think are
really interesting

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.519
that I think you should know about and I think
we should discuss,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.430
but don't really warrant me cluttering your
subscriber box here

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.440
