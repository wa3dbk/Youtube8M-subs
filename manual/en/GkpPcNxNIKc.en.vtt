00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.100
Did you know that famous character shoe maker Phil LaDuca was a dancer himself

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.310
and specifically designed his shoes to help complete the line of the leg?

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.940
They are now the go-to for the Rockettes and most Broadway dancers.

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:20.939
The Tonys brought as much excitement as ever,

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.644
kicking off with host Hugh Jackman performing a routine that paid homage

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.993
to Bobby Van’s “hop dance” from Small Town Girl. 

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:32.069
The award for best choreography went to Warren Carlyle of “After Midnight”.

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:39.979
A top highlight for us was seeing former SYTYCD winner Melanie Moore

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:45.169
dancing alongside singer Jennifer Hudson in a preview of the new show Finding Neverland.

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:50.420
Melanie will in fact be playing Peter in the show, 
 which opens in Massachusetts this summer.  

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:18.456
Much like Free People, Kate Hudson’s Fabletics jumped on the dancewear bandwagon.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.479
And much like Free People, Fabletics chose to employ

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.681
non-dancers to showcase their line of dance apparel “Just Dance”.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:28.130
Why is it so difficult for to do the right thing??

00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:36.255
I mean Under Armour got it right by featuring real athletes 
 and dancers (hello!! have you seen ABT’s gorgeous Misty Copeland??

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:40.160
Kate, c’mon… you should know better!

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:44.170
Janelle Monae has been switching up her look for 
 the roll out of her new album,

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:47.610
The Electric Lady, and so far I'm loving what she giving!

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.500
The video for her new single, Dance Apocalyptic, Janelle Monae

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:57.760
and features her eclectic dance style and man, she's got a mean James Brown!

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:01.650
The song is super catchy and sure to be a hot summer single.

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.220
She ends the video saying " And I really, really 
 wanna thank you for dancing till the end"

00:02:06.314 --> 00:02:08.390
You know us Dance Pluggers, we'll do that.

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:13.220
Upload your video and share with us, you're, Dance Apocalyptic move! 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.610
About everything you could possibly need to do these days, there’s an app for…

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.840
and now that goes for dance and choreography, too! 

00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:23.000
Bounden is a new app that was developed by Game Oven

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.710
in collaboration with the Dutch National Ballet’s Junior Company.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.810
The dancers helped create movement sequences for the app,

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:33.370
which helps guide two users in movements led by the phone.

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:39.240
 It’s a pretty cute and fun way to get moving, 
 whether or not you’re a well-versed pas de deux partner.

00:03:06.423 --> 00:03:09.240
He's been called the male version of Adele.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.190
At just 22, a British powerhouse whose stunning voice has limitless potential,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.800
Sam Smith is changing the game people!

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.940
Boy George looking, super swag, with a soulful voice,

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:23.920
so it's not hard to believe when he 
 sings "I do it for the love"

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:30.040
Woo, that song is so dynamic it's just calling 
 for some awesome choreography, use it in class!

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.570
The renowned modern dancer, choreographer, and teacher

00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:37.080
Mary Anthony sadly passed away at the age of 97. 

00:03:37.223 --> 00:03:42.610
Anthony taught the likes of Arthur Mitchell, Ronald K. Brown, Elisa Monte, and more.

00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:47.130
She moved to New York in 1940, where she then performed and studied

00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:50.000
with artists including Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. 

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:53.420
She was an influential figure in the world of modern dance,

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:57.130
and her legacy will continue to live on through her philosophy of movement.

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:02.200
The news is still buzzing over the return of US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl,

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:06.900
a prisoner of war who was held captive in Afghanistan for nearly five years.

00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:10.810
Though the media focus has been mostly around the controversy of his release 

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:17.010
and Bergdahl’s reputation as a potential deserter, one interview focused on something totally different…

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.590
his ballet dancing!!!

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:24.030
Apparently Bergdahl used to take ballet lessons, and his former dance teacher, Sherry Horton...

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:29.740
...was interviewed, she told reporters about how much he loved it 
 and wished he had started when he was younger.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:42.530
