00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.580
Medical parasitology is the study of 
parasites that cause diseases to humans

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.140
predominently, these are diseases to humans

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.160
sometimes they can also involve an 
alternate host

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.630
like a reservoir host and sometimes
these are transmitted by insects

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.699
and sometimes they're not. 
There are lots of generic skills that the students will

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.519
acquire

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.320
for example to begin with they'll acquire
skills in

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.760
literature searches, how to undertake a
literature review

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.629
and how to write grant reports, proposals,

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.089
and also undertake a research project
that's independent.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.379
So we hope to train them in all of the relevant skills that will be required

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.409
for their proposed careers. 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.129
I chose to study medical parasitology mainly because of
the wide-ranging diseases

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.500
that it covers. All the specialist techniques
you get to look at

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.600
from diagnosis, immunological, molecular
techniques

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.880
and because the hands-on practical
experience you gain

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.740
within the laboratory looking at all the
different diseases. So my MSc course

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.710
project was

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.229
studying helminth infections in Brazil
for this I got to go out to Brazil to

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.079
Belo Horizonte

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.340
where we worked alongside the human hookworm vaccine trials

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.619
and my project was aimed at looking at
how

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.109
multiple worm infections affect your
body's response

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.380
and compared to a single one. We always want to make sure that whatever

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.310
subject we're teaching, it's been given by
the person who's the most

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.560
renowned in that particular field.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.499
The intake for this course varies
from year to year.

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.670
So they want to do a course that's parasitology based

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.420
and perhaps specialize in a particular
area, but that area of expertise will be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.810
sort of determined

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.979
by what they've done in the course
throughout the year. We also have

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.759
students

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.689
who may be in a disease endemic country
who are coming over here

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.520
because they require a specific skill
and training in a specific area.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.540
We also have students from the
United States and Canada who come to do the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.640
course here because they don't have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.550
such specialized courses offered to
them

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.980
in their particular countries, but what's
common with all of our students

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.520
is that they have an interest in parasitology to begin with,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.540
and we hope to develop that interest further.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.150
After finishing my Master's in medical parasitology, I then went on to do a PhD

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.050
in immunoparasitology. After that I've
then

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.700
come back to the School and a I'm
working on my second post-doc

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.380
in high-throughput drug screening
against schistosomiasis parasite.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.880
The most unique aspect of this course is contact with

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.470
all the staff here at the London School, so
each of the students here will have

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.040
access to so many members a staff who

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.210
are world leading experts in their
particular field

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.560
and they will give invaluable

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.290
opportunities to prospective students
for their

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.820
future careers and also

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.420
whether or not they want to do an
independent research project with that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.570
expert too.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.730
So the lectures and practicals on the MSc I found both intellectually

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.480
challenging

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.680
and highly interesting, all the lectures
on the course were both

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.820
approachable and friendly so I feel that
my decision to study here at the London School

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.030
was the correct one

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.180
as I found the varied expertise here at

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.010
the School, allowed me to learn so much, and all the very people you get to meet

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.260
here also which now have become lifelong
friends.
