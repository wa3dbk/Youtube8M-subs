Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.850
to talk about one of the steps involved in
changing a broken wheel stud. This step we

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.770
are going to talk about in this clip is going
to be a little bit of surface prep and some

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.609
things you are going to want to do to aid
in pulling that new stud. What I've got here

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.499
is some liquid wrench, that is going to be
our lubricant. Take and shoot a little bit

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:37.360
in our hole there
just like so. We are also going to lubricate

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.160
our lug stud. What I've done is when I begin
this job I put this lug stud in the freezer.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.740
Any small amount of space saving is going
to aid in this job. Putting this in the freezer

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.790
is going to cause the metal metalloid to contract
which is going to allow it to fit in our receiving

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:05.229
hole a little better. There are several methods
for pulling a stud. The method I prefer is

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:13.149
use a constant velocity joint nut just like
so. Grab a lug nut here, won't use that one,

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:48.009
will use this one here. We are going to start
this lug nut on there just like so. All right,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.369
what I like to do is take my little pry bar
here and I am going to set it between two

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.189
other good studs. As you can see that is going
to apply resistance for me so I can go ahead

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:10.750
and pull that stud through. Set my 4-way on
there.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.480
As I am tightening this lug nut down, what
we are doing is making a sandwich between

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.670
the splines on the stud and the CV nut. What
that is allowing us to do is to pull the stud

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.170
through the back. We are going to pull it
through till it is flat just like one of these.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:42.709
Once I get it seated, I'll rotate the hub
and show you what we have done. All right,

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.989
you can see how we've pulled that stud through
and take and loosen up my rig here. You are

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.231
going to want to flip your blocker wrench
over just like so now that we are going in

00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:09.269
the opposite direction.

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:16.489
Like I said there are several methods of pulling
studs. This is the one that I've always used.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.020
You only need one CV nut. They work for pretty
much all of them. Roll it around and as you

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.500
can see our stud is seated nice and flat and
the blinds are fully engaged and that's the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.169
proper way in my opinion to pull a new lug
stud.
