00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.000
The exhibition, or the
show that we're putting on here

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.467
at the Smithsonian on Human
Origins is an idea that goes

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:11.400
back in my mind at
least twenty years.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.967
The vision of presenting to
the public the artifacts and

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:19.667
of course the fossil
evidence of how we became

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:24.800
human was very important
to me when I joined the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.467
Smithsonian as a
member of staff more than

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.900
twenty years ago.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.400
But it takes more
than one person's vision.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.533
It takes a whole
group of people to put

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.500
an exhibit together.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.100
Designers and people who can
write the script and most of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.433
all it includes
lot of partners,

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.400
international partners,
who are able to make available

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.033
to us part of the natural
heritage of their countries,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.033
the fossils and
the stone tools,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.133
and of course when those
objects cannot leave those

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.700
countries because we
have a longterm exhibit here,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.267
they are able to provide
to us the exact replicas

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:03.833
of those objects.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:07.667
So what are exhibit does is
that it does something that

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.367
no other exhibit
in the world does.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:12.933
It's not just about the
discovery of a particular

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.133
fossil human.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.800
It's not just about
the debates that rage in

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.733
scientific circles about
our family tree and who was

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:26.333
related to whom of the early
species of fossil humans.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.267
Rather it's about
the emergence of

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:29.967
human characteristics.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.467
The things that define
every single human being

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.933
on earth today,

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.467
and it allows people
the chance to explore the

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:39.600
antiquity of walking
upright on two legs.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.100
When we started making
tools and the changes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.200
in technology over time,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.400
when our brains became large,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
the origins of art,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.733
and our ability to use
symbols and language,

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.100
and so it allows the
visitor to explore that

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.000
deep antiquity and to
see that everything didn't

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.267
happen all at once,

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:00.900
but rather
things occurred over a

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.333
six million year
period in accumulating the

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.467
characteristics of
what it means to be

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.333
a human being today.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.733
In addition to that,
we have a very important

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.833
theme of climate change,

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.567
of how early
humans were responding to

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:19.900
the dynamic environments of
earth's climate history over

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.333
the past six million years.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.333
So this idea of bringing
these two vibrant areas of

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.733
scientific discovery:
paleo-climate change

00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:30.467
--ancient climate change--
and human origins,

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:32.700
is I think a really
fascinating way, a new way,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.167
to present the
subject to our public.
