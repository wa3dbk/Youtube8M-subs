00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.577
(applause)

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.748
The President:
After the sixth time,

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:09.184
I suspect that I'm a
little more relaxed

00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:11.019
and a little better
at it than I was

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.521
the first time out.

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.222
But you never get
completely used to it.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.657
There's a certain
pageantry to it.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.393
Sergeant at Arms announces
you, you're walking

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.962
down that aisle, and you're
reminded of the incredible

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:25.801
privilege that you have
in being the president.

00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.037
And hopefully all the members
of Congress who are there

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:31.506
are reminded that, you know,
we get these positions

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:34.843
for a (inaudible) amount
of time and we've got

00:00:34.843 --> 00:00:36.711
to make the most of
it when we have it.

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:39.114
Anybody who is a sports
fan knows that you've got

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:41.917
to play the whole game and
over the last six years

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:45.687
we have been weighed down
by the legacy of the worst

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:47.689
financial crisis since
the Great Depression.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:50.425
And because of the
incredible grit

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.527
and resilience of
the American people,

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:54.563
America is now in position
to really turn the page.

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:57.332
Last year was the best
job growth we had seen

00:00:57.332 --> 00:00:58.900
since the 1990s.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.736
The unemployment rate has
now dropped down to 5.6 %.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:03.839
We've seen manufacturing
come back; we have

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.106
cut our deficits.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.808
Gas prices have dropped.

00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:10.178
And so, we are well
positioned for the future,

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:12.280
but the key is making
the right choices.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.085
And so, this State of the
Union gives me an opportunity

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:20.922
to present to the American
people, now that we have

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:23.959
fought our way through the
crisis, how do we make sure

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.595
that everybody in this
country -- how do we make

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:29.297
sure that they're sharing
in this growing economy,

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.334
how do we make sure that they have the tools to succeed.

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:34.202
You know, if you think
about what's already

00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:38.106
happened just in the
last month, in addition

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:40.475
to major initiatives
surrounding immigration,

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.979
around Cuba, around climate
change, when it comes

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.115
to dealing with bread
and butter issues for

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:49.351
middle class families
all across America.

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:51.319
We've put forward
proposals for making

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.122
community college free,
so that young people

00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:56.091
can access the
education they need.

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:57.826
We're working together
with the private sector

00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:02.097
to increase internet
access for communities

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:04.699
that feel left out, to
increase competition,

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:07.903
and to protect our privacy
and our security.

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:11.473
That's just been the
last month, so you know,

00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:12.908
I think over the next
two years we have

00:02:12.908 --> 00:02:17.712
the opportunity to not
simply continue the momentum

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.383
that was built last year,
but to really capitalize

00:02:21.383 --> 00:02:24.486
on some of the long
term trends that make

00:02:24.486 --> 00:02:26.721
America best position
to take advantage

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:28.456
of the 21st century.
