00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:23.545
Sometimes people ask

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:26.699
Why do you fly?

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:29.672
well,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:31.566
why wouldn´t I?

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.806
being able to fly like a bird

00:00:34.103 --> 00:00:35.835
It´s men oldest dream

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:40.530
gliding your way into unexplored worlds

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:47.849
and sharing it all with your friends

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:50.092
before flying

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:52.154
anxiety builds up

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:53.852
heartbeat increases

00:00:53.852 --> 00:00:55.492
but this is normal

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.911
we were not meant to fly

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:00.859
the air is not our natural environment

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.351
maybe this is a way of correcting evolution

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.505
we have always wanted to grow wings since we

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:08.474
as a species

00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:11.442
became aware that nature was not so generous

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:13.835
as some of us would hope to

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.394
and paragliding is

00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:18.470
in my opinion

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.745
the closest to having wings

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.538
when flying I feel more aware

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:30.158
tuned up to understand and move through the invisible element

00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:32.260
that carries me upwards

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.344
and manifest itself

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:36.753
in many

00:01:36.753 --> 00:01:39.456
many ways

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:43.138
all of them beautiful

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.859
but not all of them gentle

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:50.417
like almost everything else

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:52.104
there there are some risks

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:55.524
but it’s all about knowing your limits and working on them

00:01:55.774 --> 00:01:58.220
so that you can safely fly higher

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.027
and further

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.602
once an old man came up to me and asked

00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:05.597
“Aren’t you afraid of dying?”

00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:06.893
I said:

00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:08.063
“Yes”

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:09.482
“I am”

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:11.747
“but I'm also afraid of not living”

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.439
paragliding is my way of experiencing life to its fullest

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.184
understand the feeling reality trough all senses

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:23.601
My Poison is my antidote

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:26.038
the more I fly

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:28.969
the more I realize that I can´t get enough of it

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:32.917
Flying is now and forever always on my mind

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:38.139
If I lived to be five hundred years old

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.974
I would wish to live another five hundred more

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:45.848
and be able to have many flying adventures

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.220
it is my worst regret

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.637
that I will eventually

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:50.821
one day

00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.162
fly no more

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:57.951
even now after a few years flying

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.952
it still amazes me how this apparently

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:02.865
fragile piece of technology

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.759
built out of fabric

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.375
lighter than paper

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.919
can carry me to the clouds

00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.537
and beyond my dreams

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:15.470
and now

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.396
as I speak

00:03:16.904 --> 00:03:20.200
a simple thought comes up answering the first question

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:21.855
I'm flying

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:26.190
because I can
