00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.420
What's up guys!?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.960
Danny from Danny Mac's Kitchen
Good to see you as always

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.050
Listen, this is totally an unplanned video
I was not prepared to do this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.001
but I felt compelled to do so
because I came across an item in

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.160
the supermarket that I have not seen
in a really, really long time

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.190
I was at my local "stop and shop" supermarket
here

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.940
and in the corner I just happened to see this
item

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.050
and I was like, "You know what?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.780
I have to buy this
and do a video because I haven't made this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.590
in a really, really long time
So I came across these guys in my local supermarket

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.550
and I was blown away
I haven't seen these in a really, really long

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.890
time
I used to see these in the south

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.239
when I worked in florida
These are immature fern fronds

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.120
and they make a really great vegetable
They're actually very high in omega 3

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.860
and omega 6 fatty acids which would
blow you away because you only associate that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.860
with fish, right?

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.780
But no these guys are
really, really high in that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350
So I found them
I wanted to throw together a quick video

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.390
Something really simple for you guys
in case you come across it in your supermarket

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.710
and let's get started!

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.840
So yeah, this is spontaneous
So we're going to throw together something

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.930
really, really simple and quick
I have a half of a lemon

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.830
that we're going to use
I have the ferns

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.549
I have a bit of bacon about 3 to 4 ounces
chopped

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.689
1 ounce of garlic
2 tablespoons of fresh sage

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.289
and we're just going to season
with a little bit of salt and pepper

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.590
and that's all you need guys
So it's really important with any vegetable

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.350
like this to blanche it
blanching being the process where you boil

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.119
it
for about 45 seconds

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.380
Then you strain it and immerse it into
an ice bath where the cooking process stops

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.870
So that's what we're going to do
We're going to take these guys

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.530
We're just going to throw them in here
We're just going to move them around

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.689
for 30 to 45 seconds
You can see the color coming out

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.409
beautiful green
Looking great

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.630
We don't want to overcook them
that's why we're going to put them

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.979
in to the ice bath
It's going to stop the cooking process

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.130
and then we can move on
Now that we've strained it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.890
You need to cool it off
Stop the cooking process

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.999
Really toss it around
Let those vegetables cool

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:10.550
Go ahead remove the ice cubes
Remove the water and we're going to move on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.310
We're going to sautee a little
bacon, some garlic, some fresh herbs

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.060
and we are set
So after heating up some oil, olive oil

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.099
For about 30 to 45 seconds
over medium, medium high heat

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.060
Add 1 ounce of garlic
Toss that around

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.739
We're going to add the bacon
that we chopped up

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.660
about 2 to 3 ounces of bacon
You really want this to cook for a little

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:52.700
while
Probably about 3 minutes

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.709
Bacon is looking nice and cooked
Smells great, add the blanched vegetables

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.260
Some sage, a little bit of fresh lemon juice
and season with salt and pepper

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.099
That's all you need to do
Real simple presentation

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.790
Awesome!

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:29.870
Give that a good coating
Alright, turn off your flame

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.750
That's all you need to do
This is such a great side dish

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:43.420
Let's plate her up
Mmm, spectacular!

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.599
Garnish with a little fresh sage
in the corner

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.599
and that is beautiful!

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.601
Enjoy guys!
