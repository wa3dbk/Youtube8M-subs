00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.650
U.S. President Barack Obama will be arriving
in Seoul shortly... for a two-day visit.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.440
This will be his fourth visit to the nation,...
the most ever for a sitting U.S. president.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.590
From North Korea's recent nuclear threats
to South Korea's ferry disaster,... our correspondent

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.050
Choi You-sun walks us through... what will
top the agenda during his talks with President

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.820
Park Geun-hye.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.100
Talks this Friday between President Park Geun-hye
and U.S. President Barack Obama in Seoul will

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.600
largely focus on reaffirming their security
alliance on the Korean peninsula.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.539
"North Korea-related issues, including the
North's recent threats to conduct a nuclear

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.090
test will be discussed.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.160
Strategic talks on the state of affairs in
Northeast Asia will also take place."

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.469
Since their meeting last month on the sidelines
of the Nuclear Security Summit in the Netherlands,

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.620
Pyongyang has threatened to carry out what
it called a "new form of nuclear test."

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.040
President Obama is expected to express support
for President Park's vision on reunification

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340
of the two Koreas.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.470
In a speech in Dresden last month, the South
Korean leader called for the two Koreas to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.850
expand reunions of families separated by the
Korean War and increase cross-border economic

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.510
and cultural exchanges.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.909
On the economic front, the two presidents
will likely discuss Seoul's possible membership

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.250
into the Washington-led Trans-Pacific trade
pact.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.490
There's also attention towards what President
Obama might say concerning strained Seoul-Tokyo

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.520
ties, over Japan's repeated denials of its
imperialistic aggressions.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.899
This, especially after he said Japan's disputed
islands with China were subject to Washington's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.799
defense treaty with Tokyo following talks
with his Japanese counterpart Thursday.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.670
Reflecting strong Seoul-Washington relations,
the U.S. leader will also return nine Korean

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.600
royal seals that were lost during the Korean
War.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.971
And as South Koreans mourn the loss of so
many lives in a recent ferry disaster, President

00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:17.710
Obama is set to express his sympathies during
his two-day visit.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.000
After a meeting with Korean and American business
leaders and visiting U.S. forces in Korea,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.780
Obama will depart for Malaysia on Saturday.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.130
