00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.820
Producing sustainable food and fuel and
creating local jobs is the focus of Victus Farms

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.519
Michael Mageau, a faculty member at
the University of Minnesota Duluth is a

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.310
driving force behind the project.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.259
Victus Farms combines three different
things: fish, plants, and algae.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.730
The fish

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.689
eat the food, excrete waste in the water,
and the water is sent into these troughs

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.090
where the plants grow on the nutrients
provided by the fish.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.150
the water then flows into an algae
trough behind me which isn't up and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.270
running yet

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.980
and the algae will further take the
nutrient out of the water

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
and they will reoxygenate the water
and then that water can be returned to the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.890
fish, so the three are working symbiotically in that cycle. The fish and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.060
produce are harvested and sold locally.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.290
The algae will be harvested for oil
production and fish feed.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.860
Victus Farms is the first research
project to incorporate all three of these

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.580
systems. It is also a completely
sustainable operation. Space and water

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
heating are provided by biomass boilers,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.820
electricity will soon come from a wind
turbine,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.340
water is supplied by collecting and
filtering rainwater,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.680
and fish feed is made from the algae and
locally produced organic soy, barley,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.970
oats, and peas.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.369
At full production, Victus Farms will
produce about a thousand pounds of tilapia

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.990
each month

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.640
The fish will be replenished by
fish that we grow in our own hatchery

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.749
and from egg

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.600
to harvest it'll take about nine months
to grow full size fish.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.190
In comparison, it takes a walleye or a perch
about three years to do the same thing.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880
Plants are started from seeds and then
after nearly four weeks

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.220
they're brought out to the greenhouse to grow.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.790
At full production, Victus will produce

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.479
432 heads of lettuce per
week, fifty pounds of basil a week,

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.300
and many, many pounds of greens and arugula.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.049
Victus will also produce tomatoes, 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.309
strawberries, and will be experimenting
with all sorts of

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.879
fruits and vegetables.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.649
Produce from Victus Farms is harvested
two to three times per week, and delivered

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.150
to restaurants in Duluth, Woodson and
Grand Marais.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.099
Eventually we will be introducing algae to
the system.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.049
We extract oil from the algae to make
biodiesel

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.859
and then the remains of the algae will
be used as a high-protein feed for the

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.839
fish.

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:36.349
And currently we are doing some small scale
experimentation to try to determine the

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.739
best species for use in our system. The
algae must be fast growing

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.199
with high oil and protein content.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.249
It also needs to be easy to harvest.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.499
By working together, the city of 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.379
Silver Bay and the University of Minnesota Duluth 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.749
have created a dynamic 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.599
renewable energy project 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.919
and are producing healthy,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.040
 locally grown food. Their creativity and hard work have achieved a national model

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.349
for sustainability.
