Hey guys, I just wanted to film a quick little
update video because I've got some exciting

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.400
news to share. And that is that next year
in January my sister and I will be moving

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.090
to the other side of the world to go and live
in London. Woo! My Dad was actually born in

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.640
England so I've got a British passport. I
feel really connected to my kiwi side obviously

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.499
because I've lived here for most of my life.
But I've never lived in England and I've only

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.599
ever just visited so I really want to move
over there and sort of connect to that a little

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.510
bit more I guess. And also, if you know me,
you'll know that I'm obsessed with Europe

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.000
and travelling around Europe so I really want
to live closer to that to be able to go and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.850
travel on the weekends and see new places
and things like that because unfortunately

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.420
living in New Zealand that is a little bit
difficult. The only place we can really get

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.969
to quickly is Australia and even that takes
like 3 hours. if you live in London, or especially

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.660
if you've ever moved from overseas to go live
in London I would really love any advice you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.420
can give. Please write it down below in the
comments, talk to me on Twitter, send me an

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.670
email, whatever. I'm just looking for all
of the advice I can get. I'm so excited to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.250
get over there I just cannot wait. I absolutely
love Wellington, like it's gonna be really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.630
sad to leave this place, but I mean, I just
feel like I've got to do this at some point

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.610
in my life. I'm 25 years old, I'm not getting
any younger. So it's time to do it. I know

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.590
a few people in the Uk YouTube community so
I'm really looking forward to going over and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.780
hopefully hanging out with them. I can't wait
to meet Abby from AbbyBeeBeauty, Lucia from

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.320
GirlyFrame, Matt from JustMattWatson and Rupinder
as well. I really want to meet those people.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.140
Oh my god my breath. Breathe Charli. So hopefully
maybe you'll see some of those people in some

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.350
vlogs in the coming year. I'm just really
excited to get over there and start this new

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.939
life I suppose. And I'm really excited to
share that journey with you guys. So like

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.899
I said let me know down below if you've got
any advice. Let me know what you think about

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.920
the fact that I'm moving and I will see you
on saturday for a regular video. Bye.
