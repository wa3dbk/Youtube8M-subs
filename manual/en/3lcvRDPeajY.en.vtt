When choosing your safety equipment for your
motorcycle, gloves for your hands is a very

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.520
important component for your safety equipment
and a component that you don't want to miss

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.160
out on. Because when you fall, first you do
is stick hands straight out. So you might

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:25.800
want to talk some coverage for your hands.
We have many different styles and textures.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.340
And we have leather gloves and textiles gloves,
and I just wanted to briefly go over some

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.710
of the different styles. We have your fingerless
gloves, great for putting your hands down,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.810
not much protection on your fingers. So you
might want to consider that when looking at

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.850
them. And we have textile gloves. As we've
discussed, they're a purely a textile material

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.820
style glove with a leather palm for protecting
your palms, great in the summertime, they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.239
breathe easily. And if you are looking for
a little extra protection, in the unlikelyhood

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:15.229
of an accident, you have some heavier, sturdier
leather gloves with a little composite extra

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:23.560
knuckle protection. If you choose to, try
them on. Always close your hand. You know,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.709
kind of make sure they feel comfortable and
they fit well like regular winter gloves or

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.319
something. Make sure they're comfortable and
that you can wear them for long periods of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:39.600
time. Its all in a personal preference. And
here we have some full on race gloves and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.609
I brought them out just for fun because they're
a different style. If you like to or are looking

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.899
toward going to the track and spending any
time at the track, they're full leather race

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.069
gloves with composite for your wrists, a little
extra wrist protection. So just keep all of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.399
that in mind when you're purchasing your safety
equipment and always wear them.
