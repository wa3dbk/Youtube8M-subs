00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.583
Harrison: So, a lot of you kids in high school,
you probably know, you know like, you're getting

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.920
a little hot and bothered.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.350
Where you going to take this?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.560
You know, so what's a place that you used
to go to when you were in high school to make

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
out?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880
Maya: Well, assuming I had any physical interactions
when I was in high school, I probably would

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.321
have wanted to be discreet about it.

00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:28.540
I hear closets are good for this.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.540
Harrison: Closets?

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.810
Maya: That's the word on the street, a little
janitor's closet action.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.810
Harrison: You know what?

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.810
Maya: Interfere.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.942
Harrison: Take photography because there is
a darkroom.

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:37.050
Maya: There is a darkroom.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.050
Harrison: Darkroom, also...

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.450
Maya: And that is saucier and less creep than
a janitor's closet.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.450
Harrison: Exactly.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.629
You might even get a Vicki/Christina Barcelona
scenario with, you know with Scarlett Johansson

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.629
and Penelope Cruz.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.629
Maya: They might come out of the blue.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.310
Harrison: They might just come out of nowhere
and just start making out.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.120
Maya: Where there's a darkroom, there's those
two.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Harrison: Exactly.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.780
Other than a darkroom, some more you know,
logical place would be you know, like under

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.910
the stairwell.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.410
That would be easy.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.410
That's quick.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.020
There's a lot of them usually.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.650
Maybe the library, in the stacks.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.480
Maya: Oh, yeah that is a sultry move being
surrounded by literature.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.470
No, it's really, it's good.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.470
Because it's quiet.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.700
There's a lot of little corridors and small
spaces.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Harrison: Exactly.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.250
Maya: It's easy to do the whip-around if someone
should come by.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.250
Harrison: Exactly, yes.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.530
Maya: Maybe the gym sometimes, because that's
not utilized.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.790
Harrison: Exactly, not during a basketball
game, though.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.790
Maya: Yeah.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.790
Well, yeah.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.361
That would be less than discreet, but a little
bleacher action.

00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:30.829
It's a very zesty approach.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.220
Harrison: So I would say go to your local
high school, unless you're not in high school,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.220
and you know...

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.399
Maya: Or I mean if only to make out somewhere.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.390
Harrison: Well, you might become a sex offender.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.100
But I just think, just go to your local high
school and when you're in class, try these

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.640
out if you have a girlfriend or someone you
like to kiss.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.610
Then you can experience what we're about to
experience right now.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.610
Maya: Let's say we're under the bleachers.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.930
Harrison: All right.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690
Maya: Rah, rah, rah.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.000
Sis, boom, bah.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.210
Harrison: Oh yeah, I'm going to get some popcorn.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.590
Maya: I feel so naughty.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.689
Harrison: I know, right?

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.019
I can't believe I'm kissing a cheerleader.
