00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:03.143
The 'Prophet like Moses' (Deut 18:18)

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:07.468
Prophesy of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is | mentioned in various world religious scriptures

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:09.749
including the Christian Scriptures.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:14.803
If you read in the book of Deuteronomy, | chapter number 18, verse number 18

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.382
it says that

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:20.324
"I shall raise thee up a prophet from among thy brethren

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:21.587
like unto thee

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:23.974
and I shall put my words into his mouth

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.616
and he shall speak all that I command him."

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.419
In fact, if you analyze, this prophesy of | Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:34.899
befits no-one but

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.704
the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad (pbuh).

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.028
now many people will say that the prophecy in |  Deuteronomy chapter 18 refers to Muhammad

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:44.994
but this simply is not possible.

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:47.445
Let's read the prophesy to see what it says

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:52.287
"The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet | like me from among your own brethren."

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:59.065
Now, this verse is saying that the Lord God | will raise up for you (the Israelites)

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.280
a prophet like me (Moses)

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.276
from among your own brethren (the Israelites)

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.756
It's not possible that this can apply to Muhammad

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:07.925
for two reasons

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.915
One, the verse says, "for you"

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.423
And the verse being read to the Israelites

00:01:13.528 --> 00:01:15.688
This prophesy is being made to the Israelites

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.297
Therefore Muhammad can't possibly qualify | as a prophet who will come to them

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.450
He doesn't, he comes to the Ishmaelites

00:01:22.527 --> 00:01:23.764
In a land far away

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.149
In a place far away

00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.153
In a language that's entirely different

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.752
To a people that are entirely different

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:30.144
many hundreds of years later.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.935
It is not this people.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.713
So, it can't fit the part that says 'for you'

00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:38.907
And nor does Muhammad fit the part that says | 'from among your own brethren'

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.318
You see, the term 'your own brethren' applies to other Israelites

00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:45.366
It doesn't apply to Ishmaelites, it doesn't apply to anyone else.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.876
That's what the term 'your brethren' meant when speaking to Israelites.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.294
And we can know this because a few verses before

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:55.662
The very same word is used and defined as 'Israelites'

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.068
It says in verse fifteen

00:01:57.134 --> 00:02:00.670
"Be sure to appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses.

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.432
He must be from among your own brethren

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:05.818
Do not place a foreigner over you

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.580
One who is not a brother Israelite."

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.118
So, very clearly it defines brethren as 'brother Israelites'

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:15.506
And this is how it is always used in the Bible.

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:21.001
And so to say that Muhammad qualifies | as the prophet for Deuteronomy 18

00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:26.645
clearly contradicts the wording 'for you' and 'from among your brethren'

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:30.060
Therefore Muhammad cannot be the man prophesied in Deuteronomy.
