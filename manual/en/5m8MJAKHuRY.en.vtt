ï»¿No, Gandalf! The Balrog, the Balrog!
Oh, hello. Tonight's episode is for all you

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.490
hippies, hipsters, health nuts, vegans, and
the lactose intolerant. Yes, tonight, we're

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.619
making rice milk.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.380
If you have an aversion to cow's milk, or
animal milk of any kind, for whatever reason,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
you're probably aware that rice milk rice
milk is usually an acceptable alternative,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.989
although it can be a bit pricy. The reason
for this is simple. I'll explain. You see,

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.760
each grain of rice must be milked individually,
removing all of the milk and nutrients from

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.280
the rice and leaving only a fibrous husk,
which can then be used for many purposes,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.699
but we'll get to that in a minute. This process
is performed by millions of tiny electromechanical

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.199
machines that break down easily, and cannot
be repaired by human hands. They can, however,

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.319
be repaired by nanobots, which are plentiful,
as they are programmed to periodically replicate

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.320
themselves using whatever raw material is
at hand, such as the fibrous husk left over

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.530
from rice milking. Unfortunately, the nanobots
have recently become self-aware, and have

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.920
formed a union. They are now demanding higher
pay and shorter work hours. As a result, rice

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.880
milk prices have skyrocketed. Fear not, vegan
hippies. Making your own rice milk at home

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.820
is cheap, quick, and easy. I'll show you how.
First things first: grab a handful of rice,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.740
brown or white, and throw it into a pot. Grab
a handful of oatmeal and throw it into the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:43.729
same pot. Add several cups of water. Give
it a stir, turn the burner up to high, and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.600
bring it to a boil. Once it's boiling, stir
it once more, turn the burner down to low,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.630
put a lid on the pot, and let it simmer for
a while.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.270
Meanwhile, grab a handful of raw almonds,
sliced or whole, and throw them into a blender.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.789
If you don't like almonds, or are allergic,
you can skip this step. The almonds add flavor,

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.130
nutrition, and give the milk a nice creamy
texture. Throw some water into the blender

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.780
with the almonds and blend until smooth. As
far as flavor goes, you can substitute vanilla,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.350
whole bean or extract.
After they've simmered for a while, the rice

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.420
and oatmeal should be soft and mushy. Let
them cool for a little bit, and then pour

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.110
them into the blender with the almond mixture.
Add honey or the sweetener of your choice.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.830
Or, if you prefer, no sweetener at all.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.739
Put a lid on the blender, and blend until
smooth an homogenous, probably about a minute

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.420
and a half to two minutes. You can use a clock
wipe to save time.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.180
Check the flavor and consistency. If it's
good, all right! Get out your wire mesh strainer.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.879
If you don't have one, get one. You can also
use cheese cloth, but that can get pretty

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.500
messy. Slowly pour the mixture through the
strainer. Remind the cat that he is neither

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.970
a vegan nor a hippie. Also tell him that begging
is unbecoming, and is only performed by filthy

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.010
dogs and children.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.290
Continue to pour the mixture through the strainer.
Eventually, sludge will collect, and you'll

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.630
have to remove it with a spoon.
Don't discard the sludge, as it can be used

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.989
as an egg replacer in baking, or eaten as
a porridge. That may sound strange, but what

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.299
is porridge if not cooked grains? I mean,
just look at it, it totally looks like porridge.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.390
Continue the process of alternately spooning
the sludge out of the strainer and pouring

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.989
the mixture into the pitcher. After only a
few minutes, you'll have about one quart of

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.799
rice milk, and at least a fourth of a cup
of vegan egg replacer.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.710
No matter how well you strain it, there's
probably going to be some grit left in the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.549
pitcher, so pour it a little slowly, and it'll
be nice and smooth.

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:25.350
[Yawn] That was so boring. But this rice milk
is delicious!

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.300
Tune in next time, for information on something
else.
