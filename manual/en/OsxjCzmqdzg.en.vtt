00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.150
If the force exerted is in a different direction
than the movement of an object, then work

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.200
does not occur.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.840
When you pick up a box, the exerted force
and movement of the box are in the same direction,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.270
so work is done.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.860
However, when you carry a box, you are exerting
force in a vertical direction to hold the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.710
box, but the box moves in a horizontal direction
as you walk.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:08.010
Carrying the box is not considered work.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.650
