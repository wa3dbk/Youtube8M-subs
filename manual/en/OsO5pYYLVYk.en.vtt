In the early 60's surfers from
California invented a new sport

00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:40.639
to the days of small waves
at sea, the skateboard,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.919
arose from an adaptation
of a ski on skates.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.987
In Brazil, the skateboard was also
introduced by surfers,

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.206
having been initially practiced
in the slopes of Morumbi

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.529
and Sumare in Sao Paulo
evolving to parks like

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.586
Wave Park in Sao Paulo and
Barramares in Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.745
Skateboarding is now a distinguished
sport, with participants actually

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:10.927
dedicated to their categories
and modalities, therefore,

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:13.607
enabling the creation
and development of

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:16.516
the most diverse
stunts and tricks.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:22.998

a special park for the
practice of skateboarding,

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:32.068
which became the meeting
point of the skaters.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.275
In 1982 some skaters,
together with the

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:45.367

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:47.210
