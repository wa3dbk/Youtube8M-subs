00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.560
Hello YouTube!

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.580
Xisuma here with another Minecraft tutorial.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.500
Today I'm going to show you how to build a
automated farming machine which is this right

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.800
here, it works using the new features that
are going to be added in Minecraft 1.5 and

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.830
they are the comperators and the dispensers
we have here facing downwards and these are

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.300
full of bonemeal cause bonemeal can now grow
crops in 1.5 so let me show you that.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.090
There you go, so this works with as you saw,
wheat, carrots and potatoes, and the way that

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.370
these works is we have this pressure plate
at either end and they are going to shift

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.690
the floors that the crops are on which will
cause them to harvest.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.980
So when the dispensers are on at the top we
can walk down one side like this and the dispensers

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.010
will grow the crops.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.750
And when we get to the end we are going to
shift the floor of the one behind us.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.030
So it gives it a chance for all of the crops
to grow on this side, then we can go down

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.893
this side and by this time all of these have
grown and when we get to the end we are going

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:58.400
to shift the floor, turn around and use that.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.080
So let me give you an example of this in action,
going like this, holding down right click,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.159
turn around and place them down on the other
side and when we get to the end here were

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.479
going to harvest the ones behind us.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.939
And the same thing when we get back down to
this end.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.979
And it is a little bit noisy to use since
the dispensers are always firing, and one

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.640
thing to note is that when these are fully
grown, the dispensers are not going to keep

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
using the bonemeal so it's efficient it's
not going to waste any resources.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.409
I've also built this alternative design to
show you that you can wire the comparators

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.670
from behind like this, and you can still power
the dispensers in the same way they wont run

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.450
any slower and this frees up the top of the
dispensers just in case you wanted to add

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.250
some hoppers and include an automatic refilling
system for the bonemeal.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
And also you can place blocks like this to
keep yourself an entrance and to hide all

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.569
of the redstone while you are using it.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.439
To build this your going to need these resources,
first of all your going to need some water,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.880
there are 16 source blocks in this design.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.350
You'll need 18 dispensers, 4 pistons, 2 stone
pressure plates, 2 levers, 20 comparators,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.769
8 redstone torches, 2 redstone repeaters,
28 redstone, 112 building blocks, 18 dirt

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.519
then a hoe to turn it into farm land.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.730
To build this machine your going to need an
area of land that is 7 blocks wide and 14

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.840
blocks deep.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.269
And the 3 blocks at this end are the same
on this side they have just been rotated around

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.239
so you can copy what your building on this
side and build it on that one.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.340
And then we are left with 8 blocks across
the middle, each segment that is one wide

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.300
is identical so when you build one of those
you can copy it going all the way across.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.980
You can actually make this machine bigger,
you can make the middle section 9 wide or

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.329
if you wanted to save on resources you can
make it smaller.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.480
So to build the first layer you just need
to place down these blocks like this in this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.129
corner and do the exact same thing in the
other corner.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.400
For the second layer your going to put down
one redstone dust and one repeater facing

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.261
this way on the default setting, and 2 more
redstone dust, a redstone torch on top of

00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:07.530
this block, and then you want to place these
blocks, which wrap around the ones we placed

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.689
on the previous layer, then your putting a
torch on the side of this block, and a torch

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.590
on the side of this one, and that is the same
down on this end here as well.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.060
Then in the middle, we just got 5 blocks in
a row, its the same going all the way across.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.909
For the 3rd layer were going to start off
by placing this redstone torch here, an comparator

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.180
facing into this piston which we are going
to place down with a block to the side of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.360
it, and then put down these 2 redstone wires.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.790
Then we will put a block here, another piston,
then in front of that we got a block, a farmland,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.810
a stone pressure plate, and then 2 more blocks.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.370
And again, it's just the same thing at the
other end.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.540
Then in the middle what we have is block,
water, farmland, a gap, and then farmland,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.410
water, block going all the way across.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.090
For the 4th layer we just need to place some
blocks above the water that we placed in the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.290
previous layer and on the edge here as well.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.580
So just place them up and over one block infront
of the farmland.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.569
For the 5th and final layer we are going to
place the comparators above the blocks we

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.680
placed in the previous layer facing towards
the center, and infront of them we need to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.080
put down some dispensers, the way that you
would do this is place block blocks where

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.800
the dispensers are at the moment, then you
would stand here and place the dispenser on

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.419
the underside of that block up above, then
you can remove those blocks after you placed

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.630
all of them, put down redstone on top like
this, then put 2 levers on the dispensers.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.720
Then your machines just need bonemeal in the
dispensers and it's ready to go.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.740
So that concludes the tutorial, as always,
there is a download link in the description

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.491
box to this map right here, and if you have
any questions you need to ask just leave them

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:47.180
in the comment in the comment box, so thank
you for watching and I will catch you next

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.389
time.
