00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.400
This is a guide for the third and last part
of the Death Factory mission which is called

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.810
R&amp;D.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.180
This guide explains how to complete R&amp;D with
the maximum score by showing you how to eliminate

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.490
Dr. Valentine and Dr. Ashford with silent
and signature kills and how to hide their

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.550
bodies, how to recover the evidence and how
to destroy Dr. Ashford's research on the hardest,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.550
purist, difficulty.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
After you have completed all the challenges
for the Death Factory mission and completed

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.390
R&amp;D in the way this guide suggests you can
expect 331,925 score from R&amp;D.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.120
At the start go into the conference room and
go through the door at the back of it down

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.290
the stairs.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.640
At the bottom of the stairs wait for the guard
to leave.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.770
Once he does follow him until you get to some
stairs to the left.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.140
Follow those stairs down and go through the
room out through the door ahead onto the catwalk.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.130
Keep going down and past the researcher and
guard on the platform.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.130
Go down all the way to the lowest level and
up to the little wagon, then turn around and

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.040
make go back all the way to the room that
you found the guard at the bottom of the stairs

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.040
in.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:24.010
Stand near the electric gun and wait for Dr.
Valentine to show up.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.880
Once he is there select the fibre wire.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.850
Walk up behind him when he goes to the target
dummies.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.860
Check that one of the researchers in the room
is out of sight, then garrotte Dr. Valentine.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.869
Drag the body between the counters and down
the stairs.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:46.009
Keep going down as before, but leave the body
on the last bit of stairs.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.960
Sneak to the area to the left and go behind
the paper walls.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.869
You can stop sneaking there.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.900
Go all the way to the opposite side of the
level and close the valve.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.729
Now you have very little time.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.680
Run back to Dr. Valentine's body and drag
him down the stairs and into the area to the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.509
left behind the wall.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.770
Dump the body over the railing.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.340
Go back to the valve and wait there until
Dr. Ashford gets closer.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.020
Then turn the valve again and walk up to Dr.
Ashford.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.959
Garrotte him and drag the body to the railing.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.790
Be sure not to drop the body where there are
metal bars that stop him from falling into

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.290
the water.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.640
Recover the evidence on a table nearby.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080
Go to the bridge control near the valve and
activate the bridge.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.930
Go into the corner to the right to avoid being
spotted by the guard that turns around once

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.450
the steam clears and wait for the bridge to
arrive.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.310
Go over the bridge and play Dr. Ashford's
log on the console.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.260
If you want to hear what he has to say wait
until he stops speaking before you complete

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.300
the next objective.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.849
There are two fuse boxes in the room.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.810
Sabotage both of them and exit R&amp;D through
the door ahead.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.550
Once you have done that it is the end of R&amp;D
and indeed the whole Death Factory mission.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.550
So there you go.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.689
Thank you very much for watching and until
next time.
