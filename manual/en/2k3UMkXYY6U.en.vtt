Hey, guys.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.120
Dr. Axe, Nutritionist and Doctor of Functional
Medicine.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.369
Today, I want to talk to you about the benefits
of L-glutemine powder.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.710
L-glutemine is an amino acid that is very,
very abundant in the human body, especially

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.039
in your musculoskeletal tissue.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.130
L-glutemine is used, primarily today . . . actually,
first it was used mostly by people in the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.740
fitness industry, people that were looking
to preserve muscle tissue.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.960
So both loose weight, burn fat and gain muscle
were the most common uses of L-glutemine powders

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960
today.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.020
You can see L-glutemine is basically this
sort of white powder here.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.870
You can see on the tip of my finger.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.980
But, it's just an amino acid that is a building
block of protein.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.160
But there are many benefits of L-glutemine
along with . . . I mentioned building muscle,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.410
igloo weight, burning fat.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.040
In addition to that L-glutemine can also help
heal and repair your gut.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.910
So, there are millions of people today struggling
with a condition called leaky gut, which,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.259
basically, is the main cause today of autoimmune
disease.

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.710
It's the main cause of thyroid issues like
Hashimoto's disease.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.920
It also causes arthritis, skin issues like
psoriasis.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.450
And, so that's caused by leaky gut and L-glutemine
is the number one amino acid your gut needs

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.810
to help heal and repair leaky gut.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.469
So, if you have any type of digestive issue
whatsoever, what I believe by far the most

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.000
important amino acid you need in your diet
is L-glutemine on a regular basis.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.279
So, again, using L-glutemine is great.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:43.490
What I recommend is typically between 2 to
5 grams twice daily.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.099
There are two forms of L-glutemine.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.029
You can get regular L-glutemine, in what's
called its free form, and that should be taken

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:55.880
with food ideally because, basically, if it's
not taken with food, it's not absorbed as

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880
well.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.819
There's another type of L-glutemine called
trans-alanyl- or alanyl-L-glutemine, and that's

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.280
an amino acid attached to another amino acid
which basically manes you're going to digest

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280
it much better.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.260
You can take it on an empty stomach, but it's
really best taken your meal right before and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.410
after workouts, in terms of it really supporting
your metabolism, both weight loss as well

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.220
as building muscle, retaining muscle.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.730
So it really keeps you from losing muscle.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.280
So, let's say for instance, you have an elderly
person and they are starting to waste away

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.069
from kikexia, which is from cancer, and they're
wasting away over time, L-glutemine is the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.430
number one supplement they should be taking
that's keeps them from having muscle wasting.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.680
If you're an athlete and you're out there
working really hard but you know, because

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.019
you did a lot of training, that you're, you're
already burning up some muscle, L-glutemine

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.450
keeps that from happening.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.760
Again, if you struggle with digestive issues,
whether it's irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.439
bowel disease like Crohn's disease, ulcerative
colitis, diverticulosis, diverticulitis, leaky

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.920
gut or any of the issues associated with leaky
gut, like joint pain, rosacea, any type of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.200
autoimmune response, L-glutemine can support
your body in healing.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.189
If you want to get more details on all of
the health benefits of L-glutemine, visit

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.870
my website, www.draxe.com.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.359
Look up Dr. Axe, go to my website and look
up L-glutemine.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.700
I go through all of the studies, all of the
benefits, where to get the best type of L-glutemine.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.379
You can find it right there on www.draxe.com.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.790
So, again, L-glutemine great for digestion,
crucial for metabolism, an important amino

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.190
acid for your whole body and a great thing
to take in supplement form.
