With Easter just around the corner, I'm sure
you're keen to know what's in store... well

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.650
we have that and more in the Friday News Wrap-Up
for the 22nd of March, 2013.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.500
So, let's dive in!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.860
A few weeks back the boffins at Double Fine
Productions let the world know about their

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.440
upcoming rhythm title 'Dropchord'.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.140
While the game is aimed primarily at a release
on the PC using the 'Leap Motion Controller',

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
Double Fine also said it will be hitting touch
screen devices as well.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.610
Aside from that it's anyone's guess how this
game will play, so all we can do is wait for

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.960
the iOS release!

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.660
Phil Fish, the brains behind Fez recently
participated in an 'Ask Me Anything' over

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.730
on Reddit.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.420
Of course there were many interesting questions
and answers, but the most interesting (at

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.120
least for us) was that he dubbed an iOS version
as being 'highly probable'.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.500
Considering he has previously stated that
he intends to make Fez available for more

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.070
platforms, lets take it as a very good sign
for the future.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.960
Yawn if you must, but I look forward to the
expansion of the Magic the Gathering universe,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.220
especially when I can sink my teeth in to
a portable version like 2013's iPad release.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.060
Magic 2014 is set to hit multiple platforms,
iPad included once again, and if you happen

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
to be at PAX East you can check it out for
yourself.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.500
Considering FFI-IV have made their way to
the iOS platform already, it shouldn't be

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.310
a surprise to hear that Square Enix are bringing
FFV to the App Store as well.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140
So far a Japanese version is the only confirmed
release, but let's not beat around the bush...

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.391
after their recent fiasco with All The Bravest,
they need something solid to sell and a $19

00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:44.370
re-release sounds about up their alley right
now.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.140
That said, if you want the previous titles,
they're currently on sale, so hit up the App

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.220
Store as soon as possible.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.600
I love pugs.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.770
There's nothing strange about that; many people
love pugs and I happen to wear it on my sleeve.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.320
Their derpy eyes, their inability to breathe
properly, their innate clumsy nature... what's

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.860
not to love?

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.149
So I empathize with the boy in Pug Run who
is denied owning a puppy, and in his frustration

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.060
he draws comic after comic of him and his
dream 'best friend'.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.519
That's where you come in: The pug is brought
to life, if only temporarily and through tapping

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.569
to sprint, and swiping to jump and slide,
you'll help the dog to navigate hazards while

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.189
avoiding the dream-crushing cloud of reality
chasing after him.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.230
The game's absolutely beautiful too, with
animations that show true attention to detail

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.989
in the pug's movements, up to and including
the way he can tumble down the side of a hill.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.459
Unfortunately there's just no meat on Pug
Run's bones.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.569
You can run and run, and upgrade power-ups
if you must, but it's the same old endless

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.959
formula we've seen too many times already.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.439
Still, if the cute theme catches your eye
(as it did mine), then you'll be able to while

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.980
away the spare minutes of your day mindlessly,
but not satisfyingly.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.239
Busy, fun, cartoonish, colorful, heart-warming,
clever, and constantly surprising.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.269
All of these make Fetch a wonderful game for
children and the young at heart.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.060
So often we get caught up in the need to distract
ourselves with 'hardcore' titles or games

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.129
that push the envelope without actually doing
anything interesting that we forget there

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.949
are simple pleasures to enjoy while playing
a game.

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:16.980
Fetch is one of these pleasures and a must
have for iPad owners with kids.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.809
We've got so much more to review this week
than we have had in the last month or so,

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.329
so expect us to be busy over the coming week.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.920
Of course that means more great reviews to
check out, so stay tuned and keep an eye on

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.809
our Twitter and Facebook feeds to keep up
to date.

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:36.359
Have a great weekend!
