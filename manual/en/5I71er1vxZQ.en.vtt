00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
one, two, three, four!

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.740
Rev up your engines!

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.900
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.300
if your worried about your car passing the yearly
emissions inspection, then stay tuned

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
because today I'm going to show you how
to prepare your car to pass the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.140
emissions inspection, now many places
require that every year you have your

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.020
car inspected, to get this inspection
sticker, now part of the test is a safety

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.570
test, checking things like tires, to make sure

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
they're not bald and brakes work okay,
and to make sure that your headlights

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
work, now that stuff's pretty cut-and-dry
anybody can check it, but when it comes

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.010
to emissions inspection, since your nose
can't really tell what's coming out of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
the tailpipe, there's a few preventative
measures you can do to make sure it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.010
passes the emissions testing, now in an
older car like this 93 Celica, they

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.270
actually measure the gas that comes out
of the tailpipe with a dynamometer test,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.770
so you want to make sure everything is
working fine, so the gases that come out

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.350
of the pipe, are very low and aren't
polluting much, so first make sure that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.820
the oil is clean, change the oil and
filter before your inspection, because if

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.829
the oil gets dirty, the PCV system can
suck a lot of those dirty vapors in

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.079
burn them, and pollute more, of course you want to have clean oil anyway, but right

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.250
before the inspection is the best time
to have the cleanest oil, and the next

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.390
thing to do is, to make sure the air
filter is clean, because if you have a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.610
dirty air filter it'll block the air, the
car will run lean, and it'll pollute too much

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.859
a lean running car makes the engine run
hotter, the exhaust gases get hotter, puts

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.250
out more NOx, which is a pollutant they
measure, and you can fail the test

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.570
and of course, check your spark plugs to
make sure they're in good shape, spark

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.049
plugs have a gap where the electricity
fires, and when it's old and worn out, when the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.789
gap is too big and they don't work right,
and even if a car is running okay if the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.149
gap is too big, it'll pollute more and
you'll fail the test,

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.400
and of course check the cooling system,
because if the coolant is low the top of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.000
the engine will get air in it, make it
run hotter and it'll pollute more, and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.390
here again realize that the engine
doesn't have to be overheating on the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.770
gauge to make part of the engine still
running too hot, so make sure it's full

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.760
of coolant and that it's clean, and of
course make sure that the cooling fans are

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.470
working correctly, turn on the AC, at the
fan and make sure that it's spinning

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.700
like this fan is spinning, because the
test takes place on a dynamometer, the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.340
car isn't moving,
if those cooling fans aren't sucking air,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.209
the engine will run hotter and it
can fail the test, now if you have a more

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.709
modern car, like this three-year-old mini,
they don't test them on a dyno they just

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.209
plug into the computer to see if there's
a problem, all cars from 1996 on are

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.980
tested this way, so if you have a 1996 or
newer car and a check engine light is on,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.239
you need to fix it before you go to get
inspected, because that means there's a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.470
trouble code stored in the computer and
when they inspect it, their computer will

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.000
fail it for the test, and there's over
2,000 separate trouble codes that can

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.829
exist in a car, so can get really
complicated when a light comes on, but

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.799
let's say you're unluckly and you've already
done everything I've shown in this video,

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.139
and your car still fails the emissions
test, well you can try fuel injection

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.250
cleaner poured into the gas tank, and
drive the car really hard on the highway

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.090
about 70 or 100 miles, personally I've
had very good luck using the shop line

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.540
solvent, I just pour a gallon of the
solvent to about half a tank of gasoline,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.620
then I go on a highway and drive the car
at the maximum speed limit, for about

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.299
half an hour or 45 minutes, I've done
this on hundreds of cars and got them to

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.579
pass the emissions test after doing this,
of course this is not a magic fix if the

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.180
car doesn't run good, it's got a serious
problem that needs to be fixed, but if

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.859
the car runs okay this can often let it
pass the test, because the solvent burns

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.970
really clean, so the gas coming out of
the exhaust can get cleaner and cleaner

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.139
as it cleans all the systems out, and if
you have a late model code with a check

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.430
engine light, and it says inefficient
catalytic converter try this first because

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.159
it will often clean them up, so they'll
pass the test, so now you can stop

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:28.010
worrying about your car passing the
emissions test, and do something about it

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.820
and remember if your car has any
problems just visit the Scotty Kilmer

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.240

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.780
