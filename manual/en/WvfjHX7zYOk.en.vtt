00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Ubongo Kids parents!

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.780
Please watch and listen
to this message from our friends at Amplify!

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.580
Mama Tuli, why’s your baby crying like that?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.780
I’m trying to feed her fruit,
but she just doesn’t want it?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.180
I never know what’s the right food to give her.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.060
Well you shouldn’t give her only fruit…
she won’t get full.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.260
You need to cook her a nice, soft ugali with sauce.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.940
No, ugali’s no good for babies!

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.920
I’ve been telling her to cook
nice porridge, but she only gives her fruit.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.660
Can fruit possibly be enough?

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.580
I don’t know what to do.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.440
I read these brochures that said
fruits were good for children’s health…

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.300
we you’re telling me that I should give her ugali,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.100
and you’re saying that it should be soft porridge.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.080
I’m telling you… porridge!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.280
Stop giving her bad advice.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.920
It’s all about the sweet potatoes.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.660
But definitely not just fruit.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.600
Porridge, honey, porridge.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.780
Who should I believe?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.720
When you want advice about your child,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.020
who do you go to? Who can give you trusted advice?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:25.980
Please leave a missed call
on 0687 19 23 23 to participate!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.260
When you call - you will get a 'cut call'

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.740
we will then call you back
and then you will hear instructions.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.740
This voice you hear will be pre-recorded

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.420
so don't be surprised if they don't talk back to you!

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.860
The entire set shouldn’t take more than 8 minutes.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.180
Please listen carefully to the instructions
when you receive the call back,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.260
and remember that the call-back number
will be different than the number you call.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.160
We are looking forward
to hearing your stories and thank you!
