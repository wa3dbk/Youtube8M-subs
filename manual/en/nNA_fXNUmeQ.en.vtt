00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.960
Cloudy skies may be nice from an artistic
point of view, but clouds are an astronomer's

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.740
nightmare.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.821
And while illuminated cities are a night-time
beacon of modern civilization, bright night

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.960
skies are also a no-go zone for world-class
astronomical observations.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.140
So, in the pursuit of pristine skies, ESO,
the European Southern Observatory operates

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.280
its telescopes far beyond Europe, in the remote
and arid landscape of the Atacama Desert in

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.829
Chile.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.229
A top-class site for astronomical observations
must meet several criteria.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.269
To begin with, of course, you need a sky that
is free of clouds pretty much all year round.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.499
But in addition to that, you also need excellent
atmospheric conditions, as well as very dry

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.229
air with as little water vapor content as
possible.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.530
And this is exactly the kind of environment
that you find in the Atacama Desert in Chile.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.530
The Chilean Coast Range.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.240
Here, the cold offshore Humboldt current creates
a coastal inversion layer of cool air, which

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.000
prevents rain clouds from developing.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.939
Often, a layer of fog is created, which rapidly
disperses in the foothills above the desert.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.020
A view from the Paranal Observatory towards
the Pacific Ocean clearly shows the top of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
the cloud layer.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.180
Chilean coastal range Coastal clouds gathering
at the foothills.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.869
In addition to the coastal inversion layer,
a region of high pressure in the south-eastern

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.670
Pacific Ocean creates circulating winds, forming
an anticyclone, which helps to keep the climate

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.780
of the Atacama dry.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.139
The Andes lie to the east, acting as a natural
barrier for clouds coming from this direction

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:03.969
- so all the possible paths for moisture to
reach the Atacama Desert are literally blocked.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.399
This results in extremely dry air and clear
blue skies.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.590
Ideal conditions for astronomical observations.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.800
But we're not done yet with our checklist
of ideal observing conditions.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.420
In addition to cloudless and dry skies, astronomers
need dark sites and unpolluted air in order

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.210
to make the best observations.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.720
In most places, the world at night is far
from being a dark place and the light pollution

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.330
caused by modern civilization can easily be
spotted.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.990
However, light pollution hinders astronomical
observations, as it brightens the night sky

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.480
and makes faint celestial objects undetectable.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.750
Only in places that are far from any cities
- like some regions in the Atacama Desert

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.760
- is the night sky pitch- black.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.110
Furthermore, because Chile's cities are relatively
far apart, the air in the Atacama Desert is

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:12.250
almost completely free of pollutants and is
extraordinarily transparent.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.040
Now, astronomical observations are disturbed
by the turbulent motions of pockets of air

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.650
in the atmosphere.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.870
Essentially this turbulence blurs our images
of the night sky.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.130
In addition, the atmosphere also absorbs and
scatters light.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.570
In order to minimize these effects an observatory
should be located in an area with a calm atmosphere

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.120
above it and on top of a high mountain, in
order to reduce the amount of atmosphere between

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.370
your telescope and the stars.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.930
Once again, the high-altitude of Atacama Desert
fits this description perfectly.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.550
The Atacama Desert offers many sites at high
altitude, ranging from extended plateau in

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:03.830
the Altiplano highlands to high mountain tops
close to the Pacific Coast.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.450
The Chajnantor plateau, at an altitude of
5000 meters, offers ideal conditions for observing

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.510
in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength
domain.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.430
This is where ESO, together with its partners,
has chosen to construct the Atacama Large

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.710
Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA for
short.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.190
At such high altitudes there is very little
water vapor in the air and the disturbing

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.030
effects of the atmosphere are kept to a minimum.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.860
Cerro Paranal is an isolated mountain top
in the Atacama Desert, only 12 kilometers

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.940
inland from the Pacific Coast.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.180
This is the home of ESO's Very Large Telescope,
which makes good use of Cerro Paranal's approximately

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.620
320 cloud-free nights each year.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:11.570
Further inland, within sight of Paranal, another
mountain has been identified as an ideal place

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.900
to conduct astronomical observations: Cerro
Armazones.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:27.470
This will be the future site of ESO's Extremely
Large Telescope, or the E-ELT, for short.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.590
The Mars-like landscape of the Atacama Desert
is really a wonderful gift of nature.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.340
Its unique climate makes it a first-class
location for ESO's powerful telescopes so

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.520
that night after night ESO's astronomers can
observe the crystal clear skies.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.760
This is Dr J signing off for the ESOcast.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:53.210
Join me again next time for another cosmic
adventure.
