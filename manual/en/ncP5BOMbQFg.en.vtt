Hi! This is Carlos Ramos Jr. on behalf of
Expert Village. Today we’re going over the

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.340
game of solitaire. I want to get a little
bit more in depth about the foundation and

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.350
building your foundation; because ultimately
that’s the way you win this game. Let’s

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.360
play through a little bit and see how far
we can get with this, okay. Let’s go ahead

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.690
and move this ace over from your stock pile.
Now, we see we have the ace of hearts, the

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.351
ace of spades, so all we need now are the
ace of diamonds and of course the ace of clubs.

00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:33.260
Let’s go ahead and play it through. We can’t
play this 3 of spades here because there’s

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.390
no 2 of spades. Remember, we’re going from
lowest to highest. Ace being 1 and then 2,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.120
3, all the way up to the king. We can however
play this jack, which we missed earlier, over

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.600
here by the queen. You play it on either queen.
It doesn’t matter to the suit when you’re

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.579
talking about the playing board, only up in
the foundation. Other than that, I don’t

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.680
see anything. Obviously, you can turn this
card over and we’ve got 3 of clubs there,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.809
and we see nothing here. Let’s go back to
out stock pile and pull from the bottom. Hello,

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.619
we’ve got a 3 of hearts. We can definitely
play the 3 of hearts over on the 2 of hearts

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.719
and build up from there. We see our ace of
diamonds, let’s move that over. We have

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.969
a 2 of diamonds, and there we go. Now, we’re
starting to build this foundation. We see

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.060
some patterns developing and it’s starting
to open up a little bit, and we’re starting

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.969
to see some hope. You can move this 9 over
here if you feel like you want to, it doesn’t

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.779
really matter though. As you look through
the board, obviously there’s nothing else

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:40.509
we can play, and we have to go back to stock
pile. We call it the boneyard where I’m

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:47.859
from, but that’s whatever choice you want
to call it. As we go through, we can see there’s

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.789
nothing there. Sometimes people say, alright
the game’s over. Other people take this

00:01:51.789 --> 00:02:01.549
deck, turn over the stock pile, and they start
all over again and there’s your jack of

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.330
hearts. So forth, so forth, and keep going
with it until you can all your foundation

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.109
built and start moving cards up to the foundation.
