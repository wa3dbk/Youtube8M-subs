00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Remarks of President Barack Obama Weekly Address 
The White House, Saturday September 10, 2011

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.800
This weekend, we’re coming together, as one nation, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.900
to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.  

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.300
We’re remembering the lives we lost—

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.000
nearly 3,000 innocent men, women and children. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
We’re reaffirming our commitment to 
always keep faith with their families 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We’re honoring the heroism of first responders 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.500
who risked their lives, 
and gave their lives to save others

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we’re giving thanks to all who serve on our behalf

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.000
especially our troops and military families

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.120
our extraordinary 9/11 Generation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.800
At the same time, even as we reflect on a difficult decade 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we must look forward, to the future we will build together

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
That includes staying strong and confident in the face of any threat

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
And thanks to the tireless efforts of 
our military personnel and our intelligence

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
law enforcement and homeland security professionals 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000
there should be no doubt: 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Today, America is stronger

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.500
and al Qaeda is on the path to defeat.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We’ve taken the fight to al Qaeda like never before. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Over the past two and a half years, 
more senior al Qaeda leaders

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000
have been eliminated than at any time since 9/11.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.500
And thanks to the remarkable courage 
and precision of our forces

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.700
we finally delivered justice to Osama bin Laden.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We’ve strengthened the partnerships and tools we need

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
to prevail in this war against al Qaeda

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.000
working closer with allies and partners

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
reforming intelligence to better detect and disrupt plots

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.500
investing in our Special Forces so terrorists have no safe haven

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We’re constantly working to improve 
the security of our homeland as well

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
—at our airports, ports and borders

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
enhancing aviation security and screening

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
increasing support for our first responders

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
and working closer than ever with states, 
cities and communities

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.500
A decade after 9/11

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.000
it’s clear for all the world to see

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.500
—the terrorists who attacked us that September morning

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
are no match for the character of our people

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
the resilience of our nation

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or the endurance of our values

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.900
They wanted to terrorize us

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.500
but, as Americans, we refuse to live in fear

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Yes we face a determined foe, and make no mistake

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.600
—they will keep trying to hit us again

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But as we are showing again this weekend, we remain vigilant

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
We’re doing everything in our power to protect our people

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.700
And no matter what comes our way

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
as a resilient nation, we will carry on

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They wanted to draw us in to endless wars

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.000
sapping our strength and confidence as a nation

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.000
But even as we put relentless pressure on al Qaeda

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
we’re ending the war in Iraq and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.500
beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.500
Because after a hard decade of war

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.000
it is time for nation building here at home

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.300
They wanted to deprive us of the unity that defines us as a people

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.500
But we will not succumb to division or suspicion

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.200
We are Americans

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
and we are stronger and safer when we stay true to the values

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.500
freedoms and diversity that make us unique among nations

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.500
And they wanted to undermine our place in the world

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.200
But a decade later, we’ve shown that America doesn’t hunker down and hide behind walls of mistrust

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.000
We’ve forged new partnerships with nations around the world

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.800
to meet the global challenges that no nation can face alone

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And across the Middle East and North Africa a new generation of citizens

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.700
is showing that the future belongs to those that want to build, not destroy

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.700
Ten years ago, ordinary Americans showed us the true meaning of courage

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.500
when they rushed up those stairwells, into those flames, into that cockpit

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.000
In the decade since, a new generation has stepped forward to serve and keep us safe

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.300
In their memory, in their name, we will never waver

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.000
We will protect the country we love and pass it safer

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.500
stronger and more prosperous to the next generation.
