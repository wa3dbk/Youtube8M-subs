Rokosz, your digital life style expert here
with ya. I'm going to show you how to clean

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.160
your flat screen TV. Now, very important that
you keep it clean because as different things

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.349
accumulate on it like dust or just oils or
as you can see I've got fingerprints up on

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.760
mine. They can build up over time and attract
things that make it much more difficult to

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.590
clean and then degrigate your picture quality.
That sort of negates the whole purpose of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.550
having a awesome flat screen or HD monitor.
Now cleaning your flat screen TV is similar

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.190
to cleaning the soft screen on your lap top
or your flat computer monitor. Some of the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.329
solvents of the chemicals that they recommend
for those you can use on it. But I would use

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.420
as very little as possible and this is my
personal recommendation. A soft cloth. A lot

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.690
times, something that your sun glasses come
with or use for camera lenses, just a soft

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.399
lintless cloth can do a lot of it. I'm going
to show you here. What you do is just a lot

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.950
of circular motions and you can see over time
our studio monitor here has a lot of finger

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.400
prints because she definitely gets used and
you can see as I make circular motions it

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.590
can go from filthy to clean. It doesn't take
a lot of time or a lot of strength. You turn

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.940
it around so you can get a fresh thing over
there. That way your not putting any chemicals

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.900
your unsure about because the last thing you
want to do is choose the wrong thing and put

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.920
it on to your beautiful television set. Now,
obviously the plastic part up here is pretty

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
much plastic so things that are used to clean
plastic would be OK but what you want to worry

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.810
about there is over spray. So something that
is really good for plastic, it's kind of like

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.350
using Armour All in your car. If you use Armour
All to clean your dash board and you over

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.741
spray on your windshield it's a nightmare.
Armour All is not meant for windshields. At

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.210
least the ones the interior dashboards are.
So I tend not to use anything there. Now,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.110
the screen itself, you can use the same technique.
Now it's much more difficult to see obviously

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.159
because we got a picture up here on the screen
and tapping it is not a good idea in general

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.310
either. But that will get your dust off of
it. Also the rags that are statically charges,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.349
your Swiffers and things like that, if it
is just mostly dust become nice because your

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.510
not putting anything on there. But if it is
really time for a deep clean a good lintless

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.440
cloth preferably or paper towels if there
is nothing else And just a bit, and I mean

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.400
a bit of hot water or warm water rather just
luke warm water. Now even there I am going

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.840
to squeeze it out so my rag is just moist
and I'm going to give it line up in the top

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.670
here and then I'm either going to turn it
over and again the same circles. Just be careful,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.221
it's an expensive tool. A great asset and
just a little bit of things and your going

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.580
to have a beautifully clean monitor. Rokosz,
