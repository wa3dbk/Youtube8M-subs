Hi you guys. Thanks for coming to the YouTube
page of Wedding Night Bliss. I�m Driana,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.630
the Blissful Wife. So I wanted to make a video
about something really interesting I read

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.099
on Facebook. Somebody asked a question, sort
of like for advice from people to write back

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.740
and tell them what they thought. And so I
wanted to just make a quick video about it.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.859
So the question is from a young lady and she
said that she�s been in a friend�s with

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.010
benefits relationship. Obviously, she thought
she could change him. That was her reason

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.120
for staying in the relationship for about
four years, and so she finally stopped all

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.330
contact with him, which was great. But now
someone who is married is interested in her.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.420
And she�s just feeling so lonely that she�s
kind of considering meeting up with this guy

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.350
that�s married. And so obviously she knows
this is wrong, so you don�t have to write

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.369
that. She knows that it�s wrong, but she
just kind of wanted some encouraging, sisterly

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.780
advice about the situation. So here is advice
from me, The Blissful Wife. Not that she asked

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.409
me, but I�m gonna give my advice anyway.
You know, don�t you start, a lot of times

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.640
like as Christians, we like to say, �When
you do the right thing, you�ll get rewarded

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.569
for it.� And that�s true you will get
spiritually rewarded for it, and maybe down

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.530
the line you will see a benefit from it. But
that�s not always true right away. When

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.030
you do something that you know is the right
thing to do, there probably is going to be

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.689
a lot of discomfort. So when you break up,
you need to tell yourself, �I know this

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.141
is probably really going to suck. And I know
it�s probably gonna be really hard. But

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:01.350
I�m doing it because it�s the right thing
to do. I doing it because I know it�s a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.259
bad situation for me.� And that�s it.
Sometimes it�s ok to just feel that loneliness

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:22.390
and feel that pain. Here�s something that
I really firmly believe. When you do something

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.610
that you know is the right thing to do, a
lot of times God is going to continue to test

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.530
you in that area to make sure that you really
learned the lesson. So you got out of this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.560
relationship, it took you a while. And so
God is trying to see. Did she learn the lesson?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.900
Not being in a relationship that I have not
ordained for her. And so then he�s gonna

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.879
allow temptation to come to you, to see what
you�re gonna do. And yes, you finally got

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.299
out of that relationship. Good. So now, this
time just do get into the bad relationship.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.420
And it�s gonna show God that you�re serious
about doing what he wants you to do in this

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.931
area. So that way he can trust you that you
are ready for him to send your husband. But

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.080
just because you did the right thing once
doesn�t mean that right away your husband

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.810
is gonna come. I�m trying to be serious
and this do is acting crazy. It might take

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.629
a couple of guys, you know, that it�s obvious
that it�s not for you. Turn it down, turn

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:42.549
it down. Keep doing the right thing, so pass
the test every time. Please, don�t go back

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:50.530
to another bad situation. Show God that you�re
mature enough to make the right decision every

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.939
time even if it means so me loneness, so he
can trust you that you�re with your husband

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.480
because you know it�s from God. Not just
because you�re desperate and lonely. I feel

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.930
your pain. I know that it�s difficult. I
know that it�s hard. But it�ll be even

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.230
worse if you make the wrong decision, the
pain that you�ll feel from doing that would

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.049
be worse than this pain that you�re feeling
right now. Form my heart, to yours. Love to

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:17.139
you.
