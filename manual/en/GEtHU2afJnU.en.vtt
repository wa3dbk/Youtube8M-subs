00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.580
In the last couple of years many people have
declared that American Football is in crisis,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.550
as former players are suffering from brain
damage in increasing numbers.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.830
Numerous studies have linked brain damage
to concussions— and since 2009, the number

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.610
of concussions has jumped almost 70%, even
as the league has made rule changes to try

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.730
to solve the problem.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.320
Maybe rule changes alone won’t do the trick.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
Are there others ways to save the game, and
make it safer for players?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.980
We could start… by ditching the helmets.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.189
Or at the very least, by making them flimsier.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.399
Do I sound crazy?

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.960
Wouldn’t head injuries be worse without
the protection of helmets??

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.320
Maybe not.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.239
Over the same period that helmets and other
equipment have become stronger and more protective,

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.610
concussions have actually increased.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.000
And studies comparing the NFL to the helmet-free
Australian Football League indicate that NFL

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.030
players are 25% more likely to suffer concussions
than the Australian players.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.250
One possible explanation is what economists
call “moral hazard.”

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.900
When we try to insure people against the consequences
of negative outcomes, we reduce their incentive

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.520
to avoid those outcomes of their own accord.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.250
So by trying to soften the bad outcome, we
actually make that outcome more likely

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.400
Think about the football helmets: the better
that they protect players’ heads, the more

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.229
players may feel invulnerable or the more
they might use their heads as weapons, given

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.580
how well protected they supposedly are.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.420
Today’s players are more aggressive, and
more likely to tackle with their heads—and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.290
hence they suffer from more concussions – than
players did ten or twenty years ago.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.299
Moral hazard doesn’t just affect football;
it has important implications for public policy.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.561
It’s a big reason why all kinds of laws
and public policies that are meant to make

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.780
us safer can actually have the opposite effect.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.909
For example, how should we reduce car accidents/injuries?

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.241
We can mandate airbags and seatbelt use, but
some studies show that this leads to people

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.580
driving more aggressively because they now
feel safer.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.909
A recent study from Texas A&amp;M shows that the
introduction of mandatory seat-belt laws led

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.380
to higher car accident fatality rates among
non-occupants such as bicyclists and pedestrians.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.170
An Australian study found that drivers of
large SUVs were more likely to engage in risky

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.099
cellphone use while driving, perhaps because
they believed the SUV made them safer.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.020
These innovations do indeed make people safer,
but innovations that make us safer might cause

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.220
to take risks we wouldn’t have before.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.660
And those risks might cause harm others that
offsets those gains.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.980
Making people safer is tough—and you always
have to pay attention to the incentives you’re

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
creating.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
Getting rid of fancy helmets might not be
the whole solution to the NFL’s concussion

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.310
crisis, but it’s worth considering.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.099
Making players just a bit more conscious of
their own vulnerability, and that of their

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.709
opponents, might reduce the number and severity
of concussions.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.220
People might say this makes the game less
fun to watch, but how much fun is football

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.090
to watch when star players are constantly
being injured, or deciding they don’t want

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.420
to risk their long-run health by playing the
game?

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:18.710
Incentives matter and more safety can be bad
for your health
