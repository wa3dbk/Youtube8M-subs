00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.640
UPS just delivered a four hundred
thousand dollar drown to a random dude

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.980
by mistake

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.660
that's right time no one is perfect
especially UPS

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.230
as far at mistakes go this is about as
bad as expensive as it gets

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.980
Reddit user 77 reported that a four
hundred thousand dollar

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.510
unmanned aerial vehicle was delivered
straight to his doorstep

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.820
talk about service so apparently this is
a rather expensive piece a federal

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.519
property

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.380
that had been in storage for a while
before landing at its new and hopefully

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.790
temporary home

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.070
the really weird thing is even after
being informed at the error

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.610
UPS was more than willing to let him
hold on to the United States government

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.670
drawl it's crazy so the guy who made the
Post said

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.199
I just called UPS they told me there was
one of the undelivered packages in their

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:51.910
office

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.030
and asked if I've ever had it on
delivered package I said nobody insisted

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.860
that it was mine

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.100
nato's up to me if I wanted to keep it
or not I don't think it was the right

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.840
way to go about this summer call the
number on the card

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.030
and try to get this sorted out now looks
like a relatively

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.729
all drawn based on the pictures here but
it's definitely federal property

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.380
it's pretty expensive cell thankfully

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.700
this guy didn't decide to just keep this
drawn and hang on to it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.700
but because his paws that like what
other kind of expensive piece the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.080
government equipment are just hanging
around in the FedEx

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.439
office waiting to be delivered to a
random citizen

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.689
so the NOAA aircraft operations center
the long lost your own

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.150
ended up with someone who understand the
implications are keeping a surprise

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.900
package

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.140
also seems that he received only partly
true on which is good things because the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.790
propellers on the folger on can
apparently do

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.729
some major damage UPS definitely dropped
the ball on this one but what to expect

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.759
with that many packages going in and out

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.210
here's my idea don't ship four hundred
thousand dollar drones through UPS if

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.659
you want them to get to 1p

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.340
in one piece separately they might end
up on the for the UPS

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.189
and on internet user and fortunately
this guy new

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.590
artbuy hang on minister on at one point
or another

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.099
the crap is going to hit the fan and I'm
gonna have to answer for that and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.709
they're probably gonna kick down my door
and arrest me

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.430
so might as well call UPS as soon as
possible and get this straightened out

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.690
well

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.099
here

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.070
home

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.320
now
