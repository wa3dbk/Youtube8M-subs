Hello my friends and welcome to another Tuesday
of tutorial!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.140
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and last week I mentioned
to you that I wanted to get the videos subtitles

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.090
into different languages and asked for assistance,
but I never expected such a great response!

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.439
Last week's video has been translated into
Arabic, Dutch, English, German, Lithuanian,

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.879
Polish, Rumanian and Russian!

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:37.570
Thank you so much! It is so exciting to get
the videos in an understandable form to the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.840
artists of the world who want to learn to
draw. Thank you so much and lets keep going!

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.040
Today I am going to draw some lips with pearls.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.920
I start by sketching the upper lip, then the
teeth and then I will do the lower lip.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.090
Now the pearls. There will be a series of
circles, that will make up the neckless.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.110
I sketch the fingers that hold the pearls.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.970
To be able to reach the intensity of this
black I am using a charcoal pencil.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.420
Because as you know, the graphite does not
reach these darks.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
The list of materials is in the information
below the video.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.170
I erase the lines that I do not need anymore,

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.019
and I do the shading of the pearls, obviously
they will have bright highlights.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.900
With a soft brush I smudge graphite.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.630
Then I can pull lights with a kneaded eraser.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.500
I continue shading and smudging with the brush.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.750
Ooops! [laugh]

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.370
I hate it when that happens!

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.690
Now with the kneaded eraser I rescue 
the drawing from disaster.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.470
Nobody will ever notice.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.640
Except... for the thousands of people 
watching this video, of course.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.930
I had forgotten I had used the charcoal, and
you can not go over the charcoal the same

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.090
as over the graphite, as you know.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.000
Ok. I continue shading.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.800
With the brush I give a tone.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.300
I am smudging with a stump now.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.240
I do the shape of the face 
and pull some more lights. 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.039
I want to give more volume to this 
front part of the lip.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.539
Ok good. Please let me know 
what do you think about it.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.319

subscribe to my channel.
