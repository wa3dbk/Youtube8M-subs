00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.452
Correction - Backhand Clear (2) Richard-2

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.559
Next one

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:09.778
you are following through

00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:10.905
watch this

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:12.602
so you are hitting like that

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.820
shuttle goes

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.233
and you hit with follow through

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:22.740
Question - Why you take backhand?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.673
Because you are late

00:00:25.331 --> 00:00:27.698
when you are late, you don't have time

00:00:27.698 --> 00:00:28.820
to make big swing

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.222
let's say you are here

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:31.721
shuttle goes back

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.188
you don't have time to do this

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:38.753
so you go and then follow through

00:00:39.637 --> 00:00:40.305
now

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:43.513
cock that way

00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:46.838
it does not matter

00:00:47.254 --> 00:00:47.927
today

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.553
you do what I say

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.438
the way I ask you to do

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:57.269
and you only hit 3 meters

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.792
but please continue it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.604
week by week

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:06.000
you will hit much longer

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.772
watch this please

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:07.155
here

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:07.815
cock

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:08.977
shuttle came

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.044
tap

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:11.789
higher please

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:14.970
back

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.428
here

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:26.149
so you cock it like that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.456
so shuttle is coming from there

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429
I changed direction

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.229
cocked

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.761
and at the impact

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:37.645
practice the tap

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:41.478
instead of

00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:44.276
like this

00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:46.913
so watch this

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.435
this is what I am asking you to try

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:52.113
cock

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:54.543
grip, cocked like this

00:01:54.852 --> 00:01:55.379
vertical

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:56.006
not like this

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:56.812
vertical

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.441
shuttle goes

00:01:58.441 --> 00:01:59.435
yeah back

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:00.747
here

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.703
wrong way

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.195
the way I am asking you

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:41.507
tap

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:45.017
I will guarantee you soon

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:48.965
you will be much happier with your backhand

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:53.237
but please do it with total belief

00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:55.923
don't just try

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:59.117
and hope something will happen to you

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.478
that does not work

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:08.643
