Hey, how's it going guys? This is Joe, you're now watching SupremeFootyTV.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.070
This is just an update on the 4 headliners of the transfer market

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
of the Premier League. Let's start off talking about the Suarez situation.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.110
He's obviously, as you know, he's been linked heavily with Arsenal over the past

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.140
month or so. Arsenal made a bid of £40 million

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.160
plus 1 pound which was rejected by Liverpool. The owner of

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
Liverpool... one of the owners of Liverpool is now

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.180
claiming that Suarez is not for sale. No

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.200
club will be able to buy the player no matter what the price

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.220
especially to a Premier League rival. But he said

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.250
that even if an overseas club comes in, for instance Real Madrid

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.300
he will not be selling to them. He says it would be ludicrous to sell the player as they really

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.320
need him and he hopes that all the problems that have happened

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.340
with the Uruguayan striker and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.350
Liverpool will pass. Suarez was told by Brenden Rodgers,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.370
 the manager, that he had to train alone for the disrespect that he has brought to the club.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.400
I think Brenden Rodgers is right, I think Suarez has been disrespectful

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.440
but I do think Liverpool have made it very difficult for him. If

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.470
the player wants to leave I think it's only fair enough to let the guy go, although the way

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.500
he's done has been awful. I do think that Suarez will leave to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.510
Arsenal. There are rumours that there is another

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.540
one more bid being prepared of £51 million pounds

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.560
which will be the record signing of the Premiership

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.570
League, in the history of the Premier League. I think that if

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.580
£51 million pounds comes in, I think Liverpool won't be able to resist it and I think they will

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.620
sell the player, so we'll see what happens there.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.640
Let's talk about the Gareth Bale Real Madrid situation. Levy had a meeting with

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.650
Florentino Perez the other day. Levy says that he will not

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.700
budge. He wants a substantial amount of money for the player.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.730
Rumours of £85 million pounds. Florentino Perez has

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.750
come out and said that he is not too keen on the price tag. It's a lot of money to spend

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.780
on one player. There are reports that Tottenham want £85 million pounds

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.820
plus young Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.860
The £85 million pounds is enough in itself "plus" a player. Will Real Madrid

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.890
bring themselves to spend that kind of money for a player that could possible

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.930
not make it in La Liga? Few British players have

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.950
gone down that round and the only one that I can think of that has managed to

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.980
make a proper career and play well was David Beckham.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.990
Michael Owen went to Real Madrid, he couldn't settle, he came straight back to the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.010
Premiership. So... that's the big question,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.030
if Gareth Bale does go to Real Madrid, would he be able to settle down? Would he be able to become

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.040
a top class player and play alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Gareth Bale will appear at the Tottenham

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.090
Espanyol game tomorrow, all though he will not be playing.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.110
Let's see how the fans react. Barcelona

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.160
forward Cesc Fabregas announced the other day that he has never had any interest in leaving

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.190
the Spanish giants and that he doesn't understand how all the speculation started

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.210
around whether he would move to the Premiership

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.220
Champions. This presumably puts an end to all the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.250
hype surrounding Cesc Fabregas and Manchester United, although

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.290
there are rumours of David Moyes possibly making one more bid

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.330
of £40 million pounds. The Rooney sitution has calmed down

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.360
over the last few days. Chelsea have made two bids for the United striker

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.400
the second one being at £25 million pounds plus add-ons

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.420
There are rumours of Chelsea making one final bid if the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.440
player hands in a transfer request. So this was just an update on the four

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.460
main headlines of the transfer window. I will bring out more videos shortly

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.490
