00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.700
Merhaba and welcome to iPhonedo!

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.749
Today I'm here to review CandyShell FIT for your Apple Watch!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880
Now you may ask yourself, "does my watch need protection?"

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.300
Well, let's remember what Tim Cook said.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.440
Apple Watch is the most personal device you can wear!

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:27.489
What else is personal? Let's think about it. What else is on you is personal?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.140
Yeah your... $#&amp;@@#

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.615
Do they need protection?

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.360
Not always, but sometimes!

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.515
So does your watch!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.700
Let's say you're about to workout and you know what you're doing in the gym!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.840
Like I do, I know what I'm doing in the gym!

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.100
During such events you may want to protect your watch!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.400
Because, why not!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.680
If it gets scratched, it is worse than updating to watchOS 2 beta 1

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.818
Which you can not downgrade from!

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.360
Now let's go and take a look at it!

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
Alright, it is quite simple as you can see. Just pull it out.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.140
This is for 42mm

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:37.178
You just take it out like this! This is it.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:38.964
Let's see what else is on the box.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.860
Dual layer design protects against shock and impact!

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.400
Easy on easy off.. Yeah! I like Speck!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.980
And you have to watch out for this. The real Speck sticker.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.720
I guess there are a lot of fake Speck products out there so you have to look out for this!

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.620
This is polycarbonate and then inside it is TPU (Thermoplastic urethane)

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.360
It's like a soft rubber feeling.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.010
It's very easy to apply.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.960
Yeah, this is it.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.920
So it gives you a little bit of space before you can hit the screen.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.240
Protects your watch all over.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000
You can still reach to your digital crown.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.030
You can still put it to sleep like that.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.620
Also very easy to take it off

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.700
It comes in various colors and of course there is another version for 38mm

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.463
And it comes with a one year warranty!

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.940
This is something I'd wear when I go to the gym.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.800
Because in the gym with all those weights and cables, sometimes things start rubbing on your watch and makes you feel anxious.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.644
Do you know what this reminds me of?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.940
The Kinder Surprise! I want to eat this!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.260
It reminds me of that Kinder Surprise chocolate!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.300
