00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.000
Hi, I'm Courtney from Creativebug and I'm going to show you how to make some really fun, summery wall decor.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.060
Right now, phrases and words are really popular,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.520
but you may be intimidated by doing hand lettering
to put on your wall,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.680
so I'm going to show you an easy and quick way
to use vinyl sticky letters

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.050
that allow you to create really beautiful, really impactful artwork

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.150
without having to know any hand lettering at all.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
To begin, you'll need something to work on.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
You can use a canvas if you prefer,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900
but I actually like the look of the wooden crate.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.430
This adds to our rustic feel which is perfect
for our summer house beachy look.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.960
You'll need paint.
You're going to want to choose a dark paint.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm using a navy, and this is just an average craft store acrylic paint.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.420
You'll also need a bit of light-colored paint.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.000
So this could be a light blue, a light tan.
I'm just going to use white.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.530
Then we need a medium-tone oil-based paint.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.300
I'm using Rustoleum sun bleached

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.300
which is a pretty gray color.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.710
You'll need a couple of really coarse-bristled brushes

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.800
and a couple of fine brushes for some detail work,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.830
a pallet or plate to put your paint on,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.850
a container with a bit of water.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.950
And you should probably have some water on hand
for washing out your brushes as well.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.930
And then for your type, you're going to pick something
that you really like

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.770
that fits the scale of whatever painting surface you're working on.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.070
So I have these vinyl adhesive letters.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.460
This one happens to be just a standard bold font
Helvetica in three inches.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.860
If you're doing something much larger,
you could go with a four- or five-inch size letter

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.880
which is actually quite sizable.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.270
And if you have some of those scrapbooking
or paper crafting adhesive letters kicking around,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.270
you could also use this.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.380
It's really up to the style of letter that you like.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.890
We're not going to actually be using these in the final project.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.900
We're just using them as a template,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.680
so you don't have to worry about if they're colored or glittery.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680
You're just going to use them as a placeholder.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.980
You do want to make sure that they fit
onto the slats

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.650
of your wooden surface, if you are using the crate.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
It's nice to have a ruler on hand as well in case you don't feel comfortable eyeballing the placement of your letters.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.650
The first thing we're going to do is paint our crate or our canvas with our darkest color,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.680
which for me is going to be the navy.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.600
Using your coarse-bristled brush,
we're just going to grab a little bit of this paint.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.789
No need for any water.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.070
And we're just going to brush this onto our crate.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.630
I'm choosing to just paint the slats and the sides here.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.820
I'm not going to do the underneath or the interior of the crate,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
and that's totally up to you.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.930
I prefer to keep some of the light-colored wood.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.080
And this doesn't have to be perfect.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.110
I'm going for a rustic feel here,
so I don't have to fill in all of these little spaces.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.490
I do want a nice good covering of the darkest color

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.340
because that's actually what our letter colors will be at the end.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.670
So our text is going to show up with this darkest color so keep that in mind when you're painting.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.630
I do want to get these little negative pieces here in between the slats

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.290
with just a loose little brush stroke.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.870
It doesn't matter which direction you're painting in.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.470
Again, this is just very loose and free.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.240
We're not going for perfection.
That looks pretty good.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.990
I'm going to let this dry fully.
It's usually about ten or fifteen minutes.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.970
Once it's fully dry, then you can figure out
what phrase you want to have on your wall piece.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.900
I want something that fits all four planks
and uses them.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
You could just do two planks,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.040
but I like to have some balance so that I can think about how the letters will be spaced to create my phrase.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.230
I think I'm going to do something a little sassy and perfect for our summer house,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.490
so maybe something like "Go jump in a lake."

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.640
Once you have your phrase decided,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.620
you can use your sticky vinyl letters and start to place them.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.730
These happen to be re-positionable.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.040
So that gives me some freedom when placing my letters out.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.270
You may want to measure the center

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.780
and just make a chalk line or draw with a pencil.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.310
I'm really liking the way this is laid out,
and I've been adjusting as I go.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.730
Because "lake" is the focus of what I want to evoke with this piece,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.820
I'm actually going to space it out a little bit wider

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.230
so it takes up more visual space on the crate.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.820
Make sure all of your letters are stuck down really well

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.730
because our next move is to go over this with our oil-based paint.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.310
I'm using a medium tone that is actually a wood stain.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.330
So it has a little bit of color in it, and it has that oil base.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.390
Our final coat is going to be a water-based coat,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.810
and we're relying on that mix of oil and water

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.700
to give us this really cool beachy effect which I'm going to show you in a minute.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.630
Using another one of your coarse-bristle brushes,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.740
you're going to very lightly brush a coat over very similar to how we painted the crate initially.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.690
We're just looking for a light touch here.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.200
OK, that's looking good.
It's starting to look really distressed and weathered

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.410
which is exactly the look I'm going for.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.330
But you are going to want to let this set for about ten or fifteen minutes before we go on to our next layer

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.250
which is going to be back to our water-based layer.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.800
Using your white acrylic paint,
or whatever the lightest color you have is,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.410
squeeze a little bit into a container that has water in it.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.130
We want this to be milky because we're going to rely on that

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.220
water/oil duality to create our effect.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.390
And this doesn't have to be perfect.
You can add more water or more paint as you go.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.710
Just like we did before, you're going to loosely brush this over the entire crate

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.660
and you'll see, because what we're putting on top of the oil is water based,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.000
that it'll start to bead and create
this really cool rustic, salty texture.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.340
This last coat is actually going to take the longest to dry,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.500
and it will probably take about fifteen or twenty minutes to set up.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.430
You don't have to be completely dry to go on to the next step.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.800
However, the water-based paint is going to lighten slightly as it dries,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.840
and so you may want to add more in a second coat before you peel off the letters.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.720
I'm happy with the way this looks,
so I'm going to peel off my letters.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.020
You can see as we peel these away
that we have a little bit of the gray paint

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.280
which was our oil-based layer that's seeped underneath.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.750
And that's normal because we're working with unfinished wood,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.810
and because it's an oil-based stain, it's sort of meant to do that.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.840
So our final layer is going to be to touch up our letters.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.680
You may be totally fine with these really distressed letters as is,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.390
but I think I want to touch mine up just a bit so they're a little crisper on the edge.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.280
Going back to my original paint color and a small brush,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.300
I'm just going to go in and quickly and easily clean up these letter forms.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.640
You're going to go ahead and do this to all of your letters.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.460
You're almost done.
You do want to let this dry for just a few minutes

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.080
which is an easy wait after all of that work.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.250
But it looks really cool, very rustic, and kind of sea-weathered.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.480
And I have two other examples that I want to show you.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.050
This one again with the crate says "Eat, Sleep, Swim, Repeat"

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.950
which I think is very appropriate for a summer house or just a beach cottage.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.990
You can see this has the same technique,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.650
but just depending on how much white you do at the end, you get kind of different effects

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.650
so it's something that you can really play with.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.930
You could also do this in a dark green,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.320
but I wanted to kind of evoke those lake colors or water colors.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.590
So I stuck with the dark blue.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.910
For an easier version of this, you could just take a canvas and this one happens to be denim

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.140
so my dark color is already on there.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.910
I placed my adhesive vinyl letters just like we did on the crate,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.920
and then I just simply brushed white paint on top.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.900
So that's one single layer,
and you're not dealing with the oil paint at all.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.520
And you can use a ruler if you're worried about lining these up exactly,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.410
but the canvas is another great option
for doing type-based seasonal wall decor.
