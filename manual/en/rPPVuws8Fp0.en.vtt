00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.800
Hello, dear friends of YouTube

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.520
with you, again,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.100
the old wizard frayed gloves

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740
A long time ago

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.900
I did not show them any curious toy

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320
so today we'll see

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.280
one of my favorite toys

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.240
This is the "magic tablets"

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.740
also known as Chinese tablitas

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.940
or, also, "Jacob's Ladder"

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.240
It is a popular toy in Mexico and Japan

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.860
The game consists of 6 wooden slats

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:56.438
brightly painted and are connected by ribbons

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.780
allowing them an unusual mobility

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
producing a curious optical effect

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:07.622
when you release tablet up

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.320
seeming to descend from top to bottom

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.780
The name "Jacob's Ladder"

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.300
He alludes to the dream he had in which he saw Jacob

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.380
an outstretched ladder from heaven to earth

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.000
why angels rose and fell ceaselessly

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.080
With this toy you can build countless figures

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.200
As if it were a tangram

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.680
Let's see a few figures example:

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
A house.

00:02:05.045 --> 00:02:07.045
A snake.

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:19.495
A chair.

00:02:28.532 --> 00:02:30.532
A man.

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:32.723
Bye Bye!

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860
Dog.

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:46.757
A camel

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440
We can even do with tablets

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.440
a simple magic trick:

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.880
We put a coin on the second tablet

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.000
and cover with the top slat,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.820
A magical passes, "abracadabra"

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.620
and the coin disappeared!
