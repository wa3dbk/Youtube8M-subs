sometimes

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.720
make I am making a trip in Los about a
black ribbon and some the Scotch

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.050
mounting squares &amp; going to clean on my
white

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.380
wall said just put a little square on
the back eat ribbon and I just epic

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.200
2 I'll all and I actually put the
squares going all across the event

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.660
the it more secure think you're going to
do this you are going to need some help

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.600
probably because you're going to need
their a-level or a measuring tape

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.640
or something to make sure that your
ribbon it suree

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.860
and I had the hell in the middle of my
wall so I just kinda went around it

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.380
and he was super easy way it to you
spice up the wall

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.500

also had some extra minutes I just tied

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.770
it around my lamps

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.070
and they had some extra fabric for my
basket so I decided to not make
