00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.590
Recently, there have been signs that the economy
is picking up steam. Last month, we saw the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.330
strongest job growth in five years, and have
added more than three-quarters of a million

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
private sector jobs in just three months.
But there are still too many Americans who

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.619
are either looking for work, or struggling
to pay the bills and make the mortgage. Paychecks

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.550
aren't getting any bigger, but the cost of
everything from groceries to college tuition

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.070
keeps on rising.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.750
Without a doubt, one of the biggest burdens
over the last few months has been the price

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.500
of gasoline. In many places, gas is now more
than $4 a gallon, meaning that you could be

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.870
paying more than $60 to fill up your tank.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.399
These spikes in gas prices are often temporary,
and while there are no quick fixes to the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.969
problem, there are a few steps we should take
that make good sense.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.739
First, we should make sure that no one is
taking advantage of consumers at the pump.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.780
That's why we've launched a task force led
by the Attorney General that has one job:

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.850
rooting out cases of fraud or manipulation
in the markets that might affect gas prices,

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.390
including any illegal activity by traders
and speculators.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.950
Second, we should increase safe and responsible
oil production here at home. Last year, America's

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.420
oil production reached its highest level since
2003. But I believe that we should expand

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.010
oil production in America - even as we increase
safety and environmental standards.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.409
To do this, I am directing the Department
of Interior to conduct annual lease sales

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.950
in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, while
respecting sensitive areas, and to speed up

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.920
the evaluation of oil and gas resources in
the mid and south Atlantic. We plan to lease

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.640
new areas in the Gulf of Mexico as well, and
work to create new incentives for industry

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.200
to develop their unused leases both on and
offshore.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.590
We're also taking steps to give companies
time to meet higher safety standards when

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.130
it comes to exploration and drilling. That's
why my Administration is extending drilling

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.170
leases in areas of the Gulf that were impacted
by the temporary moratorium, as well as certain

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.909
areas off the coast of Alaska. And to streamline
that permitting process, I am establishing

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.309
a new team to coordinate work on Alaska drilling
permits.

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:25.239
Finally, the third step we should take is
to eliminate the taxpayer subsidies we give

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.930
to oil and gas companies. In the last few
months, the biggest oil companies made about

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.719
$4 billion in profits each week. And yet,
they get $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.969
each year. Four billion dollars at a time
when Americans can barely fill up their tanks.

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.359
Four billion dollars at a time when we're
trying to reduce our deficit.

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.709
This isn't fair, it makes no sense. Before
I was President, the CEOs of these companies

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.919
even admitted that the tax subsidies made
no sense. Well, next week, there is a vote

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.859
in Congress to end these oil company giveaways
once and for all. And I hope Democrats and

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.989
Republicans come together and get this done.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.290
The American people shouldn't be subsidizing
oil companies at a time when they're making

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.480
near-record profits. As a nation, we should
be investing in the clean, renewable sources

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.400
of energy that are the ultimate solution to
high-gas prices. That's why we're investing

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.989
in clean energy technology, helping businesses
that manufacture solar panels and wind turbines,

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.129
and making sure that our cars and trucks can
go further on a tank of gas - a step that

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.859
could save families as much as $3,000 at the
pump.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.359
These are investments worth making - investments
that will save us money, reduce our dependence

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.799
on foreign oil, and protect the health and
safety of our planet. That's an energy policy

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.860
for the future, and it's what I'll be fighting
for in the weeks and months to come.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.199
Thanks.
