David Handley: I'm David Handley, with the
University of Maine Cooperative Extension,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.440
and we're here to talk about pruning grapes.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.170
Very simple system for far-northern production.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.810
Here in Maine, we need to protect the vines
as best we can through the winter, but at

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.039
the same time try to get enough light and
exposure to the canes that we're going to

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.689
get good fruit set, and good fruit quality.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.820
One of the systems you can use for labrusca
type or concord type grapes, which are the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.240
ones that do best here in Maine, which is
the umbrella kniffin.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.690
As opposed to the four arm kniffin, the umbrella
kniffin puts all of its canes up at the top,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
or the first year growth that's going to fruit.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
What we're talking about with cane growth
here is one year-old growth that has a chocolate

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.329
brown color, and nice smooth bark with buds
on it.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.289
We're going to be saving four canes, plus
the permanent trunk, to give us all of our

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.329
fruiting structure.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.100
Everything else is going to be coming off
of here, and that includes anything that fruited

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
last year.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.850
You can tell the two year-old canes, or the
canes that fruited last year, because they'll

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.520
be thicker, and they'll have gray, peeling
bark.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.720
All of these are going to come off, and we're
going to save the one year-old cane with the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.690
chocolate brown color, and the smooth bark.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.360
The first step in pruning is to look at our
permanent trunk and remove all of the two

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.170
year-old growth, the growth that fruited last
year, saving a few canes that we'll be using

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.470
for fruiting this year.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.090
Our first step is to cut some of these off,
looking at that older bark there.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.670
We just cut that out, get it right out of
there.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.530
This will open up the planting, and that two
year-old wood is not going to fruit.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.450
Unless we take it out, we'll find that our
fruiting wood gets further and further away

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.450
from the trunk.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.180
Part of the reason we're pruning is to keep
that fruiting wood concentrated right near

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.390
the trunk.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.700
With the umbrella kniffin, which is what we're
pruning to here, we're only going to maintain

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.130
four of those fruiting canes.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.810
We want them all concentrated near the top
of the trunk, or the top wire on our two-wire

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.810
trellis.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.450
We're going to take each of the canes that
remain behind.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.610
As you can see here, here's my nice fruiting
cane, smooth bark.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.030
All these are buds that are going to break
and give us long, green shoots that will have

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.769
bunches of grapes on them.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.090
We're going to drape them over the top wire,
and then we're going to attach them to the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.060
bottom wire, to give you that kind of "umbrella"
look, thus the name of the system called the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.750
"umbrella kniffin."

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.629
Then we're going to cut off the ends of the
canes, so that there's only about 10 buds

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:54.629
on each one.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.220
We just count those from the trunk.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.780
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.140
If I need to leave one or two on there to
make it reach the bottom wire, that's fine.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:15.609
I'll just go to where I can attach this to
the bottom wire, like that.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.659
I need two for the other side, to complete
our umbrella.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:25.150
You can see this leaves me with several other
fruiting canes, and I need to save some of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.480
those as well, but they don't need to be as
long.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.230
What I'm calling these are "renewal spurs,"
because we need the buds from these shoots

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.200
to come out and give us cane that we'll be
able to put up on the wire next year.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.019
For every fruiting cane that I'm leaving behind,
I also need to cut some renewal cane, or renewal

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.340
spurs, to provide us with fruiting wood for
next year.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.420
I just cut these back to one or two buds,
and if they're not where I want them I can

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.760
cut them off completely.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.749
But for every fruiting cane, I need to leave
at least one renewal spur.

00:03:56.749 --> 00:04:01.319
I tend to leave a couple of extra renewal
spurs here in Maine, because I'm very sensitive

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.749
to the fact that I'm likely to get winter
injury almost every year.

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.560
We'll just tie these to the lower wire.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.790
A little bit of winter injury on that one.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.859
You'll be able to see that we've got our umbrella.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.940
We have our permanent trunk running up to
the top wire, and coming off the top of the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.950
trunk I select four one year-old canes, and
I reach those over the top wire, and tie them

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.170
to the bottom wire, spreading them out a little
bit to get that umbrella look.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.920
This will provide plenty of light and air
movement through the planting, as those shoots

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.420
start to develop and develop fruit, and also
support the bunches of fruit, and make it

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.980
easy to harvest at the same time.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.641
For every cane that I have over the wire,
I need to leave a renewal spur or two, with

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:52.010
just one or two buds on it, because the shoots
coming out from these buds are going to provide

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.820
us with our one year-old cane to put over
the wires next year.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.140
We do this every year during the dormant period,
so any time pretty much from new years until

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.870
they start to bud out in early April is a
good time to start pruning.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.690
Anything you've cut out of the plant needs
to be dragged out of the planting, chopped

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.410
up, put in your compost pile, into the burn
pile, or just taken out so that it isn't a

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.200
source of potential for next year.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.100
Prune every year, open those grapes up, hit
them hard so lots of light will come through

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.930
there, you'll have a good crop of grapes,
winter permitting.
