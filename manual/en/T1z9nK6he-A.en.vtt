00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.180
..and yet, I think that we can go ahead and
clean up a few highlights, and then I'm going

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.170
to use my 4B and push some things a little
farther back.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.280
And this is the only time that I would really
use it.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.050
It's just rare that I ever use the 4B.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.949
But I think that probably most of the time,
I find a place where I can go into the darkest

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.269
place and show something even deeper; the
deepest part of that value.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.579
So that's what I'm going to do right now.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.100
And because we only have one overhead camera,
I'm going to have to really pay attention

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
here.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.629
Let's go ahead and go a little closer here,
so that we can pick out a few things.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.949
Let's look at our source here.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:58.010
Now, it'd probably be good to be able to use
my lighter one, now that I'm thinking about

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.179
it, so that I can tell where is the deepest
part of some of these dark lines.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.340
It's real easy to come in and do-- oh, I'm
sorry.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.010
I had the wrong one.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.159
It's real easy to 
just think about this all as almost an eyeliner,

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.700
and make it all the same.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.189
But as you can see, what I've already tried
to do is show a little bit of a difference

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.820
in the darkest place versus the lightest place.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.020
And so that's what I'm going to do; I'm just
going to touch in a couple of places, still

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:48.700
trying to use-- maintain the clean edges,
and also keep this is in a soft transition.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.049
But you can see now-- I might back this off,
but it's darker here.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.650
It comes over here and gets a little lighter,
and it gets darker here.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.450
This is another opportunity for me not to
press too hard.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.969
I'm coming down to the place now where I just
want to emphasize a few things.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.720
I'm going to show where it goes underneath
the eyelid; I love that separation.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.600
I want to make sure that that's-- you know,
I can show that to the best of my ability.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.210
And that is all quite dark in here, but maybe
I can emphasize that edge just a little bit.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.970
We want to know where it disappears.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630
And now maybe I can come back in.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.190
I want to be careful.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.380
Just because I have my 4B, I don't want to
go ahead and say, 'Oh, this is a great opportunity;

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.460
I think I'll make everything dark.'

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:49.120
The effort that I'm making now is to maintain
the gradations, maintain the range of value,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.460
the same quality I had built up with all my
other pencils.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.210
But now I have a chance to push it a little
bit further, just in the darkest places.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.260
And if I go away just using almost a line,
then I'm really defeating my purpose, too.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.360
I want to have a clean edge, but I don't want
to have it just become a dark line on there.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.240
So let's see what we can do here.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:24.130
Let's go ahead and end this up there.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.360
Let's make a little more value in the pupil
here.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.420
Taking a few liberties, because it looks like
they're quite a bit lighter in this lighter

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.510
valued print.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.960
I want to see some difference.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.370
You notice that-- it almost appears that this
is darker than this.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.401
Well, I know this is recessed in there, and
so I'm going to take that opportunity; maybe

00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:51.150
I can push it back a little bit further.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.200
And if I can, you can see the value in not
going to the extreme until you're ready.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.570
Maybe just a little bit of a separation in
there.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.070
I hope it'll pick up on camera.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.970
I think-- I can see it here, and I hope that
I'm pushing it back.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.090
But I don't want to just make a big, flat
spot; I want to really show that there is

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.879
even a deeper part to this area.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:26.539
It would probably be back closer to this,
or maybe up underneath the hair.

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.669
Now let's see what we can do about the top.

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.020
Maybe there's a little bit more value I can
do with this one.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.140
If this starts just becoming something that's
going to be gaining all the attention, then

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.550
I want to be very careful that I'm not just
making it too dark.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:59.181
I guess I can keep emphasizing that, but I
don't want to just have it catch the eye;

00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:03.419
I want it to enhance the drawing.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.380
So I'm going in between a little bit, where
there could be the suggestion of eyelashes

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.469
here.

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:14.810
There's just a little variance in value, and
so I want to take my 4B opportunity to show

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.210
the spaces in between that are a little darker.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.520
Just in a few little touches.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.489
Doesn't take much.
