Hi, I'm Sukhi from Vodafone

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.740
We know that in todays world it's really important to have a good internet or data connection

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.240
From work emails to entertaining the kids
we want to help you stay connected

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.980
So we offer a variety of ways to get data on the go without needing a phone

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a mobile Wi-Fi device

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.780
And this is a dongle

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.120
Both are able to connect devices to our 4G network

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.420
giving you an ultra fast connection

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.980
Mobile Wi-Fi devices are very similar
to standard Wi-Fi devices

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.080
You put a data SIM inside and the device creates a short range wireless network

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.520
which up to 10 devices can connect to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.280
Tablets, laptops and games consoles are all
able to connect to our 4G network

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.480
The dongle provides a direct internet 
connection to the device it's plugged into

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.880
It fits into USB ports, like this one

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.580
Data on the go is a great way to stay connected for less

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.760
saving the hassle of finding a Wi-Fi
point when out and about

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.360
And using a mobile Wi-Fi device, or dongle,
means that you don't drain your battery

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520
And we even offer 30 day bundles, so you don't have to sign up to a long term contract

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.960
Perfect for students

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.640
And with My Vodafone, our nifty little app, that shows your usage, you can stay in control of your connection

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
You can also take your mobile Wi-Fi and dongle abroad thanks to Vodafones EuroTraveller and World Traveller

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.060
Great for tablets, like this one

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.940
You can watch high quality videos, play games and browse the internet with 4G and a big screen

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.600
