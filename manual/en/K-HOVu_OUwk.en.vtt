00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:04.032
Solberg Extreme MotorShow 2009 in Telenor Arena

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:11.169
It's Mr. Rally-cross himself, Martin Schanche!

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:13.637
Looking at Martin.. oj, oj, oj

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:31.706
"It flew high up"

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.880
That car is gone, that's for sure

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.318
Give Martin a round of applause

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:58.612
That can happen when you want it a bit too much

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.475
Too bad about the nice car

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.299
Car's for 10 and 60 year olds

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:18.219
When good drivers are driving, they need the right equipment

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500
You're in a hurry

00:01:21.054 --> 00:01:22.054
It ended as it did

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490
Together are these more than 360 years old

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:31.732
Terje Schie, father of Thomas Schie, and Mr. Rallycross

00:01:50.223 --> 00:01:56.934
What we are worried about is the fact that this car was suppose to be used more in the event

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:03.459
We're probably a car short now

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.410
(They had an extra yellow one, everything was OK)

00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.419
