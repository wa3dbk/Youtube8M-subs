Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.070
I have been invited out to a professional motocross racer Ryan Sipes'

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.080
house, and today we're gonna talk about how to control a motorcycle.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Alright so we're in rural Kentucky,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.120
and we've got the V10 high speed camera again,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.160
and a bunch of jumps.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.200
[music]

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.000
 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.220
[laugh]

00:00:33.240 --> 00:01:09.980
        

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.570
Let's say that you go over on the bike

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.590
and you're coming up too high, and you need to rock her back down,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.620
so all you do is if you've got a flywheel going here, you've got rotational

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.650
energy stored up here. One half I omega squared.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.680
So what you do there is you just tap your brakes.. You can laugh. [laugh]

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.740
You tap your brakes, and once you do that, that transfers

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.770
this rotational energy to the whole body of the bike, and once you do that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.790
then you'll rock it back over. And Ryan's gonna demonstrate that for us

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.840
because, he does that intuitively. OK I'm filming

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
Explain that again, I didn't get it.
- So basically what you're gonna want to do

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.900
I mean the technical term behind it, you're gonna want to keep the vertical intertia of your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.940
sprocket bearings and your front swing arm caliper

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.980
vertex equal to X.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.990
(Destin) Wait, what?
- No that's like.. We all had to learn it.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.010
[laughs]

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.070
- Alright, so the college boy's getting made fun of here.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.110
[music]

00:02:15.130 --> 00:03:29.650
                

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.700
