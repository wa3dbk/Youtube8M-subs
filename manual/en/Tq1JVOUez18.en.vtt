00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.740
My project is broadly based around materials
chemistry so more specifically I’m looking

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.310
at a mineral called Shapaltsikite which hasn’t
been studied much previously but it’s found

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.919
in very few places in the world.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.180
We’re looking to enhance the magnetic behaviour
of the compound and also increase its electronic

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.350
conductivity with a potential for use in some
form of possibly oxide iron conductors for

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.420
fuel cells or maybe as a new material for
batteries.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.960
For my PhD my project is based on the area
of analytical chemistry.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.150
Specifically I’m looking at a mass spectrometry
technique which is based on a mild de-ionisation

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.150
technique.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.690
I’m looking at the analysis of lipids and
optimising strategies of analysing different

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.490
types of lipids such as polar and non-polar
lipids and we’ll be looking at these lipids

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.150
in normal and diseased tissue types to see
if we can find a way of finding disease markers.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.380
So this is an x-ray diffractometer, one of
four that we have in the department, and they’re

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.110
essential for use in solid state chemistry
because very few other techniques are applicable

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.399
to large periodic solids.

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:35.369
So these allow us to apply x-rays through
the sample and then depending on where the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.590
x-rays diffract you can detect what the structure
of the original compound is and other properties

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.229
such as the atoms that are inside it and various
other parameters.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.439
I use this in my research day to day.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.479
This is one of the workhorse techniques effectively
for determining what you’ve made in the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.200
lab and once you know what you’ve made you
can go on and do further analysis on it.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.429
During my undergraduate degree at Birmingham
I did a fourth year Masters project with the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:12.760
same supervisor I do my PhD with and again
it was involving lipid analysis and it was

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.709
involving optimising the ionisation pathway
of those lipids and that’s something that

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.050
I’ve continued to look at beginning my PhD
work.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.989
The fourth year’s a lot more independent,
you get to specialise a lot more in the areas

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.000
that you want to look at so two thirds of
my time is taken up by writing a dissertation

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.330
in a certain area of chemistry and then the
other third is filled with lecture courses.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.660
My fourth year project currently is natural
product extraction for use as an anti-leukaemia

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.590
drug so I’m currently extracting a certain
molecule from a weed and then modifying it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.060
and then testing it with cancer studies on
human blood and tissue samples.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.829
A PhD involves a wide variety of activities.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:11.189
Predominantly you’re doing research day
to day in the lab and directing your own research

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.560
with your supervisor helping you to direct
it as appropriate.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.810
More specifically there’s other opportunities
available to postgrads such as teaching opportunities

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.340
and seminars and various things throughout
the year.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.879
At the end of a PhD you have to write a thesis
summarising your work and also undergo a viva

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.879
examination.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.760
Chem-Soc is the chemistry society for the
university so we currently organise events

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.560
such as guest lecturers –

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.840
Charity events, quizzes, all sorts of different
social events and it culminates in the end

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
of year Chemistry Ball.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.750
A great deal of the undergraduates attend.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.390
The society’s actually open to undergraduates,
postgraduates and academics, so the Chem Ball

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.280
is normally between 100 and 200 people.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.500
We try and keep everyone involved and get
everybody mixing.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.799
I originally decided to come to Birmingham
for a number of reasons.

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.120
I particularly liked the course because of
the wide variety of different topics that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.260
were covered and also I liked the area and
the general ethos of the department.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.140
There's a good balance between work and play.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.290
I originally decided to come to Birmingham
because I really liked the campus and the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.120
admissions team were very friendly as well
which made me want to come here.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.070
I wanted to live at home in my first year
and stay with my family and after looking

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.919
at some of the local universities, Birmingham
really stood out from the others for me and

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.919
I decided that if for whatever reason I hadn’t
got in in my first attempt if you like, then

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.070
I would sort of do more courses and retake
A-levels to make sure I got into Birmingham

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.909
because it was the favourite place I’d seen
and I was really keen to come here.
