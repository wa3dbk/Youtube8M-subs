00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.090
on president obama has announced his
plans to pledge fifty eight million

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.779
dollars for the pakistani

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.719
aim being to reverse anti-american
sentiments and raise awareness

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:20.819
u_s_-funded project since the better the
quality of life

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:24.509
for every pakistani but the notion of
branding eight

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.019
already has a lot of critics who worry
that publicly announcing which projects

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.490
the u_s_ paid for

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.590
might backfire so will funding are allan
media projects really change anyone's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.400
mind

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.260
we discussed within the author of the
blog on chase point admission has been

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
and shaking you for being here now let's
listen to rap the way they describe this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.370
u_s_-sponsored media

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.030
to build the brand for america

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.420
that sounds a lot like

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.390
propaganda to me would you say that's
right or do they actually have a right

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.580
to add to defend themselves against all
the anti-american medium top

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.750
uh... i think that's a really good
question i think the answer to that

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.120
uh... would be both i think that says

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.690
what it is a fifteen million dollar p_r_
move off or if you're in town experiment

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.430
augusta collins uh... inbox month at the
same time the u_s_ aid has

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.650
hundreds and hundreds of millions
excellent programs on population and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.770
help them

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.860
democracy and governance and i think
it's fair that those programs you know

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890
forget their fair share of coverage

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.280
but do you think that that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.970
apricots other people will look at those
media outlets

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.210
they are working with the u_s_
government they're getting messy and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.200
only point my fingers only say that now
you're working hand-in-hand during the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.100
pocket of the u_s_ government i think
that's a very good question and i think

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.520
that's a really realistic possibility

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.359
south asians editorial scurvy not
conspiracy theorists i definitely think

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.039
that there's a breast and that outpost
nine eleven it's always been like that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.549
in the muslim world you know it's kind
of a catch-twenty for the u_s_

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.880
they've been working with like a local
media groups local ngos

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.580
see people on the ground you always have
to be careful because those accusations

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.730
that could

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.409
inhibiting so with this new program do
you think that i have

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.789
any chance of having working have have
convincing than pakistani people tend to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.250
trust america hilo maybe we don't know i
will have to see how it all works out

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.040
that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.049
at the end of the day at the the u_s_
actions are much more important than

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.159
there were some appearance and

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.360
there is that the licensure for

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.890
war that's region afghanistan next door
at the tensions in afghanistan pakistan

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
border of the drone attacks if the u_s_
are conducting pakistan there's a huge

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.350
issue of mt incident civilian casualties
so i think ultimately that is let the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.130
u_s_ is contest on not their millions
and millions of dollars at the poor

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.209
ensue

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.679
here the publicity that they're trying
to find but aside from the publicity in

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.780
either point ninety dollars into

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.969
new programs in case you are

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.930
to help infrastructure education energy
bill does not count no of course station

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.109
that's what i said earlier i think that
it's really important that these kinds

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.299
of programs and yes it has

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.919
never sees coverage that you as it has
been doing these programs

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.669
uh... not just this year it's been going
on for over thirty forty years i know

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.170
in bangladesh since

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.529
a nineteen seventy one the u_s_ export
almost five billion dollars in page and

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.319
it's even more in pakistan you know
you've got your usd beat you also have

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.709
military itself of course combat
positive work that the u_s_ test sp

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.639
definitely deserves its fair share of
coverage

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.939
and acting

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.939
for years he said they've been partying
for years into pakistan but for years

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.459
happened in the event of a respectful
skeptical of america

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.800
and he actually help she that

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.879
that the thoughts of the people in

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.540
well i think i feel the need to do but
you have to understand the u_s_

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.079
populations that changes it wasn't
always like this about the sun

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.249
um... role in the u_s_ that relationship
has changed since the suffering is

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.429
someone you know you've got thrown it
except the u_s_ is committing inside

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:54.420
pakistan fiesta media of course shaves
but the public view is that also

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.040
uh... like i said before you can buy the
coverage that you want that people are

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.029
also will be free to judge tele-t_v_ but
what they see

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.979
and won't speak now have coverage do you
think that

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.129
if they're doing on become more of these
news outlets than ever

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.460
perhaps a little friendlier

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.619
to america

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.439
then can we do see a counter to that
because we can't discussion on pakistani

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.370
media before here and a lot of shell

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.040
and we discussed in that that this stark
differences in how they're almost as

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.230
at fox and msnbc and so that will there
be a af box like equivalent it just

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.800
starts point even working is coming up
with a more action scarcity reason being

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.220
brats ten times as harsh i think that
that's a very valid point i think that

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.590
that's definitely a

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.450
realistic possibility there's always
arrests

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.920
of backlash when you were working with
the u_s_ especially in such a sensitive

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.130
time at the war in afghanistan

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.960
has spills on to pakistan and you can
send that

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.120
but do you think adn heard any reports
so far whether

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.720
the pakistani government itself supports
this program of the fifty million

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.560
dollars in aid

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.959
to the media well actually i a m

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:00.999
is very interesting because i was
reading how pakistani officials

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.939
high-level pompous and government
officials

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:07.710
reassuring the u_s_ supreme is
guaranteeing that here this passage of

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.279
the care in the cargo which basically
gives fifty million out for this kind of

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.509
media work in pakistan they were sharing
the u_s_ this is going to be celebrated

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.060
in pakistan the pakistani people within
a very happy about it

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.100
and you know i think we all know that
government officials and always reflect

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.880
that the people think so is yet to see
if this the passage of its awesome

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.050
celebrated in pakistan are now too many
people in pakistan actually

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.470
reading newspaper or watch tv

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.020
powers for the majority of the people do
believe that the issue

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.180
of of the population in rural areas and
those are the people and that is that

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.809
that that is the area

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.099
out with a civilian casualties actually
not and i think those people exactly the

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.490
people whose hearts and minds of
national for

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.479
and they're not gonna making adjustments
based on what every day and what they're

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.560
seeing on tv if you have access to media
they're going to be seen by

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.530
who's getting hit next are fine
restaurants exactly so if they are the

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.120
people that are most affected

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.809
as all hope lost in this program

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:06.419
well you know that's not be too negative
year we don't know i mean there's a

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.099
possibility we have to life in the u_s_
is unclear exactly what they're trying

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.459
to target and trying to target the
people you know

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:15.659
in the city is a matter of the
population as a senator to people in

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.639
reliance

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.610
which is why you know it's what i said
earlier this is what it is that the

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.639
fifty million dollar p_r_ stunt but see
how it falls out ammunition thank you

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.919
for being here

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.099
a fifty million dollar p_r_ sent that's
ever happened by mr president plan to be

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.330
a fifty million dollars to me how this

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.009
and pakistan so that the u_s_ financial
needs of people's perceptions thanks

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.669
there are a lot of criticisms and we
have to see if this plan is anne chances

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:41.259
actually working
