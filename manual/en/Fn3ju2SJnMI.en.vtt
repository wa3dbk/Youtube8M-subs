00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.079
So you've decided to throw a kid's Christmas
party and you're not quite sure where to start.

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:10.490
Hi, I'm Jessica Meiczinger with Simply Divine
Events and I'm going to talk about some ideas

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.650
and some tips to incorporate into hosting
a kid's Christmas party. First of all you

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.670
want to have lots of activities to occupy
them. Keep it centered around the theme of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.509
the holidays. As the kids arrive you can hand
out little jingle bell necklaces like this,

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.870
you could if you're doing crafts, you could
make up little aprons that say Santa's Little

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.280
Helper so they don't get their clothes dirty,
or if you just want to keep it simple, you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.090
can have little hats too for the kids to take
home. I'm going to talk about some fun kid

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.440
friendly foods. You definitely want to have
some cookies and hot chocolate, maybe offer

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.170
just some finger foods like pizza bites or
something for the kids to munch on. You can

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.140
set up a craft table for activities, you can
do a cookie decorating center with different

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.050
sprinkles, different icings and different
little treat bags to take their cookies home

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.760
if they don't eat them beforehand. You could
also have an ornament decorating station where

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.550
the kids can decorate the ornaments or there's
little ornaments that you can buy like in

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.580
little packages and have them make the ornaments,
or even if you want keep it simple with no

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.550
mess, no fuss and just have them, set out
some crayons and colored pencils and have

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.750
them decorate Christmas cards for their family.
So and then for entertainment, just have some

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.990
fun kids Christmas music, upbeat music playing
in the background. You could also have Santa

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.770
Claus make an appearance and hand out gifts
to the kids. You can also have temporary tattoos

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.680
themed around the holidays with little fun
cartoons and stuff. So those are just some

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.690
ideas on how to host a kid's Christmas party.
Again, I'm Jessica with Simply Divine Events

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.590
and have a happy holiday season.
