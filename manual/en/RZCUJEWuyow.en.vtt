00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
(school bell rings)

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.620
You know who I can't stand?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.600
Bullies!

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.340
These archaic throwbacks really need a physical BEATDOWN,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.820
10 times worse than the ones they dole out on a DAILY BASIS!

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.400
I am SO SICK of turning on the news and hearing about some random bully story,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.560
detailing how some poor kid is getting abused by some genetic defect!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.480
Now,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.720
there ARE a number of ways one can handle a bully.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.940
But keep in mind,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.060
I'm a cartoon,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.420
and you should NOT take,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.100
OR use,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.680
any of the advice I give you!

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.220
With that being said,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.920
the easiest thing to do is:

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.060
FIGHT. BACK.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.320
And when I say "fight back,"

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.660
I don't mean, "throw a pUnCh..."

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.760
I mean "throw a FUCKING CHAIR!!"

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.840
Throw a DESK,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.120
or anything else that is not nailed to the floor!

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.120
Fight dirty,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.480
punch them in the balls,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.800
beat 'em with your backpack,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.600
throw 'em down a flight of stairs!

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.740
The ends justify the means.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.360
So,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.340
knock out a few teeth in the process!

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.960
Now, be warned,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.660
you will be dragged into the pRiNcIpAl'S OfFiCe,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.960
after beating a fellow classmate with a desk.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.360
But, at that point,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.820
make sure you clearly state,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300
"I was merely defending myself against continuous attacks perpetrated daily by this Neanderthalic individual,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.580
"AND had to resort to drastic measures because the learning institution I attend,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.980
"sat idle without intervention,"

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.540
"allowing the routine beatings I received to continue!"

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.080
"I should sue you!"

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.120
You may get a few weeks of detention,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.660
you may get a few months of jail depending severity of injuries.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.280
But,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.620
either way, the bully will think twice before laying a hand on you again!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.260
Now, the downside of our "eVoLvEd" society,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.500
is that bullying doesn't end in the schoolyard anymore.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.380
It continues on with social networks,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.700
and other idiotic virtual bullshit that engulf our daily lives!

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.000
In cases like this...

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.820
Dude,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.860
IGNORE!

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.740
Just use the Ignore option!

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.940
It's there for a reason!

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.440
However, if the stupidity persists,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.100
get parents involved!

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.040
Call the police!

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.680
Or better yet, the FBI!

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.720
Internet crimes ARE a federal offense!

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.540
Get some info from your local authorities, and see how your particular situation can be handled!

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.220
The one thing a bully will fear,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.180
is their drunken fathers beating the SHIT out of them,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.100
because the cops showed up on their doorstep!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.360
And frankly, I wouldn't be too worried about the blowback from being labeled a RAT,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.420
by your peers!

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.660
If they're not gonna help you stand up to this jackass,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.160
then fuck them, too!

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.860
If they don't have your back,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.360
they can SUCK ON YOUR SACK!!

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.060
It's a motto to live by.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.200
"But Foamy,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.460
"I don't wanna ruin anyone's life because they were picking on me!"

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.260
Well-...

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.520
why the fuck NOT?!

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.100
If they're gonna ruin your childhood,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.740
feel free to ruin their life!

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.800
If you don't take a stand, you will forever look back on your school years,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.680
as a horrible bucket of emotional shit,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.580
you'll have to carry around with you for the rest of your life!

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.940
Press charges,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.740
prosecute,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.200
and wave goodbye to them as they get transferred to another school!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.800
Or, preferably,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.060
a correctional facility with shady priests.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.060
Fuck 'em!

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.460
You don't necessarily have to use your fists;

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.020
just use your BRAIN!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.460
Never throw the first punch,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.700
always have a witness,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.480
and aim for the BALLS!!

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.600
SERIOUSLY,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.060
AIM FOR THE BALLS!!!

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.160
If you kick 'em hard enough,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.440
there's a good chance he'll lose the ability to create another generation of genetically-debased offspring!

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.220
You'd be doing the world, and all its future geeks and nerds, a valuable service.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.180
You're a humanitarian!

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.220
(END)

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.220
(singing) Ball kicking bullies!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.640
It's the new pastime after school!
