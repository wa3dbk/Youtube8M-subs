BEHIND THE SCENES
#157: THE MONTH AHEAD: AUGUST

00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:15.915
This week we're taking a look at the new grandmaster quest The Light Within

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:19.926
as well as a whole host of other updates coming to RuneScape this August.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.326
Here's Mod Mark with all the details.

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:29.272
Our main update this month is "The Light Within", a brand new grandmaster quest

00:00:29.293 --> 00:00:33.335
with requirements and rewards to suit the greatest of players.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:39.440
In it, you'll be working with the elf clans to rebuild Seren to her former glory, piecing together shards,

00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:45.774
revisiting Freneskae and wrestling with some pretty difficult choices that will determine her future,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.624
how she looks, how she acts and thinks if you successfully bring her back.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:54.935
What will your role be in the ancient song of creation?

00:00:55.282 --> 00:01:00.735
Rewards are suitably massive, as we give you some brand new spells and prayers to suit skillers

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:05.783
and for those who like to play a more supporting role in group combat activities.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.980
Try out a range of new prisms and auroras to overwhelm your opponents,

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:16.581
or the powerful "new shield dome" to protect your friends, or the mysterious "soul link",

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:21.420
as well as experiment with "crystalise" to turn your skilling locations into crystals,

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:24.039
"instant growth" to speed up your farming runs

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.527
or "enrichment" to improve your divination training, just to name a few.

00:01:28.664 --> 00:01:32.509
This fantastic update was inspired by Gaga Lady,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.137
winner of the RuneLabs quest poll earlier on in the year. Well done to you!

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:42.626
Improvement updates are, once again, packed full of your suggestions via the forums.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.244
This time, in the player owned house we've added more theme flexibility,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.401
allowing you to mix up ground, house and dungeon types,

00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:52.032
and we've added a few more ground textures too.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.029
You'll also be able to change between day and night modes.

00:01:55.044 --> 00:01:59.733
And while you're exploring your house you'll notice that we've made some gameplay changes

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.532
to make life less painful while training the construction skill.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:07.339
Inside the Elf City we've added new functionality to the Max Guild

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.181
by adding useful stuff like decanters, enchanters and new portal locations.

00:02:12.314 --> 00:02:16.444
And we've improved Movrans challenge rewards by adding a bunch of new stuff,

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:19.137
not least the permanent dark crystals.

00:02:19.332 --> 00:02:24.596
There are lots of other smaller improvements too, like added crystal weapon drops for the Edimmus

00:02:24.607 --> 00:02:27.021
and new golden rocks for sinkholes.

00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:31.069
So do make sure that you have a nose around. Elves love the company!

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:37.991
We've also graphically improved a bunch of the Myreque in Morytania, ready for next month's awesome quest,

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:41.272
so flap over to the east if you can't wait to see them.

00:02:41.622 --> 00:02:47.475
With the added attention to minigames since the successful spotlight system was introduced a few months ago,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.343
the ninjas have taken it upon themselves to fix up some of our more tired and lack lustre examples.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:55.780
This month they've fixed up Fist of Guthix,

00:02:55.791 --> 00:03:01.310
a great game all about being hunted down by a fellow player while trying to earn some tasty rewards.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.752
We've improved the game so it's easier to start and find opponents,

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.417
we've changed the gauntlets so they can be dropped by monsters,

00:03:07.428 --> 00:03:12.973
we've added player-crafted dragon coifs, we've made some of the equipment available as high-end free-to-play gear,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:17.755
and we've added a bunch of new rewards gloves for Runecrafting, Fishing and Herblore,

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:22.086
making the whole experience so much more fun and worthwhile.

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:26.591
You might not know but over 5000 of you per day are playing minigames,

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:29.430
and we want to see that number increase even further.

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:34.630
So if you keep giving us feedback, expect even more improvements and reworks in the future.

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:39.790
In other news, we have some interesting content coming up as we play around with Hearts of Ice

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:42.863
and we've added Death Lotus training to Treasure Hunter.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.157
And Solomon swaggers in to introduce a bunch of new walk animations

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:50.192
and present a huge summer sale.

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:52.409
Have fun! Wooters out!

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:58.502
And we're back next week with the first of RuneScape's newest updates coming this August.
