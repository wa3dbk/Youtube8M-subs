00:00:00.235 --> 00:00:03.243
(video game style music)

00:00:03.243 --> 00:00:07.323
- Vodka is the world's top selling spirit.

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.153
Sell more bottles of
that than anything else.

00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:09.820
- Really?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.919
- Yeah.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.939
- What's the ratio?

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.843
- Why would you think I
know the goddamn ratio?

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:17.351
I just learned this shit
earlier today. Okay?

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.301
I don't know the damn ratio. Okay?

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:21.902
A lot. Okay? A lot. A little.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.247
Contrary to popular belief, homeboy,

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:26.151
vodka does go bad.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.751
- And it should be
consumed within 12 months.

00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:30.795
- Of being manufactured, okay?

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.559
Or you can be drinking
some poisonous piss,

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.906
but since it's kind of tasteless,

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:35.253
you might not know. Okay?

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:38.085
- Vodka's made by distilling
anything that's fermentable.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.641
- Exactly. So, for instance,

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:42.311
Ciroc is made from fermented grapes.

00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.401
Grey Goose comes from wheat.

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.375
Belvedere comes from rye.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:50.002
- I love rye bread.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:50.327
- Really?

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:51.191
- It's different.

00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:52.979
- That's the driest fucking bread ever.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:53.698
- I know.

00:00:53.698 --> 00:00:55.486
- Both Russia and Poland

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:57.924
claim to be the birth place of Vodka.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.828
They fight over this all the time,

00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:02.243
and it is both of their national drinks.

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:03.241
- It's my nationality.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:04.356
- What?

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:05.378
- Russian and Polish.

00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:07.630
- I thought your nationality was American.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.720
- No. I'm American,
because I was born here,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.043
but that's...

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:11.938
- Nationality, yes.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:12.547
- Yes.

00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:13.545
(they laugh)

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:14.745
- Moving on. Okay?

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:16.347
Google that shit. Figure it out.

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:20.549
Oxford University Professor
Richard Peto did a study,

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.916
and he was able to determine
that the average Russian

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:28.003
drinks five gallons of Vodka a year.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.160
The reason why Vodka
became so popular in Russia

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.272
is because this was the
only liquor that was able

00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:36.408
to survive the harsh Russian winter,

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:39.473
because it wouldn't freeze
because of its purity.

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:41.539
So, you could leave that shit
out there in the snow, okay?

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.281
And Vladimir could wake
up in the next morning

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.113
and take a hit of that,
because it's still good to go.

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:49.109
You can't do that with
Whiskey and, you know, Rum.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.288
During the reign of the
Russian Peter the Great,

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:55.494
he was a real Vodka fanatic.

00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:58.814
When ambassadors came to his court,

00:01:58.814 --> 00:02:01.601
they were required to drink what was

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:04.758
the White Eagle Cup, which contained

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:08.566
a liter and a half of Vodka.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:09.518
- To drink the whole thing?

00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:12.653
- Yes. So, once that's happening,

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:14.812
was two ambassadors would come. Okay?

00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:16.786
Yes, so he's the, one to drink it

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.202
and then one to do business.

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:20.988
(laughing)

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:22.033
- The one with the good ideas.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.635
- That's not a myth. Google that.

00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:25.028
The cup goes by different names:

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:27.281
the White Eagle Cup, the
White cup, whatever it was.

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:29.626
There was some shit in
this cup you had to drink.

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:33.155
The way to drink Vodka in Eastern Europe

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:35.857
is to drink it neat. Just sip it.

00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:37.003
You know what I mean?

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:39.070
You don't mix it with
olives and crazy cocktails;

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.114
that's not their style.

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:41.926
They just love it neat.

00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:44.294
The two most popular Vodka drinks are:

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:46.151
- [ Girl] The Martini and the Bloody Mary.

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:49.007
- Exactamente. Vodka's
the most popular drink

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.817
in America, but that
was not always the case.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:55.091
Smirnoff came to America in the 1930's.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.529
At this time, Whiskey was king.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.697
That's all Americans were really drinking.

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:01.554
And they nearly went bankrupt.

00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:06.554
Then, in the 1950's, they
came out with a real winner.

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:10.540
Their campaign was, "It'll
leave you breathless."

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.932
Now, you have to understand
what they meant by

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:14.929
"It'll leave you breathless,"
because you definitely

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.925
can't market your shit this way, today.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:18.574
In fact, what they were saying was that

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:21.894
Vodka has no taste, it's odorless.

00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:24.007
That means you could
drink it and go to work.

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:25.633
You could drink it while you drive.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:27.002
You can drink it in church,

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:30.183
and no one will know that
you're drinking Vodka.

00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:32.413
People went freaking crazy for this drink,

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:34.851
and Vodka exploded. No looking back.

00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:36.499
- [Girl] Today, we're
making Night Night Daddy,

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.008
based on the movie Sinister 2.

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.237
- Exactly. Could you live in
a house that someone died in?

00:03:40.237 --> 00:03:42.513
- No. Fuck no.

00:03:42.513 --> 00:03:43.581
I'm sure I have.

00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:45.086
I've lived in Hollywood for six years,

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.502
and like, shit goes down there.

00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:48.415
I'm sure, like, my place would find...
