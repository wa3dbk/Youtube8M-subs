00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.709
K it and the whole and today we're going
to do some pretty bad things to lunatic

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:06.120
Luntatik Taktik Extreme for the iPhone 5s

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.760
Real Usage. Real Reviews. Mobile Reviews - eh.ca

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.900
now this Luntatik Taktik Extreme case is a very expensive
case

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.010
made by lunatik and lunatik is a company
that prides themselves in

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.850
build quality as well the design of
their products and generally it shows

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.160
lunatik it doesn't tell you how far you
can actually drop it so I'm guessing

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.910
that actually going do that test but

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.809
and the Rafique users say you know
somebody riding a motorcycle dropped it

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.640
fell off while they were going at fifty
miles per hour so they make it sound

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.920
like it's pretty tough

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.960
so entire focus it's in the middle up to
the silicone there's about a

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.489
happenin to circle around the entire
boat the call it an impact Russian there

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.250
are all these little triangles and
whatnot

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.120
the things that we look for in a dropped
us just to see if there's any physical

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.020
damage to the phone as well as physical
damage to the case

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.640
sometimes tough iPhone cases break after one drop or
they come apart after dropping those are

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.420
things that we want you guys to know

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.949
so what we're going to do next going to
do several tests were neg do a bussey

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.130
coming into your pocket Estate Group C I
walk in and i trippin I drop it and in

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.430
group C I'm gonna throw it up in

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.659
maybe hit the ceiling up this room test
so we're going to get the video going

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.869
there's our entire setup and we're gonna

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.560
you can actually pull it over pocket and
it falls in a cell so nice when he hits

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.340
the ground

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.340
just kinda like like a pillow pet good

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.630
video still going

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.570
not too shabby um a walk-in nooo

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.790
all face first the mid

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.130
yeah nothing really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.640
this entire Luntatik Taktik Extreme iPhone case is screwed together so
there's almost no chance

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.040
other than somehow we're tearing apart
the pot polymer polycarbonate plastic

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.740
thing apart

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
a will do a speedy test speedy up

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.649
good

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.329
still going and if we do it haw

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:14.329
pop theme so this is the last us that
we're gonna do and we're going to make

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.959
it a doozy

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.290
so I'm gonna try to toss the phone

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.319
that up

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.569
I totally missed wanna do that one more
time

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.569
this time gonna try not to fail and what
up

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.580
good

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.180
still filming

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.340
so after all those drops the one thing
we did notice was that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730
this Luntatik Taktik Extreme case piece doesn't bit

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.350
into the pool ugh anymore and so we are

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.690
gonna guess that we dropped off a corner
which look like we did

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.460
Andrew somethings bent on the inside I
months period these ones

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.980
I'm gonna leave this one and we're just
gonna do that quickly now

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.180
this is the one that's hold in the plug

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.480
and that's the thing that's not fitting
properly that's the screwing

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.480
question and it doesn't look like it
bent all good if it's back in time

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.160
but to bust no and doesn't so I went and
got my old Luntatik Taktik Extreme iPhone case and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.740
I've got this little red knob and I

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.030
had to take I compared the two and I'm
guessing that the impacts actually

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.250
what are the drops landed directly on
this corner

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.660
because the peace actually this metal
pieces actually

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.180
slightly deformed its a little longer
now

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.730
so it used to fit but now it doesn't go
as opposed to take this red piece

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.840
and put it in if it's quite nicely into
the hole but if it take this

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740
orange little nub because we've
performed it

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.100
doesn't really fit that well kinda pops

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.440
ot a little bit all in all I still think
this case is pretty tough we did just

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.549
toss Luntatik Taktik Extreme case like nobody's business but I
think week might be able to do something

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.800
a little more with its but you have to
find that own the annotation section

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.640
at the end of this video we're gonna see
if I can fly think I'm and the whole

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.980
