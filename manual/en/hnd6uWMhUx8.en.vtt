00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.932
James: A lot of people
think when I'm doing this

00:00:01.932 --> 00:00:07.455
kind of thing with my fingers,
it looks very chaotic.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.079
But the truth is when I'm
doing this I'm paying attention

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.044
to only one small very tiny
thing not the cube overall

00:00:14.044 --> 00:00:16.022
and that gives me the
ability to focus on things

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:18.125
even though it looks very chaotic.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.158
Now the first thing I do when
I solve it is to focus on

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.258
this piece right here which
seems pretty simple, right?

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:27.118
What I need to do is make
sure that the four surrounding

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:29.977
edges for each of them
is going to be white.

00:00:29.977 --> 00:00:33.277
Now you can see that this
one here is white as well,

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:36.082
but the problem is when I come over here,

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:38.738
the green and the blue don't match up

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.700
and that's a very easy fix.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.970
I can take and I can move it like that.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.617
So even though it may seem like
a lot of work is being done,

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.367
I'm only focusing on that
one piece right there.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.523
Now the rest of what I have to
do to begin in this first step

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:54.982
is to make sure that I get
this white cross right here.

00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:59.468
(upbeat music)

00:00:59.468 --> 00:01:02.367
Okay, so just in a couple
of seconds I was able to get

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:06.272
this white cross but not only
that I was able to get these

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:11.599
centerpieces matched up with
the edge pieces as well.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.771
So this next step is where
the magic is gonna happen

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.105
and this is the difference
between the beginning solvers

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:17.737
and more advanced solvers.

00:01:17.737 --> 00:01:20.085
I'm actually going to do two steps in one.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.980
I'm going to pay attention to
not this piece, not this piece

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.324
but this piece right here.

00:01:26.324 --> 00:01:27.861
But the advanced method is to worry about

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:29.398
this piece as well.

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:30.937
So in my next set of moves,

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.997
I intend to put these pieces into place.

00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:37.659
Now what I would do is I would
find those pieces on the cube.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.989
I make the adjustments and if you can see

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.829
those two pieces are now together
and I simply put them in.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.471
So now we've got one corner
of the Rubik's Cube solved.

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:50.442
So to finish out the second
step, what I did for this corner

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.942
right here I want to do for the
other three corners as well.

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:56.264
Now those pieces are gonna
be living up here somewhere.

00:01:56.264 --> 00:01:59.311
I simply need to find them,
recognize the algorithm

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:03.813
I have to use and put them into place.

00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:04.810
And just like that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.700
I've got the bottom
half of the cube solved.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.514
The third step is to
make the top all yellow.

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:12.796
Now pay close attention

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:17.002
'cause this is gonna happen really fast.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.870
And finally we get to the last step.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.008
It's gonna be just as easy as
Step #3 is to be able to take

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.655
all these pieces and be
able to put them in place.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.185
So this one, usually takes
just a couple of seconds

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:31.813
to get it done.

00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:33.516
My name is James Gray
and I'm the Chair of the

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.028
Math Department here at the
Community College of Aurora

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:37.946
and I don't know why I like them.

00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:40.392
I've always just liked Rubik's
Cubes since I was a kid.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:44.000
(upbeat music)
