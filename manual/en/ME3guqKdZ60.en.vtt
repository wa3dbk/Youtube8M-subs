00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.920
Hey guys so today I am going
to be showing my you day time and night time

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.920
routine. It's very simple. Both of them take
under 3 minutes. I don't really do too much

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.940
so I'll just show you guys my night time routine.
It's actually morning time but I figured I

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.000
could do them back to back. So this is my
nighttime routine even though it's morning.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Nighttime routine

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.059
Okay so what I usually do is, I gather my
hair up in a ponytail... or a bun. And I just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.600
take my hair tie and wrap it around, like
so. And next, I take my hair... scarf. It's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.740
just a rectangle scarf that's really long.
And I just wrap it around my hair and wrap

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:30.149
it around again and then knot it in the back.
So it's the morning time and I hope that you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.119
all had an amazing sleep like I did. Just
kidding, I just filmed the nighttime routine

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.119
2 minutes ago. But it's the morning time and
what I'll normally do is I'll wake up and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.090
normally I'll take a shower after I wake up.
But I don't like getting my hair wet in the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.990
shower. So what I'll normally do, because
shower caps, I've bought them and they don't

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.990
fit under my bun; I'll normally wear shorts
and a shirt to bed. So I'll take my shirt

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.810
like this one. And the hole part in it, I'll
put my head into... or the neck part of it.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.200
And I'll wrap it around and then tuck this
little piece in. And it's easy and I'm sure

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.970
everyone has a shirt. So that's why I like
to use it. And then I'll get into the shower.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.099
Hey guys so I just got out of the shower and
now I am going to show you what I do with

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:44.019
my hair in the morning time. So I take my
shirt/ turban off. Take my scarf off. And

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.019
I take my bun out. And I just take my hair
down. And this is what I usually do to my

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.019
hair. I mean I don't refresh the curls or
anything. I just take it down. If I want some

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.099
nice shine to it, I'll take this shea butter
and olive oil mixture, I'll just take a little

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:13.099
bit like that and I'll smooth it in my hands
so it doesn't leave white marks. And I'll

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.580
warm it up in my hands like this. I spread
onto my hair. Now I don't do this every day.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.890
I will, well lately I have been doing it every
day. Because I like the shine that it gives;

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.409
My hair has never been shiny before. This
makes my hair so shiny. I just style how I

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.540
want my hair. I always, almost always part
my hair to this side because this is where

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.459
my natural part is right here. Sometimes,
I'll take this chunk of hair ans flip it over

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.459
to make my hair fuller on one side. But that's
usually about all I do. This is my hair guys.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:13.409
That's it guys. So thanks for watching so
much and if you have any tips, have any tricks,

night routine, can you leave it in the comments
