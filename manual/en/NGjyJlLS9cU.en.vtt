00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.219
&gt;&gt;Agnelli:

00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:07.700
I think that we all follow the news items,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.680
in particular sport news and in these

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.620
last days the legal sport news as well.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.361
I can’t hide the fact that,

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:20.519
in the light of the activity

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.919
by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Cremona,

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.929
the overall current pattern is extremely worrisome

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:27.929
for the whole football world.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:28.929
We’re following all developments

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:29.929
with concern and disappointment,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:37.750
but considering the whole current picture

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.160
and I’m here today to underline this point

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:51.370
I don’t think that Antonio Conte belongs
to this worrisome pattern.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.440
My position can be explained with three main
reasons.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.730
Firstly, and mainly, the role ascribed to

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.070
Antonio is practically negligible.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.850
Secondly, the club that I represent

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.229
have thoroughly known Antonio over the last
season,

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
which saw Juventus back to winning ways up
until clinching the Scudetto.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.400
Thirdly, I’ve known him for 20 years,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.009
and he’s always shown honesty, integrity
and fairness over

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.430
his whole career, as both Juventus football
player and Juventus manager.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.070
Moreover, knowing Antonio and his moral values,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.240
and considering the current stage of the inquiry

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.829
activated by ordinary and sport justice,

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.159
it’s absolutely fair to respect the work
carried out by

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.159
the investigating authorities,

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.390
as they are addressing a quite complex scene.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.780
However the same respectful attitude

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.969
should be shown to those who found themselves
involved in

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.140
these circumstances which are to be verified,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.960
to those who are living a moment of weakness.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.549
Along with the club Juventus,

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.090
I’m now personally close to Antonio Conte
and Leonardo Bonucci.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.600
About the latter, I’ve just known from some
agency dispatches,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.200
that he would also be implied in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.770
the inquiry activated by a different Public
Pr

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.939
osecutor’s Office.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.450
Leonardo joined us two years ago,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.239
he knows how to address stresses,

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.110
and I wish him to pass

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.830
through this time as soon as possible

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.840
in order to enjoy a wonderful European Championship,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.610
with a National side which still counts for
one-third of Bianconeri players.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.760
In order to avoid possible conjectures,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.129
I’d like to conclude by pointing out the
fact that

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.220
Antonio is and will be our manager.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.810
Next season, we’ll be involved in the Champions
League

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.739
- the top European competition - and

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.290
Antonio will certainly be our leader.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.290
Thank you.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.290
&gt;&gt;Conte

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.290
Thanks Andrea for your words.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.599
I’d like to say that

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:15.930
I 
think that my sport career,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.400
as both football player

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400
and manager is

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
absolutely apparent.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.720
I’ve always shown moral honesty

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.500
and integrity under all circumstances,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.860
as both footballer and manager.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.220
You can ask my former teammates,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.510
my players, and my rivals too

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.849
what kind of person Antonio Conte

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:59.220
is on the pitch:

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.370
he’s a man who wants to win,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.040
who also goes beyond

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.709
his possibilities to achieve

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.709
his targets.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.040
I’ve carried out a hard work,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.180
with sacrifices and humility,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.130
trying to transmit true values to my

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.130
players.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.000
We mustn’t forget that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I’ve also been attacked by

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.950
people armed with sticks

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.600
under my two-years

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.930
daughter and my wife’s eyes,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.910
and just due to my moral integrity,

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.620
honesty and fairness.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.650
This is Antonio Conte,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.950
especially for those who

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.160
don’t know him or perhaps

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.530
those who pretend that

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.530
they don’t.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.780
With Siena I won last year’s

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.670
championship three games before

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.510
the end of the season,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.170
with sacrifice,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.720
hard work, tears and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.490
achieving great satisfaction,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.620
with a group of extraordinary lads.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.670
I’d like to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.920
underline my total

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:31.310
ignorance of all these facts,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.250
as well as that of my players.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.560
It was a wonderful season,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.730
and nobody will damage it,

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:54.800
because it was something really special.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.030
I was put under

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.260
investigation for criminal conspiracy.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.050
My house was thoroughly searched,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.770
and I wasn’t there.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.700
I read the order and the few words contained
therein.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.480
I immediately wondered why

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.740
I wasn’t sent for by

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.410
the public prosecutor in Cremona

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.410
before my house

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:30.260
search and before being put under investigation.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:39.730
I fully read the order and its poor content,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.960
I’d have expected to be heard by the public

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.550
prosecutor in Cremona before

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.150
such measures were taken.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.950
I think to have been exhaustive.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.820
Enjoy your holidays, I’ll do so.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.820
&gt;&gt;Agnelli

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.640
That’s all, thank you for your attention.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.120
Bye
