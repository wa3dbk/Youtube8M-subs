00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:10.982
Ah! Just in time, bro. Ha ha ha! Yeah!

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:12.949
Lance, I'm through with this, man.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.650
What, you mean this dump? Yeah me too.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.434
No - I'm through with this bullshit. 
 I don't wanna be a damn drug dealer. It's for assholes.

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:25.289
Vic - don't go soft on me now.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.203
I got what we finally needed - I know how we can 
 get our hands on one big shipment, completely free.

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:35.776
We can finally get Pete the health care he needs.

00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:41.392
Look Lance, I'm a long way from being a good guy, 
 but drugs just mean trouble.

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:48.887
I agree, man. 100% agree. That's why we gonna get 
 this one big pay day for all the hard work and split.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.700
Jerry Martinez... it's his coke.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.889
Oh... fuck it. You know what? Let's do it.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.808
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that is a real man. Let's pop.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.958
We're gonna make it big Vic.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:13.894
I have a dream...

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:15.364
I have a dream-muh!

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:16.969
Your dream's my nightmare.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.546
Don't be like that, man.

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:21.187
Look, I've even arranged some insurance.

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:23.494
C'mon guys - time to pop.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.299
So, what's the plan?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.775
Martinez is bringing in that big ass shipment Forbes 
 was rapping about...We're gonna rip it off.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330
I'll take a look and see what's happening.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.079
You two just sit tight and make sure our exit is clear.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.770
This is about to get ugly.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.179
Take the other truck and follow me.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.449
Looks like your friend Martinez finally showed up...

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.670
Shit!

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.479
Try to keep up man, I'm a BAAAD driver.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.560
You said it.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.720
Hey, looks like the cops have scared off Martinez...

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.440
Oh, shit. They're after US now.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.942
Rich at last, uh-hu, rich at last, huh...

00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:30.828
Thank God almighty, we are rich at last!

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:32.633
We haven't sold this shit yet.

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:38.015
We'd better: I've just bought us both fancy apartments. 
 We're mortgaged to the hilt.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:40.539
We're supposed to be getting out of this shit.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.910
We are. But I gotta do it in style. 
 I've got a reputation to uphold.
