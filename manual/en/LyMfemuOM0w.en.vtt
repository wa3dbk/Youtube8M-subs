00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.149
Hey all, it's micro I am back again with a
bit of a proof of concept. So if you watch

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.889
a lot of of Vortac's streams on Twitch you will
notice that he has been getting somewhat back

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.889
in to Runescape. So I decided that I'm bored,
I like Runescape, I don't relay play it all

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that much, because it has gotten bad but I
used to like it and I also like Minecraft

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.140
so why not try and make an open world RPG-like
Minecraft map within Minecraft or an open

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.410
world RPG map within Minecraft. So ignore
this poor excuse for a makeshift cave and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.980
imagine that this is some sort of level grinding
were I want to level my mining. You will notice

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.120
on the scoreboard side it will say "Mining
level 6", I plan on making levels harder to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.640
achieve eventually but this is just again
a proof of consent very rough, I plan on making

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.219
it more efficient. So I go ahead I mine an
Iron and pick it up for later so I can work

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:21.219
on smelting or what ever and it relapses it
with an emptied out, unable to be used stone

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.869
which is then later replaced after a little
bit of a "warm up time"or a "Cool down time"

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.869
or whatever you want to call it with an iron
block. Similar to many grinding forms in games

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.220
like Runescape or other RPG games with a uh,
what's it called, a mining skill were it replaces

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.579
the stone you just mined with an empty stone
after a set cool down time it will replace

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.579
itself and it can be mined again. And if you
notice my mining level is slowly going up,

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.679
now it is level ten and I figure why not show
you the stuff behind this. So uh day game

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.650
mode one, come on, game mode one, time set
one hundred, and here is the red-stone behind

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.280
it. It is actually rather simple, ignore this
stuff it is just the score board and game-rules.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.680
Over here I have a simple clock, I could have
a faster clock I just chose this one because

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.680
I can and I have a "test for block" five blocks
above this one for an air block so every time,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.450
there, this iron block gets replaced with
an air block it'll send off a pulse which

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.390
goes in to this block. Which goes off to add
the closest player one level to their mining

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.390
level and replaces the block with stone, which,
after that it sends a pulse out around this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.150
way. I can make it longer, I probably am going
to come up with some sort of of more efficient

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.150
way to set up the pulse. And this one relapses
the stone block with an iron ore block. So

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.790
rather simple, again just a proof of consent
which I plan on making more efficient. But

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.600
I was bored and had nothing better to do I
figured I would show it off, it is not much

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.830
but. I'll see you guys later.
