[MIDI music plays]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.520
[typing]

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.120
Back in the 1980s,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.540
one of the most common types of
game to see for personal computers

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.100
was the arcade port.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.060
Sometimes they were awesome.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.800
Sometimes they were aw-FUL.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.300
And sometimes they were Ikari Warriors,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.320
the arcade game by SNK

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.240
released in 1987 by Data East USA

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.680
and ported by Elite Systems, Ltd.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.300
The box is pretty typical stuff for back then,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
promising arcade realism at home,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.800
and shoving in your face the idea that the game

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.200
is the most amazing thing to
happen in the history of humanity.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.580
It also provides some pretty
darn good-looking screenshots,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.880
which sure do get me psyched
to play the game because, frick,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.220
this looks exactly like the arcade version.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.980
Speaking of the arcade version,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.020
it exists.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.600
Ikari Warriors, or I-kari Warriors–

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.420
iRobot Warriors, iPad Warriors,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.980
however you pronounce it–

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
was first released to arcades by SNK in 1986.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.780
The game featured two Rambo-ripoff manly men,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.800
hailing from the man-filled
manscape of Northwest Mandia

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.940
from the year 1980-Man,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.780
and was in fact SNK's first major hit in the USA.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
While it was essentially a tweaked
clone of Capcom's Commando,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.120
Ikari Warriors had a pretty little innovative gimmick.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.640
Its cabinet featured rotary joysticks,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.140
which could not only be pushed in
eight directions like most other joysticks,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.360
but also rotated, so the player
could move in one direction

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.720
and fire in another.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.120
This version of the game is actually
not a DOS game but a PC booter.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.240
What this means is that the game
bypasses any existent operating system

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.280
and runs the game by simply inserting the
floppy and booting your IBM-compatible PC.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.840
No messy command-line stuff required.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.140
Inside the box, you get a PC booter disk itself,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.760
in this case on a 5¼-inch floppy,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.500
even though the box says it contains a 3½-inch.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.700
It lied.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.980
You also get a manual,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.280
which is pretty typical black-and-white crap.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.220
It actually states that it's for the
Commodore 64 and 128 on the front,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.360
though inside you get some basic instructions

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.420
for the IBM PC, Apple II and,
of course, the Commodore ports.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.700
Mine also came with this little sheet of paper,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.600
which appears to be part of a
map from The Legend of Zelda.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.180
I don't think this was supposed
to be included, but who knows?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940
Maybe you get to grenade Link in this game.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:24.960
That would be awesome.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.500
[PC speaker music plays]

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.600
The game starts with a
pretty simple selection of players

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.040
and your control method and, uh...

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.700
Okay, uh, what...is this?

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.420
Ikari Warriors in the snow?

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.020
Did nuclear winter happen while I wasn't looking?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.920
What happened to all those awesome colors?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.820
The "arcade realism at home?"

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.740
Ah.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.620
"Screens shown are from arcade version.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.400
Computer version may vary."

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.880
No, you don't say?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.960
Arcade realism at home...

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.280
Well, I guess that's technically true.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.380
There's arcade realism on the back of the box,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.640
which is in your home.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140
All kidding aside, it seems this
PC version of Ikari Warriors

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.220
only utilizes CGA and EGA graphics.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.140
Though I don't know why they didn't
choose the other color palette for CGA,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.560
as the warmer tones would've
made a lot more friggin' sense

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.500
than the winter wonderland
you're forced to walk through.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.240
You can switch over to EGA

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.480
which provides a much better selection
of colors, all things considered.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.940
And I'd highly recommend it
unless you just like the game

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.680
looking like a bowl of Dippin'
Dots melted on your screen.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.620
As far as the gameplay itself goes,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.560
it's not too shabby for a PC port of the time.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.840
Actually, I'd say it's pretty frickin'
awesome once you get over the fact

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.900
that you don't have those sweet
rotary arcade joysticks to use.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.780
You use the numpad on the keyboard
to move your Rambo wannabe around,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.200
so that gives you your cardinal
directions plus diagonals.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.820
It takes some serious getting used to

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.100
since the only way to aim
is to move in that direction,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.780
And due to the lower resolution

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.320
and differing screen ratio from the arcade game,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.040
you have a much smaller play field.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.960
But before long, you do get used to this,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.140
and thankfully the game is made a bit easier

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.980
to compensate for all of these changes.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.880
In addition to the movement keys,
you have the Z, X, and C keys,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880
for your action buttons like shooting,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.320
getting in and out of vehicles
and tossing grenades.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.260
It's an acceptable enough layout,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.800
but I do wish you could
change the key configuration

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.300
as I prefer my hands to be a little
bit closer together on the keyboard.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.260
But whatever. It doesn't get in
the way of the main attraction

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.860
and that is killing dudes, using guns,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.340
explosives, tanks,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.500
and sheer testosterone ejaculation.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.880
It may not be as intense as the arcade game,

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.240
but it totally gets the "solid gameplay feel" down pat.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.460
This is just one of those games that I always
intend to play for maybe a few minutes

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.780
or a couple of rounds.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.200
But before I know it,
it's a half-hour to 45 minutes later

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.760
and I haven't even realized it.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.120
Once you get past that initial clunkiness,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.460
you get into a certain groove

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.080
of pattern learning,
danger dodging and mayhem

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.040
that's just satisfying to
experience time and time again.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.880
It's just a freakin' cool game,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.040
and it's one of my favorite classic arcade games,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.120
even though I honestly suck at it.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.120
And it's got support for two players.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.960
So if you want to bring a friend along

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.480
to get frustrated and volatile, then feel free!

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.800
So, yep.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.680
Ikari Warriors on the PC

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.220
has some flaws, but taken
as an overall experience,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.460
I'd say it succeeds as an arcade port for the PC.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.740
It's just plain fun

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.900
and as far as I'm concerned,
that's really what counts in the end.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.760
Even if the "arcade realism at home" promise

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.240
is a bit far-fetched.
