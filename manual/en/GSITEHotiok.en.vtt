00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.700
Scott Pape: Welcome to the Barefoot Investor's
60, 60, 6 challenges.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.700
Helping you get more money smart by the minute.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.200
Part of becoming a wage-earner is taking control of your money.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.200
Do it now and you’ll have this ritual for life
and you’ll be able to use it to build real wealth.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.900
This challenge takes one call. Phone your pay office
and ask them to give you all your employment details.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.200
You need to know how much you’re pulling in
each payday, how much is going to super

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.300
and whether you’ve started to pay back any
higher education debt that you might have.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.400
Now, you might also find some of this info on your payslip.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.400
Now, you don’t need to start paying back your
higher education debt until you earn just over

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.700
50-grand per year, but you do need to declare to
the tax office that you have a HECS-HELP debt.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.300
This is usually done on your tax file number
declaration form when you start a new job.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.900
You can’t really understand your finances unless you
devote a bit of time each week to keeping them in order.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
But who said it had to be hard?

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.160
Just do what I do: First, I want you to find an empty shoebox.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.700
Next, buy a packet of bickies or whatever treat takes your fancy.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.000
Then, put all your bills for the week in the shoebox.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.100
Okay now I want you to put the kettle on,
and make yourself a cuppa and go through your bills.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.100
Pay the bills if possible, or work out exactly
when you’ll need to pay each one

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
and put the payment date in your diary.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.200
If you do this little 60-minute ritual once a week,
at the same time each week,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.300
I guarantee you’ll not only get on top of doing your
weekly finances, you’ll even look forward to it.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
Now this may sound strange but for the first
part of the 6-day challenge I’d like

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
you to go out to a restaurant with your partner or a mate.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.700
While you’re there, get a serviette and a pen and
draw a tap with three buckets under it.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Label them ‘Blow’, ‘Mojo’ and ‘Grow’.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
That’s exactly what I did with my wife before we were married

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.700
and it’s become famously known as my Serviette
Strategy. And now I’m going to share it with you.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay, so how much you devote to each bucket will
vary depending on your situation but what’s important

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is setting all three up and giving something to each one each payday.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.400
Now, for most people, their Blow bucket is their one and
only money bucket – wages come in, money goes out

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.500
and hopefully there is something left over
to put towards saving and long-term wealth.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.300
But there’s nothing systematic about it.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.200
Your Blow bucket is an everyday transaction account
I want you to use to pay expenses like bills,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.000
food and your mortgage or rent.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.500
But the problem is, it has a hole in it – every dollar that
you pour in ends up leaking out the bottom.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.800
That’s why you need the other two buckets.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.900
Now, your Mojo bucket is simply a high-interest online savings account.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.800
Work towards keeping your Mojo bucket stocked
with at least three months of living expenses

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.000
or a quarter of your annual pay.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.700
The final one is the Grow bucket. Now the aim with
every dollar you pour into this bucket is to compound

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.900
your money, hopefully doubling your dough every seven to ten years.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.100
Now, there are actually three parts to the Grow bucket –
superannuation, shares, and property investments.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.300
And if you can devote money to each of those
three things your wealth will grow safely

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.200
and surely over your career.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.100
You can use MoneySmart's budget
planner to help you work out your goals

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.600
and how much to allocate to each bucket.
