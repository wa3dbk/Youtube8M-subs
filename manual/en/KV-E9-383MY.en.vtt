00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.680
En Papillote, French for "in parchment", is
a really neat method of cooking where ingredients

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.579
are baked together in a parchment paper pouch.
Today I'll be making this really delicious

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:19.590
recipe, “Chicken en Papillote,” with roasted
grapes, a recipe kit designed by my friends

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.710
at Plated.
First I'm going to preheat the oven to 400ºF

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.360
degrees.
Now I’m taking the potatoes and cutting

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.250
them in half lengthwise. In a medium bowl,
I’m tossing the potatoes with 1 tbsp of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.690
olive oil and seasoning them salt and pepper.
Next, I’ll thinly slice the lemon.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.310
These will all bake together in our parchment
paper with the chicken. I’m folding a large

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.690
piece of parchment paper in half. Using kitchen
shears, I’m cutting the parchment into a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:01.670
heart shape. Now, on one side of the heart,
take some potatoes and arrange them in a single

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.970
layer. Then, I’m laying my chicken breast
on top of the potatoes and seasoning it with

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.610
some salt and pepper. Finally, I’m layering
the lemon slices and a sprig of thyme over

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.080
the chicken.
Now to fold the parchment paper, I’m starting

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.740
from one end, tightly folding the open edge
of the paper. I’ll continue to fold the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.090
edge of the paper to form a seal. And here's
my nifty chicken packet!

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.220
I’m transferring my chicken en papillote
to a baking sheet and baking it for 30 minutes.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.010
It’s basically going to be steaming in the
oven and it’s really good for you because

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.140
it’s locking in all the flavors and nutrients
in this little packet.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.441
Now for the remaining ingredients. I have
some red and green grapes that I’ll slice

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:59.659
in half and I’ll toss them in a bowl with
some quartered shallots, crushed rosemary,

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:11.540
balsamic vinaigrette, olive oil, and some
salt and pepper. I’ll lay it on a different

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.940
baking sheet and roast at the same time with
the chicken for about 15 minutes until it’s

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:34.890
brown and tender.
Dinner is ready! It took me about 45 minutes

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.840
to prepare this gourmet fresh meal and the
best thing is I didn’t even have to go shopping

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.570
for it. Plated sent all the ingredients measured
out so I knew exactly what went into my meal!

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.989
