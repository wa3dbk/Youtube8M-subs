00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.110
and here's another one

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.480
this one is for target

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.049
target is awesome

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.349
and time to get inspired, again you
can have animation bringing these things on

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.009
I just click on it it takes over the screen
again

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.369
back to school

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.829
I could play that again

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.000
or I could build my own dorm room

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.009
let's see what that's like

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:41.009
I am a dude who's into fashions skateboarding music
sports.. I'll say music maybe

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.930
music and I'm going to Baylor Berkeley
or my school Michigan

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.910
so let's build my room and it's
going to put up all the stuff that they carry

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.100
this Michigan furniture

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.540
I want a bean bag chair let's say

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.640
and I want a wall clock

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.170
and ...

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.400
a let's say Michigan rug

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.790
and again I can just look at my shopping list
here

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.360
and it shows me everything

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.640
I can just go buy it if I want to

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.180
I can find a target store

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.770
you know either near me

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.939
or near my school cause i don't want to lug all that stuff back there

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.180
it's that simple

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.110
and again I can return to my app any time
I want

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.399
so that's

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.790
an example

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.110
of three ads

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.460
that are very easy to make

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.760
and in addition to ad agencies being able to
make these things

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.500
there are hundreds of thousands

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
of iPhone app developers that know how to make these things

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.990
so, we think this is going to be pretty exciting

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.880
emotion plus interactivity
