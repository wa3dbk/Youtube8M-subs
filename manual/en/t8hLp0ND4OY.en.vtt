00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.260
There’s been a very interesting bread baking
technique that’s been floating around the

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.579
internet since about 2007. It’s called No-knead
bread. It uses a very simple dough, a high

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.140
moisture content and it’s baked in a Dutch
oven. I would encourage you to watch the video

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.180
sometime, it’s very worthwhile. No-knead
bread, because of its simplicity and its great

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.579
flavor, is a very innovative technique compared
to modern bread baking methods, but I’ll

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.450
let you in on a little secret, now this is
not a new idea. In fact, no-knead breads have

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.739
been around for hundreds of years. Today I’m
going to show you how to do an 18th century

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.090
version of no-knead bread. We’re going to
bake it in an 18th century manner. We’re

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.430
going to use that old Dutch oven that so many
modern bakers are falling in love with.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.960
There are many different kinds of breads in
the 18th century. Some of them were baked

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.830
from very fine white flour, others made from
very course flour, still others were made

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.630
with wheat flour mixed with other grains,
but today we’re going to focus on a bread

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.110
known by the 18th century British and North
American colonists as French bread. Now when

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.140
I say French bread, what one might think is
a baguette, a batard, or a brioche. Most people

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.180
think of a French bread as a firm white bread
with an open crumb structure and a crispy crust.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.660
Numerous 18th century English cookbooks
contain recipes for French bread, but this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.920
French bread is nothing like the modern French
bread. Modern breads made with just flour,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.840
water, yeast and some salt. No, these French
breads in these 18th century cookbooks are

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.730
always made with milk and sometimes eggs and
butter. This English version of French bread

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.569
was made into loaves or into rolls. The rolls
were sometimes referred to as machete bread

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.129
which can mean the quality of a bread or sometimes
its size and shape. This French bread had

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.779
its crust either rasped away or chipped off
with a knife. 18th century French bread was

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:37.590
commonly used as an ingredient in other dishes.
The bread crust was often used in porridges,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.570
soups, even in other breads. Let’s make
some of this French bread.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.099
In a large bowl, let’s put 3 cups of flour,
bread flour or all-purpose flour will do,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.510
and about 1 ½ teaspoons of salt. That’s
it for the dry ingredients. Let’s do the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.549
wet ingredients. The original recipe calls
for barm and since nobody has barm, which

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.010
is the foam from the top of beer, instead
we’re going to make a substitute barm. Let’s

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.410
start with a half a cup of water. To that
I’m going to add a heaping tablespoon of flour

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.800
and then we need some yeast. We’re
going to use instant yeast. You need about

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.589
a quarter of a teaspoon to a half a teaspoon
and then we can stir this all together.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.840
Now for the rest of the wet ingredients. I’m
going to take just one egg white. Let me crack

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.889
this egg, and we’re going to add that to
¾ of a cup of milk and whisk that together.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.060
Now I’ve got here 2 tablespoons of melted
butter and I’m going to put that in with

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.469
2 egg yolks and we’re going to whisk those
together. Now let’s add this all together

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.919
and we can put in our barm mixture too, and
that’s it for our wet ingredients. Now we’ll

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.559
mix the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients
and I’ll mix them with these.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.839
As soon as the dough is formed and all the
flour is absorbed, it’s time to stop mixing.

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.349
Now one of the interesting things about the
18th century recipes is that they call for

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:25.189
this dough not to be kneaded. It makes a very
wet and sticky dough. They call it in the

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:32.930
recipe a very light paste. We’ll cover this
with a damp cloth and set it aside 12-24 hours.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.670
We could divide this dough up and put it into
smaller, well-floured bowls to make rolls.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.439
Now we’ve prepared this batch ahead of time
and it’s been rising about 18 hours so it’s

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.699
got a very nice spongy texture, so it looks
like it’s time to start preheating our Dutch oven.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.939
We’re going to be baking our bread in a
Dutch oven today. Baking bread in Dutch ovens

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.879
is very common in the 18th century although
our recipes don’t call for that specifically.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.060
We have this oven over the fire and it’s
warmed up. Don’t skimp on preheating this.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.180
You want it to be nice and hot when you get
started. I’m going to go ahead and sprinkle

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.180
some cornmeal into the bottom of that. This’ll
keep the loaf from sticking. Just a very thin

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.719
layer here looks good, and it should brown
up just a hair so you can see that the oven

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.539
is getting the right temperature.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
Now it’s time to look at our dough. Now
I’m going to turn this out onto a liberally

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.849
floured surface. Now your dough may be a lot
stickier than this, but that’s okay, but

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.330
it’ll help to flour your hands so that it
doesn’t stick, and now let’s pat this

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:54.330
down a little bit, let’s fold it once, let’s
fold it twice, three times, and one last time.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.780
Four times we’re going to fold this and
now let’s put it in our Dutch oven. You

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.480
want to keep a close eye on this while it’s
cooking. It’s going to take 25-30 minutes.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.700
You want it to be a nice deep golden brown
without burning on the bottom.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.380
If you’re going to bake this in your home oven, you’re going to want to set your oven to 450 degrees.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.680
There, that looks perfect.
I’m going to take it off. And there it is,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.210
an 18th century enriched no-knead bread. Something
that they called, in the time period, French

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.060
bread. We want to make sure that our bread
is completely cooled before we rasp or chip

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:49.039
off the outer crust. The crust and also the French bread as it is, is used in many 18th century recipes.
