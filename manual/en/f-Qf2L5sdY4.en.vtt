SPEAKER 1: I'd like to welcome
everyone to Back to Bellingham.

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:07.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.410
So, having that said,
welcome to parents, students,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.056
prospective students,
families, alumni, of course,

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:15.630
and community members.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.720
This is such a beautiful thing
to see such a strong community

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.250
here together.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.990
So, while we're
all here together,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.980
I kind of want to challenge
some current students

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.670
to go find some alumni.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.210
Ask them questions, ask
them about the history

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.280
of Western, things that
they've seen, and just inquire.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.440
Ask them questions.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.570
I'm challenging you
current students.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.060
And as far as you
alumni, I challenge

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.120
you to find some
current students,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.590
or these lovely
individuals up here,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.840
and ask us questions
regarding what's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.420
going on Western, what
are some problems, what

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.750
are some things that you're
just generally curious about.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.250
Inquire.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.789
I'm challenging you.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.035
