00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.830
So Mortal Kombat is a really interesting story
about the entire eco system.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.520
And it’s an interesting story from an IP
perspective as well as from a creative perspective

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.520
as well.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.070
The director Kevin Tancharoen, he originally
put a short video of Mortal Kombat – a short

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.660
that he had based on this concept he had of
an origins story, a live action origins story.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.760
From that you know, there was this concept
of creating a web series around this origins

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.680
story and we saw it as a 10 episode season,
a 90-minute film.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.810
And that web series was put up, you know,
again financed by Warner Brothers and it was

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.940
put up in our series and, you know, blew up
in terms of numbers and had over 50 million

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.150
views and then recently they announced at
Warner Brothers new line that they’re going

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:01.210
to make a theatrical motion picture with him
as director and his origin story as the basis

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.210
of that thing.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.970
And so one of the great things about this
is it shows this model of short film shown

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.170
on YouTube drove a bunch of numbers and then
it went to the next level which was a web

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.350
series and then after that it went to a movie,
right?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.390
So now you’re almost seeing kind of a web
process attached to content, right, as opposed

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.210
to let’s go spend $150 million dollars and
pray, right?

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.860
You can actually – you actually are building
an audience while you’re going, right and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.200
if people are clamoring now for a Mortal Kombat
movie and it’s really the same guy.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.310
Same group of actors, same creative person
that went from the short to the web series

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
to the movie.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.050
And I think that’s a really interesting
model from a – for creators to change their

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.620
careers or enable their careers and they can
be from anywhere in the world to do this obviously.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.290
And it’s also a really great model for content
creators to creating new IP or driving an

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.670
older IP like Mortal Kombat back into the
mainstream, so I think that’s an interesting

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.670
story.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.900
And in turns out also that Episode 1 of Mortal
Kombat was competitive with the first episode

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.950
of True Blood and you know, things like Walking
Dead and things that are on television.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.200
So one of the things that we’re doing is
really starting to say is the type of numbers

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.160
we’re generating are generating numbers
that are competitive with the type of demographic

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.220
programming you see in television in the United
States and that’s going to only get bigger

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.400
because we’re an international brand, right?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.370
We release Mortal Kombat everywhere in the
world at the same time, right?

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.600
So there’s a really interesting dynamic
in this kind of new wave of programming.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.569
New wave of video brand.
