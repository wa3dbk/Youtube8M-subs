00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:34.120
Running rampant in the sleepless forest, an assasin from hell's depths rolled into the moonlight

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:44.320
Decomposing demonstration, though I search for my place as I drag my chains along to nowhere in the night,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:53.470
You pass by without looking at me once, slipping right through me

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:03.370
Broken apart, with a shaky voice, I call to you; I'm right here!

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:13.470
My old reckless self is like an idiot to me now, sorrowful wings melt under the moon

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:33.770
My sleepless wings shudder, the cross on my back burns in the moonlight

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.720
Artificially resonating deeply, hallucinating angels ironically

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.820
thunder leads to the boundary line, eloping in the pitch-dark night

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:53.720
I glance aside at you as you pass me by and voice out to you without my voice

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:02.720
The white moon rises in the indigo sky even if this body of mine melts away...

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.620
Broken apart, with a shaky voice, I call to you; I'm right here!

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:22.720
My old reckless self is like an idiot to me now, sorrowful wings melt under the moon

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:43.970
If I could trade anything for you to hear me; I'd let go of these wings

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:54.670
Tears dripping down, with a shaky voice, I call to you; I'm right here!

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:04.970
My old worthless self is like an idiot to me now, sorrowful tears spill under the moon

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.420
Though empty before, with a shaky voice, now, I'll always call your name

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:24.570
My old reckless self is like an idiot to me now, sorrowful wings melt under the moon
