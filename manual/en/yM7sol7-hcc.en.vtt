00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.660
Am I a candidate for Hairline Lowering FUE?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.660
How much would it cost?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.360
As you can tell by the photos, I have a receding
hairline.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.270
My expectations with surgery would be to have
my hairline lowered to give me a more youthful

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.270
look.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.530
I am 22 years old.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.160
If it means anything, my hair is straight
being that I’m West Indian.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.120
How much would this cost and is it possible?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.220
Thank you for your question.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.640
You’re 22 years old and you’ve submitted
photos and asking a question about whether

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.140
or not you’re a candidate for FUEs or follicular
unit extraction transplant surgery.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.850
You explained that your hair is straight related
to your West Indian origin.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.930
So to answer a question like this, first,
the point of understanding whether or not

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.030
you’re a hair transplant candidate has to
begin with the question about your recession

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.930
or receding of your hairline.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.250
So you’ve noticed at a very young age that
your hairline is receding so the question

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.600
here is where will that hairline be three
years from now, five years from now or ten

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330
years from now.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.950
One of the question is always raised about
surgery is how many grafts can you actually

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.740
place or what the more important question
is how much hair do you have to graft.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.300
You see when you are young and you have some
receding technically it’s not difficult

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.700
to address that relatively small amount of
recession with transplant but you have to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.500
remember that the donor area, the area where
you transplant from is limited.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.010
Think of the baldest man you’ve ever seen
and in the medical field we refer to that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.310
as Norwood 7 which is a very thin rim of hair.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.620
That rim of hair is referred to as genetically
resistant.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.250
That means that no matter how old they get
that hair will always be there.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.240
Hair transplant is the selective use of this
genetically resistant area and transplanting

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.230
it to other areas.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.020
So which means that there is a limit to how
much hair you have available to transplant.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.230
It’s like having only so much money in the
bank; you can’t use it all up because you

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.360
may need the money later.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.630
So look at your family history, see what other
male members of the family whether it’s

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.750
father, uncles, cousins or etc.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.760
What is their hair loss pattern like?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:22.540
Within a family, hair loss is not determine
by any specific pattern such as dominant or

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.230
recessive or the common myth of maternal uncle,
it’s not the case it’s variable.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.860
Even within siblings it can be variable, one
brother can have a lot of hair, and another

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.700
brother can have thinning hair or hair loss
at a relatively young age.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.400
So think about the future before you address
the amount of recession you have now.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.140
Now, in thinking about other options besides
transplant in the United States there are

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.340
two drugs that are approved for hair loss
one is minoxidil which is a topic solution

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.160
or foam and the other is finasteride which
is an oral medication with blocks an enzyme

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.870
called 5-alpha reductase.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.320
5-alpha reductase blocks the conversion of
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:23.259
A specific subgroup of men with male pattern
hair loss have what’s called androgen sensitive

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.940
hair follicles.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.150
Those androgen sensitive hair follicles will
thin in response to circulating dihydrotestosterone

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.910
or DHT.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.280
What that means is that by taking finasteride
you reduce DHT thereby restoring the functionality

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.070
of hair follicle.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.370
The problem is, there are two problems really.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.270
One is a significant number of men do not
respond to finasteride.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.690
Many men have come to us for hair transplant
or hair loss solutions because they were taking

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.420
finasteride and they lost hair in spite of
it.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:11.810
A more well-known issue right now is that
there is a question about the long-term sexual

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.820
side effects of taking Finasteride.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.850
This has led in our practice for a lot of
men to come in who are in their 20’s or

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.320
30’s to seek an alternative.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.250
What we’ve developed in our practice is
this alternative that we call Hair Regeneration.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:35.600
And what it is, is the application of the
material called extra cellular matrix combined

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.650
in a specific way with platelet rich plasma
and what we have done over the past several

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.630
years with hundreds and hundreds of patients
coming from all over the world we’ve developed

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:56.290
our own method of formulation and customization
based on a large clinical pool of data.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.110
So what we do is actually a one-time injection
that appears to last up to five years, up

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.750
to this point and has been a remarkable benefit
for men who don’t want to take Propecia

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.090
or finasteride, or men who are taking it and
are still losing hair.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.160
It also has proven to be beneficial for female
pattern hair loss.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:30.180
So this means that when you are considering
a solution for your receding hair line think

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.730
about your future, think about where your
hairline is going and what can happen when

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.760
you are 25 or 30 years old.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:47.300
Also think about medical options as opposed
to surgery and then consider some of these

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.600
newer developing treatments like ours called
Hair Regeneration, the use of extra cellular

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.990
matrix to help restore the functionality of
the hair follicle.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:06.630
The problem with this is that hair research
has not revealed the critical mechanism of

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.900
hair growth to the level that we understand
everything about it so we’ve been very fortunate

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.850
that clinically found a material that was
already approved for wound healing that we’ve

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.419
been able to now help a lot of patients who
have male pattern and female pattern hair

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:23.419
loss.

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.730
So this is something else than you can explore
as an option.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.230
And with that being said, I hope this was
helpful and thank you for your question.
