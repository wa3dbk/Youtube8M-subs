Hi, this is John and is this clip we'll be
laying out and drilling our stud holes. Now

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.119
since we are building a coat rack and coats
can get pretty heavy, we have six hooks, so

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.570
we could feasibly have six different coats
hanging on our coat rack. What we need to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.429
do when we install it is to install it into
studs in the wall and this is going to prevent

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.220
it from pulling out of the wall with the weight
of the coats. Now essentially what we're going

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.760
to be doing to install this, is to we're going
to take a long screw and we're going screw

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.480
it right through our project into a stud in
the wall. However, we also want to make our

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.480
project look good, so what we're going to
do is countersink our screws and we're going

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.940
to install these buttons on top of those countersunk
screws and that's going to cover those up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.690
and give it a really nice finished look. Now
first we're going to measure the distance

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:08.250
between each peg, which is about six inches,
and we're going to come in and make a mark

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.110
halfway between those pegs. We're also going
to make a mark the other way at the halfway

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:27.290
mark; this is going to give us a little crosshair
for where we should drill for our screws to

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.580
go. Next we're going to drill a pilot hole
through our crosshairs, all the way through

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:53.950
our project and just make sure you don't drill
a hole through the table below it.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.310
Next, we're going to be drilling our countersink
hole with a three-eighths inch drill bit and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:14.310
we're just going to drill that down, oh about
three-eights of an inch.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.260
Then we can go ahead and test our buttons
in those holes that we've just drilled and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.459
that looks pretty nice.
