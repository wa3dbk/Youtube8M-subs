00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.279
Today on this 2012 GMC Sierra, were going
to install part number HL56801 from Husky

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.279
Liners.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.620
These are front mud inaudible.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.140
Our first step is to install the inaudible
protection film.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.340
This is installed it along the edge right
here.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.680
Well clean off the body work area based on
the solution of 1 pint water with four drops

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.910
of liquid dish washing detergent.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.280
Take the film, peel it loose back a little
bit, and keep everything wet.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.770
Slide it into place and this bottom edge will
go all the way to the back edge of the body

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.420
work.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.399
Once youre happy with the placement of it,
use a squeegee to get rid of all the water

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.030
and bubbles underneath the protective film.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.339
We maintain at least 1/8 of an inch distance
between the corner and the edge of the protective

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:50.339
film.

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.940
Well go ahead and just let it dry on its own.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:02.350
Now with the protective film dried up, well
go ahead 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:20.310
and remove the factory 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:02:20.250
hardware for 
the inner inaudible liner.
