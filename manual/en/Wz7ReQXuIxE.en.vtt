Hey what's up ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.490
This is David Benjamin from HealthyWildAndFree.com,
today i'm going to share with you some amazing

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.240
health benefits of the almighty cucumber.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.490
Now before I get started with the video today
I just want to clear up a rumor you know,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.119
we've all maybe hopefully possibly seen veggie
tales before, and there's that character he's

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.980
larry the cucumber, he kind of hops like this,
he's like uhhh i'm larry the cucumber.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.950
And you're like ohh that's such a cute cucumber.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.280
You go to the store and see the cucumber sitting
there and you're like "I don't want to eat

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.310
larry, that would be so rude" and you don't
want your kids to think your kids to think

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.510
you're eating larry.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.700
I don't want my future kids to eat.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.520
SO we can eat cucumbers and get the health
benefits from it, tomatoes too, bob the tomato

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.039
if you've seen veggie tales, it's completely
irrelevant.

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.559
Anyway, i'm going to get on with this video.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.550
Cucumbers are amazingly beneficial in so many
different ways and they aren't utilized enough

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.460
for health and vitality reasons.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.159
The first reason they're so beneficial is
because they're 96, remember that number 96%

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.340
water content.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.549
Meaning if this cucumber is 1 pound, 96% of
that 16 ounces is water, so i'm basically

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.360
eating water, which is kind of weird scientifically
and philosophically but that's what you're

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.930
doing, you're eating a lot of water.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.150
So it's very hydrating to your body, and hydrating
your body is very important for detoxification.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.130
It's very important for your digestive system,
it's very important for your brain, your cardiovascular

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.509
system, it's important for everything.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.000
Hydrating runs the ship, the ship being you,
the vessel, coming out of the womb, the vessel,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.310
get it? maybe later.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.590
Anyways, so cucumbers are also rich in many
minerals that are beneficial for health and

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.890
wellbeing but also specifically beneficial
for the skin.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.229
That's probably why they slice up those cucumbers
and throw them over your eyes when you're

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.719
at the spa, if you've ever been at the spa,
i've kind of been but not really it was kind

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.729
of an easter thing but it wasn't an easter
thing, it was a retreat spa, I didn't get

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.349
cucumbers in the eyes because it was Costa
Rican and I don't think they do that there.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.520
Anyway, it's beneficial because it contains
magnesium, potassium, calcium and silicon,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.770
it also contains silica which is beneficial
for your hair and your nails.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.040
Now you can see where I got that sexy hair
from.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.910
It's also beneficial because it contains vitamins
A, B and C. yeah, ab and c, it's like the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.680
ABC's, easy as 1, 2, 3.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.130
Vitamin a is beneficial for your eyesight,
amongst other things, vitamin B is beneficial

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.750
for energy levels and just energy production
within the body, and vitamin c is beneficial

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.180
for repairing the body once again, your hair
skin and nails.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.610
So the minerals and the vitamins kind of work
together with the hydrating water that is

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.920
in the content of the cucumber to really benefit
your hair, skin and nails.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.010
The other cool thing about it is cucumbers
are actually beneficial for reducing uric

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.710
acid and uric acid is an acid that causes
over calcification.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.370
So, if you have kidney stones or arthritis,
that is a cause of over calcification, meaning

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.180
you've had to much coagulated calcium in your
diet and not enough magnesium, potassium and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.519
phosphorus to kind of balance those minerals
out and that causes calcification, your kidneys

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.780
don't do nothing but clog with calcium.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.720
Arthritis which gives you stiff joints which
makes you do the robot, you can't be fluid

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.180
and flexible, you don't want to have that.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.659
So eat more cucumbers, cucumbers are also
beneficial for your cholesterol.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.590
They actually help to lower the quote on quote
'bad' cholesterol.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.650
as well.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.700
Beyond that they are also beneficial for your
blood sugar levels, it's actually beneficial

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.060
for cells within the pancreas that produce
insulin so there's a hormone it helps create

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.650
the hormone that releases insulin within your
pancreas so cucumbers are great for diabetics,

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.850
people with arthritis, kidney stones, and
it's just an overall beautifying vegetable

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.410
containing many minerals, magnesium, calcium,
potassium, silicon and silica amongst vitamins

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.540
a, b, and c as well.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.919
It's very beneficial for your health and wellbeing,
you should include it in your diet daily if

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:35.919
you can.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.620
If you can add it to salads, juice cucumbers,
juicing cucumbers is great with spinach, romaine,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.540
and celery because they are very alkalizing,
very hydrating and just very beneficial for

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.540
the body overall.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.810
One more quick tip, the skin or the peel of
the cucumber is what's richest in silica content

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.680
so make sure to eat the peel, I know some
people peel the skin and they don't eat it.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.350
You're missing out on all that beneficial
silica that's good for your hair and your

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.350
nails.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.956
Don't you want to be shining like a boss?
and silica is great for your cardiovascular

00:05:05.956 --> 00:05:14.100
system, so you can be like a super athlete
with great hair, nails at the same time.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:27.460
All by eating cucumbers, so, just break it
open and crunch, crunch, crunch, take a bite.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.280
see you in the next video.
