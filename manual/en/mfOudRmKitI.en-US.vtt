Hi guys! Welcome everyone in this my new video of IXUS1000

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.160
 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.600
That´s bike of my friend Adam.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.480
I would show some upgrades on this bike that he buyed 5 days ago.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.280
Originally, Ninja 300 came with 140 back tires from tailand marc IRC. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:31.420
Here you have Michelin Pilot 170!!!

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.120
These nice "Racing " stripes" was also put by first owner.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.480
This bike on odometer has in this moment 1200km.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.440
This mudguards is also upgrade, because the original color is black.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.320
One more upgrade is a "no-brand" fender eliminator. No brand but for now looks god, no?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.600
In my other video I speak more about this upgrade of exaust IXIL55x that suit this Ninja 300.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.580
We saw a lot of exhaust for Ninja 300, but I think that this one have the best  look and very nice sound.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.980
IXIL it´s a spanish brand founded in 1955(that´s why 55) in Barcelona.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.220
Front tires it´s also upgrade.

00:01:43.993 --> 00:01:46.753
One again "Racing"stripes.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.220
And for now are all of our upgrades.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.440
Now, Adam will turn one round for we could listen a bit in the open ambient.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.900
Before this, he want to show this nice digital display.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.960
More? So now maybe closer!

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.660
