00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.800
Francis Lawrence directed this science fiction
action film that flew past $600 million in

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.420
proceeds only a month after its November 21,
2014 release.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.320
The clumsily titled adventure is an adaptation
of the first half of Suzzane Collins' final

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.960
novel in the best-selling "Hunger Games" franchise.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.300
Shamelessly, the narrative as been stretched
and broken-up into two back-to-back features.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.850
It was frustrating and annoying when Harry
Potter did it four years ago, and now it seems

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.970
to be a recurring trend in Hollywood.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.120
Even still, this 123-minute story is the strongest
in the saga yet, as we once again witness

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.850
brave characters in a ruined and complicated
dystopia.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.120
The PG-13 rated plot follows Jennifer Lawrence
as she pivots from gladiator survivor to leading

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.510
a massive rebellion as the face of their propaganda
campaign.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.749
In fantasy-built worlds like this one, having
a strong and relatable protagonist to experience

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.629
the emotional developments with is paramount;
and the young Oscar winner is - as always

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.420
- absolutely fantastic.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.719
Balancing the duties of a spokeswoman with
her love and compassion for others is the

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.420
most interesting dynamic explored in the series
so far; and the narrative is much stronger

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.420
because of it.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.619
When she fiercely threatens the evil Donald
Sutherland, "If we burn, you burn with us!",

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.170
it's hard not to get excited for the fury
that's unleashed next.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.400
Josh Huterson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson,
Elizabeth Banks, Phillip Seymour Hoffman,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.220
Julianne Moore, Stanley Tucci, and Jeffrey
Wright all make return appearances here: but

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.060
few of them have any real purpose; with Hemsworth
seeing the biggest bump in responsibilities.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.510
There seems to be some foolish, and unwritten
rule that says if a character exists in the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.470
book, it needs to be in the movie too: when
in reality, this picture could have been greatly

00:01:26.470 --> 00:02:01.560
improved if half of these players were removed,
or combined.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.180
After two repetitive and slower movies, this
third outing is a breath of well-paced fresh

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.950
air... picking up immediately after the events
of "Catching Fire" with an exciting action

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.200
sequence amongst the rubble of District 12.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.760
When Lawrence primes her arrow for an anti-aircraft
shot; time slows down, and the music fades

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.760
away... resulting in a powerful moment.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.170
The nauseating shaky-cam of its predecessors
is replaced with lots of these longer and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.000
steady shots that really let the action sequences
build tension and deliver payoffs.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.040
Unfortunately, the story never quite turns
a corner, as it is missing that crucial climatic

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.150
final act, which is still a year away.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.800
The visual effects and set design however
are well-done and interesting.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.049
James Newton Howard once again provides the
soundtrack, which is at its best during the

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.980
higher-octane moments, like when Lawrence
and friends are scrambling to evacuate a stairwell

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.700
before a nearby airlock closes.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.180
While some of the developments may be hard
to believe, this picture is a solid improvement

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.529
worth seeing at least once.

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:51.849
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1" is
a fascinating drama with excellent acting

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.370
and action that's disappointingly cut-short.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.030
And here's your thoughts from the YouTube
comments.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:10.540
Mixed opinions on this, while most enjoyed
it - some were more critical, citing the lack

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.090
of action and the cliffhanger ending as its
biggest flaws, you scored this a SEVEN.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.150
Finally removed from the contrivances of the
first two installments, I felt this was a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.769
superior follow-up, and a GREAT picture.
