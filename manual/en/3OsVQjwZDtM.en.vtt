Happy Easter everyone i recently met the lovely Elise from

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.000
mycupcakeaddiction

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.859
she makes totally awesome cupcake and cake pop tutorials she is so cool i love her energy

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.089
I did her nails while she was here in Melbourne so

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.019
if you guys want to see a sneak preview

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.459
of my next week's design

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:23.680
go and watch her easter videos and tell her I sent you :)

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.260
without further a due here comes my pocket animal

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.260
nail art tutorial

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
as always start with base coat to protect your nails then a layer or two of a base color

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.600
of your choice

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.560
use a lighter shade from the same color family and draw a semi circle on the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.560
tip of the nail

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.350
I just used the brush that came with the bottle

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.990
grab a detail brush and line all the edges to frame the design

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.330
again i'm keeping with the same color family here and used a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.330
darker green polish

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.790
to make the bottom section look more like a pocket i'm going to add in

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.640
some stitched lines to decorate around it 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.100
now it's time for the cute little pocket animals

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.720
since Easter is coming up I decided to go with a bunny rabbit

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.610
I did come up with a few alternatives for different kind of animals

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.500
you can put in your pocket pocket so it's up to you if you want to occupy all your

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.370
fingers with cute animals or you can do
an accent nail with one animal of your choice

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.370
then just have a stitched outline for the rest of your nails to compliment the accent nail 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.090
so once you've drawn in the basic shape of the animals

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.509
color in the ears and dot in the eyes don't forget to add a little 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.299
button on top of the pocket

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.319
for the little kitty design i just changed the shape of the head

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.319
and added in some tiny pointy ears
instead

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:31.409
i also decided to draw in a tail because it looks so much cuter

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.749
and if any of you have seen my marie design this looks kind of like the baby

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.249
version of it

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:44.249
same color and everything

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.659
and then for the little cheeky monkey i decided to  go with the color scheme from one of

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.679
my older videos i did of the morality monkeys

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:59.079
if you wanna go visit that tutorial you can click on the annotation or find the link 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.629
in the description box below tell me
which monkey is your favorite so

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.579
i know if my skills have improved

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.189
after three years

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.549
and then there is the little pinky

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.609
since the background-color i went with is blue it reminded me of Dumbo

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:17.889
for some reason

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.139
so i decided to draw in an elephant

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.709
and then after it came out i thought

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.650
why does this look familiar

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.389
then i realized the colors looks kind of similar to my twilight kitty nail design

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.139
yeah so i recycled some color schemes in this video so

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.979
I hope you don't mind

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.229
anyways so when you're finally done add a layer of top coat to protect 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.060
your masterpiece

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.439
