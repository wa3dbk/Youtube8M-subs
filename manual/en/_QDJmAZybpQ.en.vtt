00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.510
yeah I'm going to do a little review
about something that maybe other folks

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.880
don't know is out there and that is
glasses safety glasses you know I've

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
been kind of pushing my look in my shop
these are my just brief my throw around

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.130
reading glasses I buy the little Walmart
cheapies and when I break them up we'll

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.830
buy another pair but you know they're
not safety glasses and they're not big

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.719
enough to cover your eyes from flying
debris

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.000
and I've been trust in my eyes to them
for too long pushing my luck so I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.289
decided to look for some safety glasses
that have readers built into them

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.030
bifocals if you will and I found some at
a old Phil supply company and they work

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.190
fine but the diopters the little things
that magnify are so low at the bottom of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.020
the glasses that there's just no way you
can comfortably hold your head and look

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.100
through them I mean you got to push
these way up the bridge of your nose and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.570
then hold your head up and look down at
a steep angle that's just uncomfortable

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:29.929
and I was at Lowe's and I found another
pair of two and a half's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.360
and the diopters are way bigger way
bigger is if I can

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.930
catch it and a light just right maybe
this away

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.230
and they're still not perfect but
they're a lot better than these and then

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.920
online I found safety glasses that are
the entire glass is two and a half those

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.770
are perfect and perfect while I was
looking for these what bran disease

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.250
these are

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:26.239
pier MX p why are a Emmie experiments
these are really good classes really

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.510
good and they're really big and I the
quality of the class the optical quality

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.760
is really good they're well built too
and they were like I don't know and then

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.790
these are just regular old safety
glasses these are genuine

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.040
harley-davidson safety glasses that I
used to wear on my motorcycle at night

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.579
because even though I had a windshield
bugs and rocks and stuff would find

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.940
their way around the windshield up into
my eyes so I used to wear these at night

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.049
but they don't have diopters on them so
what I also found was this thing called

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:12.220
hydro tag and there are these little
stick on diopters

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.459
that you stick on with water and you put
them where where they do you the most

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.180
benefit I haven't tried them yet but I'm
fixing to so let me shut you off and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.000
I'll put these on and see how they how
they work well they don't work on these

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.019
because the glass is too curved but plus
it's pretty damn cold out here you know

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.260
these are really they're hard to bend
and I don't want to bend it too hard

00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:00.400
because I don't want Mariko so I like
the idea

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.880
but I would need a pair of glasses like
this with a with a flat lens for it to

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.420
work so I guess I'm just gonna have to
hang on to these genuine harley-davidson

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:27.840
made in China safety glasses
harley-davidson say made in China and I

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.820
don't know what I'll do with them
probably not a we're gonna have another

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.750
bike but in the meantime I'm gonna be
looking for a big pair of safety glasses

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.060
like this I like the kind that cover
your whole eye and have side shields and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.680
I'll try these out in the meantime I
just wanted you to know that there are

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.080
options safety glass options just in
case you didn't know they make them with

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.470
diopters and this company called pyramix
makes them where the entire eyepiece is

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.360
the magnification that you need alright
I'll put this up and thanks for watching
