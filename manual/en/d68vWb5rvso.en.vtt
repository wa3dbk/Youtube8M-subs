T. P. Jagger here with The 3-Minute Writing
Teacher. Today we're going to look at something

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.580
a lot of writers have been told: "Show,
don't tell."

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.000
When you "show, don't tell" effectively,
your readers can form a stronger mental image.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.060
Basically, what you're doing is you're
taking what's in your mind, and you're

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.119
drawing it in the mind of your readers.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.119
So is a character angry? Show, don't tell.
Is a character surprised? Show, don't tell.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.239
Excited? You get the idea. . . .

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.050
But what does "show, don't tell" really
mean? And how can you work that in to your

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.109
writing? Let's check it out.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.749
For today's writing tip, I'm going to
focus on showing a character's emotions.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.760
And you only need three things that basically
every character you ever have is going to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.760
bring to your story. Because they all bring
their faces, their hands, and their feet.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.390
For today, we're going to focus on an angry
character, and we're going to call him Bob.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.329
And I could just take the easy way out as
a writer and tell you something like this:

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:21.329
"Bob was angry." But, you know, for my
readers, that really doesn't help them picture

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.890
in their minds what I want them to see. And
so I have to consider what is it that I see

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.840
and what is it about Bob's face, his hands,
and his feet that could show the readers what

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.780
I want them to imagine as they read.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.700
And so first I have to picture this in my mind,
and it might look something like this.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.890
Now I take some of those face, hands, and
feet details, and I add them into my writing,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.820
and I create a couple of sentences to show
the reader that Bob is angry.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.820
So with those sentences . . . is Bob angry?
You bet. Did I have to tell you? No. And

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.000
my writing was stronger because of that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.640
Now we're going to try this a little bit
differently, and I want you to see what you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.300
can "show, don't tell."

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.370
We're going to take that same scene with
Bob. This time though, he's got a bit of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.390
a different reaction.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.300
All right. Go ahead. Try it. Pick a few face,
hands, feet details from that video and describe them.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.200
Show Bob's emotion.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.940
Now, as you do your own writing, look for
opportunities to "show, don't tell."

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.570
You've got your characters faces, their
hands, their feet. You don't have to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.230
use all three every time, but they're there
if you need them. And with Bob in that last scene?

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.300
What was he feeling? I'll never tell.
