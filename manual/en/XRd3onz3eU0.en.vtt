Where I Live
Sara Anderson

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.910
Hi I'm Sara Anderson

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.250
and if I have an antique shop in Sonoma
California and I was very drawn to this home it's my

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.809
favorite home in all of Sonoma. It's one of 
oldest homes in Sonoma,

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.299
I think one of the first five that 
was ever built here from eighteen seventy five

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:22.579
we knew we wanted to maintain the integrity
of the house and not make too many the changes

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.249
because

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.390
it's an old victorian home and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.840
I wanted to keep it as it was originally.
Well the overall focus in setting up the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.860
home was to make it very warm and inviting
like a farm house

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.320
and just creating an environment that that
people felt comfortable that they walked in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.749
and sort of felt like they were getting a bear 
hug when they walked into the house, just cozy.

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.510
So the entertaining space that I

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.710
find very interesting is the dining
room

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.090
because we have a long trestle table in there 
and it's very narrow

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.580
and when I used to come and visit my friend who was the previous owner

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.310
she would have all of her neighbors sitting around the table
and it was just a very fun gathering and I tried

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.600
to replicate that here in this house

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.850
but of course the kitchen everybody's always
in the kitchen so

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.310
I try to find other areas in the house where I can you know, 
have cocktails and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450
appetizers and things but everybody always
wants to follow me back into the kitchen and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.950
it's a nice space because it's pretty large
and there's a big island in the middle also

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.600
I I don't mind

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.780
well everybody who walks through this house says you need
to change everything now that you have a child

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.460
and I keep thinking well

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.630
I, that's going to be very complicated because
I like the space that I live in right now

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.690
where my husband and I spend our time now
in the television room has a nice cushy carpet

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.120
there really isn't anything that needs to be baby-proofed in that 
room and I feel that we'll spend a lot of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.580
our time in there. I had lunch with a friend
and she had a dream about the baby's room, and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.090
it included black and white photographs
the famous baseball players and great thinkers of the day

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.110
so my husband's just so happy to have
a collection

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.030
of black and white photographs of famous
ballplayers and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.980
a few great thinkers of the day like
winston churchill and JFK

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.290
my husband thought it would be a great idea
to put it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.250
chalk boards above each of the photographs
and put

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.339
different words that were inspirational for
a child like

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.879
courage and

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.079
strength so that was very fun

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:21.029
When Pottery Barn was here they would just recreate spaces
and after seeing the photos

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:26.109
behind the camera it was just amazing the transformation
that they could put this house through

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.809
and it was

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.359
an enjoyable experience all the way around

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.689
the one thing that really sticks out in
my mind when they were working upstairs and

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.759
one of the bedrooms that

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.449
I had finished but

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.319
when they took all the furniture out and put it into

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.599
another bedroom and put the pottery barn furniture
in they had a wonderful bed and a desk

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.340
and I looked at way the room was situated 
and I thought that's how this room

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.759
should be situated

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:57.259
so I was just about to leave town and I talked
to one of the stylists and I said

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.019
when you put the room back together because
they always put it exactly as you had it before

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.150
I said when you put the room back together will you just

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.530
be creative and put it back however you think
that it should be

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.529
and so I came back home from my vacation

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:16.019
and I was so pleasantly surprised because the room was
perfect I just love the way they would layer all

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.139
these interesting objects from a throw to plants and
things on the table that sort of brought all of

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.790
the whole scene of

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.619
the interior together

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.749
and it was very interesting to me because
that's the way I like to approach my own home

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.010
and have layers of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.709
interesting things that mean something
to me

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.629
and just make feel like it's been lived in forever

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
