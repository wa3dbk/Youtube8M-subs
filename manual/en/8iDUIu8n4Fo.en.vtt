Hi, I'm Rokosz, your digital lifestyle expert,
and I'm going to show you how to get your

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.100
music and videos onto your iPhone. The first
thing you gotta' keep in mind for transferring

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.630
your music, your videos, your podcasts, it's
all using; ringtones, it uses iTunes as the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.350
porthole. So, we're going to go inside of
iTunes and I'll show you how that works. Here,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.570
we can see we've got a little representation
of my music library here. What we're going

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.550
to do is go to the Devices and iPhone, and
you're going to see that most of the settings

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.500
for doing that are right here. So, we've got
Music okay, and if you've, if you have Music

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.960
Videos associated with it you simply click
on Include music videos. Those will also appear

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.320
in there. If you're trying to save space deselecting
that is obviously a prudent move. Now, over

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.450
to video; you'll have the choice of, then
you can see exactly what you're trying to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.530
do here. We want to sync all unwatched episodes
of in this case Selected TV shows. I've chosen

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.190
to sync the HBO original series Oz, or Studio
60 On the Sunset Strip. We can do that there

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.400
or All TV shows. Now, depending on your library
that could mean a lot of space, so we're going

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.570
to go back here to Selected, Selected TV shows.
I'm going to deselect Studio 60. Rented movies

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.440
can be transferred if you have them, and then
regular movies over here. We could watch Hot

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.110
Rod or The West Wing. See, I have it selected
to sync, but I haven't any, I haven't decided

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.020
to select anything. I'm going to throw that,
and that's a West Wing, an old television

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.550
show, and Hot Rod, a major motion picture,
some TV shows here, and I simply hit Apply.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.280
After I hit apply right now sync in progress.
Television shows, major motion picture, music

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.350
videos right now being copied right into my
iPhone. In just a few minutes I can pull it

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.520
off the cradle, walk out, do what I please,
watch one of my favorite TV shows, watch a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.219
movie, listen to music, watch music videos.
That's so awesome; it just is! I'm Rokosz,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.629
your digital lifestyle expert, sayin' stream
ya' later.
