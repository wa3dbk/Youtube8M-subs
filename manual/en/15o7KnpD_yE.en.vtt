00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.660
FREE Scrivener Cheat Sheets

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.070
If you are just starting out in Scrivener you may find yourself forgetting

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.090
some of the technical terms for things 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.179
and where they are, and then you end up 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:15.670
with post it notes all over the place.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.029
for instance the editor in Scrivener

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.350
it's not the kind person who fixes your
manuscript once you finish writing

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.599
the editor is this bit here where you do all your writing

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.340
and view your documents.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.399
even if you've been using Scrivener for
a while 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.300
you can never remember how to do those things

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.870
that you only need to do once or
twice ever --

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.239
like resetting your spelling from

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.690
US English to UK english for that one agent.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.010
Or getting the pilcrow symbol to show up on the page

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.530
so that you know how many carriage returns you have between

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.820
the top of your page and your text.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.909
For instance, here where I want to line my dedication up

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.820
perfectly with the copyright page of my paperback novel.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.799
And if you are anything like me you drive yourself crazy because you imagine

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.460
everyone else can magically remember these things,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.130
but I assure you, I have taught enough people to know that mostly they can’t.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.650
and it is such an energy
suck if you try to work that way

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.880
So here are some cheat sheets I made for my writing gang to help jog their memories.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 I hope they will help you too. 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.950
There’s a picture of the screen with arrows pointing out where the main tools are

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.860
and what the areas of the interface are called and what happens inside them.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.260
Don’t worry, I have made one set for Mac users

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.110
and another for Windows users, so you won’t have to wonder

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.140
what that would look like in your version of scrivener. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.450
Then there’s a section on Customizing and Navigation via the Main Menu

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.250
and another reminding you of the most important

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.090
keyboard shortcuts if that is the way you like to work.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.610
Of course a lot of these instructions and keyboard shortcuts are different

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.590
in Windows than they are on a mac,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.019
so be sure to download the correct cheat sheets for the platform you are using.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.970
I have also put together a set of cheat sheets

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.940
that show you how to customize your toolbar and what all the tools do.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.640
There are some great tools there so have a good look at all of them

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.260
incase they will be useful to you but Scrivener is a huge application

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.620
that is also for technical writers, screen writers and academics 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.750
who use different tools than you do. 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.920
Not only are there too many tools to fit on the toolbar,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.950
but you don’t want to clutter up your toolbar with the ones you seldom or never use.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.680
If you are on a Mac,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.140
you just drag the ones you want up into your toolbar and click on done.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.709
In the windows version of scrivener you transfer them to your toolbar

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.439
via the ‘Available Toolbar Actions’ box.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.459
 Sorry, my filming software is on my Mac

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.849
so I can’t show you this in action,

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.780
But don’t worry I have added instructions right here on the cheat sheet.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.879
Simply choose the tools you like best for the way you like to work.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.700
 If you find you move files up and down in the binder a lot 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.680
choose the move file buttons. My personal favorites are

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.780
the ‘copy format’ and ‘past format’ tools because I am constantly moving text

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.859
 from one document to another and I use different fonts or different colors 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.790
to remind me what draft a document is in. 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.090
My favorite tool to add to my toolbar

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.889
when I am working with windows

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.000
the ‘Options tool’ which takes me directly to the ‘options dialogue box’

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.750
where you can adjust such things as the appearance of the interface,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.959
text formatting, navigation etc. and choose where to backup your projects. 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.979
So there you go.  If you don’t want to be like the post it lady,

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.540
 keep your cheat sheets close at hand.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.849
Print them out and pin them up behind your computer monitor,

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.099
or better yet, leave them in PDF format on your desktop 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.650
where you can open them and do a quick search for the thing you want

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.199
by holding down command (control on a PC)

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:24.199
and hitting the f key which will highlight what you are looking for.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.220
From your pdf you can also link directly to the official Scrivener user’s manual

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.890
for the really technical stuff

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.890
or you can link to my website for Scrivener tips and tutorials.

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.080
Oh yes . . . If you are on my website,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.969

Don’t worry, I would never share your email and you won’t hear from me

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.489
unless I find, or make, cool new resources to help you with your Scrivener.

00:05:00.489 --> 00:05:01.879

So this has been Karen from Scrivenertuts.com

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.769
Hoping to make your writing life easier

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.759
so that you can get on with the important stuff like actually writing your book.
