00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410
[thunder crackling]

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.615
[light bulb buzzes]

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:10.751
-Whoa, where am I?

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:12.638
What is this thing
I'm hooked up to?

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:16.266
Ew, who's that?

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.060
-Hello, Orange.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.991
I want to play a game.

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.023
-A game? Okay.
Let's play Go Fish!

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.938
-What? No.

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:26.235
-How 'bout Chutes and Ladders?

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.607
-No, you don't get
to pick the game.

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:31.406
-Why not?
-That's not how this works.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:34.040
-Why?
-Because! Now just listen.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.177
-Why?
-Because I said so!

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.330
-Okay, geez.
Who crapped in your corn flakes?

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.123
-[groans]
All right.

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:45.349
Now Orange, so far, you've made
a living annoying people.

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:48.173
Society would call you
a nuisance.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.468
I would call you an abomination.

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:53.917
-Yeah, and I'd call you
clown-face. [cackles]

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:55.031
-What?

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:57.237
-You look like somebody smeared
mashed potatoes on a mime.

00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.184
[laughs]
-That's enough.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.394
-You're kind of Emo, aren't you?

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.764
-No, I'm not Emo.

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.690
-You're an Emo clown.
[laughs]

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.456
-[growls]
Listen.

00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:09.778
The device you are
attached to is a deathtrap.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.214
It's hooked up to a timer.

00:01:12.214 --> 00:01:15.535
If you do not locate the
key in time, you will--

00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:16.535
-You mean this key right here?

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.079
-What the--?
Where did you get that?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.387
-I don't know.

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.058
-That's just great;
you're totally ruining the game.

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:24.985
-Your game sucks.
Let's play Yahtzee!

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.332
-I hate Yahtzee.

00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:27.516
-Jenga?
-No!

00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:30.382
-You like backgammon?
-Oh, my God, you're annoying!

00:01:30.382 --> 00:01:31.788
[growls]
I can't take it.

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:35.039
That's it.
I'm moving on to Eggplant.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.595
-Whoa, it's Barney!

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.545
-Uh yeah, dude, I'm not Barney.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:41.959
-Hello, Eggplant.
-Hey! Hey, Barney!

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.816
Can I teach you a song?
-No!

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:44.699
-Hey, I'm not Barney.

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:47.253
Dude, is this part
of the torture or what?

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:49.296
-Look, this is not how
this usually happens.

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:50.155
-[singing tune of This Old Man]:
I'm an orange

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:51.038
That's a key

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:53.535
There's an Emo clown on TV
[Jigsaw growls]

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:55.542
-Do I look like a
giant purple dinosaur?

00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:56.703
I'm an eggplant.

00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:59.049
-You look like a potato
with bad circulation. [laughs]

00:01:59.049 --> 00:01:59.931
-That's it!

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.578
I swear to God,
I am so done with this crap!

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:05.945
Why did I think
this was a good idea? [scoffs]

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.920
-Hey, hey...
[singing]: I'm an orange

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.405
You're not me

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:12.191
Jigsaw has to take a pee
[laughs]

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:13.677
-Oh, shut up!

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.024
-Hey, Potato!
-What?

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:16.882
-Deathtrap.
-Huh?

00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:19.552
[shrieks in terror]
[slice!]

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:20.783
-Aw, poor potato.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.547
He never "saw" that one coming.

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:25.845
[laughs]

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.911
Oh...

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.066
How do I get out of here?

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.841
Make sure to tune in
every day this week

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:33.211
for a new animated episode
of Annoying Orange,

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:37.853
and then a new original
animated episode of Friday. Yay!

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:41.113
