Hi, I'm Valerie from the decorating room
overlays and inlays is a really great

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.779
technique that helps

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.750
add visual appeal and color to a cake
and overlays basically just a cut out

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.190
shape

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.589
a fondant attached to a fondant covered
cake and inlay

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.940
is when you cut out a piece and inserted
inside

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
an overlay so first I'm going to  show you
how to do an overlay so I have

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.230
two colors of fondant here it's rolled
out to about

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.170
to about an eighth of an inch thick

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.280
thicknesses is up to you depending on
how you want it

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.110
the finished product to look so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cut out

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.170
a couple different sizes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.940
of fondant. Now the great thing about
these new cutters is that you can have

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.670
a straight edger you can have

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.649
or you can have a crimped edge so you can mix and
match

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.739
as you go along with your decorating so
have a large piece here

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.750
and then I'm going to with a smaller
size I'll cut out the blue and I will use the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.189
the ruffled edge

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.510
to add some more texture

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.570
and then we'll have a smaller

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.590
size back with the yellow now I'll use the
straight edge for that and that's pretty

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.610
much a simple

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.920
as it gets for the overlay and then to
attach it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.409
all you need is just a damp brush of

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.479
water onto the back side of your fondant pieces

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.659
lay them on top of each other however

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.540
I'll center these,  but however you want
them to be

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.049
and that's basically an overlay right
there

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.350
that's pretty simple so now I'll show
you how to do an inlay

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.130
so again we have our two pieces of
fondant rolled out different colors

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.369
and I'm going to cut out a piece off

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.369
let's say the yellow and so the thing
with inlays so you want your bigger

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.130
piece

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.979
and then you're gonna cut I'll go with
this one for the smaller

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.239
your other color and now the next step

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.980
is you need to cut a hole into your
bigger piece so you can lay

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.900
the smaller piece inside so doesn't have
to be right in the center if you wanna

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.970
have it at an angle you can do that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.239
I'll try to center this one so we'll cut
out the piece

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.530
then we'll  take our blue and just

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.940
fit it right into the spot where
we cut out the yellow

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.410
and now for smaller pieces like this you
can just use your fingers to kinda

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.810
of guide the two pieces of fondant
together so it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.629
adhere somewhat and there's no gap if
you have a bigger

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.629
piece that you're working with you can
use a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.930
fondant smoother that will also work well

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.900
and there you have your fondant inlay

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.440
