00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.290
Hi friends. I'm excited to show you how you
can use Stampin' Up! ribbon to dress up

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.320
all your packages.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
It's amazing how just a little bit of ribbon can change a package from

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.160
ordinary to extraordinary. The possibilities are endless so

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.039
I'm just going to give you a few ideas and
tips to get you started. Let's start with

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.890
the basics and it's amazing how just a
little piece of contrasting ribbon tied

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.250
in a knot take this package to a whole new level.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.859
This one uses a three-quarter inch Chevron and this one has a very

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.530
stiff fiber to it. So you can see how that tied such a beautiful knot.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.180
On this package, it's the same basic idea
but we've used our Seam Binding Ribbon

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.979
and you can see this is a much more pliable
ribbon. So same basic idea but it gives

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.120
you a total different look

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.430
depending on which ribbon you use. Now there's 
some basic knots and bows, but we can really take

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.600
things up a notch if we want to get fancy.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.089
Look at we've done here with our Cotton Ribbon to make this really cool

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.780
messy bow on this package.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.440
Super easy to create. All you need to do is cut a length

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.570
of our Cotton Ribbon, and then just wrap it around

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.230
your fingers as many times as you want. The more

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.900
ribbon you use the fatter your bow is going to
be.  You don't need to worry about being super

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.990
clean here, and when you're done just pinch
that together and tie it with the piece

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.480
of baker's twine. You'll have something that looks like

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.820
this and then all you need to do is separate out those loops.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.200
Really just mess it up, separate out those loops

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.780
and then it's really easy to get the look like we've created

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.670
on this package here. Now if you want to get really fancy

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.880
look what we have done with our 7/8 inch Natural Cotton Ribbon.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.530
Now the natural fibers in this ribbon take dye

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.409
so well. So you can really make this ribbon any color you want.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.830
In this case we've actually done a
two-tone dye. Let me show you how easy

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.630
it is to create that look.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.700
Start with your basic ribbon and then
just fill up a spritzer with a couple of drops

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.390
of Crisp Cantaloupe, and spritz that. We just want a really basic

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.860
light pink color. You can see we've done there.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.019
Set that with your heat tool and then what you'll do is

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.650
add a piece of washi tape along the middle to create a mask.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.140
You'll get another spritzer and this time we have used

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.400
Calypso Coral. Spritz that again, and again
you'll want to set that with your heat tool.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.500
When you're finished you have this really cool two-tone

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.500
stripy look with that. Now accessory your
going to want to use, no matter which

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.099
ribbon you are working with is our
Craft Scissors because these

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.360
cut so well and they never fray the edges. To create the bow

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.410
on this package, all we've done is cut this ribbon into small strips.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.500
Using some circles of cardstock

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.740
we've hot glued

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.400
little loops around the edges. We'll start with the big circle,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.670
and then move on to a medium-sized circle,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.280
and a smaller size circle. You can see how using those

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.470
circles together, you can create this 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.620
really big, fancy looking bow.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.750
Now we've seen some really fun examples of
knots and bows, but believe it or not you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.739
can make darling packaging without even using a bow

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.080
like we've done on this one. This look is
so easy to create. Very elegant and simple.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.790
We've used our Burlap Ribbon and
then sewed some Venetian Crochet Trim

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.800
along the edge. So combining two
ribbons to create a totally different look.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.810
If you're intimidated by the sewing
machine you can creat this exact same

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.750
look with Sticky Strip.  Just Sticky Strip

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.200
on the back of your Venetian Trim and 
attached that right there to the Burlap Ribbon.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.150
I'll show you one last sample. This one

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.110
takes ribbon to a whole different level. We have cut out a shape here,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.940
this cute maple leaf shape. You almost can't
even tell that's ribbon, but using our Natural

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.290
Chevron Ribbon gives it a really cool look.
Those fibers give it a much different

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.580
texture than paper.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.690
To create this one all you do is cut strips

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.370
of the ribbon, Sticky Strip on both sides of that, and then just apply that

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.879
to a sheet of cardstock making sure to line  up those chevrons.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.180
So you'll have your ribbon stuck down

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.440
to your paper. Run that through your Big
Shot with the Bigz Die of your choice and

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.129
you have a beautiful

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:22.240
accent piece for your package. There are so
many fun things to do with Stampin' Up!

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.409
Ribbon and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.909
