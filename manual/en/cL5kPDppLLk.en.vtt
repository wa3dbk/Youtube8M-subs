Turning a classic story that kids have enjoyed
into a super dark tale can have mixed results.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.870
With the exception of Big Fish, Tim Burton
has been ruining my childhood for years, and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.370
after he cast Johnny Depp and his own creepy
wife in their 57th movie together, Alice in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.210
Wonderland was pretty much dead to me.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.540
I thought that making a super dark Alice in
Wonderland couldn’t work, but the original

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.570
story wasn’t exactly a bright and cheery
tale.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.620
Actually, the game I have today proves to
me that dark doesn’t have to equal “I

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.260
need an adult” creepy.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.239
This is Alice: Madness Returns for the PS3.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.150
As a newcomer to this game series, and I call
it a series because one other game was released

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.030
at the turn of the century, I didn’t really
know what to expect from the story.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.921
Alice is trying to forget about terrible events
in her past, but is still suffering, and the

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.070
player is immediately stuck trying to figure
what is real and what is in her mind, as the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.549
game’s earliest section shifts between her
terrible imagination and what is really in

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.680
front of her.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.140
Although the game itself is very different
from it in most regards, this aspect reminded

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.229
me of the movie Donnie Darko.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.040
The developers want you to be just as confused
as her, and it works really well.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.719
As you get into the gameplay of Madness Returns,
it’s actually a very solid action platformer.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.770
Jumping mechanics are great, with Alice having
the ability to float and twirl in air to reach

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.759
a platform, in addition to finding some spots
that fling her up into the air.

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.600
Combat is not quite as refined, but it is
still very well done.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.799
Different enemies must be taken down in different
ways, depending on how they attack.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.860
So you might have to dodge and then attack.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.729
Using the pepper shaker is especially fun
for taking out some weird spawny things.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.390
Alice also has the ability to shrink down
to not only reach areas she could not as a

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.569
normal sized person, but also to reveal hidden
platforms that she can jump across.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.120
The game will leave these visible for around
3 seconds after you go back to normal size,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:25.420
allowing you just enough time to jump to them
before they can no longer be seen.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.280
As this is supposed to be a horror game or
sorts, I also appreciated the way the developers

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.500
made it scary.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.470
I HATE it when games just make things dark
and startle you with quick movement.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.420
That’s not utilizing atmosphere or the plot,
it’s just utilizing involuntary reflex.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.020
Alice doesn’t do this, it uses creepy characters
and a dark tone to achieve its scariness,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.920
a rarity in today’s games.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.970
Alice obviously doesn’t try to go for realism,
this isn’t the type of game it is, but the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.830
visual style used actually does look very
solid.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.640
Environments are varied and look great, and
although enemies don’t look like anything

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.720
special, the cat looks terrifying, in a good
way.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.470
Voice acting is also very good, and the 2D,
storybook presentation between sections looks

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.470
wonderful.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.890
I should mention, however, the game does hang
up for a good second when it auto-saves, and

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.560
this can be a bit annoying.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.530
Knowing nothing about this game and not really
having any expectations going in, I am pleased

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.480
to say that I enjoyed my time in Madness Returns.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.730
I kind of wish they made the movie more like
this.
