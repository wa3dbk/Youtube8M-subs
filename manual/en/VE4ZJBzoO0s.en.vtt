00:00:06.132 --> 00:00:07.114
- Hi again wig lover!

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.507
This is Heather from Cysterwigs.com.

00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:11.336
And today I'm bringing you a re-review

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.673
with a brand new camera

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:14.230
of one of my favorite styles that

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.411
I've reviewed so far.

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:16.978
And a different color.

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:19.559
This is Kristen by Jon Renau

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.992
in the color 12SF8, which is also known

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:23.622
as Shaded Praline.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.088
And this color is very very similar

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:28.826
to Sparkling Champagne from the Envy line.

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:30.445
So if you're a fan of
either of those colors,

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:33.434
they're pretty much interchangeable.

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.767
Both colors have a very light brown base

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.019
color, and it's easier to see it

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.686
if you pick this up.

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:46.090
Then the bottom here, very light brown.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.423
Golden, in tone.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.854
And then on top of that you've got

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:54.992
a medium golden blonde so a very rich kind

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:56.894
of buttery shade overall.

00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.152
And the root is A number 8.

00:01:00.152 --> 00:01:03.412
Which is a medium golden brown.

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:04.718
So it's got a really nice amount

00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:07.936
of contrast and it's a
very pretty rooted color.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:10.737
And it's also, by the way, my number one,

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.809
best-selling blonde shade
of any of the lines.

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:16.525
I sell a ton of wigs in this color.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.114
It's a very very popular blonde.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:01:20.611
So very very pretty.

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.283
And very nice if you don't want something

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.028
that's too light,
especially if you're looking

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:25.303
for something that's rooted.

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:27.267
Very very good color.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:31.434
So, I think this is a great
professional little bob.

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:35.605
I also am of the opinion that wigs

00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.772
with permatease in the cap,
look great on big girls.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.149
Because they give you
a little bit of height.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.584
This wig has permatease in the cap.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.433
Maybe not quite as much as a Noriko wig.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:51.059
But enough to give it
a little bit of body.

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:52.919
Which help give you a better proportion.

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.612
Cause when you're a
big girl and you've got

00:01:54.612 --> 00:01:56.367
a lot going on down here,

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.614
a little bit of height helps a lot

00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:02.041
to try to, you know, make your face shape

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:03.541
more proportional.

00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:07.579
And this wig can be styled
in a bunch of different ways.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.596
Now if I sweep this off to the side

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.772
a little bit, you can see that

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.266
the root and shade is really playing

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.338
in my favor because it doesn't cover ...

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.909
Like this is my bio hair,
it doesn't cover completely

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.197
and I mentioned that in my
original review of this wig.

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:23.780
Because it's rooted

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:27.544
that's awesome!

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:28.550
(laughs)

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.964
And so now you can see why so many people

00:02:30.964 --> 00:02:33.722
intentionally buy wigs that have rooting.

00:02:33.722 --> 00:02:35.885
So I really really like this.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:37.735
I love the color.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:39.595
I think it's a very very beautiful cut.

00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:42.228
I'm gonna turn to the side.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.827
I'm gonna rattle off some stats

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:45.457
while doing so.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:49.229
The sides are 7.5 inches long.

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.757
The nape is 3.5 and
I'll show you that when

00:02:51.757 --> 00:02:53.638
I get to the back and the front here

00:02:53.638 --> 00:02:54.819
is quite long as well.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.309
Front is 7.75 inches, that's that there.

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.211
But the layer next to that around the face

00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:02.133
is substantially longer,
they don't provide

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.265
a measurement for that.

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:05.765
So maybe I should.

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.502
Okay.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.610
It's about 12.5 inches, so it's

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.954
a good length for framing out the face.

00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:24.621
And here is the back of Kristen.

00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:29.022
Very very pretty wig.

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.643
And I love this color, like I said.

00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:34.984
So now I'm going to go
ahead and take Kristen off.

00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:37.408
So you can get a look
at the cap construction.

00:03:37.408 --> 00:03:39.658
So here is that lace front.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.970
It's very nice.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:44.958
Very well done.

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:50.991
And the rest of the cap is a standard cap.

00:03:50.991 --> 00:03:52.872
With a little bit of permatease in it.

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.431
And the permatease in
this cap is right here

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:56.695
in the middle.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:00.039
Kinda making almost like a T shape.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.956
And then the back is very stretchy.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.333
It does have soft felt at the back

00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:11.669
as well as soft felt at the ear tabs.

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:15.524
And it has a very very tiny tiny line

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:19.691
of soft felt right here in
front of that lace front too.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.361
So I'm gonna go ahead
and put Kristen back on.

00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:26.088
So you can see how easy it is to wear her.

00:04:26.088 --> 00:04:28.909
I actually kept the
Kristen in Shaded Peach

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.678
from the original review.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:34.886
I actually really really loved that wig

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:36.485
in that color.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.052
I'm actually going to go ahead

00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:39.609
and change this part around so you can see

00:04:39.609 --> 00:04:41.469
what it looks like
parted to the other side.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.469
Now I am using a wig friendly brush.

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:56.192
Just gonna part that to the other side.

00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.172
So there you go.

00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:01.339
Very easy cut.

00:05:02.388 --> 00:05:04.080
I would definitely
recommend either carrying

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.393
a wig safe brush or a wide tooth comb

00:05:07.393 --> 00:05:09.065
in your purse with you
just in case you need

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:10.486
to do what I just did.

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:12.001
But it's not that difficult.

00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:13.484
And I noticed from my own experience

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:14.885
with the one that I kept,

00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:17.455
that you can very easily train

00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:19.524
this hair to stay over to the side.

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:22.314
It just takes about a week of wear.

00:05:22.314 --> 00:05:25.407
And I would also
recommend washing it once.

00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:27.476
Right at the beginning to help aid

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:29.848
in that training process.

00:05:29.848 --> 00:05:31.373
So there you go.

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.024
This is Kristen by Jon Renau.

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:35.156
I wore mine for three and
a half months straight

00:05:35.156 --> 00:05:37.057
before it actually started to look it.

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:39.711
So to me that's a pretty good buy.

00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:43.066
So, thanks for watching and
I hope you have a great day.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:43.899
Bye bye.
