00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:10.374
That's an absolute record:

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:17.635
Emirate Airlines just announced last week that it
ordered another 130 new long haul aircraft...

00:00:17.636 --> 00:00:21.280
... all in all for a bargain price of 20 Billion US Dollars.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:27.601
This would probably make Emirates the world’s biggest airlines by 2010!

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.200
Captain Nathan Hildebrand - an Austrian national - has 
contributed to Emirates’ success.
. 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.080
Landing in Dubai over 7 years ago, he is now part 
of an expat group of Austrians that have succeeded abroad:

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:52.040
Vienna born Nathan Hildebrand is now a resident of Dubai, 
the city on the Arabian Golf where dreams still can come true! 

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.000
In your case Nathan, I think they have come true, no?

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:59.200
Yes, for my family and myself this dream has certainly come true!

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:03.760
At first, it wasn’t easy to warm up to the idea of actually living 
in Dubai…

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:09.640
as friends would say: Why move to the desert where you don’t 
know anyone?

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:17.600
In the end, the thought of discovering a unique culture,

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:22.160
making new friends, facing new challenges: all convinced me to plunge 
right in! 

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:27.240
A career plunge that is unstoppable for now, but which is under 
constant &amp; strict supervision!

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:30.976
Hence we are here in the simulator today, where you are re-tested 
twice a year, correct? 

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:36.320
Yes, all airliners around the world need to pass the so called PPC!

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:41.520
The pilot proficiency check is required twice a year…

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.720
each test lasting two days, eight hours each day!

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:51.053
So in effect you need to re-qualify yourself on the job every 6 month!

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:54.240
These tests include simulating realistic emergency scenarios...

00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:59.040
as realistic as these ventilator sounds we can hear in the background.

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:08.960
That’s correct, the many instruments in the sim can easily overheat 
on a long flight

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:15.440
so they require constant cooling. That’s what the vents in the back are for!

00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:24.600
Dubai has regulation that also require health checks no matter what 
job you’re in?

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:30.600
We have a very large expat community in Dubai. 

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:35.328
The percentage of foreigners living here is much higher than that 
of the local population.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.880
But surely they are welcome here, as they contribute to the 
well-being of the city, right?

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.920
Yes, we are very welcome here, it’s actually a very stable and 
peaceful coexistence!

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:46.440
But with so many nationalities, there are also strict rules! 
So as you mentioned:

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.440
If you want to work in Dubai, you need to get a health check first!

00:02:50.441 --> 00:03:00.400
This includes an aids test, which needs to be performed every 3 years.

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:07.280
This is necessary for every worker entering the country! 

00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:14.280
However, not every worker can bring his/her family to the UAE,
as you need to reach a certain salary level!

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:20.040
And as a pilot with a higher salary, you do enjoy a certain 
privileged position

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:26.040
as for other workers in Dubai a higher income is required, 
i.ex. to bring family to the UAE!

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:32.040
Yes, it is a privileged position. For lower income workers there are 
restrictions!

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:38.040
Workers at construction sites or in the tourism industry
usually cannot afford to bring their family members.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:42.040
With a monthly salary of between 200 and 300 USD, that's hardly
possible!

00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:54.520
A minimum of 1000 USD is required to be able to bring family 
members to the country.

00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:59.960
So most employees work until they can afford to bring their family along.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.797
In your case, adequate accommodation is provided.

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:07.422
You live together with your family in a house with swimming pool?

00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:13.067
Yes. I live in a spacious 400 sq.mt. house, with two bedrooms, 
two living rooms

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:19.030
two kitchens, a swimming pool a fitness center &amp; 24 hr security.

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:24.998
These housing amenities are part of the package offered 
to captains and pilots!

00:04:25.012 --> 00:04:31.279
And no taxes for employees? Yes, that’s true! Zero taxes!

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.520
How are infrastructure projects like streets &amp; public parks paid for

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:41.520
if there are no taxes collected by the state?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.836
I’m afraid I cannot answer that one! It’s a state secret waiting 
to be answered… 

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:50.560
Looking back to your past seven years and your newly won friends: 

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:56.400
are there any locals among them, or primarily expats like you?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.520
Mostly foreigners I would say! One neighbor is from Samoa,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.640
the other neighbor from Trinidad, one from India, also Chile &amp; Mexico…

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.520
It’s actually a very mixed bunch from all around the world!

00:05:13.524 --> 00:05:19.400
It’s a very unique experience: I’m still proud to be Austrian

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:24.720
and always happy to visit my beautiful country of birth.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:29.400
But after 7 years living among so many different nationalities...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.400
I fell more like a cosmopolitan citizen of the world!

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.320
The multitude of cultural, ethnic &amp; religious diversities,

00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:41.328
really shape you to see the world through completely different eyes! 

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:44.328
It really seems to be exciting to live here...

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.840
…amongst all these different Nationalities and to be a part of 
it all!

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:55.440
Nevertheless Captain, any plans to plot a permanent course back 
to Austria anytime soon?

00:05:55.605 --> 00:06:00.040
I’m privileged in that I can fly to Vienna at least once in two 
months. So I am back often! 

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:03.040
But for now, I can’t really say for how much longer this interesting 
city will keep me here!

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:07.191
If ever I leave Dubai, it will be to return back to Austria!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.063
Thank you very much for the interview and many great flights 
in the future!
