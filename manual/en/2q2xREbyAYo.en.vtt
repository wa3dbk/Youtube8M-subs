00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.940
One of the things I love about the Fall planting
season is the variety of herbs that we can

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.940
plant but it can't grow in the rest of the
year, like cilantro.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.419
Now I'm always unhappy to see my basil go,
but I plant cilantro where the basil was in

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.419
the garden.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.849
And if you've ever tried cilantro in the Spring
you know it's just not successful, it goes

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.869
to seed immediately.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.620
So when you're looking for cilantro in four-inch
pots, it is often very crowded in the pot,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.660
so if you look at this pot you can see there's
probably eight or ten or more cilantro plants.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.800
And if you were to plant them just like it
is, it's going to do okay for a while, but

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.890
then the plants are going to start to struggle,
and probably die.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.000
And if you have had trouble growing cilantro
in the past, that might be why.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.420
Now this plant is kind of small so it would
be rather easy to take it apart and divide

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.890
it and separate it.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.820
This plant, however, is quite crowded and
the plant is a little bit larger so it looks

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.460
like it would be a better buy but really it's
going to be a struggle for that plant to survive

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.720
just like it is.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.040
So what I would do is I would plant it, and
once it's planted let it grow for a little

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.140
bit but as it's growing I would take out one
or two of these extra plants all the way down

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.250
to the base.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.540
You can take that into the kitchen and cook
with it, but that way this plant is going

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.380
to eventually have just one or two at one
place and it will survive and do much better

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.450
that way.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.340
Now another plant that is fabulous to get
started in a cool season is parsley, both

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.790
the curled parsley and the Italian flat-leaf
parsley are great to start in this cool season

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.200
and get established.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.950
Again this plant is multiple plants in one
pot, there are many many plants in there,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.610
and this one is a little bit further along,
the roots are extending out from the pot a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.830
little bit, so again I might go in a cut some
of those all the way down to the base.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.819
This one, however, is fairly crowded, but
with much smaller plants, it doesn't have

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.140
a root system that's winding around and twisting
around too much, so that could be teased apart

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.130
and separated into probably eight or ten different
parsley plants.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.680
Same thing here with this fennel now this
is really, really crowded, I know there's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.019
at least twenty plants there and so to divide
those, just gently squeeze the pot, pull it

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.019
out, you see the roots are kind of twisting
around so separate those out, sort those out,

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.920
and you'll just gently pull it apart, it's
best to do this when the soil is a bit damp,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.989
so tear it apart, and you can take these little
divisions that you got, and you might have

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.640
two or three plants in each division, and
pot those up in the pot, let them sit for

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.599
a week or so for the roots to heal or repair,
or you could also put them in the garden and

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.489
just protect them with a little bit of shade
cloth.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.389
Now again, this is a dill that I don't mind
having extra fennel, because it's a great

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.720
butterfly plant, and so the larva of the swallowtail
butterflies come in and feed on the fennel

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.440
all the time, in fact, I take the larva of
the swallowtails off of my dill and my parsley

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.939
and I put them on the fennel so the fennel
can be their host plant.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.890
This is dill that's stretched a little bit
long, so that would not be my best choice,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.349
I would prefer this dill, and it's going to
be easy to separate and divide.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.920
Also look for roots that are really twisting
and winding around like that, make sure you're

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.969
pulling them out and really separate them
before you plant them.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.969
Now even with some vegetables you'll get really
crowded pots, this little arugula plant has

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.670
five plants in the pot, that's all the arugula
that I ever plant, that's plenty arugula for

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.340
me, so I would separate this out into five
plants and separate them about twelve inches

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.389
apart because it gets pretty big.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.330
Now this little pot of spinach has a lot of
nice healthy little plants, but there's a

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.849
lot of spinach in this one little pot.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.239
That needs to be separated before it goes
in the ground.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.280
When you're pulling these apart and separating
them, you have to give them a little protection

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.060
from sun and wind so that they're not stressed,
so the way I do that is with my trusty rebar

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.090
garden hoops, and use this lightweight row-cover
that gives them a little bit of wind and sun

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.780
protection and I started using the bulldog
clips from your office supply store to hold

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.400
that row-cover on, you can also use the little
spring clamps too, and you can use these same

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.340
hoops for deer-netting, you can also use the
same hoops for a heavier-weight row-cover

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.030
for winter protection for when your plants
are going to be in danger of freezing, you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.180
can use the heavier weight row-cover.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.970
So all these tips will get you off to a great
start with your fall garden.
