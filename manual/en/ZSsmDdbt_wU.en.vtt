00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.820
Welcome to Introduction to Learning Technologies
from the Gwenna Moss Centre for Teaching Effectiveness

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.359
at the University of Saskatchewan.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.500
Throughout this video, I'm going to mention
a number of tools that you may not be familiar

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.700
with, but through this course you will learn
how to use them for your teaching and learning.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.920
So, this course is going to take a pedagogical
and technical look at learning technologies.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.960
It's actually an open online course, but it's
more than that.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.970
The course is built around a 15 person cohort
that meets face-to-face at the University

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.060
of Saskatchewan made up of faculty, staff,
and grad students who come in five times throughout

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.950
the term and get hands on assistance going
through this course.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.900
But there is no need for you to come to campus:
you can complete the entire course online.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.910
There's tutorial videos, readings, assignments,
and even some suggested rubrics even though

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.650
there are no grades associated with this course.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.910
The entire course is open.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.230
There will be a Creative Commons license on
it, so please feel free to make use any of

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.440
the resources in the course.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.890
So this is what we're going to cover in this
course.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.150
We're going to look at blogs, podcasts and
screencasts, Twitter, Flicker, YouTube, social

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.960
bookmarking, and more.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.390
We'll also look at copyright and Creative
Commons as well as digital citizenship and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.060
literacy.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.370
This is what we're going to do in this course.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.930
We're going to complete readings and watch
videos, create and maintain blogs, collaborate

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.620
on papers using Google Docs, create and publish
podcasts and screencasts, create a final digital

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.640
artifact that you can use in your own teaching,
and you're going to hear from and ask questions

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.500
of some guest speakers.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.170
Wait, really?

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.170
Guest speakers in this class?

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.170
Yeah, that's right.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.790
There's going to be three throughout the term
that are going to join us through Google Hangouts.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.159
You can catch them live - we will be live
streaming it - or you can catch the recording

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.470
on YouTube later.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.070
You can send in questions using the Twitter
hash tag for the course which you will find

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.850
in the course itself.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.020
Joining us this term will be John "The Plaid
Avenger" Boyer from Virginia Tech, Brad Wuetherick

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.730
from Dalhousie University, and Valerie Irvine
from the University of Victoria.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.390
I'm your facilitator for this course.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.900
My name is Heather Ross and I'm an Instructional
Design Specialist here at the Gwenna Moss

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.240
Centre for Teaching Effectiveness at the University
of Saskatchewan.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.010
Finally, if you found this course through
our YouTube page or a link on Twitter, this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.210
is where you can actually find the Wordpress
site where the course is located.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.190
It's word.usask.ca/learning-tech.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.920
I hope you join us.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.310
Thank you.
