00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.639
Peddling is easy isn't it you learn to ride a bike and it becomes very instinctive very quickly

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.449
But what is it that pros do it takes pedaling to an art form [how] do they look so bloomin smooth?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.709
Well, here are few tips [you] will get you pedaling like a pro

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.060
First up. We're actually going to do some backpedaling not literally

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.999
But metaphorically because an overwhelming body of [research] including our own have shown up pulling up on the pedals

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.989
Scraping through the bottom of the pedal stroke does not make your pedaling more efficient

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.849
Now your body will naturally put power to the pedals in the most efficient way for it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
So you do not have to think about pedaling in circles there are times though [when] you will

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.779
Automatically pull up on the pedals when you're sprinting or maybe when you're accelerating very hard in the saddle

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.199
But the point is it should be natural just do it when it comes to you

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.619
[same] is true of your cadence your body will naturally

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.529
Select the most efficient cadence for you as it weighs up the demands of fast and slow twitch muscle fibers

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.449
So don't try to change the speed at which you pedal because it's likely to be detrimental

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.409
One thing that is going to affect your pedaling efficiency

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.399
Is your muscle efficiency now true muscular efficiency is really only determined [by] genetics and training

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.970
It's not completely understood

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.139
But what we do know is that some riders don't need to use as much energy a given power as others however

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.690
It's not really a true barometer of performance

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.940
No efficient Riders are certainly not always fast riders and [Vice-versa]

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.240
So unless you've got loads of time available to you, and we actually don't recommend that you focus on it in training

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.289
What?

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.219
What is actually going to make the difference [then] don't worry so there are a few little shortcuts for better pedaling and coming up?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220
right now

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.729
getting in the correct position on your bike is

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.090
vital and the Most

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.979
Important part of [that] is your saddle height now if we look at [the] broad spectrum [of] riders in the professional peloton you will find

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.890
There is [a] range of Satellites preferred by different rides

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.750
But there's also a broad trend and that is that when you've got your feet at the bottom of the pedal stroke

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.590
you've got an angle here and me

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.220
Around 25 to 30 degrees if you are more detailed look we have got a great video for you here at [gCSe] food

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220
How perfect your saddle height?

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.939
Next it's really really important to keep your upper body still when you're peddling

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.549
Excessive movement if your torso, [not] only wastes energy it also kind [of] looks bad

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.489
And while some pros do rock and roll when under pressure because there's so much fitter it happens at much higher speeds

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.549
To achieve this on the one hand. It's just a case of focusing on staying still

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.750
It's a learned behavior

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.569
It just takes a bit of practice, [but] it is easier for some riders than others and that is because of core stability

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.039
You can't fail to have heard that tone from Yoga to pilates

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.099
specific core strength work now

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.089
increasing the strength of your stabilizer muscles in the lower torso

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.729
Apparently helps with things like back pain posture all sorts o that's true or not what we do know for certain

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.810
Is [Arise] with strong core do pedal very smoothly and often they're very strong as well, so it could benefit us all

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.079
Not all pros stretch not by a longshot most actually aren't very good at doing that bigger picture stuff

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.809
But because [the] amount of time they spend on their bikes

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.680
They're likely [to] have a degree of flexibility the rest of us might [be] lacking

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.869
We spend a lot of time sitting either for work or driving or ice and just [when] relaxing?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.500
So actually doing a little bit of light stretching even if it's only

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.299
when you're on the bike really help to improve your pedaling style not to mention your

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.429
Efficiency and comfort as you'll be able to get yourself into a fast aero position on the bike withey

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.049
Now there's a little bit [of] debate about this one exactly what it does for you

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.139
But the theory is that pedaling at a located and therefore a high Force helps to recruit muscle fibers and develop neuromuscular

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.480
Pathways now personally always found this very enjoyable as a way of training and also quite beneficial

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.690
[even] though it's not yet been proven [in] the lab if you want to try it through five minutes of pedaling at 60 rPM

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.649
Relatively high intensity then an easy gear for another [five] minutes and repeat

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.830
Make sure you do it on a climb to maintain the resistance. So there you go then to pedal like a pro

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.750
Don't do what you perhaps thought that you should do instead focus on these five simple things

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.650
Yeah

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.600
Set your saddle height keep your upper body still do some core work some flexibility work and also experiment with some slow cadence drills

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.620
Really nice shoes and salt will also help as well [solutely]

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.179
Yeah, if you want to see that video about how to set your saddle height and just click up there to watch it [or] to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.310
Combine core work and flexibility in the same workout well we've got a video about yoga for cyclists

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.910
You can get to it just down there and to make [sure] that you know about all of the latest global

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.200
Cycling network videos make sure that you subscribe by clicking on us

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.760
if they click on the ocean the Pacific Ocean and that will work -

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.680
No way
