00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.330
This week we have a giveaway.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.940
And this time it is the Knitter's Pride Nova
Interchangeable Starter set.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.920
And it's a set like this.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.320
And it's a set that comes with three different
needle tips, and two needle cord lengths.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.680
And I'll give you the sizes here -- this is
US sizes 6, 8, and 10.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.030
Or metric sizes 4.0, 5.0. and 6.0 mm.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.930
And the starter sets or sampler sets that
Knitter's Pride puts out are such a great

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.870
way to test out different needle materials
when you're looking at investing in an entire

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.980
interchangeable needle set.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.379
And whether you win this set or not, I really
encourage you to test out needles like this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.210
before you invest in an interchangeable needle
set.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.000
Because they are expensive, and you want to
love what you end up getting.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.220
Now to back up, what I'm talking about when
I say interchangeable needle set are a set

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.341
of needles that range in, a big range of sizes,
that are the needle tips like this, that come

00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:09.280
with the cord like this.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.620
So you attach the cord length that you need
to a needle size that you need, and you have

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.550
a huge range -- you end up having hundreds
and hundreds of dollars worth of needles in

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.960
this one set that you spent much less on.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.740
And I always try to convince new knitters
that are excited about knitting to invest

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.170
in one of those sets, but it's tough, because
you're not sure.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.100
There are acrylic, and metal, and wood -- and
you don't really know until you try them what's

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.250
going to be appropriate for you.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
Now the Nova needle set is made of nickel
plated brass.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
And these are the slickest, the fastest needles.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.690
And these needles are most appropriate for
two different kinds of knitters.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.950
The first kind is, regardless of skill level,
tight knitters.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.550
If you, maybe you don't even know you're a
tight knitter, but if the stitches don't move

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.690
easily across the needle, or if you're having
a really difficult time getting your needle

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.800
into the next stitch, chances are that you're
a tight knitter.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.390
So you're going to benefit from the slickness
of these needles.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.149
The second kind of knitter who will benefit
from these needles are really experienced

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.149
knitters.

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:16.290
If you rarely have a problem with stitches
falling off the end of the needle accidentally,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.170
then you have the skills you need to be able
to work with needles this fast.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.980
That's what they are.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.240
Tight knitters, experienced knitters, needles
like this will improve your speed.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.020
And they're fun to use, I think.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.480
So the next question is, what do I prefer?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.370
These needles are my go-to needles for almost
everything.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.330
I go back and forth between Knitter's Pride
Symfonie Dreamz wood needles, which are highly

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.730
laminated wood needles, and these needles.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.360
I like both of them.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360
I like the feeling.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.540
Kind of just depends on the stickiness of
the yarn, what I like to use.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.740
I like variety, I guess.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.550
But really, most things I knit are on these
kind of needles.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.580
And the tips, I would say, are medium sharp.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.900
They are good all purpose needle tips.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.340
Maybe not the best if you are working a complicated
lace pattern, where you have complicated decreases,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.790
like purling three through the back loop,
or something.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.310
You might want sharper needles for that.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.980
But, good all purpose tips.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.610
So, I'm going to show you how, if you've never
used an interchangeable set, how to attach

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.610
the cords.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.790
Let's go ahead and take a look.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.530
So here I have the tips.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.260
And here I have the cord.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.310
And the set comes with a couple of these little
keys, like this.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.330
And the way this works is, you take the cord,
and the cord is threaded.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.879
So the needle goes on there, and you just
twist it in place.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.860
And you hand twist it, about as tight as it
will go.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.630
And the key is here, only to give you something
to hang on to.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.910
So you can tighten it the rest of the way.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.901
It might not show up on camera, but there
is a tiny hole at the base of the cord, so

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:58.380
you put your key in there.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.810
And that gives you something to hang on to,
to just tighten it the rest of the way.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.800
And then once you have that, you have a really
smooth join, that isn't going to get caught

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.550
on any of your stitches.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.349
Now we've had Knitter's Pride Interchangeable
needles in videos before, and people were

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.250
asking me -- what are those black dots?

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.410
Well, the black dots are stoppers.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.780
You can actually make yourself cords, two
needles like this, putting a cord on each

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.070
needle that you're using, and having a stopper
at the end.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.400
Or if you need the tips for something else,
you can, I'll show you how to undo this.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.580
You put the key in and untwist it.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.670
If you want to save your work and have the
needles available for something else, you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.979
can put a stopper on each end of the cord.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.470
And then use this as a stitch holder, like
this.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.020
Okay.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.160
So that's how you use the needles, and to
enter this giveaway, there are two steps you

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
have to take.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.279
The first is to subscribe to my channel.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.569
And if you're already a subscriber, you have
that one taken care of.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.289
The next one is to leave a comment but not
just any old comment.

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.689
We're taking suggestions this time.

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.849
You notice that sometimes we do tutorials
on guest patterns.

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.770
On other designers' patterns.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.069
And I don't have time or the opportunity to
look at all of these amazing patterns out

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.069
there.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.389
But hopefully you have some ideas for a tutorial
you'd like to see.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.990
So leave a comment with a tutorial that you'd
like to see here on verypink.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.099
And make sure it's not something we've already
done.

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.879
We have hundreds of videos out already, you
can take a look at the video library to make

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.479
sure it isn't one that we already have done.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.020
Leave your comment with your idea, make sure
you're subscribed to the channel, and we'll

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.659
use a random number generator to pick the
winning comment.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.660
Uh, the contest is open for one week from
the release of this video, so the contest

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.780
will be closed on the 11th of July.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.780
Yes.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.469
So, that's it, looking forward to your comments.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.909
Good luck.

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.349
