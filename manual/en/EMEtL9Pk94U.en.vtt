00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.060
Over the next four webcasts,
we’re gonna take a look at

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.030
some of the most important
reactions of monosaccharides

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.093
and we’ll begin with the
process of mutarotation.

00:00:08.093 --> 00:00:11.083
Which is an inversion
of configuration

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:14.087
of the hydroxyl group at
the anomeric position.

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:17.013
So, the α-form can
interconvert to the β

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:18.043
and visa versa.

00:00:18.043 --> 00:00:20.097
The way that this can be
tracked- it can be followed

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.053
by the process of
specific rotation.

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:26.000
Specific rotation, you don’t
need know the details.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But, if you were to take-
it’s a reflection-

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.050
it’s a characteristic
property of a pure compound.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.030
So, if you were to take
pure α-D-glucose,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.040
a solution of that would
have a specific rotation

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.003
of 112 degrees.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.087
But over time that would
evolve to a value of 52.7.

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:45.003
Similarly, if you were to
take a pure solution of

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.087
β-D-glucose, initially you’d
measure a value of 18.7.

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:52.057
But, again over time
that would evolve

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:55.050
to the same exact value, 52.7.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.043
When two different solutions-

00:00:57.043 --> 00:01:01.033
two different pure substances
converge to the same

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.030
ah, value of a physical
characteristic.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.040
You probably are dealing with
an equilibrium situation,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.073
where there’s going to be an
equilibrium mixture that lies-

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:13.067
that is a- a combination of two
different chemical species

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.040
and that’s exactly
what’s going on here.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.007
The two different
chemical species

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.007
are the α-anomer
and the β-anomer

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:21.087
that can interconvert
with one another

00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:23.093
through the open chain form.

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:25.063
So, for example,

00:01:25.063 --> 00:01:29.010
if you were to wonder where
that 52.7 comes from.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.023
Well, it’s just an
arithmetic uh, average, 36%

00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:38.097
times 112 which is the
value for the pure α-form.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:44.007
Plus at equilibrium we
have 64% of the β-form,

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.053
which has a value of 18.7

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:49.063
and so the arithmetic
average of those numbers

00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:52.037
gives you uh, 52.7%.

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:55.057
And so starting from
either pure α or pure β,

00:01:55.057 --> 00:02:00.067
we end up with a value
of 52.7 because the

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.057
equilibrium mixture
will be the same

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.033
regardless of where
we started from.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.070
[psk] We want to look at the
mechanism in three dimensions,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.000
what’s going on basically
is we’ve interconverted

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.097
the anomeric hydroxyl group

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:16.017
and the axial α-position
into the β-position.

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:19.027
And it’s going to involve
this open chain form,

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:22.013
so let’s take a look at the
details of the mechanism.

00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:25.083
Basically, we’ll follow a
process that can either involve

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:29.037
the cleavage of the
bond within the ring,

00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:32.000
that’s going to be the
endocyclic cleavage pathway.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.073
Or it could involve cleavage of
the hydroxyl group

00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:37.080
carbon-oxygen bond on
the outside of the ring

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.077
and that will be the
exocyclic pathway.

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:42.047
We’ll begin there and the
key word to write down

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:46.023
in both cases is the
ah, intermediate

00:02:46.023 --> 00:02:49.003
that’s known as the
oxocarbenium ion intermediate.

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:50.020
So, let’s take a look at

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.010
what the oxocarbenium ion
intermediate is.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.067
Basically, we’re going to
protonate the hydroxyl group

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:56.080
at the anomeric position

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.097
so we can set up a
good leaving group.

00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:01.097
Then, um, we’re going to
see the oxocarbenium ion

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.083
by a lone pair assisted
β-elimination.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.093
And you end up with
this ah, structure -

00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:09.043
the intermediate that’s
shown here

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:13.057
– this ah, cation that has
positive charge on oxygen,

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:16.043
but also essentially some
partial positive charge

00:03:16.043 --> 00:03:18.030
at the anomeric position.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.087
And that’s known as the
oxocarbenium ion intermediate.

00:03:21.087 --> 00:03:24.087
The oxocarbenium ion
intermediate can then take

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:28.087
and do a nucleophile addition
to that polarized π bond

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:30.057
from the β-face

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:33.093
and in this case now we’ve
inverted the configuration

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.063
of the carbon-oxygen bond.

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:39.000
A proton transfer
gives us the β-anomer.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Alternatively, we could
have set this up in a ah,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.067
this mechanism up in a
slightly different way.

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.040
Had we protonated the
oxygen in the ring,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.093
we would have ended up with
a- a- an intermediate

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:51.033
that looks like this.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.057
That intermediate would
then go on and do-

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:56.033
a β-elimination,
lone pair assisted.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.087
And now what we need
to do is to generate-

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:01.097
to change the face by doing
a bond rotation

00:04:01.097 --> 00:04:05.037
about that bond and
show the opposite face

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:08.043
so that the hydroxyl ah, group

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:12.020
can add into that polarized
π bond on the opposite side

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.023
from which the
cleavage took place.

00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:18.017
Now the new carbon-oxygen
bond is set up to be in

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:23.010
the ah, β-position and so
we generated the β-anomer.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.087
Those are two different
mechanisms by which
00:04:24.087,00:00:00.000
the mutorotation process
can take place.
