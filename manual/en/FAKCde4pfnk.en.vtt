00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.960
Up until this point, I’d never played a
good Barbie game in my life.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960
Video game.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960
I should be more specific.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.870
Because there’s lots of weird Barbie games
you can play, but…we’re talking Barbie

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.640
video games here.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.440
And speaking of things that should remain
private and never be spoken of…Barbie video

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.540
games have been awful for a long time.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.960
And then there’s this one.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.870
It takes some ideas from those awful Barbie
games, mixes ‘em up and throws ‘em together

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.870
in one cheap GBA game.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.620
So you can imagine what this one’s like.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.559
It’s the best Barbie game ever.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.579
Ah, didn’t expect that, did you?

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.710
It’s Secret Agent Barbie.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:22.610
So if you believe in the universal truth of
mathematics…this game will challenge it.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.210
Like waves of contradiction, crashing onto
the shores of reason, Secret Agent Barbie

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.409
says, “Hey, three plus three doesn’t have
to be six.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.180
Not for hot blondes, we can make up anything
we want.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.170
We can invent numbers, nobody cares.”

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.370
I’m basically paraphrasing Secret Agent
Barbie here.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.840
‘Cause this game does the impossible.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.890
It combines things that sucked for decades…into
something that doesn’t suck as much.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.920
Why don’t you explain that one, Neil deGrasse
Tyson?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.090
Now, if you’ve played any of Barbie’s
awful games…I can’t imagine why you did

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.090
that.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.150
There’s literally no reason for you to have
ever done that.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.150
What’s wrong with you?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.300
I mean, I’ve done it, but only so you don’t
have to.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.160
That’s my burden, I’m bearing it for you.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.950
You crazy *sshole.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.080
Nonetheless, if you have, this is going to
give you some flashbacks.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.370
Remember the mermaid levels in her NES and
Game Boy games?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.440
Yeah, lot like this, isn’t it?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.200
And hey, what about the driving levels in
Barbie: Super Model?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.910
‘Cause they’re almost identical to these
levels, in Secret Agent Barbie.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.340
This game takes lots of concepts and mechanics
from Barbie’s previous games.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.510
But again, somehow…they’re better this
time.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.930
Still kinda generic and dumb, but they’re
playable.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.560
So that’s something.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.970
So you play as either Barbie or Zero Suit
Samus, it’s hard to tell.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.799
Anyway, where Barbie’s prior games mostly
had you playing as Barbie the Stupid, Selfish

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.310
Super Model…this one’s a bit more interesting.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.210
It’s Secret Agent Barbie, and she’s doing…secret
agent things.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.110
Some other chick’s stolen the jewels, so
Barbie chases her all over the place.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.970
From England, to China, to Italy, to Mexico,
to…

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.490
Actually, that’s it.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.590
She chases her to four places.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.380
Still a long way, though.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.639
So this is basically a 2D platformer with
minor elements of stealth.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.100
Barbie has to platform through standard 2D
levels, nothing exceptional…and along the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.480
way, she has to avoid being spotted by the
bad guys.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.250
She does that with her spy gadgets.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.810
She has an invisibility ring, a bunch of smoke
pellets, a grappling hook…and you use this

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.209
stuff to sneak by.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.169
She can hide in doorways, roll through tunnels…

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.549
Alright, this is basically Metroid now.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.590
This is just Barbie Suit Samus.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:40.260
Now, there’s nothing great about the gameplay…but
it doesn’t have to be great to be the best

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.120
Barbie game I’ve ever played.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
And that’s what this is.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.260
It’s the best Barbie game I’ve ever played.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.550
Doesn’t really say much, still not a great
game…but at the very least, it’s a functional

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.680
Barbie game that you can actually play and
finish and not want to die while doing so.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.290
It controls okay, it looks okay…

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.170
The music blows, but that’s okay.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.540
‘Cause it’s Barbie, and Barbie loves to
b…

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.870
Be okay.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.400
There are also some hacking minigames, because
video games.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.760
Problem is, there’s only a couple different
ones, and they’re always the same.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.519
It’s not like BioShock, where one is clearly
more difficult than the other.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.910
They’re all pretty much identical, so it
gets a little repetitive.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.389
Still, though…not bad.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.389
Okay.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.880
Didn’t want to die.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.650
Can’t say the same for Barbie Super Model,
or Barbie Game Girl.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.389
And even though the driving levels are still
pretty terrible…that’s actually the only

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.160
serious blemish on the gameplay.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.310
Everything else is functional, so this is
a decent game for kids.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.250
I’ve reviewed a lot of Barbie games.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.389
And I’ve lost my mind during some of them,
just watch those reviews and see.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.389
But this one?

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.760
I don’t know, this one wasn’t so bad.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.710
And you know, it’s nice to see a Barbie
game that isn’t just…oh, put on the lipstick,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.199
walk down the runway, buy some purses.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.680
This is, like…you can be hot and still throw
smoke pellets.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.349
I think that’s an okay message.

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.110
It’s Secret Agent Barbie.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.030
It’s actually an okay game, too.
