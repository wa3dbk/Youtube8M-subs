00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Well, what he actually said was

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.180
uh, that Taco Bell burritos don't count as

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.180
real burritos?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.700
Which is not true at all.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.060
Right?

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.020
Hm?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.560
Yeah, burritos suck balls bro.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Anna?

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.600
Hey, what did I say about no stupid cellphone at the table?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.240
*gasps* Don't call him stupid!  He can hear you.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.740
Don't you see the little ears?

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.960
Okay, since when is your phone a guy?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.240
Sometimes I feel like you're in love with your cellphone more than me.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.940
Not more.  Just different.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.440
This is getting out of hand.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.760
Anna?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.760
Hey!  Anna.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.720
Who's under the sheets?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.820
No one, I'm just playing with my cellphone.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280
Aw, isn't he so cute when he naps?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.120
You know it would be great if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.780
you start referring to it as a female

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.720
or at least something gender neutral.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280
I'm sorry, Celly identifies as a man.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.840
Look, Anna, I know that you love the movie "Her."

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.180
This is too much, okay?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240
Okay.  We'll go watch Netflix.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.700
Okay.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.900
Cool.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.340
Anna.  What the Hell is this?

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.440
I'm ready to watch Netflix.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.660
I thought we were going to watch Netflix.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.420
Not you me and your phone.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.100
What's wrong with Celly being here?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.160
I just--

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.220
You're always so distracted with the phone.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.960
I can't handle this anymore.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.360
Okay?  What's so much better about him?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.120
He has all the answers.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.420
Can I ask you how many spiders crawl into

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.200
a person's mouth in their lifetime?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.260
You don't know that.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.060
I can take photos,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.600
I can look at my photos,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.440
I can share my photos,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.200
I can figure out what date it is!

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
This is better than you because it's a machine.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.760
I can't take it anymore.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.820
It's either him or me.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.320
You know you have a phone too, right?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.260
Oh.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.280
[Laughing]

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.560
What's so funny?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.920
Nothing.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.880
Just paying my gas bill.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.140
Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed that sketch.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.040
Clearly, it comes from my own addiction

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040
to my phone.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.960
And I just had to talk about it so

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.800
thanks Brad for being in it with me.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.020
But before I go, I did want to mention,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.360
Have you seen "Hey USA" Season 2?  The trailer?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.440
Doesn't it look adorable?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.960
Jenna Marbles and Mamrie Hart

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.440
in like those giant overalls like in that lake is just--I can't even.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.520
So, "Hey USA", if you don't know

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.700
is a travel show by the people, for the people

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.480
and this season, season 2

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780
Mamrie Hart is going to take YouTubers that you picked

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.980
and go all over America, wherever Grace Helbig tells them to.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.040
So it's got some of my favorites!  Like Mr. Flooa

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.200
Kingsley, and of course Jenna Marbles

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.020
and Tyler Oakley, and Colleen, and so many more!

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.780
So if you want to check it out you can

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.380

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.720
It's going to be fun, it's going to be America.
