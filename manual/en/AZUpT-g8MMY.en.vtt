Hello, i'm Jeff from e-outdoor.co.uk

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and this is the Barbour Microfibre
Polarquilt Jacket

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.170
The Microfibre Polarquilt is a warm and padded country

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.000
jacket from Barbour with a slim fit design.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.890
The jacket is a generous fit

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
I am normally a medium and this one is maybe just a bit

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.950
bigger than usual. Lets take a look at
the front you have a padded

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.040
storm flap which is press studded

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.720
and reveals a two-way metal zip

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.250
with barbour logo on it.
Inside the jacket

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.070
is a 100 percent polyester fleece lining

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
which makes the jacket nice and warm
on the left hand side

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.030
just by this Barbour insignia

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.660
is a zipped inside pocket
For extra protection there is a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.000
overlap baffle here to give you protection
and warmth

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.700
The outside is diamond quilted and you will
probably notice the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.670
binding on the edge of the cuff
all the way around the edge

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.870
and hem

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.530
also on the front you have nice deep patch
pockets which are

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.439
fleeced lined and really warm

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.750
you have adjustment on the cuff.
Two pressed studs for adjustment

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.149
thr collar is noticeably warm

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.579
and soft in a windy cold weather
you can pull that right up

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.329
there is also an extra tab here to
pull right across

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.290
and fasten over to make it nice and snug
Looking down the jacket

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
you have the usual Barbour branding
on the left hand pocket

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.659
also there is vents

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.950
on each side which are adjustable

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.140
The Barbour Microfibre
Polarquilt is a snug

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.450
and practical jacket protecting you
from the cold

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.500
there's a variety of sizes and colours

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000
