00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.960
Armin's Haircut

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.170
Fine, if it's the military regulation I'll cut my hair

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.560
Please... at least let me cut it myself

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.070
I'll do it... I'll shave it all, just go and don't worry about that

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.020
Why...

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.270
Armin

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.030
I know you won't cut it yourself

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.270
I... I was going to do it, I swear, I was going to shave my beau-

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.940
Bullshit!

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.720
No please... let me go

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.870
If they drag me back... the general is going to make me bald

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.150
Wait! Look over there, at that titan!

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.760
Titan?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.720
The two of you don't care about hairstyle so you wouldn't undestand

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.180
But trust me...

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.800
That titan haircut is weird!

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.670
His haircut?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.650
I think titans have haircut regulations like us humans

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.260
And that titan is not following them, just like me

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.060
He is fighting other titans for the sake of his hair

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.480
Are you nuts? Did that yellow helmet crush your brain?

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.650
That "yellow helmet" is my precious hair

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.300
For that titan, his hair must mean the same

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.940
If the titans have haircut regulations are like that, we humans should not adhere them

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.570
What the fuck are you even talking about?!

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.730
Then, look at all those titans with dull hair and tell me I'm not right

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.160
Yes, I can see what you mean

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.580
You too?

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.790
I've been trying to tell you this, baldies are not my type

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.920
Armin's hairstyle is better

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.760
You are saying his style is better than my style?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.290
Yes, that is how it is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.310
I'd rather die than look like a titan

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.810
Now, we just need to convince the general

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.690
Prepare a speech

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.650
Baldie? I'm not bald!
