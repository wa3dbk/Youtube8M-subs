00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.200
Writing, reading, typing, texting.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.900
Written language is just one of those things that’s always been around.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.540
It’s a natural way for
you to use words. It’s a given. But there’s

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:28.320
something you’ve forgotten. It’s understandable.
After all, it’s been a very long time. A

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.800
long time since no one on the planet knew how to write.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.989
Our story starts with a legend: the tale of
Thoth and Thamus. No, that’s not a lisp

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.760
you’re hearing. Thoth and Thamus. Thoth
and Thamus. After the Egyptian god Thoth invents

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.219
writing, he runs to King Thamus to share this
discovery. But, to his chagrin, the king isn’t

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.940
impressed. At all. Looking down his nose,
he starts pontificating on the destructive

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.200
power of this newfangled technology.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.350
“Oh, clever Thoth! This invention will produce
forgetfulness in the minds of learners, with

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.830
the neglect of their memory, because their
trust in writing comes from strange external

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.610
marks and not their own internal recall. The
drug you’ve discovered isn’t a memory-enhancer,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.930
but a mentioning-enhancer, and you’re offering
students pretend wisdom, not truth.”

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.240
This sounds strange. It’s easy for you - and
your world full of writing - to dismiss Thamus.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.050
But hear him out. He brings you back to the
early days of writing, when it was the hot

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.230
new thing. And, like many other inventions,
not everyone was on board. Ok, so, let’s

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.110
say, for the sake of argument, you don’t
want writing. What are the alternative technologies?

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.850
You could bust out your abacuses. They’ll
help with counting and doing complex calculations.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.090
Or maybe you prefer icons, ritualized images
that help you relate to culturally significant

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.520
figures, events and attitudes.
The quipu is an amazing Incan information

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.190
storage system using cords, colors and knots.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.680
Oh, and don’t overlook rote memorization
- a basic option, sure, but it’s really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.980
useful in preliterate societies, where sentences
can be memorized and recited by the thousands.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.069
Your brain’s bigger than you think.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.740
Perhaps you prefer petroglyphs, rock carvings
with major cultural ties that may refer to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.720
nearby places or animals. Ooh, watch out,
writing - we’re getting uncomfortably close.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.870
All of these inventions helped humans keep
track of their thoughts. So what makes writing

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.380
different? What is Thamus afraid of?

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.980
Let’s talk some ‘ness. Embeddedness. These
things are all embedded in minds, tasks, rituals,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.190
events, cultures. Rip them from those contexts
and you rip out their expressive heart.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.849
Thoth’s drug doesn’t come with so many
strings attached. It will de-embed you, letting

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.450
you record any specific thought and letting
future generations read it in any context.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.080
So, human. Was Thamus right? Is writing an
unnatural intrusion? Or do you want to swallow

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.400
Thoth’s pill and see for yourself what we
actually unleashed when we invented writing?
