Charles: FRAAAANK!

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.240
Frank: CHARLES!!

Frank: CHARLES! CHARLES!

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.460
Charles: Frank.. the bird is dead.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.180
Charles: Please stop.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.760
Frank: CHARLES! I'm gonna die, Charles!

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.260
Charles: No you're not..

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.220
Charles: ..because the bird IS DEAD.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.000
Frank: I've never swam in the ocean, Charles!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.280
Charles: That.. doesn't even make sense.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.740
Frank: CHARLES!

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.420
Charles: FRANK. &gt;:(

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.280
Charles: THE BIRD IS DEAD.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.100
Frank: ..what?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.780
Frank: ..really?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.640
Charles: Yes.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.880
Frank: When did it die?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.980
Charles: About SEVEN HOURS ago.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.620
Frank: Oh, man! That's embarrassing! :D

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.540
Charles: Yes.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.420
*CAW*

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.620
Charles: OH S***!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.320
Frank: ..umm, hi.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.320

""BIRD"": WHY YOU ARE NOT BE SCREAMINKS??!

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.660
"""BIRD""": I AM GOING TO BE HAVE EATING YOU!

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.860
Frank: Well, I've been stuck halfway down this bird's esophagus for the past 7 hours..

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.180
Frank: ..so.. I guess I no longer fear death.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.920
""""BIRD"""": Congratulations, Frank.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.240
""""""""BIRD"""""""": You have passed the test.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.220
Frank: Cool.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580
Frank: You're like.. some sort of alien squirrel-thing.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.440
Squirrel: My planet be subjected to cruel feline overlord.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.520
Squirrel: Brave worm-creature must DESTROY cruel overlord.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.720
Frank: Sure man, no problem.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.720
Squirrel: Excellent!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.080
Squirrel: Now please be cominks with me, to space-ship!

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.920
Squirrel: We not have much time. &gt;:(

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.480
Frank: Awesome! How far away is it?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.900
Squirrel: We're already on it!

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.700
*awesome sound effects*

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.400
Frank: That was fast.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.680
..why am I still stuck in this dead bird's mouth?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.460
Squirrel: SILENCE!

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.500
Squirrel: This is space-ship, not talkey place!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.380
Squirrel: It be time for journey!

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.600
ANNOUNCER: And so, after several hours of awkward silence..

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.840
ANNOUNCER: ..the intrepid duo finally reach their destination.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.980
Frank: Well, that was awkward.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.920
Squirrel: SHUT UP.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.920
Squirrel: We have reached our destination.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.660
Squirrel: But before we are being fighting evil cat,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.780
Squirrel: I must ensure I have your undivided loyalty.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.840
Frank: YES, COMMANDER!

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.980
Squirrel: There will be no betrayink.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.960
Frank: You will not fall in battle unless I have fallen first, Commander!

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.640
Squirrel: I swear, worm!

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.480
Squirrel: If you be having betray me, I be making you pay!

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.940
Frank: Alright, I get it!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.440
Frank: You have trust issues.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.940
Squirrel: I will f***ing cut you!

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.460
Frank: ..umm, okay..

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.120
Frank: You're getting kind of creepy now.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.400
Squirrel: Salute me, soldier!

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.260
Frank: Look, buddy..

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.560
Frank: In case you didn't notice, I'm a WORM.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.100
Frank: If I had any arms, the first thing I would do..

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.880
Frank: ..is climb out of freaking dead-bird's esophagus..

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.800
Frank: ..and then MAYBE I would consider saluting..

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.520
Frank: ..the crazy knife-wielding alien squirrel-person.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.300
Squirrel: Fine.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.220
Squirrel: I be trusting you.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.260
Squirrel: Let us begin our mission.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.800
Frank: Yes.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.980
Frank: Let's.. do that.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.560
*dramatic music*

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.180
Squirrel: Alright, so just over this rock lies our target..

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.900
Squirrel: ..the FELINE FORTRESS.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.520
Squirrel: The citadel of terror on this world.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.340
*well-timed lightning*

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.280
Squirrel: It is of course heavily guarded..

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340
Squirrel: ..but I have been studying it for years..

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.600
Squirrel: ..and it does have several weaknesses.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.220
Squirrel: I strongly believe..

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.760
Squirrel: NO..

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.440
Squirrel: I am CERTAIN that if we work together..

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.800
Squirrel: ..we can overcome all obstacles..

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.440
Squirrel: ..using teamwork!

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.020
Squirrel: Any questions?

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.160
Squirrel: What.. the [heckadoodle].

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.260
Squirrel: Get back here you TRAITOR!!!

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.560
*plop*

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.360
Frank: Hey, Charles!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.120
Charles: Frank! :O

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.340
Charles: You're alive!

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.460
Frank: Hells yeah!

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.420
Frank: And that's not all!

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.800
Frank: Check out this cool space-ship I stole!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.920
Charles: Neat.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.880
Charles: What happened to the pilot?

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.340
Frank: Oh, you know..

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.920
Frank: I betrayed him.. left him stranded on some planet somewhere..

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.700
Frank: Whatever.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.360
Charles: Cool.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.800
Charles: So I guess there's no way he could possibly inflict vengeance upon us?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.100
Frank: You know, it never crossed my mind.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.300
Frank: Oh, well.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.500
Frank: I had a nice life.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.940
Charles: I. Hate. You.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.700
*BOOM*

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.260
Frank: Awesome!

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.140
Frank: We're still alive!

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.340
Frank: ..and completely unharmed for some reason.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.260
Charles: WHAT?!

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.840
Charles: How is THIS supposed to make sense?!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.620
Frank: I dunno! :D

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.040
Frank: Maybe the explosion missed us or something?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.920
Charles: That's..

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.820
Charles: That's.. just..

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.000
Charles: That's.. just.. stupid.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.920
Charles: This is

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.560
Charles: This is stupid.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.260
Charles: You're

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.020
Charles: You're stupid.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.140
Frank: Chill out, man!

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.960
Frank: Are you complaining that you're alive?!

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.920
Charles: YES.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.540
Charles: Yes I am.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.460
Charles: A giant freaking missile exploded two inches from my head..

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.680
Charles: ..and I'm not even scratched.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.940
Charles: Please explain the logic here.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.600
Frank: Ooohhh, I understand now!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.860
Charles: Enlighten me.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.380
Frank: Do you remember that time we were in France?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.920
Charles: No.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.880
Frank: We were on a balloon in France..

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.380
Charles: No, we weren't.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.640
Frank: Just as we reached 2000 feet above Montpellier..

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.340
Frank: ..the balloon pilot turned to me..

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.300
Frank: ..and he said..

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.980
Charles: We were never even IN FRANCE.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.400
Frank: ..and he said..

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.360
Balloon Pilot: Héy Frank! I havé sométhing for you!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.740
Charles: This never happened.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.380
Balloon Pilot: Také this magical amulét, Frank!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.160
Balloon Pilot: It was méant for you!

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.300
Balloon Pilot: Its powér will protéct you from éxplosions!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.700
Frank: Cool! Thank you, Philip!

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.100
Philip: It was my pléasure! :)

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.500
Charles: Even though I'm right here, watching all of this..

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.580
Charles: ..I probably won't remember.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.460
Charles: ..because.. I'm stupid.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.520
Charles: ..and also, I'm grumpy.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.260
Charles: ..and fat.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.080
Frank: So the magical amulet must still be around here somewhere!

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.360
Charles: None of the events you just described..

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.140
Charles: ..have ever happened to anyone.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.620
Frank: Oh, here it is!

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.280
Charles: WHAT THE-

gjja

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.420
Charles: I don't have anything else to say.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.980
Squirrel: Hey guys. What's up?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.780
AAAAAAA

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.180
