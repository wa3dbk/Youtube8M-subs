00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.640
We're back here today with Keith from K.O. Tires

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.140
and what we did is,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140
we took the tires and wheels off

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.060
and in the meantime

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.400
we went through

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.310
and sandblasted the drums. We sandblasted the
wheel's center

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.050
and painted those. We got those green. The
drum's black

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.540
We also went through the entire brake
system, got everything

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.240
dialed in.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.940
While we did that, what did
you have to

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.100
to work on these wheels and tires?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.559
Well,
these tires and wheels

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.660
this setup is called a suicide rim.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.600
Ok. Wow. Well, why do they call it a suicide rim?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.460
A suicide rim is - it's a two piece rim and
it's just

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.260
the outside lip is just really small

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.440
and a lot of times they fly apart

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.729
when you're airing them up.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.920
I notice you've got a pretty good sized hammer there.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.420
Well, when we break 'em down you
have to beat

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.270
the tire and the outside lip down far enough,
so you can pop the outside lip off,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.390
because it's like oval-shaped.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.770
So if you can imagine, we got a circle

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.550
and we got a outside lip that's oval-shaped.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.170
So,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.410
that means it's not touching all the way
around.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.140
So, would the center pop off and hit people then?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.760
Yeah. A lot of times this, the
outside ring, when you're airing the tire up

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.630
if it's not set just right,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.630
it will fly off.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.340
A lot of times, it's called a suicide rim because

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.720
people doing it are pretty much committing
suicide.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
So they do fly off, and they -

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.539
So you definitely don't want to try
this at home yourself

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.359
No. No.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.700
You want to take it to a
professional like yourself.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Make sure it's done properly.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.030
The professionals need to
be trained,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.039
so even like a normal tire shop

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.839
cannot do this.

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:01.499
A lot of people that do like
farm equipment stuff,

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.119
those type of professionals probably have
done this stuff and they know how to do it.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.700
Gotcha.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.009
So, once you got all this reassembled,
looks like we've got the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.509
powder coated the wheels.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.949
I think you
did that. Where did you take that to?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.320
We sent those out to Aesthetic Finishers in Piqua and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.290
they do a great job.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.489
Nice black. Really nice and thick. Even
when I mounted them back up, the

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.749
paint hardly chipped.

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.560
When I have to
install these, is almost the same way as

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.319
taking them off.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.299
I have to beat these with the hammer.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.650
Make sure they're centered.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.849
That's crazy. So now that we've got
these painted,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.319
we're going to do the installation. What
does that entail?

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.159
What we do is, we just slide it over the
hub.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:42.780
Now,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.940
this is not like a normal car set-up.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.900
It has little wedges that go all the way around it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.200
and centers it just right.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.019
So you have to spin the wheel

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.720
and tighten one up a little
bit at a time to make sure it's nice and true.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.959
Otherwise, you're gonna go down the road
with the steering wheel shaking

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.459
The truer we get it, the smoother the ride
is on this.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.829
All right Keith, why don't you go ahead and show me how to do a proper installation on these?

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.449
All right. Sounds good. Let's get to it.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.940
All right.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.160
Lift it up on there.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Slide it nice and easy.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.180
There it is. Just like that

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.100
Now we get the wedges on there and start them.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.600
Ok.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.040
And we'll go from there.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.780
We'll get one started and go back on the opposite side.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.800
Get the other one started

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.480
and slowly
work our way around the rim.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.860
We've got them all started.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.220
Now we have to true
this thing up. Make sure we get it nice and smooth,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.640
so the poor driver doesn't get shook - 
shook to death

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.980
So, what I do -

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.260
I use my hammer because I'll probably have it out because I just changed some wheels.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.300
I'll set it. 
I'll start out about an inch from the wheel.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.900
Then I'll spin it to see how bad it is.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.560
So, this is the highest spot that sticks
out

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.660
Go ahead and put this little bit closer.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.720
Then I'll go ahead and tighten one of these up a little bit at a time.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.960
Until I get it nice and smooth.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.980
Go ahead and get a socket and an
impact, and we'll go ahead and snug them up a

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.560
little bit at a time.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.020
And we should be pretty good to go.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.570
Boy, that looks good. Doesn't it?

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.480
Do you want me to go ahead and hit the breaks?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.940
Yeah.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.940
Go ahead and grab a torque wrench

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.400
and we'll get them torqued down

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
and we'll be
finished with one

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.039
Alright. There they are. That's one done.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.100
All right. Let's go ahead and finish them
up, and we'll see you next week!
