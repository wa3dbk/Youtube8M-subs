00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.190
JOHN: Hi.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.920
I'm John.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.010
ABBY: And I'm Abby.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.790
JOHN: And we're here to
share a great word with you.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.060

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.140
JOHN: Tell them what
the word is, Abby.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.765

ABBY: Hey, tell them
what sturdy means, John.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.940
JOHN: Good idea, Abby.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.820
The word sturdy
means when something

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.229
is strong, and won't fall apart.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.770
ABBY: Sturdy.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.936
JOHN: Hey Abby, do you think
you could use your wand

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:55.992
and poof in some
sturdy things for us?

00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:56.700
ABBY: Absolutely.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.989
Sturdy!

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.780
JOHN: Look at this!

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.920
This ladder is strong,
and won't fall apart

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.944
when you climb on it.

00:01:06.944 --> 00:01:07.860
This ladder is sturdy.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.180
ABBY: Mm-hm.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.815
Sturdy.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:11.940
JOHN: Let's show them
something else that's sturdy.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.894
ABBY: You got it, John.

00:01:15.894 --> 00:01:16.790
Sturdy.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.290
JOHN: Yes!

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.490
This chair is strong,
and definitely will not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.945
fall apart when I sit on it.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.900
This chair is sturdy.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.470
ABBY: Mm-hm, sturdy.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.270
JOHN: Let's show them one more
thing that's sturdy, Abby.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.440
ABBY: I am on it, John.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:34.441
Sturdy.

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.000
JOHN: Oh, OK.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.660
This rope is very strong, and
will not come apart no matter

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.360
how hard I try to break free.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.824
This rope is sturdy.

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:46.552
ABBY: Yeah, sturdy!

00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:49.900
JOHN: OK, all right, Abby,
can you poof this off me, now?

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.370
ABBY: Oh yeah, sure thing, John.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.200
(LAUGHING) Wow, that
is a strong rope.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.504
JOHN: Try it again, Abby.

00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:00.625
ABBY: Oh, yeah, of course.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.306
Oh boy, John.

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:11.740
This rope is strong
and it won't come off.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.179
JOHN: I guess it's too sturdy.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.720
ABBY: STurdy.

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:21.090
NARRATOR: Maggie wants
a safe and strong place

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.920
for her doggie to
sleep, right doggie?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.370
Yeah, right.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.524
So she and her dad are
designing a sturdy doghouse.

00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:33.926
First, they got themselves some
sturdy wood and cut through it.

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:36.820
And now, they're
using screws to hold

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.905
the wood together--
nice and sturdy.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.646
They're taking nails, and
they're going to use a hammer,

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:47.730
and put the nails and
the wood together,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.430
to make the house really sturdy.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.670
Wow!

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.600
That looks like a
sturdy roof, guys.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.540
Aw, now they're painting it.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.230
Look at that!

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.710
The house is sturdy,
right doggie?

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.300
Ruff.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.256
PIG 1: I predict that
the air from the fan

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:14.510
will blow the straw,
and the sticks, but not

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.148
the heavy bricks.

00:03:16.148 --> 00:03:17.420
PIG 2: Me, too.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.090
PIG 3: Me three.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.161
PIG 1: Come on, let's turn on
the fan and see what happens.

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:22.410
REPORTER 1: I got it, fellows.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.910
Here you go.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.480
OK.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.310
Well, this is [INAUDIBLE]
history in the making, folks.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.480
REPORTER 2: The fan is blowing.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.710
Oh, there goes the straw.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.120
REPORTER 1: Now the air from
the fan is moving the sticks.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.386
REPORTER 2: There go the sticks.

00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:42.885
PIG 2: Ooh.

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:43.630
PIG 3: Hey.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.333
PIG 1: But look-- the
bricks are not moving.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:52.310
PIG 2: The air from the fan
can't blow the bricks away.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.550
PIG 3: Oh, the bricks
are the strongest.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.955
It must be the best.

00:03:55.955 --> 00:03:57.350
PIGS: Yay!

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.499
PIG 1: Hey, let's build
our house out of bricks.

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.040
PIG 2: Quick!

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.790
PIG 3: Before the big,
bad wolf gets here.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.837
PIGS: Come on, let's go.

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:06.295
REPORTER 2: Look,
they're building.

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:06.590
REPORTER 1: Wow.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.423
REPORTER 2: Look it.

00:04:07.423 --> 00:04:08.632
REPORTER 1: And they're done.

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:09.714
REPORTER 2: It's all done.

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:10.610
Look.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.734
PIGS: Yoo hoo!

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:13.400
REPORTER 1: Wow!

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.160
REPORTER 2: Whoa!

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.409
REPORTER 1: You guys are fast!

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.670
REPORTER 2: Yes!

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.839
WOLF: Hello, piggies!

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.500
PIGS: Aaaa!

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.529
The big, bad wolf!

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.570
WOLF: That's right, and I'm here
to huff, and puff, and blow you

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.865
away.

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:29.365
Haaaa!

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.960
REPORTER 1: The big, bad
wolf is huffing and puffing.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.513
REPORTER 2: Will he be able
to blow the brick house away?

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:43.847
WOLF: Huff and puff.

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:45.430
REPORTER 1: No, he
can't blow it away.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.450
It's too strong.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.430

things are sturdy?

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.960
GIRL: A brick house
can be sturdy.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.800
MURRAY: A brick
house, as the pigs,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.580
the three little pigs taught
us, a brick house is sturdy.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.280
What does the word sturdy mean?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.360
OFFICER: Sturdy means
like strong, something

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.780
that's built well,
and won't fall.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.011
MAN: To be firm or solid.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.260

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.755
MURRAY: A bed needs
to be sturdy if I'm

00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:17.019
going to take my nap on it.

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.060
WOMAN: If you go camping,
you want a sturdy tent,

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.074
so rain or wind
doesn't blow it away.

00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:21.740
MURRAY: Awesome.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.060
Sturdy-- that's the
word on the street.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.510
Let's jump.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.814

here to tell you

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.660
what the word imagination
means, right Count?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.940
COUNT: That is correct,
Forrest-- imagination.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.060
FORREST: Now
imagination is when you

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.810
make believe
something is anything.
