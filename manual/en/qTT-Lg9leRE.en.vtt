00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:14.392
Creating your own fringe set will allow you to 
 quickly change up your look, every day.

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.907
I'm going to show you how to make 
 your own fringe set using wefted hair,

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:20.509
needle and thread,

00:00:21.307 --> 00:00:22.215
weaving clips,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.060
binder clips, and these can be found in any office supply store,

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:27.415
comb,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:28.146
shears,

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.185
flat iron,

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:31.426
and our bangs templates.

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:35.009
You can find these templates on our website in the Tutorials section.

00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:38.605
What you're going to do to create your template 
 is you're going to download the paper.

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:43.488
You're going to cut out that sheet of paper in 
 the shape of your bangs that you are wanting

00:00:43.774 --> 00:00:47.583
and then you're going to trace that onto a heavier card stock or cardboard.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:51.450
Go ahead and cut that out, and then you're ready to begin your process.

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.245
For your wefted hair,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.095
if you are using a weft that is a little bit too thin or 
 it's not as thick as you want your bangs to come in,

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:07.090
you're going to simply double up that weft and use a little 
 bit of fabric adhesive to hold the two pieces together.

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:11.098
You can use a foam adhesive, or you can use a fabric tack.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.264
If your hair is not perfectly straight, go ahead and 
 run a flat iron through it at this point.

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:20.050
We are doing the V style bangs.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:23.608
If you had wanted any of the hair to frame your face

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.641
you'd want to cut the weft just slightly wider than your template

00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:31.222
and then cut on the interior of that and 
 then leave the two sides hanging long.

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:36.426
We're just going to slide the weft onto our template

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:39.420
and clip it into place using the binder clips.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.710
The V style bangs are particularly tricky to cut.

00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:59.100
You want to make sure that you're always cutting towards the center point.

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:03.860
The reason for this is because if you 
 cut outward and your hair travels up

00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:06.100
you may accidentally notch out

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:07.660
a shorter piece.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.780
If you cut towards the center,

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.560
at worst it will be longer than you want, and you 
 can always go back through and trim that up.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.290
We're going to cut along the template

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:20.870
in very short, deliberate motions.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.610
We're going to make sure that that hair is straight down

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.480
at each point that we're cutting.

00:02:34.602 --> 00:02:38.350
Sometimes it helps if you kind of pin it 
 in place with your thumb as you cut.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.610
You might want to do an initial cut and then go back in

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:45.960
to clean up those extra stray hairs.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.480
So you can see how it's a little bit jagged.

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:56.870
So we're just going to push that hair along the 
 template and make sure that it's smoothed out.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.840
So I've got a long spot here.

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:11.600
And as long as when it's pushed out to the template

00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:14.200
that it has a nice, straight line

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.990
then it's not going to matter for when we style it.

00:03:18.312 --> 00:03:20.830
So we just want to make sure that it's following the template.

00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.080
And it looks like it's pretty close.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:25.470
So next, I'm just going to switch sides

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:27.870
and I'm going to cut down the other side.

00:03:29.942 --> 00:03:34.050
And we're just going to continue this until we have completed our cut style.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
The last step of the process is to 
 sew your weaving clips to your weft.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.560
Make sure that your tongs are pointed up

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:43.830
and not upside down.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.600
Otherwise, you won't be able to put it on at all.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.700
The first step is to take your sewing needle 
 and thread and go through the weft.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.040
Before you get to the end of your thread

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.840
take your needle and go through the loop.

00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:03.760
Then, take your weaving clip.

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:05.890
Put it in place.

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:07.330
And you're going to go

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:08.480
through the weft

00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:09.930
once.

00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:13.090
Twice.

00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:17.970
And three times.

00:04:23.657 --> 00:04:24.890
Next, you're going to go

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.200
back into the weft.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.230
And come out.

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.780
And then you're going to find where the 
 other hole of your weaving clip is

00:04:33.282 --> 00:04:36.870
and you're going to go down into the weft in that spot.

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:50.880
What that's going to do is it's going to 
 allow your thread to hide under your clip.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:53.630
You're going to come up

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.830
and you're going to go

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:56.620
in through

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.200
that spot

00:04:58.543 --> 00:04:59.060
once.

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:02.790
Twice.

00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:05.580
And you're probably guessing it...

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.590
Three times.

00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:19.310
Next, you're going to go back underneath your weft

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:21.130
and pull it back through.

00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:25.030
Pick up a small piece of the weft.

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:35.620
And then you're going to wrap your needle around your thread once, twice

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.270
and pull it tight to knot it.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.290
You're going to repeat that motion

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.910
one more time

00:05:42.284 --> 00:05:44.280
to make sure that that knot is good and secure.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.670
So pick up and small piece of the weft.

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.490
Once, twice and pull.

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:54.700
Clip away your thread.

00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:57.350
And repeat for the remainder

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.030
of your weaving clips.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.090
The last step in finishing your V style bangs

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:05.200
is to put some curvature in them so that 
 they match the curvature of your head.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.290
So we're just going to take our flat iron

00:06:07.887 --> 00:06:10.410
and we're just going to put a slight bump in them.

00:06:10.623 --> 00:06:13.070
That's a really subtle turn of the wrist.

00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.630
We're going to do that on both sides.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.850
And, now, they are ready to wear.

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:24.400
Just clip your bangs into place and use a 
 ribbon or a headband to cover the seam.
