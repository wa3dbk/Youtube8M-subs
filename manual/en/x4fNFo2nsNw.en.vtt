00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.420
In this American English pronunciation video,
we're going to go over how to pronounce this.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.480
Every once in a while, there's a word that's
hard for Americans to pronounce as well. For

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.189
example, I'm here in LA at the Tastemade studios,
and I've been watching a few friends recording

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.869
some cooking shows.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.640
&gt;&gt; So we need, now, I can never say this,
worcestershire.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
&gt;&gt; I say worcestershire.
&gt;&gt; Worcestershire? Ok, we'll go with that.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.920
&gt;&gt; We should ask Rachel from Rachel's English
later on.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.749
&gt;&gt; Yes. How to say that properly.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:39.739
&gt;&gt; A little bit of worcestershire sauce.
&gt;&gt; Or worcestershire.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.089
&gt;&gt; Wor-, or worcestershire? Nobody really
knows how to pronounce it.

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.129
&gt;&gt; We don't know.
&gt;&gt; We need to talk to Rachel.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.079
As you can see, they're not quite sure how
to pronounce this word, so, let's go over

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.010
it. This is one of the few cases where we're
actually retaining British English pronunciation.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.739
This sauce was first made in city of Worcester,
England. 'Shire' is the British equivalent

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.180
to our counties here in America, so this sauce
is simply named for region from which it comes,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.109
Worcestershire, where 'shire' sounds just
like the state name 'New Hampshire'.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:22.109
So, we drop the first R, and the vowel in
that syllable is the UH as in PUSH vowel,

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.659
wo-, wo-. So the lips will start in a tight
circle, and then they'll relax a bit out.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.770
But we still want a little bit of round for
that vowel. Wo-, wo-. This is the stressed

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.759
syllable. Then we have two unstressed syllables,
-stershire, -stershire, so they can be lower

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.759
in pitch and quicker. So we have the ST consonant
cluster, worcest-, -st-, so your teeth need

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.909
to come together for the S sound, tongue will
go to the roof of the mouth for the T, worcestershire.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.179
Now, the second two syllables have the schwa.
So, we need basically no jaw drop for those.

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.479
Worcestershire, -stershire. To make the SH
sound between the two -er- sounds, the tongue

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.030
will come forward a little bit. But the tongue
tip still doesn't need to be touching anything.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.780
And your teeth will stay together, sh. And
your lips will flare. Worcestershire. So,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.780
it's just three syllables. DA-da-da. Worcestershire.
Don't pronounce that first R, and also make

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.129
sure you put the schwa in the last syllable.
Some people will want to say 'shire', but

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.290
just like the state 'New Hampshire', -shire,
-shire, it's a schwa in that last syllable.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.030
I also appeared on the cooking show Hilah
Cooking, so click here to see that video.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.049
We made yummy Long Island Iced Teas. Also,
click here to see the two videos of recipes

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.680
that call for Worcestershire sauce, now that
you can confidently pronounce that word. All

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.030
the links are also in the video description.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.030
That's it, and thanks so much for using 
Rachel's English.
