00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.479
The university is the last bastion of hope
against the world

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:11.890
that would anesthetize us all. A world of
thinkers and experimentation,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.279
a world of ideals and ideas, a world
where tattoos and ties

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.450
are equally welcome.
My name's Joe Boomhower. I've worked here for 15 years.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.980
I came here by way of Veterans
Hospital,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.520
a small parish in the inner city, did

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.370
postgraduate work at Duquesne University.
And

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.960
after 15 years I thought I had

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.470
done my stint here, and I left in 2010

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.530
into '11 for a for parish

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.649
north of Butler, Pennsylvania.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.890
I love the faculty's passion for
what

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.750
they do. They're so focused, and they
want to present,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.900
in church terms, if you would like to put
it that way, they want to present their

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.230
discipline on the altar of

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.449
learning, but,

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.210
but as a sacrifice too, and in a good way. They sacrifice

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.500
that and their entire life for this, this

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.659
idea, and that's such a cool thing.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.500
They know that all it takes is one dreamer
with passion. One person. And they hope

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.400
in each of you, that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
you might be that one, who makes a
longer-lasting light bulb,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.979
who writes music for the ages, who reaches
into the mind and discovers a new star,

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.060
and who can change the world of a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.500
fifth grader. 
You know when you teach someone

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.470
you're giving up your future to them, and I
think that's what makes it a success.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.659
They do that unselfishly

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.850
and so do the staff from the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.290
top-down, from what I understand.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.580
We gather here to hope in you.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.440
 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.840
