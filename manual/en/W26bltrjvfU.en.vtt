Hi.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160
My name is Jason Keenan.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.960
I'm a biologist with Mississippi NRCS.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.059
I came to talk to you today about native grasses.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.470
Behind us what you'll see is a bunch of native
flowers that have been planted for pollinator

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.740
habitat and for insect production for small
birds.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.449
To the right that you'll see here, we actually
have a stand of native grasses - mostly this

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.660
is broom sedge but is basically from a result
of just a herbicide application.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.660
This is what came up.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.619
This is what was in the seed bank of the soil.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.210
The goal of the landowner here is this is
kind of an isolated block of habitat.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.390
You can see all the way around us is trees,
trees, trees and trees.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.079
This little bit of grass that's here is where
the turkeys are bedding, the deer are bedding

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.079
down.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.460
He's bringing in- he's got a couple of quail
here, he's bringing those in.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.579
Off to your right over here is a section of
pines that have not been thinned.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.910
There is no habitat underneath.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.039
It's kind of a biological desert.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:05.900
This is kind of a biological oasis for small
birds, ground nesting birds, migratory birds,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.270
deer, turkey, game animals.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.940
This is a stand of native grasses.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.720
Mostly what you see here of the shorter stuff
is called Broomsedge, Andropogon species.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.230
What you see behind me is actually a taller
Bluestem not a Broomsedge.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.160
Broomsedge is the shorter stuff, Bluestem
is the taller stuff.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.450
Other taller grasses that we have that our
native are Indian grass, switch grass.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.970
They'll look a little bit different than this.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.910
As you can see behind me that's been burned
and where it's much lower, you can see a lot

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.220
of forbs that are showing up as well.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.500
The whole purpose of these grasses are actually
the bunch grasses- how they grow and have

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.470
a space underneath for little animals like
little quail chicks and little rabbits to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.780
run through and be able to escape from predators.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.000
When you have a thatch grass or sod grass,
those little animals can't run through that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.580
nearly as well to be able to escape their
predators.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.810
They have better survival in these kind of
grasses and this is more of a natural habitat

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.299
for them.
