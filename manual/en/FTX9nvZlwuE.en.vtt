00:01:58.946 --> 00:02:02.369
Who's that girl there?

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.907
I wonder what went wrong

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.219
so that she had to roam the streets

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.148
She doesn't do major credit cards

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:09.698
I doubt she does receipts

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:12.716
It's all not quite legitimate

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:18.434
And what a scummy man

00:02:18.683 --> 00:02:20.254
Just give him half a chance

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.347
I bet he'll rob you if he can

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.459
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a driving ban

00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.323
amongst some other offences

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:34.534
And I've seen him with girls of the night

00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:39.745
and he told Roxanne to put on her red light

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.373
It's all infected but he'll be alright

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:49.091
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:20.079
He's a scumbag, don't you know?

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:44.637
Although you're trying not to listen

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:47.439
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:50.212
She makes a subtle proposition

00:03:50.324 --> 00:03:53.071
"I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down"

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:56.037
He must be up to something

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.751
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely

00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:01.587
I've got a feeling in my stomach

00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:03.746
I start to wonder what his story might be

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:05.746
What his story might be, yeah

00:04:05.803 --> 00:04:08.263
They said it changes when the sun goes down

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.108
They said it changes when the sun goes down

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:16.423
They said it changes when the sun goes down around here

00:04:16.562 --> 00:04:21.235
Around here

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:32.879
Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.588
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?

00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:38.399
And he don't have to say 'owt

00:04:38.562 --> 00:04:41.211
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:44.152
Bet she's delighted when she sees him

00:04:44.265 --> 00:04:46.986
Pulling in and giving her the eye

00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:49.869
Because she must be fucking freezing

00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:52.338
scantily clad beneath the clear night sky

00:04:52.436 --> 00:04:53.942
It doesn't stop in the winter, no

00:04:54.018 --> 00:04:56.519
And they said it changes when the sun goes down

00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:59.322
They said it changes when the sun goes down

00:04:59.376 --> 00:05:01.936
And they said it changes when the sun goes down

00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:04.956
Around here

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.908
And they said it changes when the sun goes down

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.792
over the river going out of town

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.382
They said it changes when the sun goes down

00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.987
Around here

00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:22.277
Around here

00:05:22.964 --> 00:05:25.368
And what a scummy man

00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:27.307
Just give him half a chance

00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:29.449
I bet he'll rob you if he can

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.343
Can see it in his eyes, yeah

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.548
that he's got a nasty plan

00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:38.483
I hope you're not involved at all

00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:53.519
Thank you very much
