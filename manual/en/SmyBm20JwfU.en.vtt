If you think Disneyland Resort Theme Parks
are just for kids, then I've got news for

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.540
you. It's a great place for adults to have
fun, too! There's so much to see and do from

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.259
day to night. In fact, you're going to need
multiple days to enjoy it all! Here are some

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.820
magical travel tips to help you plan an adults-only
visit to The Happiest Place on Earth.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.790
First, get your group excited about visiting
by sharing Disneyland Resort posts on Facebook

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.690
and Twitter. Next, ask everyone in your group
to explore m.disneyland.com on their mobile

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.190
devices or download the Disneyland Explorer
App - a free iPhone and iPad app. Both are

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.239
great tools to learn about attractions, entertainment
and dining options so you can compare notes

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.600
and start making plans together.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.359
For adults, I recommend Radiator Springs Racers
at Cars Land at Disney California Adventure

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.640
Park. By the way, the after-dark neon glow
of Radiator Springs is definitely a must-see!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.290
There's also an entertaining vibe happening
on Buena Vista Street and the Mad T Party

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.299
pulsates with lights, color and music. Plus,
there's no better way to re-connect with your

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.560
inner child than at the nighttime water spectacular
World of Color. Remember to take advantage

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.439
of Disney's FASTPASS Service on select attractions
that's included with valid theme park admission

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.560
that allows you to enjoy the Disneyland Resort
while your place in line is saved.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.869
Another great service is Disney's PhotoPass
-- it's the perfect way to get everyone in

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.530
the picture at the same time. Need help with
dining reservations? Head to Guest Relations

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.420
on Main Street U.S.A. in Disneyland Park,
or Buena Vista Street in Disney California

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.450
Adventure Park. You may want to check availability
at Carthay Circle Restaurant. It's exquisite

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.369
restaurant service, local wines and all the
cuisine of Southern California.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.859
Other popular choices for adults? The House
of Blues, Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.579
Catal Restaurant all in Downtown Disney District.
You can also save time by making table service

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.579
dining reservations up to 60 days in advance.
Call Disney Dining at 714-781-DINE or email

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.840
your reservation request to dine@disneyland.com.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.320
As you can see, adults can have a magical
time at the Disneyland Resort, too! After

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.440
all, why should kids have all the fun? See
you there!
