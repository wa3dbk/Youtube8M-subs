00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:10.162
I'd love to be the compassionate teacher;

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.606
the tough, but fair teacher.

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:16.588
But to my brilliant young minds,

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:22.602
these scholars for whom I'd stand up at all costs,

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.955
I'm the sweaty teacher.

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:27.951
Not the compassionate teacher who,

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:31.630
hey, by the way, happens to sweat,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.058
or even the teacher who sweats.

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:38.227
No. The sweaty teacher.

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:39.861
Adjective, sweaty

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:42.559
purposefully coming before noun, teacher,

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.542
as if to say, "This is Mr. Lamb.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:50.664
Do not define him by the profession he devotes his life to.

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:55.720
Define him by the geysers he calls armpits."

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.185
Every morning, I wake up in a cold...

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.603
nevermind.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:04.743
The easy-going teacher says,

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:06.659
"I shouldn't sweat it."

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.865
The loud teacher says,

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.632
"YEAH YOU SHOULDN'T SWEAT IT!"

00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:15.432
But even the empathetic teacher doesn't understand.

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:18.099
I've got funny teacher potential.

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.174
I used to pretend the notes I confiscated in class

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:22.932
were thank you letters.

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.502
Acknowledgements of my great teaching.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:29.515
"Oh ho ho, you shouldn't have!"

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:34.252
Until I intercepted one about a Mr. Stank Pits.

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.438
No, really. You shouldn't have.

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:41.083
Ever since I've started developing quirky habits

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.795
to deflect attention,

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.551
to become someone new:

00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:46.689
the teacher who shrugs his shoulders

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.012
really aggressively.

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:51.744
The teacher who tucks his tie into his pants

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.340
and pulls the end out his fly

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.301
because he's so wacky.

00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.902
But it's no use.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:04.957
Because I had the sweaty teacher, too, for geography.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:09.757
And to this day I cannot remember the capital of Bulgaria,

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:13.144
and the two bodies of water I know the most about

00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:17.378
sat below his shoulders.

00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:19.384
And now, I'm the one

00:02:19.384 --> 00:02:22.278
looking like I've got the Atlantic and Pacific

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:23.951
in headlocks.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:29.716
The one being asked, "How was the dunk tank?"

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.663
"There was no dunk tank!

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:36.237
We live in New Orleans and it is humid!"

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:40.031
is how I'd respond if I was the angry teacher.

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:43.330
Instead, I look the kid in the eye

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.943
as the sweat cascades down my nose,

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:50.459
and splatters onto his blank paper below,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.923
and I say, "I sweat because I am working my tail off

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:59.283
and I need you to do the same."
