00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.601
Hi guys my name is Eric St-Onge

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.896
and I'm a Cirque du Soleil artist and a personal trainer.

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:14.502
In today's video we'll be talking about stretching.

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.572
I will be covering two techniques.

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:20.393
PNF which is proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:22.996
which is a contract/relax technique

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.340
and static stretch.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.240
Always make sure that when you do stretching

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.480
that you warmed up before.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.420
You want to raise your body temperature

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.800
to a little sweat.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.360
We'll start with the PNF stretching.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.300
You want to contract and relax

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.500
the muscle that want to be stretched.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.689
When contracting the muscle

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.912
you don't need an extreme contraction

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:45.220
you just want a slight contraction

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.480
and then you relax.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.360
So for PNF stretching

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.250
for the quad

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.420
you just rest your foot on the ball

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.850
this is the start position

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.180
if it's too much of a stretch

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.260
just move your knee forward

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.960
if you need a bigger stretch

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.639
then you bring your knee back

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.780
you wanna push down on the ball

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.413
for 5 seconds as you inhale

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.880
and then you exhale for 5 seconds.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.880
You don't want to blow up the swiss ball

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.830
you just want a slight contraction

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.660
to activate the muscle.

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:15.277
And push. Straight position with your chest.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.840
You want to go 3 to 5 contract/stretch cycle.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
Now I will show you stretching exercise for your glute.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.400
You want to start on all four

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.267
you bring one leg forward

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.410
it's the pigeon pose in yoga

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.420
so bring one leg forward

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.000
the knee like this

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.400
and you stretch the back leg.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.300
If you don't feel big enough of a stretch

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.060
you can just bring the foot forward.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.220
You want to push your knee down at the ground

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.180
so you push for 5 seconds as you inhale

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.660
and you relax as you breathe out.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960
Next muscle we will be stretching is the hamstring.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.300
One foot forward

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.320
on your heel

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.860
you want to just slightly bend your knee

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.140
and move forward.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.160
And think about bending your leg

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.980
like this as you push down on the ground.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.960
So you bend, push for 5 seconds

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.480
and then you relax for 5 as you breathe out.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.940
And then you can lean forward

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.417
keeping a straight back.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.280
You don't want to stretch like this.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.180
You want to always have proper technique.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:37.957
When doing a push up

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.000
the two major muscles that are working

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.720
is your pec muscle

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.980
minor and major

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.260
and your tricep.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.460
So the pec major

00:02:48.025 --> 00:02:49.865
you rest forearm on the ball

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.480
you can use a chair or couch, anything.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.488
Keep your shoulder parallel to the floor

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.132
and you don't want any pain in your shoulder joint.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.480
So same principle

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.700
you will inhale and push on the swiss ball

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.900
and then as you breathe out, exhale

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.700
you will just relax and bring your chest towards the floor.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.260
For the pec minor

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.100
it's basically the same exercise

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.060
but you will be resting your

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.660
bend your arms you rest your shoulder on the swiss ball

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.320
same principle.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.209
To stretch the tricep

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.389
you want to get in this position

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.540
you want to either hold your wrist

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.440
or forearm.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.720
Get in this position

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.220
to activate the tricep

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.120
you will be pushing against the holding hand

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.920
so you push 5 as you push up

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.560
slight contraction again

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.400
and then you just pull it for 5.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.560
Here's some exercises to stretch your abs.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.540
You want to lay down on the floor

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.960
it's called a McKenzie press up

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.080
wrist about shoulder height

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.260
make sure you don't contract your butt and leg muscles.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.240
So what you want to do you will inhale

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.980
and as you exhale you'll be pushing from your hands

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.340
towards the ground

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.840
and you keep your pelvis on the ground.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.440
Bring your belly button in.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.900
So you don't collapse your back.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.840
I'll show you now two exercises with the swiss ball

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.940
to stretch your abs.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.900
The first one will be for the abs like this

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.354
and the second one will be for your obliques.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.034
I'll start with the first one.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.140
Here's a warning before doing this stretch

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.640
if when you look up at the sky

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.160
and birds or airplanes

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.360
you feel dizzy

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.599
you shouldn't be doing this exercise.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.420
Lean back

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280
and then you stretch your arms

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.820
and right away you should feel

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.860
you should feel a stretch.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.000
And you can complete full stretch by

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.640
stretching your legs

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.000
 and just resting your head on the ball.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.120
You want to keep that stretch for a minute.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.500
Second exercise using a swiss ball

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.880
will be for your obliques.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.480
You want the bottom leg in the front

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.120
the top leg in the back

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.040
and then what you can do is just roll back and forth

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:27.455
to feel where is the tension.

00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:29.345
Once you feel a tension

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.700
just stay there

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.187
and you will activate the muscle

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:33.780
by pushing your elbow up

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.600
in this hand.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.920
Push for 5 as you inhale

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.480
and relax for 5.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.160
Here's a static stretch for your hamstring.

00:05:52.653 --> 00:05:54.413
You want to lay on your back

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:59.725
clasp your hands together behind your knee

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.140
rest your head

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.800
you come up

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.400
straighten the leg

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.400
and just hold it there

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.660
and then you relax

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.400
and you do it again.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.920
Here's a static stretch for the quadricep.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.400
So you just pull until you feel the stretch.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.520
You don't want to push your hips forward

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.280
because this way you will stretch your hip flexor

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.616
what we want now is to stretch the quad.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.140
If you can't grab your ankle

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.963
you can put a towel around it and hold the towel like this

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.200
One thing is important...don't overdo the stretch.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.000
because you create some injury and connectivity issues

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.280
and your body could react against the stretch

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.820
preventing some injury.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.600
The muscle is gonna contract

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.120
so that's why you just want to relax into it

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.500
think about your breathing

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.580
and just let it go slowly.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.460
