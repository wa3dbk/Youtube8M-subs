00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.616
My name is Madeleine Kohl, I am from South-Tyrol

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:08.499
and study at Andrássy University in Budapest.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.851
I am Phlipp Siegert from Germany

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:13.397
and study at Andrássy University in Budapest.

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:16.603
My name is Shoasil, I am from Uzbekistan

00:00:16.603 --> 00:00:19.707
and study at Andrássy University in Budapest.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.043
I am Mirjana, I am from Croatia

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:24.893
and study at Andrássy University in Budapest.

00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:27.390
The university is very small; everybody knows everybody,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.151
and it has a friendly atmosphere.

00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.221
This is what I missed at my previous university.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:40.974
The strong collegiality between the students and the professors is what I particularly like,

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:50.352
that the focus here does not only lie on the academic development, but also on the personal relations.

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:56.386
I am very satisfied with the professors. Many of them are diplomats

00:00:56.386 --> 00:01:02.573
and share their practical experiences in the lectures, which is what I especially like.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:12.688
Small, exquisite and friendly, beautiful premises, we know each other and spend a lot of time together.

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:20.566
The building itself is incredibly wonderful, and the library is beautifully established.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:27.859
Because of the small seminar groups we can profit much more from the academic performance of the professors, 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.013
than it would be the case in a lecture of 100-200-300 students. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.928
As we work in small groups, we know each other, and the professors know us,

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:40.924
therefore the relationship between the students and the professors is very personal.

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:46.801
We enjoy organising programmes apart from the lectures, we go to pubs in the evenings,

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:54.160
or go on excursions together and take part in many cultural programmes as well. The community is fantastic.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.445
 It is so friendly, you get so close, you don’t want to miss the others.

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:05.816
You simply enjoy yourself. That’s it.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.378
I work here at this law firm, CMS in Budapest. This is an English office, which has set up a branch in Hungary.

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:27.051
I established a German desk, this is practically a German department, and I as a German lawyer in Hungary am responsible for the German clients.

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:34.142
The colleagues I got to know at that time, who I studied together with, are now my best friends or still colleagues in my work today.

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:40.097
At the moment I work at the Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation as a scientific assistant and the personal assistant of the director here in Budapest.

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:48.028
Andrássy University provided me great help, as we learnt and experienced so many things,

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:53.584
which proved to be very useful later in my professional life.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.822
Andrássy Uni with German as its official language was built on traditions, where everything is examined with a European aspect.

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:14.171
I believe that this comparative aspect shall be very important in the future Europe.

00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:28.845
The experience of studying in German is an outstanding possibility, especially in Hungary, where the roots of the German culture are strongly present.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.434
As a German-speaking university Andrássy is the bridgehead of science in Central and Western Europe well into the southern and eastern European regions,

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:46.351
and this peculiarity shall be expressed in its programmes and research activities.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:55.164
I think it is absolutely sure that this university has its future here in Hungary, as a Hungarian state university with German being its official language,

00:03:55.164 --> 00:04:03.484
and with the support of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Austria and the Federal Republic, that is Berlin.

00:04:03.484 --> 00:04:11.836
I would recommend studying at Andrássy, because it provides an ideal combination of theory and practice.

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:15.544
If you are looking for that you are at the best place.

00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:26.064
You simply enjoy coming to this university, you look forward to the lectures, to meet your fellow students and to listen to the professors.

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:34.722
I would strongly recommend studying at Andrássy, because I think it provides outstanding opportunities for your academic as well as your personal development.

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:42.952
I stronlgy believe that it is really worth studying at Andrássy University. We make our students fit for Europe as our slogan says.

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:51.259
The international environment of the university and the European aspect make this university unique.
