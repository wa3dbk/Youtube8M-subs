00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.765
Who wants to have a jet pack to fly around with?

00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:04.334
Me!

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:10.885
Who wants to have special robot legs that make you go faster?

00:00:13.477 --> 00:00:14.519
No? You don't want that?

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.206
Only Zachary wants that?

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:17.893
I want that.

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:21.567
Who would want another eye?

00:00:23.052 --> 00:00:27.184
Oh yeah, I want three eyes in the back of my head, but they're covered in hair.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.849
What do you think humans need to improve them?

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.845
A female Marine veteran has become the world's first true bionic woman--

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:39.701
-we're already part artificial, aren't we?

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.863
If there were a drug that would make you smarter, would you take it?

00:00:42.863 --> 00:00:46.077
Is the quest for a perfect baby morally wrong?

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:49.989
A sprinter, who's running with prosthetic legs faster than most people in the world.

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:52.884
-it will redefine the field.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.423
We're used to a certain amount of artificiality, but this is taking it to a whole new level.

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:01.265
-it's happening now.

00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:05.917
What does it mean when you can augment the mind, if you can improve memory?

00:01:05.937 --> 00:01:06.957
What does it mean if you could augment the body?

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:13.247
In the future, emerging genetic technologies coupled with assisted reproductive technologies 

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:15.668
could give us the capacity to design enhanced children,

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:23.062
which causes concerns about creating genetic castes and super humans.   

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:27.269
There have been so many advances even in the past few years, that I think

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:33.000
people are aware, more aware at least, how quickly the technologies are moving.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.500
Us humans, especially us baby boomers, are really gonna want augmentation pretty soon

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:42.974
as we start to decay, we're gonna be demanding more and more augmentation.

00:01:43.974 --> 00:01:44.997
I'd like to have a better memory.

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:48.308
Maybe with-- memory chips, or something.

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:51.139
I'd probably want to be taller so I could play for the NBA.

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.284
Well I just turned fifty so memory is sort of an issue.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.161
I'm happy who I am.

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.750
I actually don't need anything.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.091
I mean, if i could fly maybe it would be okay.

00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:15.406
Am I disabled?

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.866
That depends which definition we use.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:20.398
Of course I'm a disabled person.

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:25.505
Do I see myself as an impaired person? No.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:27.849
I'm just who I am.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.765
There's all kinds of dynamics which go around this obsession with ability and competitiveness,

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:38.450
and that the only way to get respect is if you show you are superior to someone else.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.377
Ableism is our obsession with certain abilities and 

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:50.920
the accompanying negative treatment of people who don't have these kinds of abilities.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.650
Human enhancement is no different than human.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.499
Everything from brain implants to spinal cord injury rehab to cell phones to gaming: 

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.981
there is no difference between them.

00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:14.562
What if this kind of collaboration with a machine

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:18.500
was flexible enough to allow the user to do whatever they want with it?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.524
You want to make a device that has

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:27.228
a sophisticated enough collaboration that that human will make it an arm,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.232
in their own way, in their own image.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:35.432
My artificial limbs are now part of my body. They are part of my identity now.

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:38.532
What I'd like to see is the death of normalcy.

00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:41.432
What is normal to you? 

00:03:41.432 --> 00:03:46.780
I thought I was normal before my injury-I certainly still feel normal today.

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:52.500
I really don't understand the desire for enhancement technologies-- we don't have basic healthcare,

00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:54.182
not only in this country but globally.

00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:03.535
Preventable diseases are number one killers globally.

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.968
Talk about misplaced priorities.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.687
It is this huge irony that the research money goes into emerging technologies as opposed to wheelchairs that are waterproof?

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.599
That demonstrates the financial priorities of the healthcare system.

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:24.783
Wheelchairs are amazing, and that's really precious and at the same time it's a machine.

00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:30.979
You know, I'm subject to its frailties.

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.121
You know, like any machine. 

00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:35.162
So it makes me feel pretty vulnerable. 

00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:39.013
(Where are the hand controls?)

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:42.224
(Daddy, here are the hand controls.)

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:45.884
People should think of disability as another human experience

00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:47.908
(Alright, ready?)

00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:53.822
that embodies qualities of human adaptability

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:56.776
that are common to all people, whether they have a specific disability or not,

00:04:58.776 --> 00:05:03.915
and the experiences of people with disabilities have lessons for the population at large.

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:06.381
Technologies that help bring people up to normal

00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:08.539
are used to help people go beyond normal.

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.044
Often when I talk about implants to people,

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.949
they say "Oh that's too icky.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.158
No one would do that willingly, no one would have a cochlear implant

00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:17.298
if they weren't deaf, if they didn't need it.

00:05:17.298 --> 00:05:21.808
No one would have a visual implant if they didn't need it."

00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:30.262
And I say to them: Botox. People will do anything to their bodies for enhancement, social enhancement.

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:33.568
If you force me to see myself as deficient, 

00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:37.545
and you want me to enhance myself to your level,

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:42.342
then I of course will say no, I go further, and then you are deficient because I outdo you.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:47.771
I mean, why would I want to have legs which only get me to your level?

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:52.191
Every line we draw will be transgressed in the next

00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:54.598
ten, twenty, thirty, fifty years,

00:05:54.598 --> 00:06:02.066
and we are gonna see more and more augmentations, alterations of our bodies as the technologies develop.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:09.411
These genetic technologies assume that human variation along a spectrum of ability 

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.400
should be eliminated.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.556
We have these technological developments, they're not inevitable,

00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:21.372
but they do have a lot of momentum behind them, and so we at this point in human history

00:06:21.372 --> 00:06:28.206
we're at this moment where it's our responsibility to really look at them carefully,

00:06:28.216 --> 00:06:30.634
and really make decisions.
