Gooood morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
So, we're undergoing a pretty significant
office reorganization project, and along the

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.519
way I found a lot of documents from my past
like, uh, this old picture of me.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.519
Good news, little me.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.009
Your braces are going to come off!

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.190
In six more years.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.289
I also found this somewhat newer picture of
me.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.240
I'm not sure if this is a photograph, but
it's definitely realistic.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.320
And from 2006, my favorite fan mail ever,
"In regards to Looking For Alaska I can honestly

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.380
say that after putting your book down I felt
a feeling that I had not felt before.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.099
It was not a sickness, like I was going to
throw up.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.860
Or a feeling like I had to take a crap or
anything.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.020
But I felt something."

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.910
Your book made me feel something, man.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.270
Not the two main things I feel: the urges
to defecate and vomit, but something new.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.000
And Hank, I also found, from way back in 1994,
some of my report cards.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.110
This is from my junior year of high school,
Hank.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.340
I got a C- in Latin, "John went into a tailspin
in this course during the last 6 weeks.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.960
He missed too many classes and seldom was
prepared for the daily lesson."

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.740
Yeah, that's Latin; that's a dead language.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.440
This is from my, uh, French - got a B- in
French, not to brag.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.280
"It's safe to say that John underachieved
this year."

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280
Hmm.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.600
American history, I got a B, "John managed
to get to class more often during the final

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
trimester, and his grade came up - a bit."

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.340
That wasn't necessary, to say "A bit."

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.630
Could have just ended it at my grade came
up.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.630
It's technically accurate.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.650
I got a C- in Pre-Calc, which frankly, was
probably generous.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.240
In chemistry, C. And in English I got a, uh,
C-, "Incredible potential as an English student,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.230
but he's reached a juncture where he just
can't mail it in anymore."

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.890
Hank, I don't talk much about what a terrible
student I was in high school.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.390
I think partly because I'm still embarrassed
about it, 20 years later.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.000
I did miss a lot of classes, you know, because
they were early, or because they conflicted

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.640
with my schedule of smoking cigarettes in
the woods.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.390
But even when I attended class, I was still
a pretty terrible student.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.550
Hank, you know how you become the third best
C-student in the entire state of Alabama at

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.440
academic decathlon?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.830
First by getting terrible grades so you're
not an A or B student.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.830
And that's who I was in high school.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.799
I underachieved, and I skipped classes, and
I didn't do my homework, and I didn't do the

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.680
reading, and I was always behind and stressed
out.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.960
Meanwhile, Hank, you were getting great grades,
and not smoking cigarettes, and then you'd

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.729
get a scholarship to college and everything.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.429
Anyway, Hank, coming across these report cards
made me think a couple things.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.230
The first is that I was incredibly lucky.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.120
Like I didn't just get a second chance -- I
got hundreds of chances.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.890
And even though I was a crap student, I still
had excellent teachers who continued to believe

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.760
in me despite my not giving them a reason
to.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.590
The other thing these old report cards made
me think about, Hank, was this: High school

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.360
is not destiny.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.700
It's part of life, but I feel like when you're
in high school, people act like it's the most

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.010
important thing you'll ever do, and like the
whole course of your life is being decided.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.200
But at least so far as I can tell, the course
of your life isn't decided.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Ever.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.240
Most of the time it's not like there's one
fork in the road, and you choose one, or you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240
choose the other.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.300
There are hundreds of forks in the road every
day that you're alive.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.480
College is also not destiny.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.599
For the record, I was a much better college
student than I was a high school student.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.060
Also your 20s are not destiny!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.590
Your 30s are not destiny!

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.660
Like, destiny is not something that happens
all at once.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.670
It's something that happens only in retrospect.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.760
Hank, when I was in high school, I thought
I was just, kind of, a screw up.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760
You know?

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.360
But in the end, Hank, people aren't just one
thing.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.380
Like I WAS a screw up, but I was also a pretty
good reader.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.370
And looking at those old report cards, I just
want to thank my teachers for knowing that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.660
I wasn't just a screw up - even when I didn't
know it.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.030
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
