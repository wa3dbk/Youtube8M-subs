00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.769
Hi guys, I'm Laura vitale [on] this episode of Laura in the kitchen

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.649
I'm going to show [you] how to make a twice baked potato

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.799
[I] love these and they're great [for] side dish for thanksgiving or any holidays my [dummy] that might be coming up

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.080
Or just a society in general because of that delicious, so let me take your ready ingredients, so we can get started

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.599
Running some potatoes that I roasted in the oven so that's so nice and tender you need some whole milk

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.699
Some chopped bacon some grated sharp cheddar sour cream finely chopped green onions some butter and salt and pepper

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.479
That's it. So you can simple now for the potatoes

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.000
these are just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.799
Baking Russet potatoes that I've cooked in a 400 degree oven and they baked for around an hour or [until] they're you know fully softened

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.390
And cooked through and I just took them out of the oven so these are going to see her for [a] few minutes until they

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.950
Cool just enough for me to handle them. So now the first thing. I need to work on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.190
if I can get the stove on is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.649
Crisping up the Bacon now in this little skillet. I'm just going to add my bacon and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.219
I'm just going to cook [that] until it's nice and crispy [and] at the same time in this little back

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.480
Saucepan

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.279
Right here. I'm gonna warm up my milk with the butter

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.090
Just until the milk is nice and warm and the butter is melted

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.169
It doesn't need to be boiling, and you don't want it to come to a boil just want it to be a nice simmer

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.360
So just keep an eye on both of these and in the meantime. I'm just going to tidy up just a little bit

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.730
I'm gonna just wait for these potatoes to cool a little [bit] longer

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.990
Just Gonna remove my bacon to a clean Bowl

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.870
With a slotted spoon because I don't want the bacon grease to go into the potatoes [just]

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.980
[going] to get rid of that my butter mixture is perfect the butter is melted

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.260
The milk is nice and warm

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.139
I never recommend adding cold milk to mashed potato ever because what happens is

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.089
It gives you that awful like wallpaper paste consistency

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.979
Which I hate my mashed potatoes to be perfect anything that has go with my fraternity's be fluffy doesn't need to be done gluey

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.079
Consistency so I've hacked my potatoes and now I'm going to scoop out the flesh, but you want to leave like a quarter-inch border around

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.719
Because that's you know I'm going to keep your potato together otherwise if you want to take the whole thing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.819
[it'd] fall apart so like that see there's a little border. That's what you want. So just

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.489
continue to do them all

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.090
Once you have all the flesh in your bowl. You're just going to take a masher and mash this up now

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.870
I have to tell you I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.870
am so passionate about

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.329
Potatoes, [I] just I love potatoes. [oh], I mean I could eat them anyway. I think that [a] good

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.519
Really good twice baked potato perhaps to have some kind [of] cheese in it

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.499
And it has to have something that just takes it from like just a regular baked potato which it's great with a little bit of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.319
Butter and some pepper too something that's really worth putting your time and effort into so this I [think] is really delicious

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.168
[but] [now] chew my potatoes want to season these really well with salt and pepper

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.719
because potatoes really need salt because I don't really taste like a whole lot and

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.908
So I just can't wait to make these. I love you know bacon Cheddar. I mean please how bad can that possibly be

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.549
[but] I also do love [dutchess] potatoes too which I think I'm going to have to share with you guys soon

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.608
If you um if you want to share what your favorite potato dishes down below please feel free to

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.198
My was getting trying to get see no suggestions from you guys. That's what inspires me

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.319
You know I cook a lot and a lot of the times it comes from you

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.018
[and] I post on my Facebook and then you guys say oh

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.539
I wish you could make this right wish you could make that that's when I get into the kitchen and I start cooking up

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:59.989
So anyway

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.948
I'm adding my butter and milk mixture a [little] bit at a time because

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.449
you know what sometimes you may need the whole thing and sometimes you may not so

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.809
it's really something [I] would put a little bit of a time here a little bit [there] just to kind of get it to the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.629
perfect

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.978
Texture that looks perfect to me. I'm going to add in [some] sour cream. [I] like the nice tankiness that it provides

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.948
also going to add in some scallions

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:33.229
the finely chopped some of this cheddar not the whole thing I'm going to just use [some] of that and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340
finally the crispy bacon

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.449
Now just stir everything together until everything is really [nicely] mixed

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.729
Awesome, so now. I'm just going to take this mixture and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.869
Spoon it into your little potato boat. That's it

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.779
That's simple and easy

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.680
Okay, so now that they're all filled. I'm just going to scatter this cheese over the top

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.159
I know. This is like really indulging a potato dish, but trust me when I tell you it is worth it

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:18.049
So just do your best scatter is evenly as possible because you never want to gyp anybody or special around the holidays

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.930
You want them to all feel?

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:23.089
after getting the proper respect they deserve

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:31.219
okay, now I have the oven cranked up to 425 and [I'm] just going to pop these babies in for 10 to 15 minutes or

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.719
Until the cheese is nice and melted and the potato mixture is nice and warmed all the way through

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.719
I'll show you what they look like when they're done

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.389
My potatoes [just] baked for 10 minutes and look at me. I'm ready these look so

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:53.299
amazingly delicious, I just got to get into one of these immediately you should probably let them cool a little bit but

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.989
I'm going to just go right in because I just can't take it. Just look so good and I eat the skin and everything

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.779
[well], you know before I roasted the potatoes

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.789
If I baked them I did scrub them really well, so I will eat the skin as well. [I] love the crunchiness

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.750
Mmm, all right I got it mmM

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.460
It is so delicious

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:33.139
And I do understand that a lot of people are gonna say that's a really indulging potato it is but it's the holidays

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.240
It's you know. I don't like this every [day]

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:42.459
But it's the holidays so I can't like the excuse I'm in again for another bite if you want this recipe

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.199
And I'm telling you you need this [recipe] in [your] life because it is just divine
