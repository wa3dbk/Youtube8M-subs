00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:11.500
So, to start your hula hoop vortex we're going
to start with the hoop around our waist.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.440
You can also start in lasso with the hoop
above your head.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.600
I'll demonstrate both of those.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.609
But you learn each section in two parts.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.650
Basically the first section, you learn how
to lift the hoop off.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.320
And the second section you learn how to put
the hoop back on your waist.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.289
Then you put them together and that's your
vortex.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.210
And it looks like this.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.800
Okay?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.309
So, we're going to start on our waist.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.250
You've got the hoop going around your waist.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.600
If you hoop to the left, you're going to take
your right hand.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.100
And if you hoop to the right you'll reverse
everything.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.270
So, my right hand behind my back.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.170
As far over as I can get it.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.170
All the way to my left hip.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.670
So right hand crossing my back to my left
hip.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.830
If this is touch for your shoulder flexibility,
just do some simple stretches to get that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
arm nice and flexible so you can reach behind
your back.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.590
So, once you've got your hand in behind your
back notice when the hoop is touching your

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.590
hand.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.240
So, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.211
That's when you're going to grab the hoop.

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:32.940
So as it touches your hand you're going to
grab it.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.670
You're then going to bring the hoop against
your body and straight up in front of you.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.550
Then from there you're going to give the hoop
some momentum to continue that rotation.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.119
So, one more time slowly.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.570
Hoop around my waist.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.049
Hand against my back.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.659
Pull straight up.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.990
And then I've got my lasso over my head.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.340
Let's do that one more time just a little
bit faster.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.200
I'll do it once facing the front and once
facing the back.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.680
So, straight up.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.599
And facing back.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.529
Grab straight up.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.560
So, that's section one.
