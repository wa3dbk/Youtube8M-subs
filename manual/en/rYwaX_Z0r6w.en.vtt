Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.881
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:24.996
First, cut the sashimi-grade boiled octopus into bite-size pieces.

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:30.320
There are many tentacles but don’t be scared.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.714
They will not attack you.

00:00:33.977 --> 00:00:39.697
Make numerous cuts in the octopus pieces, making them easier to eat.

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:46.529
With kitchen paper, remove the excess water from each piece 

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:51.049
and place it onto a tray covered with all purpose flour.

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:56.482
Then, thoroughly coat the octopus with the flour.

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:04.987
Next, combine the potato starch and cake flour.

00:01:09.125 --> 00:01:13.170
Sieve the powder into a bowl of cold water.

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:18.666
Lightly stir the mixture with a balloon whisk.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:24.300
Then, add the beni shoga, pickled ginger 

00:01:25.988 --> 00:01:28.135
and aonori seaweed.  

00:01:30.363 --> 00:01:34.296
Mix until there are no pockets of dry flour.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:40.094
Now, let’s deep-fry the tempura.

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:47.122
Coat the octopus pieces with the tempura batter 

00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:54.212
and deep-fry them at 180 °C (360 °F) for about 30 seconds.

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:03.297
Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot splashing oil.

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:08.719
Lightly stir with chopsticks to cook evenly.

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.554
Octopus easily becomes tough 

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:15.807
so quickly remove the pieces with a mesh strainer 

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:19.324
as soon as the outside gets crispy.

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:23.360
Place the pieces onto a cooling rack.

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:29.804
Then, arrange the the tempura onto a plate.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:40.782
Octopus is a healthy ingredient that is low in calories but rich in protein.

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:46.791
It helps prevent high blood pressure and has a beneficial effect on the liver.

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:03.212
The hot frying oil can easily splash in this recipe 

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:07.144
so make sure to have a lid on hand to cover.

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:09.330
Good luck in the kitchen.
