Hello

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.420
on this episode of Doctor Mad Science

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.740
Today's experiment we are going to make SILLY PUTTY

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.820
this is silly putty, this is going to be the end result of the experiment

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.080
All we have today: Water of H20, Food Coloring,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.140
a mixing stick, glue, and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.189
borax. The first thing to do

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.189
is to put water into the glue.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.290
The second step is to add food coloring.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.579
Then mix it up.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.780
That will be good enough.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.309
Then grab your other water and add it to the borax.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.309
Then mix it up.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.990
Now,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.270
The final step is where the magic happens.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.070
Ok, I have my borax and this solution.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.140
I'm going to add both solutions together

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.140
Then its TIME TO STIR IT UP!

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.119
If it is still to sticky, add more borax.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.330
When you are able to take it out your silly putty

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.120
and roll it around.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.790
Yeah when you done with the Silly Putty

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.000
put it in a plate

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.140
and it will turn like this one.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.510
I really hoped you enjoyed

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.670
making your own silly putty

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.650
and watch my upcoming experiment.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.870
That is how to make silly putty. That is how you do the experiment.
