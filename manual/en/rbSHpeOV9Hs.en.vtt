At Audimute Soundproofing, we love hearing from our customers and seeing how our products

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:12.749
contribute to their sound success.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.609
This is the sound booth that I built

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.519
and i'm using the uh... Audimute

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.449
sound absorption sheets.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.229
You first notice

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.890
on the door,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.890
I have a sheet on the door.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.870
In the booth,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.390
I have sheets hanging from

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.330
the ceiling down to the floor.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.609
I got the three foot by eight foot

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.180
sheets.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.310
And besides the walls,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.310
I have them on the ceiling as well.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.399
