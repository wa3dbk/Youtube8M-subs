00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.940
Make this cool DIY take on a drum ‘shade’
with a super simple technique.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.240
The pattern’s predictable, but the mix of
materials sure isn’t….this project’s

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.940
woven with wire and wood veneer.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.400
The dimensions are definitely flexible depending
on your needs, but for a shade this size,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.890
cut a piece of hardware cloth, you may know
it as chicken wire or poultry netting- 15

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.590
inches wide by 76-1/2 inches long.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.270
Wrap the piece into a cylinder – holding
the overlapping ends together,. then count

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.870
the number of ‘grids’ or ‘squares’
there are including the overlapping ends.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.800
You need a final number that’s divisible
by 3 - so make any adjustments, and then go

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.920
ahead and wire the ends in place.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.810
Now you can divide the number of grids by
3, and that’s the number of vertical strips

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.190
to cut for your weaving.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.150
The vertical strips should be about 18-inches
long…you want that extra length so you have

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.920
some give while you’re weaving in and out
of the mesh.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.890
Don’t try to work too quickly, and be gentle
with the veneer…because it can snap if you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.520
tug or bend too hard.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.080
Weave the pieces starting inside the shade,
working your way from top to bottom..

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.170
As you’re weaving – it’s important to
know where any wider horizontal strips will

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.780
play into your pattern, so you can leave enough
room for them to slip under the vertical strips.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.430
Once all the vertical strips are in place,
go ahead and weave in your horizontal pieces

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.390
– it’s a little easier to work with shorter
pieces here, so cut lengths that are long

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.030
enough to tuck the ‘tails’ under a vertical
for a nice neat look.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.380
With all your weaving done – trim the tails
of the verticals to length.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.330
To help maintain the shape and provide a place
to ‘attach’ the shade to your light, measure

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.340
and mark two square dowels.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.370
Drill holes in the ends and add screweyes
so you can attach the dowels to the shade.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.229
Using an existing pendant light, or get a
kit, and slip the cord between the two dowels

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.380
and ziptie them together.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.760
Then you can wire the screweyes at the ends
of the dowels to the mesh. ,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.380
graphic and current – the shade adds a whole
new dimension to your lighting.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.220
