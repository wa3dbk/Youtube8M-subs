00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.380
Hey, it's me, the Korean Alex

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.920
Since we're friends...

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.000
I'll give you some advice

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.380
The spicy pork cutlet (Tonkatsu) at Sindebang...

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.120
Don't eat it

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.200
From now, let's do a mini-"behind the scenes"

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:26.853
We had the spicy tonkatsu

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:28.793
30 minutes before

00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:32.153
Still, my stomach is...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040
It's as if...

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.040
I ate...

00:00:41.614 --> 00:00:42.614
knives

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 If I have more milk

00:00:56.754 --> 00:00:57.754
I think I'll puke

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.540
so...

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:04.654
Was it fun?

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:05.794
The Challenge?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.780
Yea

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.540
You gonna try it?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080
Hell no

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:17.294
How about you, David?

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:42.554
This...from now...

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.360
I had the spiciest thing in Korea

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.440
I'm done with spicy food contests

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:04.633
Watermelon bar

00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:17.794
This doesn't hurt

00:02:17.794 --> 00:02:19.034
My tongue doesn't hurt

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:20.493
My lips? Don't hurt

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:23.694
My face doesn't hurt

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.060
Here

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.120
(stomach)

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:31.740
Stomach
