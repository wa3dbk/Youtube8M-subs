00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.189
what we found in these papers is very
exciting we basically use number two at

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.660
c_ l_ against to gain insights into
metabolism and how it is connected to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.169
diet which has major implications for
human health

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.259
we briefly found that c l_ against which
is a bacteria four

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.539
candy different bacteria and can respond
to that by dramatically changing it's

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.240
gene expression program

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.070
and that them leads to a dramatic
changes in physiology briefly the worms

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.599
i have

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.879
offspring they've shorter and developed
much faster when they eat unnatural soil

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.210
bacterium when compared to the stand at
the park three type of e_-coli we start

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.190
by asking how diet exerts physiological
facts i animal

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.160
we fed them arm salience to different
bacterial diets alley discovered that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.360
diet a fax regulator that controls more

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.840
and in the wyrm molting determines
developmental rate

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.870
but importantly the same regulator in
humans control sikkim rhythms

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260
which is also affected by diet

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.490
and this is one example of the insights
we can gain using the wire mazza system

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.140
an example of a question that that can
be addressed was what we did in the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.210
second paper where we ask

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.390
what are the e_c_ elegance or the one
networks that are involved in mediating

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.479
the dietary response to the soil
bacterium

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.640
and what we found remarkably is that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
when you get turned genes involved in
the title is them this leads to the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.000
metabolic imbalances that can interfere
with the dietary response to better

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.120
understand the molecular mechanisms by
which time bbechstein expression in the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.040
word

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.140
high-performance complimentary to
extremes to which we haven't tried seems

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.570
that and or response to that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.250
and what we discovered is actually a
large network of metabolic and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.159
regulatory teens xing integrate internal
cellular needs an imbalance is with

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.600
external dietary availabilities and
communicate with information processing

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.210
teens to elicit program response an
animal we started out with asking a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.570
dietary question in the world

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.089
and got an answer that directly relates
to disease

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:14.839
and dietary treatment in humans we now
have a very tractable system namely the

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.049
number two in c l_ against ask precise
questions as to which components and

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:19.860
diet

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.590
can affect gene expression

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.379
and life-history traits arrested or the
physiological traits

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.759
how this works this is much harder to do
in humans where we don't have large

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:35.699
populations such as we do in the world
where there's lots of genome complexity

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.179
and every single human being has a
different you know
