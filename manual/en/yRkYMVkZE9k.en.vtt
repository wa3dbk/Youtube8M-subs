00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.400
Hey what's up guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of
EliteImpactLabs.com and today I'm responding

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.160
to a few requests that I've received to do
a review of Creatine Hydrochloride supplements

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.139
and so that's what this video today will be
about.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.640
So, we started off with the original creatine
monohydrate back in around the mid 1990’s,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.109
and since then a huge list of “new and improved”
creatines have been added to that list and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.520
one of the most recent of those forms is creatine
hydrochloride, or creatine HCL for short which

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.600
is a form of creatine that is created by attaching
a hydrochloride group to the creatine in order

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.790
to create a salt.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.370
And like most of the other “breakthrough”
creatine forms on the market, creatine HCL

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.420
is surrounded by a lot of hype and big claims
about its muscle building effectiveness in

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.109
comparison to creatine monohydrate.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.140
But is creatine HCL superior to creatine monohydrate?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Well, let’s examine the main claims that
are made about creatine HCL in comparison

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.400
to creatine monohydrate and thhen you can
basically just make the decision for yourself.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.380
So the first major claim is that there is
no loading phase required with creatine HCL.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.500
Now this is a totally irrelevant point because
there is no need for you to perform a loading

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.360
phase with any form of creatine, whether it’s
creatine monohydrate or creatine hydrochloride.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.530
A loading phase can help you see the results
in a shorter amount of time, 5 days as opposed

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.770
to about 20 but a standard 3 to 5 gram per
day dosage of creatine will result in full

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.060
creatine saturation of the muscles within
about 2 to 3 weeks.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.460
The second claim is that there is no bloating
with creatine HCL.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.200
Now I've talked about this a hundred times
in the past and I don't even really know where

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.560
this idea came from but creatine monohydrate
does not cause “bloating” of any kind.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.270
Creatine does require additional water in
order to be stored in your muscle tissue,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.340
but that water is stored inside of the actual
muscle cell itself and not directly underneath

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340
your skin.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.360
And this is actually one of the primary benefits
of creatine usage because it gives your muscles

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.620
a fuller and harder appearance.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.810
So sure, creatine hydrochloride does not cause
bloating, but neither does creatine monohydrate.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.550
The third claim is that creatine HCL will
not give you an upset stomach.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.930
Now creatine monohydrate is the most studied
sports supplement in history, and when used

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.070
within the recommended 3 to 5 gram per day
dosage does not produce any unwanted side

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:45.490
effects in terms of upset stomach or GI distress
in otherwise healthy individuals so again,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.640
another irrelevant point.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.280
Claim number 4, you don't have to cycle off
of creatine HCL.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.500
Now I just covered this in a video a couple
of weeks ago and there's no need to cycle

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.040
your creatine whether it’s creatine monohydrate
or creatine hydrochloride.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.680
External creatine consumption does not alter
your body’s natural production of creatine

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.720
when you stop supplementing with it nor does
cycling reduce the side effects because there

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.040
are none.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.310
Nor does it enhance the results any further
when you cycle on and off.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.780
So again, this is just another irrelevant
point that's used to market creatine HCL.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.990
And claim number 5 is that there is no water
retention with creatine HCL.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.470
Now, I just mentioned this a couple of points
ago but increased intracellular water retention

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.300
is actually one of the primary benefits of
creatine supplementation.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.880
This is NOT a drawback.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.370
Creatine requires water in order to be stored
in your muscles, and to say that creatine

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.730
HCL does not cause water retention is basically
saying that it doesn’t work.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.069
Both creatine hydrochloride and creatine monohydrate
are going to cause intracellular water retention,

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.340
and this directly translates to improved muscle
growth and performance at the gym.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.750
So, when it really all comes down to it, there’s
just no good reason to deviate from the monohydrate

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.820
form when it comes to creatine supplementation.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.300
2 to 3 weeks of consistent creatine monohydrate
use at the recommended dosage of about 3 to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.239
5 grams per day will result in a near 100
percent saturation of your muscle tissue,

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.900
and without any unwanted side effects.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.009
And there’s really nothing more that you
can ask for there.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:31.581
It’s not that there is necessarily anything
bad about creatine hydrochloride itself, but

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:36.490
why pay 8 to 10 times the cost when you can
achieve the maximum benefits that creatine

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.620
has to offer by simply using the monohydrate
form?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.059
One of the primary reasons why creatine HCL
is claimed to be superior to monohydrate is

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:52.620
because it is more water soluble and so it
requires a smaller dosage but on a per serving

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.220
basis despite that it still ends up being
a significantly higher price.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.319
And on top of this, creatine HCL is still
a relatively new supplement, and at this point

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.520
there really isn’t any concrete research
that directly demonstrates its effects in

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.479
comparison to the creatine monohydrate form.

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.559
So the bottom line here is that you're free
to use whatever form of creatine you like

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.809
and I'm sure when I post this video there's
going to be a few people in the comments section

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.470
who are defending creatine HCL and who claim
that they got better results with it but at

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.150
the end of the day creatine monohydrate is
the most researched sports supplement ever

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.099
released and it has a near 100 percent absorption
rate in the body, no side effects and it's

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.789
also the most cost-effective form as well.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:46.800
So unless new research surfaces which shows
a different form of creatine to be superior

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.150
to monohydrate for building muscle or enhancing
gym performance, I think the choice is pretty

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.419
much a no-brainer at this time.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.650
