00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.341
Okay, so we're going to talk about a little
bit about bike safety.

00:00:06.341 --> 00:00:11.219
Bike safety is really important because you
can get to really high speeds on a bicycle.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
Even at low speeds you can get pretty injured.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.380
The best thing to do is of course keep your
bike in working order, taking it in for a

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.609
tune-up, making sure if you an issue with
your bike like your brakes are squeaking or

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.279
your wheels are out of true, bring it in and
have it serviced.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.910
A couple things with New York City especially,
is that you want to make sure you have reflectors,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.620
front and rear.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.800
That you have working lights, both front and
rear, white on the front and red on the rear

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.120
just like a car.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.750
You can get a substantial fine if you do not
have them at night, so, basically from dusk

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.750
to dawn.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.969
With lights you have a bunch of different
options.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.370
Most light go for anywhere from usually $8
on up.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.629
They can go very, very expensive depending
on how bright they are, what they're made

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.010
out of, all those types of things.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.820
Basically, for the city you're not going to
want a light that's going to necessary illuminate

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.820
your path.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.090
You just want light where you are going to
be seen by cars and pedestrians and other

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.090
cyclist.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.850
A light like this basically flashes, it's
nice and bright, it's US (?) rechargeable

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.090
so if you do a lot of riding at night you
can get this and save a lot of money on batteries,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.659
which is really nice to have in your backpack
all the time just in case you're out and it

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.659
gets dark.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.620
The rear one is basically exactly the same.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.640
It's going to be blinking or you can keep
it steady.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.750
It's better to keep in blinking so people
can see you in the city.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.240
So, that those lights.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.600
Another way to be safe is to just to wear
the proper clothing and equipment, so make

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.290
sure you have a rain jacket with you if it's
going to be raining that day . Make sure you've

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.090
got fenders on you bike if you're going to
riding in the rain or if you're going to be

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.500
riding on a winters day where there's like
slush and snow and things like that, so you

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.900
won't get wet and cold and get sick.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.299
Also a lot people don't like to wear helmets
but definitely helmets can help keep you safe.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.811
You want to make sure you can take two fingers
and put them above you eye brow and that's

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:09.009
how low the helmet would be.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.290
You don't want far back like that because
then you're going to lose your short term

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.549
memory and you also don't want to have it
on backwards.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.799
With the strap you want to make sure it's
fastened correctly and that you can put two

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:20.799
fingers underneath the strap.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.070
This one's a little bit loose, so I'll tighten
it up.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
You just don't want it too tight and you don't
want it too loose because if you hit the ground

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.980
you don't want our helmet flying off.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.380
That's basically how you wear a helmet properly.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.169
So, with bicycle helmets, they are made for
one crash.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:41.790
If you have an accident or you have a collision
with your helmet on you want to make sure

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.770
to replace it because it fractures kind of
like the front end of a car.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.760
It supposed to create less of an impact on
your actual head, so make sure replace those

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.510
and also if your helmet is over three years
old it needs to be replace because the foam

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.980
that it's made out of breaks down after three
years and it's pretty much useless if you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.290
have it on.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.660
Something else you want to look out for when
you're in the city, is you want to make sure

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.079
that you're looking for doors that are going
to swing open.

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:17.010
That can be really, really dangerous and has
caused some fatalities and many, many injuries.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.881
Drivers and also passengers of cars just don't
realize that they're throwing their doors

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:24.049
open and can potentially injure you very badly.
