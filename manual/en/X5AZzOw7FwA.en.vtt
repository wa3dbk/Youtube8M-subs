00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:06.380
CARINE CARMY: 3D
printing is a technology

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.200
that lets you take
a digital file

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800
and turn it into a
physical product.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.140
SAM CERVANTES: Almost
anything you can imagine,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.310
people are creating.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.518
I think it's going to open
up whole new opportunities

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:16.124
in areas of mass customization.

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:18.540
MICHAEL WEINBERG: Unlike with
music or movies, with the 3D

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.520
printer, a lot of
things that are printed

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.990
aren't protected by copyright.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.840
JOSEPH FLAHERTY: One of
the really cool things

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.479
about 3D printing is it
really changes the dynamic

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.395
of a consumer culture.

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:28.550
It turns you from being
a passive consumer

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.810
to an active creator.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.770
SAM CERVANTES: 3D printing is
this amazing new technology

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.680
where you can take
a 3D digital file

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.520
and with the click of a
button, use that file to create

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.630
an actual physical 3D part.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.330
So how does a 3D printer work?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.360
The first step is
to get a 3D file.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.750
And you can get your 3D
file in one of two ways.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.230
One, you can simply download
the file from the internet.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.147
The second way is you can
design your own 3D part.

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:00.480
The software is going to slice
your part up into layers.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.225
By building a part
layer by layer,

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.970
you're able to create a plastic
part in three dimensions

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.830
and the possibilities
are limited only

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.990
by your imagination.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.270
People will create their next
big invention or engineers

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.170
and designers create
small production

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840
runs or little prototypes.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.120
Teachers can use it to
print out teaching aids.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.181
If a teacher is doing a
little lesson on a ship,

00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:20.930
they can actually print
out a sailing ship

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.210
and pass it around the class.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.550
And people print out things
for around the house.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.990
iPhone cases are pretty big.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.270
You break a towel hook, you
can print out a new one.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.310
We want to make 3D
printers at a price

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.660
that the average person can
afford and also easy to use.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.300
We're already seeing late-stage
early adoption of 3D printing.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.680
But for me, the exciting
thing is what's to come.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.460
CARINE CARMY: Shapeways
is an online 3D printing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.940
community and marketplace.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.100
Anyone in the world can
upload their 3D model

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.250
and we'll print for you.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.990
And then also, if you decide
you want to make it for sale,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.950
you can sell it and
we'll produce it

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.650
on demand for that customer
wherever they are in the world.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.360
You can essentially bring a
product to market with no risk.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.920
You don't have
inventory anymore.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.150
You don't have to
make sure that there's

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.600
a market ready for your product.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.540
If you sell one, that's awesome.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.350
If you sell 10,000,
then all of a sudden,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.150
you have a passive
income model and that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.460
radically changes the economy.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.990
Usually, to bring a product
to market takes a year.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.580
And then, you have to find the
manufacturer and the investor.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.360
And so it's going to
force us to change

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.990
the way we think about
not only buying products,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.060
but how they're made.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.880
One of our colleagues
broke his stroller

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.470
and it would have cost
him something like $250

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.990
to get that part in the mail
from the stroller company.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.280
And he literally just
3D-printed a stroller part

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.680
and got it for $20.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.820
You have this explosive
technology where everything

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.575
is made just for you, but at the
price and quality of something

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:40.450
you'd buy in a store.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.700
This could be a scary
technology for some companies,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.270
because what does that
mean for seasons now?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.120
You have infinite
inventory and what

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.060
does that mean for
scarcity, which

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.670
is one of the core tenets
of so many industries?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.100
I think it's very similar,
though, to social media

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.000
or other tools of
engagement, where

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.700
you're afraid to see what that
would mean to let consumers

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.370
co-create with you
or to really rethink

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.180
your traditional
manufacturing process,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.820
because you have
so many middlemen.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.410
I think we just have
to stop thinking

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.670
that you need to reach 100,000,
a million people for something

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.680
to be successful.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.900
Customization, it's
really changing the way

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.710
that we have to think about
design and production, as well.

00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:20.450
MICHAEL WEINBERG:
People who make money

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.155
by selling things that are
all of a sudden easily copied

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:25.310
with a 3D printer are
going to be worried

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.880
that people are going to be
making unauthorized copies

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.900
with those 3D printers.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.840
And I think one
of the challenges

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.250
for them is going to be,
well, how do I react?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.880
Objects that are
artistic objects, that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.940
are objects that you would
hire an artist to make,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.273
those things are all going
to be protected by copyright.

00:03:39.273 --> 00:03:41.030
But those objects
that actually do

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.630
things, that have a use besides
just sort of entertaining

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.460
or looking nice,
a lot of those are

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.360
going to fall outside
the scope of copyright.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.120
They might be protected by
patent, but a lot of them

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.430
won't be protected by any
sort of intellectual property

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.930
at all.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.125
And as a result of that, you can
use them or improve upon them

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.260
or build on them as much as you
want and no one can stop you.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.820
3D printing right now is
at its very beginnings

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.630
and so you don't have a lot of
case law about everyday people

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.710
making exact copies
of physical objects,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.250
and certainly not
a lot of case law

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.270
about people being able to
do that on a large scale.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.035
The good thing, hopefully,
is that the industries that

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:20.300
are disrupted by 3D printing
have the model of the music

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.130
industry to maybe learn from.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.990
The music industry, when
someone started copying things,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.750
decided the best thing to do was
take their time and their money

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.460
and invest it in suing everyone
they could find and try

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.296
and stop the progress
of technology.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:34.420
That didn't work very well.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.530
And so the hope is that
these creators, when

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.240
they see these new technologies,
they capture some of the upside

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.365
and they say, oh, wait,
this can change my business

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.750
for the better and they do that.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.839
It's a hard thing to do,
but the music industry

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:47.130
has taught us that it may be
the thing they have to do.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.800
JOSEPH FLAHERTY:
3D printing's going

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.570
to have a profound
impact on all of us,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.571
whether you consider
yourself a designer or not.

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.778
In the future, there are
going to be 3D printers that

00:04:56.778 --> 00:04:58.279
will allow you to
actually create

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.320
three-dimensional structures
out of living cells.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.630
And they can build very
complex structures,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.400
like blood vessels
or skin tissue.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.670
And the idea there is
that in 10 or 20 years,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.510
these scientists are going to
be able to 3D-print tissue that

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.427
could replace damaged
vessels of the heart

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:13.510
or they might be able to
print replacement organs.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.894
So you won't have to go to
find an organ donor anymore.

00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:18.310
You'll just be able to have
one 3D-printed at the hospital

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.920
based on your own cell and
your own genetic makeup.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.674
Right now at MIT,
scientists are working

00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:24.090
on 3D printers
that would actually

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.590
allow you to print food.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.920
And who wouldn't want that
in their house, right?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.878
If you could just ask
Siri to cook you a steak,

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:31.450
I mean, it's really going to be
an exciting time in the home.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.370
In Japan, there's a company
that's taking sonogram data.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.220
So they scan a
pregnant woman's belly

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.594
and they're able to actually
3D-print a figure of her torso.

00:05:39.594 --> 00:05:41.510
So instead of just having
a fuzzy little black

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.884
and white picture,
you're getting

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.770
a real model of what your
child is going to look like.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.850
People are using
3D printers to do

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.630
all sorts of interesting things
in terms of the environment.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.315
Researchers are
using 3D printers

00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:54.832
that can print concrete
to make replacements

00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:57.290
for parts of the Great Barrier
Reef that have been damaged.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.852
Normally, those reefs take
thousands of years to build.

00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:02.185
But what these scientists do
is they find the areas that

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:03.970
are damaged, they
make CAD replicas

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.380
of those damaged areas, and
they print them in concrete.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.280
So it's a base
structure upon which

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.572
coral can create a top layer.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:11.405
And that helps reinvigorate
the environment.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:13.772
It helps return
normality to that area.

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.730
And one of the coolest
things about 3D printing

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.115
is that it's a community
that never stops innovating.

00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:19.615
There are hundreds
of innovators who

00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:21.739
are making little tweaks
to these products, who are

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:23.120
trying out different things.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.190
And so it really gives
everybody an opportunity

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.882
to create anything
they could imagine.

00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:30.798
[WHIRRING]

00:06:30.798 --> 00:06:32.875
CARINE CARMY: 3D
printing is a next wave

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:34.740
of how brands and
consumers can engage.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.740
And now, we're just
starting to see that happen.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.800
JOSEPH FLAHERTY: In
a few years' time,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.776
they're going to be no
more difficult to use

00:06:39.776 --> 00:06:41.450
or difficult to understand
than a camera phone.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.908
MICHAEL WEINBERG: The way to
protect creators and designers

00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:47.775
is to make sure to give
people a way to spend money

00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:48.912
on 3D-printed things.

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:50.370
SAM CERVANTES: In
the future, we're

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.325
going to see a lot
more people unleashing

00:06:52.325 --> 00:06:54.050
their pent-up
creativity and that's

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.216
what's most exciting for me.
