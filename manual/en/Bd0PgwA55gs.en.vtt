00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.149
Now I'm going to talk about paints. You can
get the paints if you want in those what we

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:18.119
call "paint pans," like the pans for children
at school, and they'll work fairly well, but

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.369
generally they're quite grainy because they
haven't been ground fine enough. With the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.470
better-quality paints like tube paints, they
come in two different grades. They have a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.920
student grade called "scholastic" or student
grade, and then they have a professional grade.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.910
And professional grade is generally ground
a little finer, and has less filler and less

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:48.579
medium in it. Now, the medium of watercolor
is gum Arabic, and what happens is in the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.350
lower-priced paints, they just add more gum
Arabic instead of pigment. It costs them less.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:06.400
So your better-quality stuff can be quite
expensive, depending on the brand, and you

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:15.530
can get them in hobby stores or online. Basically,
the colors that I have my students start with

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.680
are - and this is set up in a color wheel
if you'll notice. It starts with grey, goes

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.350
to dark blues, to greens, I have my earth
tones right in the middle an then I go from

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:40.740
yellow up to reddish violet. So the main ten
colors to start with are: Payne's Grey; Phthalo

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:54.210
Blue; Cobalt Blue, which is one of your primary
colors; Phthalo Green; then you're going to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.670
have Yellow Ochre, which is right here. You're
going to have Burnt Sienna. You're going to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.619
have Burnt Umber, which is a chocolate brown.
You're going to have Yellow, and like Aureolin,

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.860
because it's a transparent yellow, or you
can get a Lemon Yellow type yellow. You'll

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.920
want an orange, because you can't create an
orange out of yellow and red quite as brilliant

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.700
as the orange that's made in the tube and
this is generally Cadmium Orange. And you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.780
can use either Cadmium Red or Naphthal Red.
You can see that there's very little difference,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.840
and Naphthal Red is what I generally like
to use. And Permanent Rose, which is also

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:53.790
Quinacridone Rose, and then those are the
main colors. There are other colors as well.
