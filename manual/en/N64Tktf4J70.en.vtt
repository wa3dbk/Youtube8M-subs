00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.530
This is a story about a girl named Karana
who lives on the Island of the Blue Dolphins

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.731
in the Pacific.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:10.430
Her village, Ghalas-at, lives in peace and
harmony, hunting and gathering in a tribal

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.430
society.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.610
One day, the island is visited by the Aleuts,
a crew of Russian fur traders.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.039
Karana's father, the chief of the island,
makes an agreement with the Aleuts that they

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.509
can stay on the island if they split the harvest
of otter furs.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.579
However, when it comes time for the Aleuts
to pay, they refuse and a fight ensues, leaving

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.339
many of the Ghalas-at men dead, including
Karana's father.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.720
After a new chief is appointed, the people
on the island prepare for a mass exodus in

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.760
the event that the Aleuts come back by building
canoes and collecting supplies.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.150
Soon, another ship appears in the distance,
but it is not the Aleuts.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.980
These men want to take the Ghalas-at away
and so they bring them on their ship.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.840
As they are sailing away, Karana sees that
her brother is still on the island and swims

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.370
back to be with him.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.690
The two siblings are still hopeful that the
ship will return to get them.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.760
Unfortunately, Karana's brother dies to a
pack of wild dogs on the island.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.670
Alone on the island, Karana begins constructing
shelter and weapons, a spear and bow and arrows,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.310
to defend herself against the wild dogs.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.569
She eventually captures one of the dogs, Rontu,
and keeps him as her pet.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.369
She also becomes more and more proficient
at hunting and gathering.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.789
She travels to new parts of the island and
hunts for giant squid.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.970
Many years pass until she is visited by another
ship.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.350
However, this ship is different because there
is a girl amongst the crew.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.539
The girl and Karana meet and become friends,
even trading gifts.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.229
However, the ship eventually leaves and Karana
is again alone.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.259
Despite Rontu dying of old age, Karana finds
another dog and continues her routine of checking

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.049
for a ship on the horizon.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.270
In the end, a ship of missionaries rescues
her, telling her that her people had died

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.070
in a shipwreck all those years ago.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.970
As with most desert island stories, this story
draws out the real connection between humans

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.280
and nature.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.340
Karana comes to know and identify patterns
with different animals and plants around the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.899
island that provide her food.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.780
A rhythm harmonizes where all parts of the
environment, producers and consumers, synergize

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.780
together.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.440
Readers also get a glimpse of Western Expansion
from the point of view of the people being

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.970
taken over, or "The Others".

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.360
As it's been said, History is told by the
winners, but in this case, it's told from

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.520
the losers.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.490
And this relates to how motives play an important
role in cultural understanding and sensitivity,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.330
particularly as it deals with language.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.460
Through the Aleuts, readers see a people who
are selfish and greedy.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.970
Their solution to the problem of language
is to fight and run.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.900
However, the little girl, whose motives are
friendly, handles the language barrier in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.260
a different way.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.040
She befriends Karana by offering gifts and
friendship.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.010
And it's here that we get an insight into
how important motives are in interaction with

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.010
others.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.540
This story also highlights the power that
women have if given the opportunity.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.090
In the Ghalas-at society, women are not allowed
to construct weapons and hunt.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.940
This ultimately hurts Karana when she is forced
to live by herself, but fortunately for her,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.470
she is given enough time to experiment and
craft the tools she needs to survive.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.320
Karana's survival creates a significant benchmark
for women in that they are highly capable

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.290
of taking on the roles that are predominantly
filled by men.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.720
And soon she discovers, in order to survive,
she cannot view jobs and tasks through gender-specific

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.900
lenses.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.750
She has to do what she has to do and so those
tasks become gender-neutral.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.780
And so this story isn't just a call for gender
equality, but a celebration of individuals,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.459
of either gender, who can rise to the occasion
when thrown against nature.
