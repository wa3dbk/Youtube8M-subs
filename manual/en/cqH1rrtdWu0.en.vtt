00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.920
A lot of people think that they can easily
be saved.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.530
They have bought into the LIE of the church
culture that teaches them that as long as

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:21.910
they live a pretty good life, and as long
as they have believed things about Jesus and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.060
know the Bible that they will go to heaven
when they die.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.770
But that is a BIG LIE because it is extremely
difficult to enter into eternal life, and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.010
that is because it is extremely difficult
to obey and follow Jesus.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.230
Most people would rather just say a prayer
of repentance one time, and then live the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.620
rest of their life NOT proving that they repented.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.800
They are NOT on the narrow path, and it demonstrates
that they are not on the narrow path by their

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000
fruit, by their actions.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.060
Their fruit and their actions, their words
expose their heart condition and MOST people

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.320
are NOT right with Jesus, they are on the
broad way to destruction, because they don't

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.800
follow and obey Jesus.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.170
Are you really a disciple of Jesus, holy and
pleasing (TO JESUS), righteous, who is on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.460
the narrow path?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.450
Are you in a right relationship with Jesus
Christ?

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.790
Most sadly are NOT in a right relationship
with Him and when they die they will NOT enter

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.960
into eternal life because they were NOT obedient.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.120
Are you REALLY pleasing JESUS today?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.260
Don't let ANYONE tell you that it is easy.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.360
People will hate you if you follow Jesus.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.530
They will mock you.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.799
All your old friends and probably your family
will turn on you, and most will not support

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.490
you in your walk with Jesus.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.170
But you HAVE to push on KNOWING that JESUS
IS THE ONLY WAY and resting in HIM.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:28.120
He is our security and our fortress, but if
you turn away from Him you will have NOTHING.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.389
Are you REALLY holding onto JESUS with ALL
your MIGHT?

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.629
Because the END is near and people are NOT
really holding onto HIM.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.260
HE IS COMING IN JUDGMENT AND PEOPLE ARE NOT
PREPARED!

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.750
ARE YOU REALLY READY FOR JESUS TO COME BACK?
