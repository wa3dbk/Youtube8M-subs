00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:06.770
Home to the shore angler's nemesis, the commercial
netsmen, at least harbours give us a chance

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.270
to fish from their walls.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.870
This one is quite short, gives room for only
a few rods out but it's a great mark for the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.790
disabled or elderly as you can park very close
to the fishing, the end of the wall's not

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.649
far, the walkway is flat and the wall itself
is very low.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:34.649
At the end of the wall, back room is a bit
limited but casting is do-able.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Just be aware it's 'No Fishing' into the harbour
entrance though.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.760
'The Street' is a sand and gravel bar that
runs far out to sea and disrupts the tidal

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.099
flow slightly.

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:05.739
Food will get washed up on it and small fish
can shelter behind it.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:12.739
It's thought of by locals as a good mark for
bass and rays.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Although The Street is paved with stone, either
side is clean sand.

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.540
Aside from The Street, there's a lot of beach
to go at here and wherever you decide to cast,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.010
you'll be fishing snag-free onto clean sand.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.020
Free parking opposite the Castle on Tower
Hill gives you access the long way round by

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.090
a path in the trees, or the quick way, down
this slope.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.400
You could even roll down it for a laugh.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.819
For the rest of Tankerton, Marine Parade is
free.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.840
Down the hill is a cafe and decent toilets,
with a slope next to the cafe down to the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.919
beach.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.940
From up on the slopes of Tankerton, we can
just about in the distance make out our next

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.150
mark, Hampton Pier.
