00:24
COMM: I've been holding flashlights, helping

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.670
people work on trucks since i was 3, helping
my dad change tyres on our own truck since

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.650
I was 8 and when I turned 13 i got to actually
crush a car in our front yard.

COMM: Rosalee from Watsonville, California

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.570
has followed in her father's footsteps driving
in over 100 monster truck shows.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.479
00:49
COMM: She started showing interest as soon

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.489
as she could hop into something that had wheels
a lot of people spend their whole lives looking

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.799
for something that they enjoy and they want
to do to fulfil themselves and she's found

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.799
it at a very young age.

01:03
COMM: While most teenagers are just learning

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.149
how to drive, Rosalee has been jumping and
crushing smaller cars beneath her since she

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.149
was 13.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.659
01:10
COMM: Theres so much that goes into it, its

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.789
exciting, nerve-racking and sometimes you
kind of just forget everything and its just

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.509
you driving a truck, its your own little world.

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.020
01:22
COMM: And she isn't afraid to get her hands

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.830
dirty helping her father assemble all the
trucks for upcoming shows.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.460
01:28
COMM: she's always been a big part in helping

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.659
me fix things, whether it be um a dry train,
engine transmission, or electrical issues.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.990
01:37
COMM: knowing the truck inside out helps Rosalee

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.979
take all the necessary precautions in tricky
situations, especially with things don't quite

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.399
go to plan.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.950
01:47
COMM: when I got out of the truck after I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.079
rolled, I came out smiling everyone was just
like oh your just beaming it looks like you

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.799
just came off a ride in an amusement park.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.929
01:56
COMM: We incorporate all the safety equipment

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.359
we can uh we follow all the rules for building
the cages I've added extra bars into those

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.030
cages and extra safety.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.000
02:08
COMM: And she continues to impress those around

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.180
her by competing in what is considered a male
dominated sport.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.000
02:14
COMM: She can drive like the boys, I mean

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.160
she truly can, I mean I don't think people
realise its a girl in the truck until she

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160
gets out.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.660
02:23
COMM: Being a driver at such a young age in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.260
such a big truck really shows kids you can
do what you love.
