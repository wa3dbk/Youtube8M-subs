00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.206
My canvas is passed out
in my chair.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.107 align:start position:0%
Hello?

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:10.209
[bleep].

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start position:0%
Hello? Hi.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.680 align:start size:9% position:91%
Hi.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.114 align:start position:0%
You know you were
just passed out, right?

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.416 align:start size:47% position:53%
I was sleeping.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.184 align:start position:0%
I think you were doing
a little bit more than sleeping.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.987 align:start position:0%
Probably not the best idea
for you to get tattooed today.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:24.023 align:start position:0%
It's my judgment call.
I can't have you stay here.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.860
What the heck am I supposed
to do--tattoo my own butt crack?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.962
Are you serious?

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:32.765
- Hey, Chris, let's have a chat.
- Yeah.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.333 align:start position:0%
Obviously,
this isn't your fault.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.968 align:start position:0%
In order to move on
in this competition,

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.504 size:84% position:42%
you're gonna have to tattoo
the same exact body part.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:40.906 align:start position:0%
We have arrangements
to get another canvas in here.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.109 size:78% position:39%
Once your canvas arrives,
you'll have three hours

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.678 align:start position:0%
of design time
and six hours to tattoo.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.314
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- All right, buddy, good luck.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.283 line:0%
In this competition,
you must tattoo.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:53.052 line:0%
So now Chris is gonna have
to rethink his entire concept

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.354 line:0%
for somebody else
that's coming in,

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:59.292 line:0%
and this could definitely
throw someone off their game.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:04.230
Artists, you have six hours
to create an illusion.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.600
And your time begins now.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.034 align:start position:0%
All right, let's do it.

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:11.204 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go ahead
and put the stencil on you.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.907
(Chris)
In order to achieve an optical
illusion tattoo properly,

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.808
you're going to really have
to know the anatomy

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.009
and dynamics of the image

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.611
that you're tattooing
and the body part

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.679
that you're placing it on.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.615 align:end position:100%
Dude, that's perfect
on the first try.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.585
If you're not a genius
doing these tattoos,

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.986
you will not succeed.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.488 align:start size:22% position:78%
Oh. Ah.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.224 align:start position:0%
I really do not like
the shell.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.927 align:end position:100%
There's not much elements
besides the scales on her face

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.861 align:end position:100%
that are going to make her look
like a mermaid.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.130
I just know my pain tolerance,
and I just want you to be able

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.432 size:78% position:39%
to have a finished piece.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.434 align:end position:100%
Whether I do a hand
or a hand with a shell in it,

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.869 align:end position:100%
it's gonna be
about the same amount of time.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.804 line:0%
I have to show ingenuity
with this tattoo.

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:49.142 line:0%
If I start taking details out,
it might make no sense.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.044 line:0%
I'm going head-to-head
with my mentor, Kruseman.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:56.281 line:0%
I really, really just need
to win an elimination challenge.

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.084 line:0%
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, buddy.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.585 line:0%
- How you doing?
- My final tattoo...

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.354 align:start size:69% position:31% line:0%
before I go home-skie.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:02.988 line:0%
I feel like I can't win
for nothing, man.

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:04.824 line:0%
I'm just getting screwed
left and right.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.959 line:0%
I have too much integrity
to give this lady

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.028 line:0%
a headless pinup
on the back of her head.

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.163 line:0%
I'm not gonna do it.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.030 align:end position:100%
Sometimes
you can't be bought.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.299
This is the type of challenge

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.801
that's making me want
to throw in the towel.
