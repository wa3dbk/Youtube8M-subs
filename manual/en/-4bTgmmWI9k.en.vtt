00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:01.565
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:02.900
is go through a bunch of examples

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.366
that will hopefully give us
an even better understanding

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.469
of what it means to add or subtract

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:10.386
a positive or a negative number.

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:12.400
And as I go through these, I encourage you

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.833
to keep pausing the video and
try to solve it on your own

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:17.256
and then see how we can solve it together.

00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:18.333
So let's start.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.535
If I were to say that negative one

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:25.517
is equal to seven minus blank,

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:27.134
what should be in that blank?

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:29.333
What number, either positive or negative,

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.833
I guess it could be zero,
what would that number be?

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.600
Alright, let's work through it together.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.134
So let me throw a number line here.

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:40.567
So let me put a number
line right over here.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.834
Now let's just think
about what's going on.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:47.300
So we are trying to get to negative one.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.300
We're trying to get to negative one

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.234
and we are starting at seven.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.334
So seven; this is five, six, seven.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.700
So we're starting at seven.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
So what do we have to subtract from seven

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.606
to get to this negative one here.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:08.467
Well, we have to move
one, two, three, four,

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.933
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.715
Eight to the left.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:17.769
So what we just did is we just subtracted

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:21.134
eight from seven to get to negative one.

00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:22.766
So what are we going to subtract?

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.366
We need to subtract eight.

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.033
Let's do another one of
these, this is kind of fun.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:30.766
Let's say we need to figure out,

00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:35.766
let's say we have negative 10 plus blank

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:38.300
is equal to negative five.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.601
What would the blank be in this case?

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:43.767
Let's give ourselves a number line again.

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:48.115
Let's give ourselves a number
line again and let's see.

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:51.033
We are going to start at negative 10,

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.433
so let's see, this is
negative 10 right over here.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.434
So we're gonna start at negative 10

00:01:56.434 --> 00:02:00.000
and we're gonna add something
to it to get to negative five.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.366
Remember, negative five
is right over here.

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.266
So if we're adding that
means we're going to be going

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.400
to the right on the number line.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.765
That is if we're adding a positive number.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:10.600
And we see here we're going to the right,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.866
we're going from negative
10 to negative five,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.433
so we are going to be
adding a positive number.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.867
If we added a negative number
we would move to the left.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.500
So how much are we adding?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.733
Well, let's just count.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:25.300
We're gonna add one,
two, three, four, five.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.467
So we just added positive five.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.067
So that would be a five right there.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:36.067
Negative 10 plus five is
equal to negative five.

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:39.400
We just became five less negative

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.933
is one way to think about it.

00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:42.266
Let's do another one!

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:43.433
Alright.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:46.933
So let's say we had four is equal

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.833
to negative two plus blank.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:55.707
Four is equal to negative two plus blank.

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:57.800
We could do this the same
way we've been doing others.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.200
Let's get our number line out here.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.207
Let's get our number line
out here and let's see.

00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:06.734
One way to think about it,
our goal, is to get four.

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.000
Our goal is four right over here.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.300
So this is one, two, three,
four, get to positive four.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.533
That's positive four right there.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.052
We're starting at negative two...

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:21.000
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
We're starting at negative two.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.500
We're saying four is the
same thing as negative two,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.468
negative two is right over here,

00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:30.133
negative two plus some amount.

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.112
And it's clear we're gonna
be moving to the right by,

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.354
let's see, we're gonna
move to the right by

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:39.911
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:03:40.495 --> 00:03:42.666
So we moved to the right by six.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.300
So we added six.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.564
So negative two plus six

00:03:48.564 --> 00:03:51.588
is equal to four.

00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:52.333
This is fascinating.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.638
Actually, let's just do several
more of these, I can't stop.

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:56.966
(laughs)
Alright.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:01.250
So let's say we wanted to figure out,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.568
I have six plus blank.

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:08.633
Six plus blank is equal to negative eight.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:10.500
Like always, try to pause the video

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.030
and figure out what this
blank is going to be.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.033
Let me throw my number line back here.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.930
So my number line.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.455
And one way to think about it

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:28.423
is I am starting at six.

00:04:28.423 --> 00:04:31.466
So it's five, this is six right over here.

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:34.933
And I'm gonna add something
to get to negative eight.

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:37.133
To get to negative eight
this is negative five,

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.100
negative six, negative
seven, negative eight.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.300
I want to get right over here,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.900
I want to get to negative eight.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.100
So what do I have to do to get
from six to negative eight?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.300
To go from six to negative eight.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.400
We're clear I have to go to
the left on the number line.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.534
And how much do I have to go to the left?

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.068
Well, let's count it.

00:04:57.068 --> 00:05:00.644
I have to go one, two, three, four,

00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:04.367
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:08.797
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

00:05:08.797 --> 00:05:10.826
So going 14 to the left, you could say

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:13.466
that I just subtracted 14.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:14.412
And if we phrase it as

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.966
six plus what is equal to negative eight?

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:20.200
Well, six plus negative 14.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.733
If this said six minus something

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:23.800
I could have just said six minus 14,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.666
but if it's saying six plus what

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:30.617
it's going to be six plus negative 14.
