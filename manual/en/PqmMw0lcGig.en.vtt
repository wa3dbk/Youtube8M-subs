00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.158
Today I will show you how the mapping works in Lipsync MX, 

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.494
Di-O-Matic’s automatic lipsync solution for 2d animation.

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:13.129
Lipsync MX allows you to use as many mouth positions

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.824
as you would like for your 2d characters. 

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:20.807
For this example our character is using 8 mouth positions;

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:27.133
so we have the closed mouth, mbp, one for all of the consonants,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:33.398
then we have the e, a, u, f/v, and L.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:37.476
What I will show you through this video is how to change

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:41.458
the default settings to and create new mouth positions.

00:00:41.794 --> 00:00:44.651
So I will go into the phoneme mapping section,

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.468
and in this section by default,

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:51.865
are a series of visemes that are visual families of phonemes. 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.736
The phonemes section contains a total of 40 different phonemes,

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:00.937
allowing you to customize your own visemes.

00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:06.132
Let’s create a new viseme, and name it O

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.909
This O viseme will regroup 3 different phonemes

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.156
whom as you will notice don’t sound so different after all.

00:01:14.403 --> 00:01:15.403
Let’s have a listen.

00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:24.785
You will also notice in addition to hearing an audible cue

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:30.336
that we have a visual tooltip indicating what the individual phonemes relate to.

00:01:31.677 --> 00:01:34.681
So we created a new viseme family called O

00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:37.753
and this family regroups three phonemes.

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.321
The idea is that you can go in any of the visemes

00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.319
and change any phoneme assigned by default.

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:49.385
Back to the viseme mapping, we can see that we have this new O viseme

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:52.512
but it is not being assigned to an image.

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.649
So we can simply double-click to select the mouth we want to use.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:03.202
I will simply use the “O” Mouth position that was previously created.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.636
Lipsync MX will recognize any of the phonemes that are part of the O family 

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:14.035
and will automatically assign the newly selected O mouth position image to be used.

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:24.635
One of the benefits of using this method,

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:28.042
is that you can easily change all the phoneme mappings

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.631
and create settings that are perfectly suited to your production.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:37.519
You can really make Lipsync MX work with the way you create your characters.

00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:41.767
So if you are used to creating characters with 3 mouth positions,

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.223
6 positions or even 15!

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:48.098
You can just create the viseme mapping to fit your character setup 

00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:51.418
and reuse that specific set of mouth positions.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.016
This gives you the flexibility to create automatic lipsync animations for your 2d characters

00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:00.201
no matter how many mouth position you actually use.

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:04.588
