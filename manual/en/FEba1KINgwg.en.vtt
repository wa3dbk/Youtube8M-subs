00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.570
You throw away the future we faced

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.380
You should've known better than to walk away

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.920
One last time

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.030
It's feeling like we're falling out of place

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.240
I think it's time to look inside look inside

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.690
Now look behind my heart

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.220
that's racing faster when

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.690
We're on and off and on again

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.030
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.330
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.630
This situation's dragging on and on again

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.990
Yeah!

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.700
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.270
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.800
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.520
Falling in my arms you lie awake

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.640
I take apart the look that's on your face,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.100
one last time

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.950
It's feeling like it's all too much too take

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.910
So now I,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.200
I think it's time to look behind, look behind

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.720
'Cause every time my eyes

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.070
are aching for an end

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.660
We're on and off and on again

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.110
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.530
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.830
This situation's dragging on and on again

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.190
Yeah!

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.900
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.470
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.000
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.710
Too far too late too much to take

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.710
Feels like the breaks are wasting time t-time my time t-time away

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.560
My time...

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.750
Another heartache

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.810
Tangled but I won't pretend we're on and on and on again

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.210
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.930
This situation's dragging on and on again

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.290
Yeah!

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.000
These signals, they take a piece of my heart

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.570
It feels as though we're falling apart

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.100
These complications have me shaking my head but I won't be shaken
