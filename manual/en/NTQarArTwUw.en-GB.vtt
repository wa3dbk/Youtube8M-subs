00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.250
The Nissan Note aims to provide the running
costs and fun drive of a supermini with the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.430
practicality of a much bigger car. Let's see
if it does that and what the improvements

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.120
are over the outgoing Note.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.600
The new model has a more upmarket look, ditching
the boxy stance for curves and sleek lines.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.070
The improved headlight design and 15" alloys
found on the mid range model make it look

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.329
more grown up than before.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.609
It scores highly for practicality and is one
of the biggest in the supermini class. You

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.760
get these handy hooks for small bags [hook
a small bag onto one of them] and is plenty

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.559
big enough for my large suitcase. If you avoid
the entry level model you get a handy moveable

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:11.420
floor for stashing valuables... but even better
than that...

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.700
Slide the seats forward [camera looking in
boot] and that boot becomes the biggest in

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.200
class. It even beats the larger Kia Venga
and if you fold the seats it's even slightly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.350
bigger than the HUGE Ford S-MAX. Yes, I said
S-MAX - not B-MAX!

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.250
Now, sliding the seats forward obviously impacts
on passenger space, but if you are small you

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.350
won't notice the reduced leg room, especially
if someone like me or my mum is sitting in

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.500
the driver's seat - I'm 5 foot 4 and a half
incase this is the first CarBuyer review you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.960
have watched , don't make it your last. With
the seats all the way back even the tallest

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.300
people will find there is plenty of head room
and a lot of leg room.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.690
Up front there are loads of improvements over
the old Note that add to that upmarket feel.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.500
The curved dashboard, white backlit dials
and gloss black centre console all improve

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.060
this now grown-up mini mpv.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.370
spec is good, too. All cars come with Bluetooth
and cruise control and if you go for the Acenta

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.939
- the one with the 15" alloy wheels - you
get sat nav, climate control, steering wheel

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:30.020
mounted audio control and tinted rear windows.
You should find a comfortable position for

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:45.090
driving, too, as there is plenty of adjustment
in the seat.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.290
If parking is not your strong point then fear
not because you can opt for Safety Shield,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:11.379
which includes a 360 degree camera. It's also
incredibly easy to drive around town thanks

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:19.239
to the light controls.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:30.439
It's much more comfortable to drive on European
roads than before, thanks to an improved suspension

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.260
set up and nicely weighted steering. Overall
it sticks to the road better than the outgoing

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.359
model and feels more composed than the Honda
Jazz.

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:45.999
There is a choice of engines, but the best
one to go for is the 1.5 diesel because it

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:52.609
is free to tax, feels powerful enough for
normal everyday driving and returns 78.5 miles

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.079
to the gallon. The 1.2-litre supercharged
petrol engine isn't bad either, but is more

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.689
suited to town trips than long-distance motorway
journeys,

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.699
is there anything bad to say about the new
Note? Well like with anything there are negatives

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:20.560
points to consider, unfortunately it still
isn't quite as much to drive as a Fiesta despite

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.930
its improved handling over the old model.
The engines are noisy under acceleration and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.070
again it is an improvement and does feel more
upmarket, but the interior still feels a bit

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.660
cheap next to the Volkswagen Polo.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.970
Having said that, Nissan makes very reliable
cars, the Note offers more space than many

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.290
of its supermini rivals is better value for
money than a lot of the larger mini-MPVs.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.120
If you're still unsure, why not watch my review
of the Renault Clio here, or Mat's reviews
