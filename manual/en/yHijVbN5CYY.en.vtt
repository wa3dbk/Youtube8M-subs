00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.800
What is ESD? .

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.000
That's probably the first question I get 
asked by any designer or architect.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.400
ESD is the acronym for
electrostatic discharge.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Essentially what we're talking about is the ability for a 
person to move their body while they walk on a floor,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.600
generate a charge, store that charge and when 
they actually release that charge to another objectâ€“

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.200
whether it's an electronic component, 
a person, a doorknob,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.400
that's when the electrostatic 
discharge takes place.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.000
What most people don't realize about static
is that in order to feel a static discharge

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.900
you're generating close to 3500 volts.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.000
The problem we have when protecting electronics, 
is electronic devices are actually sensitive

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.000
to as little as 5 or 10 volts of static.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.400
That means that the problem we're 
trying to cure is invisible

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.400
and because people tend to view the world through their 
own lens they don't know they have a static problem

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
because they're not getting a shock.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
Unfortunately, electronic components 
as sensitive as they are,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.200
are being destroyed, degraded, and 
damaged without us even realizing it.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.000
ESD flooring can
come in almost any form.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.800
What I've got in my hand right 
now is a solid vinyl tile.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.200
If you notice, there's little veins in the tile.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.900
Those veins contain carbon.
Carbon's a conductor.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.100
If a static charge touches the outside of the tile, 
the charge is transported through the veins

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.400
to an adhesive underneath this tile.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.100
So when we talk about ESD flooring, 
we could be talking about vinyl tile,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.400
we could be talking about 
carpet with carbon fibers,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.400
we could be talking about special
epoxies with carbon fibers,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.100
we could be talking about rubber.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.000
Almost any form of flooring that you can imagine 
we have a way to render it into a static free floor

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
But really the biggest consideration is safety.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.000
One of the things we've discovered 
in our audits of flooring installations

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.900
is a lot of times people are putting 
flooring in that's not safe.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's too conductive.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.200
The problem with something that's too conductive,
means people are at risk.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
The floor has to be properly grounded, 
has to be tested after it's installed,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we have to know with certainty 
that the conductivity of the floor

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.100
meets certain OSHA and 
NFPA safety standards.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.200
