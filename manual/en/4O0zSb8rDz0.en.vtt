00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.840
It is of a history long forgotten by humans, but yet they know

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.370
In the depths of their memories, there lie traces of guilt

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.570
By the side of the weak of heart, it lies lurking

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.980
In fear of that which they cannot see, they know the name of an oni

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230
So strong, 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.430
and for that – distant
So strong, 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.460
Feeling the transience of the world humans live in

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.630
One strong, feared by the rest

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.220
Left behind only a name

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.260
Against such a strength they could not grasp, they could never win

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.690
Against such a power they could not reach, they could only shake in fear

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.820
But one day the humans with their wisdom, took down the strong

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.460
The weak were no longer swept away, and so the humans set their guilt

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.360
Of ones they are afraid, 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.590
of ones they cannot reach
Of ones they are afraid, 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.790
Humans burn away in fear

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.600
The weak ones, their deed done in error, created a rift from the others

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.790
So strong, 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.050
and distant from the others
So strong, 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.960
Feeling the transience of the world humans live in

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:22.690
There was one strong, powerful and unbending who when set against them, left

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.380
Even if you gather up all the shattered emotions built up over the years

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.430
As you grasp them in your hands, they crumble and spill over

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:02.740
But even so, we still hold on tightly, strongly to our fleeting dreams

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.300
Time flows, 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.580
and yes a great time passes
Time flows, 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.360
But even upon the present, such without form

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.430
Human, if you lie in your heart, beside you the oni will lie

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.370
So strong, 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.680
and for that – distant
So strong, 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.630
Feeling the transience of the world humans live in

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:51.580
There was one strong, feared by the rest left behind only a name

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.520
Now so distant, 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.170
and for that – unreachable
Now so distant, 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.890
Standing at the end she looks upon the people

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:07.670
Who in fear and respect of her strong name, sing in metaphors, in honor of the oni

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:15.840
But yet they forget, and so now the oni disappears

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:23.960
But then they fear, and now again the oni lurks

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.080
She will never disappear, she will never die

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.150
She will never end, she will never wither

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.280
And as the long night dawns

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.150
She wonders over the many gathering dreams
