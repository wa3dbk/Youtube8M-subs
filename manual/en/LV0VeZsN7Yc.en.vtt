Oh, "Change Is Gonna Come," yes, it's just...
you know, I'm making huge changes.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.950
Being here and this is gonna make a world
of difference

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.980
whether it's first place or
second or third...

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.070
fourth, whatever,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.310
I think big...big changes already
have been made

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.600
and there's...there's more to come. And I think that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.830
we're in all this together.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.359
It has been a long time coming so, I mean

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.599
it's pretty self-explanatory.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.239
She's wonderful, she's just been having my
back even when

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.950
I didn't have my own back, you know, so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.739
puts a lot of self worth,

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.399
a lot more... just boost my self worth a lot
more. A lot more than I

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.190
ever had before so...

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.250
and I'm...I'm a lot further ahead

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.610
I think from, just from her encouragement and
inspiration

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.780
than I ever was.
I love that song,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.309
yeah, Avicii and Dan Tyminski,

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.010
of Union Station and Alison Krauss. 
And that's a great song, "Hey Brother,"

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.350
it was perfect. I got to really change it up
a little bit more

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.860
rock band, Kings of Leon meets
Mumford &amp; Sons

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.110
kind of sound and...

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.920
you know, I think it could do well, so.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.720
You know, a few string
guitar based, it's kind of, I can play

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.950
to some degree but most mostly keys, mostly keys,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.860
piano is my main thing.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.720
Yeah, I really love...I think both,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.850
both really actually at the end of the day.
I just had this for like a year

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.540
I never had any before.
This is my little girl's initials

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.470
and it says "music is life" up
here but you can't see it, it's

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.930
kinda tough to fold up.
Hey Champs and all other awesome fans,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.570
America, I'll be really grateful for your
votes and your downloads of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.259
the iTunes songs,

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.259
"Hey Brother" and "Change's Gonna Come." You won't be
disappointed. I love you, guys!

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.350
