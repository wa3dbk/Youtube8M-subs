00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.295
You're holding up my residents with your psychic readings

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.160
Well, don't believe everything you hear

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.240
Isn't that the one thing a supposed psychic shouldn't say?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.880
Well, I suppose there's no point in offering you a complimentary tarot reading 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.163
"A sorcerer shall not be allowed to live"

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.740
Harry Potter?

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.620
Exodus 22:17

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.060
Ah, I see

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.220
It's your faith that prevents you from believing

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.380
Yes, that is what my faith does

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.280
A word - mindfulness

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.720
This place, the hospital, it might be a social call for you, but for some - their greatest fears are being realized  

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.320
Your offering of false comforts is heinous

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.760
Heinous? Wow, I haven't been called heinous since my last honeymoon, Dr. Katz

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:01.177
You know my name, how?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.560
Ahh, the Great Randall was able to crack the good doctor's veneer

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.780
You and I may have more in common than the Divinity yet, huh 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.360
My fiance is a student of the Torah and Talmud. 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.960
If he studies hard enough, there is a sliver of a chance that he be invited to study the Kaballah, so yes, Divinity I take seriously 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.480
Baloney, I don't touch

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.660
I see what he sees in you, you're Bashert

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520
Oh, you speak Yiddish now?

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.650
I speak the truth

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.820
You're curious, aren't you?

00:01:33.222 --> 00:01:33.722
No

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.080
Little bit?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.800
Nah, you won't give it a chance, will you?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.740
You and I are both healers with a few different details along the way

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.800
Seven of Swords

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.500
Now the seven is a numeral that signifies a desire within or a miracle within your grasp

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.840
You need a tarot card to tell you the importance of seven to a Jewish woman?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.100
But, it's more about the swords here... 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.280
The swords signify a division of life/love, work...

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.360
Flashback: "Listen, I know you probably want an explanation as to why..."

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.300
Yea, it's definitely about the swords

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.820
I have order in my life

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.300
I don't know Dr. Katz. Seems to me there's more than a sliver of a chance that your life's about to be rattled

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880
You know something, you're right

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.520
This miracle within my grasp - that I...I can't deny

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.280
since I will be delivering one tonight at 6 via Cesarean and two more before the weekend

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.000
Praise Miracles!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.060
Wow

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.680
Yoohoo, Dr. Quinn?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.660
It's Dr. Lin

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.080
Medicine woman

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.280
Want a reading?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.840
Thanks, but no thanks

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.240
Ahhh, just broke up with your shrink, huh?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.440
How did you know that?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.580
I'm the psychic, not the psychiatrist

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.100
I thought you were a medium

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.460
A grande!

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.480
What?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.560
A grande cappuccino! 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.020
That's my charge, a small fee for a changed destiny

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.500
No dice

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.800
Fine

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.080
 My love life. Do your worst!

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.060
Always do!

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.060
Do you have a cat?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.740
Uhhh, you've been creeping me on instagram - am I supposed to be  impressed by that?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.520
Cat was Gavin's (ex-boyfriend)

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.660
Well, there's definitely something about cats

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.980
Cats? Great! 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.560
I'm going to be a cat lady

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.320
I mean I know this is a cold reading, but that is a cold reading 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.480
There's also something about fluid

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.080
Fluid? Like an incontinence consult?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.780
A half bottle of breakup Chardonnay in my fridge

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.620
No, no sorry

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.640
Fluidity

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.940
You need to go with the flow

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.080
because there's actually a curse on your love life

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.960
That's a bit of an overstatement

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.120
I mean unlucky maybe, but a curse?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.640
God, there has to be someone out there for me

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.380
I saw Drake in my grilled cheese this morning...

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.040
I see Drake a lot

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.120
Okay

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.460
Well...

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.900
Anyway, I uh I could help lift the curse...

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.580
for a small fee

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.960
I'll roll the dice

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.420
You only live once

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.700
Unless you're a cat
