00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:09.230
Looking in that fitness direction at such
a young age was brought on by me having, you

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.889
know, major back surgery when I was 15.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.230
Having three fused vertebrates, couple steel
rods, some screws, ha, it's like an erector

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.390
set in there.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.720
And then basically having a doctor tell me
I wasn't gonna surf again.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.650
Uh that spurred on some serious determination
so now doing this, you know, kind of right

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.079
on I feel the absolute cutting edge of you
know, exercises for surfing.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.210
You don't want to be out when it's six to
eight foot and feel like you have to pull

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.440
back on waves.You want to be able to go, you
want, you want to see a position on the wave

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.510
and you want to just get there.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.399
I mean the main thing is to take hesitation
out of it.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.269
And that usually comes by feeling confident
because you're in shape and you're strong

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.010
and you're flexible and that's what breeds
confidence, especially in the water.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.440
This is something that you can do in your
office, in a very small space.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.519
All you need is a ball, you don't need to
get in your car and drive somewhere to work

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.230
out or you know a ton of machines.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.720
If you don't have those machines, you can't
work out so this is gonna get people really

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.010
strong, really flexible.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.100
This is how I train, I train this way in hotel
rooms when I travel and I train this way when

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.100
I'm home.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.710
I don't have to deviate what I'm doing no
matter where I go.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.450
This video is for anybody that wants stronger
paddling muscles so when the surf comes up,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
you know they're out there and they're on
it and they don't have to sacrifice being

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.730
a little out of shape for the swell because
they've been working of the waves have been

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.730
flat.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.980
This is just a constant strength builder,
a constant kind of tune up you can do.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.500
Which is super important for surfing because
it's not, it's not good everyday hahaha.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.810
So you gotta, you gotta prepare yourself for
when it is good.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.170
You don't want to miss out, you want to be
out there.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.170
The main thing is to be healthy, strong and
feeling better than you felt 10 years ago.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.290
Which is um, I can actually speak from experiencing,
I feel better now than I ever did in my twenties.
