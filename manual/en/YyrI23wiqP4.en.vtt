00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.600
So now that we have our left hand down a little
bit better we are going to take and have some

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.980
fun with our right hand. So I'm going to play
my 2 minor to my 6 minor again that is your

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.800
A minor to E minor. I'm going to play the
bebop scale with my left hand. Now the bebop

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.720
scale takes this major scale which is 7 notes
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and we are going to add a extra

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
note that is in harmonic to the scale so out
side of the scale so we use one of these black

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:52.870
notes as the passing tone. So we have a even
number of scales. Notice that I'm playing

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.820
this B5. So it is that theory that you can
go in and out of the scale but as long as

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.610
you use the scale as the bases for what your
playing on your right hand it would always

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:55.770
sound good. So we are going to go through
and play those minor chords with some bebop.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.649
So that is a nice simple bebop ideas with
your right hand so when you approach the accordion.
