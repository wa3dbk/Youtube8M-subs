00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:17.699
In the future days, which we seek to make
secure, we look forward to a world founded

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.279
upon four essential human freedoms.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:31.779
The first is freedom of speech and expression
 -- everywhere in the world.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:46.499
The second is freedom of every person to worship
God in his own way -- everywhere in the world.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:58.309
The third is freedom from want, which, translated
into world terms, means economic understandings

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:08.060
which will secure to every nation a healthy
peacetime life for its inhabitants -- everywhere

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.640
in the world.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:22.580
The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated
into world terms, means a world-wide reduction

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.180
of armaments to such a point and in such a
thorough fashion that no nation will be in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:47.740
a position to commit an act of physical aggression
against any neighbor -- anywhere in the world.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:58.840
That is no vision of a distant millennium.
It is a definite basis for a kind of world

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.890
attainable in our own time and generation.
That kind of world is the very antithesis

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.769
of the so-called "new order" of tyranny which
the dictators seek to create with the crash

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.459
of a bomb.
