Hi everyone, welcome to Poggi's Animal House.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
My name is Michael Poggi and today I've got
my black leopard inside, and she loves to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.950
be inside the house 'cause of course much
cooler in here than outside in the floor of

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.200
heat so she enjoys coming in on the weekends.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.460
We're in my kitchen right now, she loves to
hang out and watch what we're doing in the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.000
kitchen and she sits in the living room couch
with me and we end up watching TV together.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.750
She's pretty dostile, she's a good kid, doesn't
cause too much trouble, very sweet, but she's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.019
very observant too she wants to watch everybody
and see what they're doing.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.770
So I just love this animal, she's about 3
years old and total sweetheart.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.890
She likes to play little bit rough though,
that's for sure.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.040
And I have her in a leash mainly because that
she'll end up jumping just about anywhere

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.371
in the house, so I need to keep a little bit
of control on her to make sure that she's

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.580
not jumping around the house.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.360
This bigger cat is from Asia, it's an Asian
leopard and she's a female she's ready to

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.890
be bred so we're going to be putting her into
a breeding program to help improve the gene

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.530
line and the species because there's not that
many left in the world especially in the wild.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.840
So by breeding them in captivity it gives
a chance to help add to the population and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
so on.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.600
If we should ever run out of them in the wild
we have some captive bred ones to release

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.210
in the wild which is important.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.009
Good girl, you're behaving huh.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.210
She may jump on me, she has the tendency to
sneak up and slam me.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.649
She just may do that but right now she's behaving.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:08.869
Hey there, my name is Michael Poggi and I've
got my black leopard here and we're gonna

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.590
be sitting here on the couch in my living
room just watching a little TV.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:03:20.220
She likes Animal Planet and she likes watching
the animals go by on TV so let's see how she

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:41.130
does.
