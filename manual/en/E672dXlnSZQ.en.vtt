00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.700
Howdy everyone!

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.680
Jaystepher here with The Simpsons

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.120
Series 2 Lego Minifigures mystery pack.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.160
Set Number 71009.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.080
Recommended building ages are 5 and up.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.140
So there is one of sixteen hiding inside this package.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.300
Let's see which one is inside.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.280
I hope it's not a duplicate.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.300
We shall see.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.500
This one's a little tough to open up as well.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.440
Here we go!

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.480
Somebody's obviously got a large head.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.100
Oh and a skirt!

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.780
No!

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.200
So here is the possible sixteen.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.580
Looks like this is Selma,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.240
and she's got a skirt.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.520
This is the second mystery pack I've opened and ...

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.160
getting hit hard with skirts.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.060
Okay.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.520
Let's see. Let's get this going.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.360
I better not cough or sneeze.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.040
This one's a bit tougher to get on than Marge.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.320
Hold up.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.780
Okay.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.760
I had to fight to get that on,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.780
but I finally got it on.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.440
No Selma. Keep your skirt on.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.120
This skirt just wants to fight me all the way.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.620
Lets put her head on.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.620
It's a very large head.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.800
Looks like an eye chart,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.830
and that is printed.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.560
So this is Selma.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.540
Nice style for her head.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.160
The blouse is printed

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.240
as well as the chart.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.500
Looks like a Snellen chart.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.540
This is Selma from The Simpsons Series 2 collection.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.200
Thank you for watching!
