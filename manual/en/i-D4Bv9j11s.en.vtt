00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.220
the lights kind of bright

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.360
i used the novelty yarn

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.640
the eyelash or i'm not sure what the other type is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.220
here is another one

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.240
this will give you an idea, i made three of these

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.580
and i made a hat here to match

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.640
i did a puff stitch hat and this is the party yarn from caron

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.100
its a larger hat as well

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.640
its kinda funny when i called them the other day

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.889
i told him, i said i know its summer time and hot right now

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.040
he asked me if i had anything else to give away

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.160
i said, well, i do have some hats

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.020
i said i know its kind of hot right now

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.860
so i can wait and give them to you in the fall

00:00:50.924 --> 00:00:53.884
and hes like No No, go ahead and get them ready

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.640
so thats what i'm doing, i'm getting them ready

00:00:57.678 --> 00:00:59.198
i've got a few more here

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.880
there's another one of the hats i made my son had requested

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.180
i think that one is probably similar
