00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.490
What inspired me was my two older sisters
swam when I was little and I wanted to be

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.770
like them. I always wanted to follow in their
footsteps and my mum and dad took me along

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.540
to learn to swim anyway. They wanted me to
learn to swim for when we go on holiday and

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.730
my two older sisters swam and I just wanted
to beat them. I was the baby and I wanted

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.990
to do what they were doing and I just wanted
to beat them really.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.020
My dad was my biggest inspiration and my
biggest encouragement as well. Obviously

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.290
with swimming we start at 4.30 in the morning,
which means, at that age, dad has to get

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.449
up and take you to swimming. So I think,
without him getting up and driving early,

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.970
I would never have done it.
I first started sport when I was three, when

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.580
I started swimming. My dad thought it a great
idea, because we lived by the sea, to learn

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.450
to swim. There’s been lots of inspirational
people in my life that I have looked up to,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.600
people like the Olympic greats like Sir Steve
Redgrave, Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson, Olympic

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.610
heroes. Anyone like that, you always try and
aspire to be like them.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.340
Quite a lot of people that stand out like
Kelly Holmes who worked for so many years

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.320
to achieve the top of her game. That inspires
me a lot. I also like people like Usain Bolt,

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.630
because of his great personality. He doesn’t
take himself too seriously, and I’d like

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
to be a bit like that.
When I first came onto the British team,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.100
Steve Redgrave was still rowing, so I saw
him and Matthew Pinsent. The men’s four

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.881
was building up to the Sydney Olympics, which
was my first Olympic Games, so along with

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.440
Tim and James they were leading towards the
race, which could potentially be Steve’s

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.979
fifth Olympic gold medal. I suppose seeing
the way all of them trained, competed, the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.040
focus, the dedication, the life that they
were creating around them, was really inspiring

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.080
to see and be part of. I guess it was leading
the way for all of us, and set the levels

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.180
of what was possible for the British team.
I motivated myself, I got myself back into

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.580
sport with the help of my parents, my brother,
all the friends I had in school. It was just

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.220
something we all had in common. When I lost
my legs, it was like right, what can we all

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.470
still do together? Still played football,
rugby with my friends, sitting on the floor

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.490
as goalkeeper, scooting myself around with
a rugby ball in my hands at 9-10 years old.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.300
My friends who I grew up with through school,
are dead supportive. I’ve got a friend,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.190
if I ever wanted to take drugs or go out
drinking, she’d probably slap me!

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.730
Many of the reasons why I got into athletics
were because of the influential figures,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.230
who weren’t always paralympic. They used
to be able-bodied figures when I was younger.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.739
Nowadays, the three main influential figures
I have are probably Asafa Powell, Usain Bolt

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.770
and Tyson Gay. I admire Asafa Powell for
his intensity of the sport and how hard he

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:23.930
tries. And Tyson Gay has amazing technique,
it’s really precise, really cut finely.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.380
And I admire Usain Bolt for his attitude,
because when most people expect sprinters

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.790
to be very serious people on the line, Usain
Bolt tends to inject a bit of fun. Sport is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.770
not just sport, it’s a form of entertainment.
He provides that form of entertainment that

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.480
we all enjoy and love.
I can always remember watching athletics

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.099
on the tv. I remember coming down to Don
Valley and watching one of the big championships

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.610
here when I was younger. I remember watching
Linford Christie and Mick Hill throw the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.349
javelin, Sally Gunnell, all those amazing
athletes from that era. I remember thinking

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.480
it’s a great sport to be part of, and pictured
myself being at that level one day.There’s

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.830
nothing more exciting than walking in front
of 25,000 people, and knowing that they’re

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.769
there to watch you race. For that how-ever-long-that-may-be
you are the centre of attention. That’s

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.639
quite exciting.The best thing about boxing
and competing is the feeling after you’ve

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.539
just fought. The best feeling in the world.
I only know what it feels like to win, so

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.080
I think, if I lost, I think it would be a
totally different story.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.639
I probably prefer being in a crew boat with
other people. When it’s two of you, it

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.120
is that intensity of being in a marriage.
You go through huge highs and huge lows together.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.689
You are locked together, you’re completely
dependent on each other. There’s nowhere

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.779
to hide. When it doesn’t go well, you have
to get through that together. When it does

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:57.860
go well, it’s probably the most intimate
thing you can be in sport.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.889
I’ve been with my coach for 8-9 years now,
he’s always been there for me, he’s the

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.430
one that keeps me motivated, he’s there
through the good and bad times. He knows

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.979
how to push me, which is a good thing, so
he is definitely the biggest inspiration.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.169
My parents have followed me all around the
world with my athletics career, with my sledge

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.139
hockey career, and especially with swimming.
Same with my brother, he’s always been

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.990
there to help, to help my father, making
my throwing frames, helping with hockey sledges,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.520
great support in all aspects in my life and
in my sport.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.089
I have a coach called Lee Pung; he’s a
Chinese diver; he’s coached the world champions,

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:42.339
the Olympic champions. So it’s interesting
to see his perspective on things.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.969
I personally draw inspiration from my injury,
it’s something that really helps me through

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.779
tough training sessions. That was a really
difficult time in my career, and I just think

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.569
back to those days when I wasn’t able to
run, I had to stay at home and miss out on

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.830
competitions and ultimately get left behind
a little bit. When I think about those days,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.029
it really encourages me and makes me feel
really thankful for what I’ve got, the

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:14.280
ability to run. That keeps me motivated.
There are some days; yesterday I had to roll

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:25.809
out of bed at 8, which is early on a Saturday
morning, I had to drag myself to the gym

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:32.900
and push through my session, that’s when
it feels like a job. But a lot of the time,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.229
when there are people around encouraging and
pushing you, reminding you of what you’re

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.789
there for, that’s when it’s a passion.Things
have inspired me along the way, hearing other

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.559
people’s stories of how they’ve got on
in sports. Especially David Roberts, the

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:53.169
fact that he’s won the same amount of medals
as Tanni Grey-Thompson; it’s an absolutely

00:06:53.169 --> 00:07:01.319
amazing medal haul. I want to get to that
stage where I can call myself the greatest

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.800
paralympic athlete in the field of throwing.
The first time I walked into the Olympic

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.509
stadium, I was carrying the flag praying
that I didn’t fall over live on national

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.140
television and the stadium was full. So,
it’s a little different seeing 100,000 people

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:21.080
while carrying a flag, concentrating on not
falling over. It’s an amazing thing, probably

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.560
the highlight of my career. It’s a massive
honour to be asked to carry your nation’s

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.759
flag.
When you’re having a bad day, you’ve

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.300
got to keep in the back of your mind the
London 2012, the fact it’s in our country.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.190
That does motivate you and spurs you on every
time you go into a training session, you think

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:45.960
of the bigger picture really.
My ultimate dream is to start on the start

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.209
line at 2012 at our home Olympics, to perform
at my ultimate peak and to win a gold medal.

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.199
I would be absolutely over the moon if that
happened!
