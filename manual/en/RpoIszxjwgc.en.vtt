00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:02.708
(soft music)

00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:10.573
- [Joe Elmore] The dining
options in a city like Memphis

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:14.221
are many, but there is
none quite like the Arcade

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.944
on South Main Street about
two blocks from Beale Street.

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:22.168
It's the oldest cafe in town,
it's been in about 30 movies,

00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:25.368
and Tammy Arender went there
to see how they kept the doors

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:29.635
open even when downtown
Memphis was a ghost town.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:32.218
(guitar music)

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:38.819
- [Tammy Arender] Step
inside the Arcade Restaurant

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.933
in downtown Memphis and
step back into a world

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.208
where life was slower,
cell phones didn't exist,

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:48.125
and saturated fat was never spoken.

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.874
(guitar music)

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:59.489
Harry Zepatos greets his customers

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.384
with his gracious Greek grin.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:04.051
The third generation to
own the oldest restaurant

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.235
in Memphis opened by
his grandfather in 1919.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.033
- [Zepatos] There was a
pot-belly stove in the middle

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:11.818
about right there where you are,

00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:14.568
and they heated and cooked on it.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.245
Business was good.

00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:19.219
He chose this location because
we were right in the middle

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.776
of three train stations.

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:22.809
And the biggest was across the street.

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:24.703
There was one down here,
and one to the north.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:27.199
- [Arender] Situated at the
corner of South Main Street

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:30.239
and Calhoun Avenue, the
original building was a small,

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.564
one-story, wood-frame structure.

00:01:32.564 --> 00:01:35.679
Harry's grandfather tore it
down and built this building

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.609
in a Greek revival style.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.817
- [Zepatos] It was called the
Paris Cafe when he bought it.

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:41.908
He changed it to the Arcade right away.

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:45.236
He had seen that name in New
York and then at Atlanta also.

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:47.359
And the connotation then
was kind of like we think

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.473
of a mall: food, people,
things, places, stuff to do,

00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:51.785
that sort of thing.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:56.382
Ten years or so later, they
leased a hotel across the street

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.049
in that spot right there
and changed the name

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.649
to the Arcade Hotel.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.580
- [Arender] The last
remodel came in the Fifties,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.259
but the boomerang tabletop booths

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.676
and the soda fountain remain.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.894
You can still get an
old-fashioned milkshake.

00:02:10.894 --> 00:02:13.817
Even Memphis's most
famous resident, Elvis,

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:15.129
had a special spot.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.643
- [Zepatos] And he'd come in
this back door right there

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:18.617
and he'd sit with his
back to where we are now.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.350
And the mirror in front
did not have the logo on it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.238
and he'd sit there and he
could see who was coming up

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:26.286
behind him, and if he had
to get out, then he'd run

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:27.758
back out the door.

00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:29.603
- [Arender] The King's
table is the most popular

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:31.822
among out-of-town guests,
like these three ladies

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:35.033
who came all the way
from Corsicana, Texas.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:38.062
For Debbie Wright, it's
worth traveling three states

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:41.047
and five hundred miles
for the chance to sit

00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:42.606
where Elvis sat.

00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:46.009
- [Woman] Well, we're just
big Elvis fans, and you feel

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.379
like a little bit a part of
him and what he experienced

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.206
and his day-to-day life
that, you know, he was

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.169
a very famous person,
but he was ordinary guy

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.230
just like us too, you know.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.659
- [Reporter] Well, what about the food?

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.027
- [Woman] Oh, it's great. It's great.

00:03:01.027 --> 00:03:02.873
Yeah, it's the best breakfast.

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:05.443
- [Arender] Besides the
biscuits and buttery pancakes,

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:08.473
there's also a blue plate lunch each day.

00:03:08.473 --> 00:03:10.698
- [Mary Dyer] Lima bean, mashed potatoes.

00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:13.743
Every Friday we have catfish, you know.

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:15.589
- [Arender] Mary Dyer has
been a part of this kitchen

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.439
since 1958, making sure
that customers are fed

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.195
the most fabulous southern
fare they've ever tasted.

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:25.498
The food has been consistent
and kept customers

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:27.948
coming in even through the lean times,

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:30.127
from the Depression to the assassination

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:32.135
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:34.522
which happened just a block away.

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:36.730
Harry's grandfather was told to shut down

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.288
the restaurant just after
the civil rights leader

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:41.371
was shot in April of '68.

00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.151
- [Zepatos] National
Guard had been called in.

00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:46.051
I don't think they were
there yet, but the place

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:46.884
was crawling with folks.

00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:48.217
You can imagine.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.769
So he went home, and then they
woke him up about five or six

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.369
that morning, only an hour or two or three

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.616
after he'd gotten there and said,

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:59.049
would you come back and open up?

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.661
We need food.

00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:03.099
- [Arender] When the National
Guard left, the once-thriving

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.289
business started to struggle,
but the Zepatos family

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.361
managed to hang on, and
with the rebirth of Memphis'

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:12.550
downtown, the Arcade has
become one of the city's

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.206
most popular dining destinations.

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:17.243
Harry believes it's because he offers

00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:19.782
a different experience.

00:04:19.782 --> 00:04:21.702
- [Zepatos] If you go
around town or this city

00:04:21.702 --> 00:04:24.966
or any other, certainly there's
more chains than there are

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.825
local owned and operated places.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.491
And you can look in, I get
five restaurant magazines

00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.465
a week probably, so you
can thumb through all

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:36.433
of these things and go to
a design school somewhere,

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:40.127
and they're all gonna
end up looking the same.

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:42.086
They really are.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:46.225
I think we've got our
niche here and it's neat.

00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:48.038
- [Arender] With such a
nostalgic feel and an authentic

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:52.987
1950's look, the Arcade has
been seen in more than 30 movies

00:04:52.987 --> 00:04:57.126
from "Walk the Line" to "The
Firm" to "Great Balls of Fire".

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:59.419
While movie making has
helped put the mom-and-pop

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.939
restaurant back on the map,
it's the meals and good deals

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.862
that keep customers coming back for more.

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:07.014
- [Zepatos] You all have a good day.

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:08.847
- [Customers] You too.

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:11.497
- [Zepatos] Everybody
talks about the restaurant

00:05:11.497 --> 00:05:14.329
being a big deal, and it is,

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:18.461
but it's like having a party at your home.

00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.161
It's like you're gonna
have a hundred people

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:21.158
over to your house.

00:05:21.158 --> 00:05:23.163
You know you clean and you get
ready and you prep for what

00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:24.955
you're gonna do and you
know what you're gonna do,

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:26.961
and then you enjoy yourself when it comes.

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:28.305
That's all.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:29.702
- [Arender] So you still enjoy yourself?

00:05:29.702 --> 00:05:33.869
- [Zepatos] Absolutely.
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.
