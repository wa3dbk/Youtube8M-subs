00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.770
Black Pearl Software

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.600
Ahhhh began! to look beauty

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.620
The Black Pearl at that time

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.730
very cool

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.360
directly from the movie

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.710
screem

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.510
for your console

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.260
The Mask

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.170
Look at that beauty

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.550
This is Edge City

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.420
Well, who as it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.290
is the game mechanics?? you are the mask

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.180
what you have

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.720
go to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.020
search of that girl who was

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.590
kidnapped

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.350
and then you will face the greatest challenges

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
along with the mask since Stanley was fucked up life and found the mask

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.210
You have some powers like in the movie

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450
not that dash

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.700
where you kill everyone

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.260
you see there

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.019
that gun , the hammer

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.039
not the cat that got there

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.229
the hammer

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.399
the clockwork damn

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.109
that irritates

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.959
and a lot of good in this game .

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.769
Well, let's analyze the game :

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.559
The first analysis is ... well i´ll try give a shoryuken

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:39.699
lets get the next , now go !

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.549
ooo mother daughter ...

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.699
SHOOOORYUKEN

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:47.069
positives points of this game

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.039
graphics look cartoon , very beautiful , simple but beautiful

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.879
I like the game so no repair in graphics

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.359
you saw that gave a fail there, I did not take a shot , but okay

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.629
movements , you played the movie

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.809
you were playing with the movie character

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.039
guys did a difficult game moves well

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.829
the guys made ​​the game with the movements in the style of the film

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.069
I could not kill anyone, has the horn

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.709
this hurricane

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.049
this is the secret

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.169
turn on the hurricane and throw the enemy in the corner

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.219
just had that " M " which showed

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.819
power level

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.499
very cool !

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:51.499
More positives : the stages were very beautiful

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.939
enemies were not so

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.879
hard to kill

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.510
had no cuts on the screens where you would have to explore

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.469
I like games that

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.989
property good

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.629
Good gameplay , even easy .

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.999
anyone can play , you take 2 minutes to learn

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.239
and now the negatives poits

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.909
some bosses were very difficult

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:28.270
need some patience. Another downside of this game

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.050
you take one and a half, two hours you finished the game

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.389
then I felt like a casual game

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.879
was not " THE GAME " means ...

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.620
I considered it as a casual game

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:51.559
another negative point

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.789
I think the audio could be a little better in relation to music

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.330
in soundtracks

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.400
already

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.539
the sound effects are good, but I think the songs

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.879
leave a bit to be desired especially in the last stages, did not like

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.949
what else ? ? was a casual game

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.009
this money is for nothing

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.919
do not know why there

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.169
a meter score

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.539
was very difficult to find this life , mask , extremely difficult

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.900
so

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.069
I will score that this game is to score ...

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.279
score 7

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.279
final score for this game

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:48.289
was fun but had these points here that

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.729
I think that is what most

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.830
left him with low note

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.379
this game is very casual even , is not a game that holds your attention for hours by day

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.240
you play one day and just sickens

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.530
then it is not

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.039
" that game " but

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.839
is fun !

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.490
I think I got the boss

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.969
before that I see send some hugs to people

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:21.229
lullilulist for the kimerda games

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.990

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.569
and the master , the old lady Piiman ( it should be )

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.619
the caretaker of the building

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.339
( i forgot to write the person's name correctly)

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.930
oh no , I died ? ! ? ! ?

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.580
look at this ...

remember that secret I told then activate the hurricane and go ahead !

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.430
the bad of it when she shoots , she escapes

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.479
looks that

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.719
look at this , will I get to kill her ?

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.550
