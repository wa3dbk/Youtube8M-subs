00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.200
[Voiceover] A motor race in the motor city on a sun-splashed Sunday,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.300
the command to start engines five minutes away for today's Indycar duel in Detroit.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.240
Back now to Pit Road and Jamie Little.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.580
[Jamie] Well Alan, Ryan Hunter Ray wasn't the only good story in Indianapolis in the month of May.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.360
On day 2 of qualifying, Sam Schmidt,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.160
fourteen years and four months after
being paralyzed in an Indycar crash,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.400
he drove a car again.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.120
It was an emotional day for all of us involved in this sport

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.370
and who knows Sam and his family.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.559
So how does a quadriplegic drive four laps around the most famous race track in the world?

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.659
Here's John Brenkus.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.080
[John Brenkus] After an Indycar crash left Sam Schmidt a quadriplegic more than 14 years ago,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.700
he's back in the driver's seat.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.540
Over the last 11 months, a team of scientists and engineers

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.100
designed a high-tech system that enables Schmidt to drive this Corvette C7 Stingray

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.570
around the Brickyard using only head
movements.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.410
Here's how it works.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.220
When Schmidt moves his head, an array of infrared cameras around the driver's seat

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.580
detect motion by reflecting light off markers on his hat.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.900
These cameras can track minute head movements down to 4 thousands of an inch -

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.620
that's about the thickness of a single sheet of paper.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.740
This information is then relayed to a computer in the trunk at about 170,000 miles per second -

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.220
nearly the speed of light!

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.760
This computer interprets Schmidt's movement and sends that information to a second computer

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.900
that uses advanced algorithms to output the data back to the car.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.160
Side-to-side head movement activates the steering servo motor,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.690
a gear system that controls the
steering wheel.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.420
A quick head-tilt backwards engages the gas servo motor which accelerates the car

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.220
and to brake, depending on how quickly he needs to slow down,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.060
Schmidt bites down on a sensor with between 60 and 80 pounds of force.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.140
And in fact, from the time Schmidt moves until the time the car responds

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.420
takes as little as 100th of a second.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.520
That's as fast as a lightning strike.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.140
[Schmidt] For me, personally, this is a sense of normalcy that I thought I'd never get again.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.480
I finally feel normal because this is a normal thing to do when you're not paralyzed.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.070
Now I can do it like everybody else.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.630
[Mike Long]  We are trying to replicate this car as close to a real driving experience as possible.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.930
We're not trying to make him feel
anything different.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.340
We want the exact same fluid movement.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.840
[John] During testing, Schmidt has already reached speeds of more than 100 miles per hour

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.420
which means he can cover a car length in about a tenth of a second.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.280
At any speed, safety is our highest priority of course

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.960
which is why the car is equipped with a unique GPS safety system.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.380
This advanced tracking system can pinpoint the car's location down to 5 inches.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.920
If the car goes off-course, a computer system will to take over the controls to avoid danger.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.260
Sam Schmidt and his incredible team hope to have this technology out on the open road in only 5 years

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.140
and, judging by his current comfort level behind the wheel, Sam will be ready.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.980
In fact, in just his second practice run around the track, at speeds around 80 miles per hour,

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.760
relative to his resting heart rate, his pulse never varied by more than 10 beats per minute.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.300
For ESPN Sports Science,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.830
I'm John Brenkus.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.630
[Voiceover] Sam Schmidt has taken circumstances that were personally devastating to him

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.680
and turned them into an inspiration and
hope for many others in his circumstance.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.240
Simon Pagenaud drives one of Sam's cars today here in Detroit hoping to bring home another winner's trophy.
