00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:05.356
&gt;&gt; Now let's take a look at two examples of
adding mixed numbers with like denominators.

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:08.576
The first step is going to be to
write this problem vertically,

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:11.296
lining up the whole numbers and the fractions.

00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:17.476
So we'll have 2 and one-sixth,
plus 3 and one-sixth.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:22.196
And now we'll add the fraction part
and then the whole number part.

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:25.506
And because we already have a
common denominator, we can go ahead

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:28.686
and add these two fractions, the
denominator is going to stay 6

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:32.466
and then we'll add the numerators,
1 plus 1 is equal to 2.

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:36.176
And then looking at the whole
numbers, 2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:41.926
Now once we determine the sum of two mixed
numbers, we have to check for two things.

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:46.686
First, we want to make sure the fraction here is
in simplest form, and we also want to make sure

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.566
that it's a proper fraction,
not an improper fraction.

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:53.606
This is a proper fraction because the
numerator is less than the denominator.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.576
So that's good, but we do have to simplify it.

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:59.326
Two and 6 share a common factor of 2.

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:05.506
Two-sixths is the same as
2 all over the 2 times 3.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:07.696
So here's the common factor of 2.

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:10.796
So two-sixths simplifies to one-third.

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.026
Remember, 2 over 2 is equal to 1.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:15.896
These are simplifying to
ones and not disappearing.

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:19.346
So this is equal to 5 and one-third.

00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:22.176
Let's take a look at a second example.

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.256
We'll first write this vertically.

00:01:27.256 --> 00:01:33.366
So we'll have 5 and seven-eighths
plus 8 and five-eighths.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:39.296
And again, we already have a common denominator
so we can go ahead and add these fractions.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:45.056
The denominator's going to stay 8 and the
numerator will be 7 plus 5 which is equal to 12.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:49.046
And then 5 plus 8 is equal to 13.

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:54.466
Now again, we need to make sure this
fraction is a proper fraction, and it's not.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.566
It's an improper fraction.

00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:57.426
But it also can be simplified.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:01:59.926
So let's go ahead and simplify this first.

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:05.526
The prime factorization of
12 is 2 times 2 times 3,

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:09.926
and the prime factorization
of 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:14.556
So notice how the numerator and
denominator have two factors of 2 in common.

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:17.766
So this simplifies to 1 and
this simplifies to 1.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:24.716
So this is equal to 13 and 3 halves, but
again, we can't leave this mixed number

00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:27.506
with the fraction part being
an improper fraction.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:32.806
So now we have to convert this improper fraction
to a mixed number and then add it to 13.

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:35.386
Remember, a fraction bar represents division.

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:39.096
So 3 divided by 2 will help
convert this to a mixed number.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:39.936
Well there's
