Hi, I’m Dr. Carolyn Clancy, director of
the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.770
Quality, or AHRQ.
You don’t have to read medical journals

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.080
to know that serious, even deadly, medical
errors take place too often when people get

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.640
health care. Estimates place the number of
deaths from medical errors at nearly 100,000

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.489
each year in hospital settings alone.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.350
Most of the time we hear about medical errors
happening in hospitals. But they can occur

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.930
anywhere you get health care or drugs, including
doctors’ offices, clinics, surgery centers,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.150
pharmacies, and even at home. And many of
these errors could have been prevented.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.820
Fortunately, you can take steps to reduce
the chance of a medical error happening to

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.960
you or a loved one. AHRQ has developed a fact
sheet for patients that explains what you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.460
can do to prevent medical errors.
The most important thing you can do is become

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.810
an active member of your or your family’s
health care team. This means asking questions

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.970
of your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and speaking
up if you have concerns about medications,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.970
tests, or procedures.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.940
First, make sure all of your doctors know
every medicine that you are taking. This includes

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.780
prescription and over-the-counter medicines
as well as vitamins and herbal supplements.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.500
Make sure your doctor knows about any allergies
and reactions that you’ve had to medications.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.060
If you don’t understand something that your
doctor tells you, ask him to explain it again.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.440
Ask questions of your doctor or nurse, and
talk to your pharmacist when you pick up your

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.440
prescription.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.920
If you need to have surgery, choose a hospital
where many patients have had the same surgery

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.619
or procedure that you need. Make sure all
health care workers involved in your care

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.550
are familiar with your health history. And
consider asking anyone who touches you whether

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.299
they have washed their hands. And if you are
unable to speak up for yourself, ask a friend

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.030
or family member to be with you in the hospital.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.510
Medical errors can happen anywhere and to
anyone. Being an active, involved member of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.650
your health care team is an important way
to protect yourself.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.069
I’m Dr. Carolyn Clancy and that’s my advice
on how to navigate the health care system.
