00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.850
We're here at the Westone booth. Westone specializes in

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.040
making custom earsets for in-ear monitoring.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.500
A lot of you may be using the, uh, less-expensive earphones.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.310
 Kind of the consumer stuff like comes with iPod...or maybe even gone with some of the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.320
higher end products but are still concerned about how much noise

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.250
is bleeding into the headset.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
Or the tone just isn't it...right...so we're with Dale

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.120
from Westone. Dale, how can Westone help?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.300
Well basically we, uh provide custom-fit products as uh, as was stated here, and so

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.640
a custom fit provides a consistent fit and seal that's not always possible with some of the universal fit

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.890
products that are out on the market.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.620
Uh, and a consistent fit and seal is important for 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.040
sound isolation, uh, for hearing conservation. Obviously if you

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.800
have a loud stage, being able to reduce that stage volume is important

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.900
for the individual musician, as well as the congregation.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.170
So, by reducing the volume by 20-25 decibels, and having that consistent fit

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.630
and seal, it allows you to really maintain the quality of sound at a reduced volume.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.100
So how do you get a custom fit? I mean do you, do you order 'em custom or what happens?

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.540
Well, what has to happen is you have to have an impression taken of your ear.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.650
And so, an audiologist is recommended because they're trained in understanding

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.880
all things ears, from the hearing conservation to also taking impressions.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.710
An impression is basically..uh..what'll happen is they, you go into an audiologist's office

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.280
and they will insert what's called an oto-dam, and it'll block the ear canal

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.220
and they, so that they can then inject material into your ear

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.500
to make an impression. [Ron speaking] So then they go ahead and take that. Send it to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.760
to you. You make a mold out of ithat...[Dale} "That's correct." [Ron] Then what happens?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.620
[Dale] Well, once we've manufactured the custom-fit product, depending

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.660
on what that is, and we have the a new product called the AC2, which is a

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.830
dual-driver, fully custom-fit, uh, ear monitor...

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.530
Uh, will work with any personal ear monitoring system on the market.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.480
It's very affordable. Uhm, well once we've manufacture that we ship that

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.690
back to the, the customer and then that is then used for any in-ear monitor system

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.130
that's currently on the market, personal ear monitoring system.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.310
[Ron] Okay, so completely compatible, even with my iPod? [Dale] "Yeah."  

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.420
[Ron] With any in-ear monitor systems. Do you have an example of the AC2?

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.570
[Dale] Yes, the AC2 [Ron] Okay  [Dale] Uh, right here this is custom fit

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.210
to my ear. [Ron] Okay.  [Dale]  Uhm, again it's a fully custom fit.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.340
Uh, let's take...[Ron] Now....see how that is a custom? Can we zoom in on

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.750
that and take a look. That's a custom fit. Okay...[Dale] And it's, uh custom fit to

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.890
my ear. uhm... [Ron] Okay so that's all molded in then?  [Dale] "Yes."  [Ron] It's not a separate

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.520
thing that plugs in.  [Dale]  "Exactly. Fully custom fit with all the components 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520
bound inside a full custom jacket."  [Ron]  Okay so this is the same thing the rockers wear

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.560
on stage.  [Dale]  "Exactly. Yes."  [Ron] Okay, so what kind of isolation can I get

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.180
from this versus a standard foam-type insert headset?  [Dale] "Well the honest truth is

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.200
depending on the design of the universal-fit ear foam, uh, but you can get 20-25

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.970
decibels of sound reduction, and that's what you could expect from a custom-fit product."

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.740
[Ron]  Nice, nice. Okay, so what that means is I get a clearer sound. I don't get as much

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.140
interference from the rest of the stuff that's happening on the stage. [Dale] "That is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.660
correct."  [Ron]  Fabulous! Alright Dale. So that's it from the Westone booth here

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.060
at Christian Musicians Summit.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.000
