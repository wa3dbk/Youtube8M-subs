00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.480
Bamako, January 2012.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.840
I am visiting Sega Sidibe,
virtuoso djembe player.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.000
I am here in Mali to make recordings
of his djembe music.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.440
Traditional Malian music...

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.520
that deserves to be listened to
by a wider audience.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.760
I am Rutger van der Ree,
I am a musician.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.920
I am running a music studio in Amsterdam
where I teach djembe.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.240
I am working at a lot of schools...

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.960
and sometimes I perform with Sega...

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.240
like last year during the
AMP Percussion Festival in Ruigoord.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.120
I've known Sega for 25 years now.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.880
I know him as a virtuoso djembe player,
as master of checkers...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.680
as a humorist,
but above all as my djembe guru.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.560
He has an almost treacherous timing, hot
techniques and an enormous vocabulary.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080
So he is by far
the best djembe player of the world.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.520
In March Sega will visit me again
to give workshops and performances.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.440
He comes for the 15th time and I want
to celebrate that with a CD presentation.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.680
With Sega, and with you.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.640
We have produced a beautiful CD...

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.680
which still has to be pressed
and presented.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.200
I really need your help to succeed.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.920
With your donation you help me, but also
Sega, his family and the other musicians.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.200
Of course you get something in return.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.360
A nice cup of tea with Sega,
a game of checkers with the master...

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.640
the double CD or a real
VIP package during the CD-presentation.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040
And of course my eternal gratitude.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.920
Will you help us?
I sincerely hope so.
