I'm Gianni and this is my North Beach.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.099
Today's episode is a viewer's choice.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.520
John Rowan asked if I could make cacio e pepe,
so that's the recipe for today.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.609
If you have a favorite dish you want me to
make, just leave a comment. Let me know what

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.109
it is and maybe you'll see it in an upcoming
episode.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.689
A lot of times I tell you how to make sauces
that are ready in the time that it takes to

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.879
cook the pasta.
You know what? Cacio e pepe is even quicker

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.089
than that. It's a no-cook sauce. The only
thing is the ingredients are a little complicated,

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.049
so let me show you what we're gonna be working
with.

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.059
There's three of 'em.
Spaghetti.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.339
Cracked black pepper.
Pecorino romano.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.569
And that's it for the sauce.
I wanted to show you, though, I'm always talking

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.999
about my Sicilian sea salt. Here it is.
The only place I'm using the sea salt, though,

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.260
is in the pasta water. So let's get cooking!
So we have the pecorino romano. Don't use

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709
that stuff in the green carton because it's
crap.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:08.100
You only got three ingredients in this dish,
so make sure you get the best.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390
Buy a hunk of this.
And I'm going to show you how you really should

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.640
grate this because we're going to create a
sauce just with the pecorino and with the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.890
pasta cooking water.
So first I'm gonna use this big grate. And

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.820
I'm not gonna push too hard. I'm going to
go light, light, light.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.960
But I want some of these big strands.
And you'll see why they're important when

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.270
I put the dish together.
So I'm gonna do some of this. We're gonna

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
end up with about a cup.
We also want to use the small grate because

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.710
we want this really to permeate all of the
sauce and help coat all of the pasta.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.159
Look at that.
Ooh, the aroma coming off of the pecorino.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.579
So you see the difference here?
This one's gonna kind of dissolve, it's gonna

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.319
make a creamy sauce.
And this one's gonna stick to the pasta and

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.780
you're gonna get little strings of the pecorino.
Okay, I'm gonna scoop this up and put it in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.560
the bowl.
And I can mix it up, I don't care now.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.749
But let's get it all over here.
This is a knob, I don't know if you know,

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:13.720
but this is a knob to adjust the size of the
grate. We want as rough, as big a grate as

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.849
we can get because when you taste this pasta,
you want to get some of that pepper caught

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.840
in your teeth.
So let me show you.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.030
If we were doing a salad or something, I'd
put it down low, low, low.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.230
Look how small that is, right?
I don't want that because we want the texture

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.010
of the pepper in this dish.
So let me get rid of that, but you see how

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.939
big it's coming out now?
See these big pieces in here? That's what

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.220
you want.
If you want to, this is the other way you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.140
can prepare these.
You can use a pan, I'm using my meat pounder

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.170
here.
You can just crush these a little bit. And

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.920
just crack them.
You hear them cracking there?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.450
Look at that.
And that's another way you can prepare these.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.209
So this pasta comes from Naples. It's a small
producer, they've been making it for a long

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.099
time, a family business.
It's durham wheat and it goes through a bronze

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.849
extruder so it's gonna have a rough surface.
That rough surface helps hold the sauce.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm in a hurry today, so I don't want to get
the scissors and try to open this thing up.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.510
Just hold it like this and pick it up and
baboom! There it goes. It's going right in

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.180
the water now.
So the water's boiling. Make sure you get

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.219
a big pot because your pasta always has to
dance in the water.

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:38.219
And it's got to be well salted also.
So this is that coarse Sicilian sea salt.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.670
Give it a good amount.
And here's that baboom that I opened this

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.939
real quick.
And, notice, nothing's broke, so don't be

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.670
worried about doing it that way.
Just throw the pasta in.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.500
Any time you put pasta in hot water, make
sure you stir it a little bit. Make sure that

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.000
it's not sticking together and it doesn't
stick to the bottom of the pot.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
A couple more minutes.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Ha! It must be done.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.300
So this is al dente. We don't want this to
fall apart so just picking it all out of the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.230
water here.
Don't drain it because we need this pasta

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.600
water. That's gonna be part of the sauce.
There's our spaghetti. I don't want it to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.600
stick together, so I'm gonna take a ladleful.
Maybe a second ladleful of the pasta water.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.480
Mix it all together.
It's got enough moisture.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.950
Here's that cheese, the two different grates
of the cheese.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.680
I'm gonna put that in.
And if it looks a little too dry to you, just

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.600
add a little bit more water.
Okay, I'm gonna finish it up.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.970
I added a little bit more of the fine grate
and a little bit more of the bigger grate.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.890
But see how it's melting here and coating
the pasta?

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.790
That's what we want.
So here's what I did before, I'm just gonna

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.770
throw this in here.
Make sure this is up high...whoa. What happened?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.770
Ow, it's hot! What are you gonna do? The whole
thing's falling apart.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.840
Just gonna give it a little bit more. Not
too much. A little bit more of that heavy

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.080
grate.
Mix it up one more time and we'll plate it

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.500
up.
And when you put it in the bowl, twist it

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.000
a little bit and you'll get this nice nest
of pasta.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.100
Give it another grate of black pepper.
Okay. A little bit of that creamy sauce, the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.190
pecorino. Let me taste. Wow, this is some
long spaghetti strands over there. I'm hungry.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.500
Mmm.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
Mmm.
