Hello friends, Welcome to Tarla Dalal's kitchen

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.640
I am Krupali

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.140
Today I am going to share with you a popular soup recipe named 'Sweet corn and Vegetable Soup' 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.540
We are going to use sweet corn and crunchy vegetables in making this soup 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.180
To enhance the flavour, we are going to saute ginger and garlic in butter which will lend a very nice aroma 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.174
Lets start making it

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Allow the butter to melt

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.460
The butter has melted

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.820
Saute for a few seconds

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.709
Ginger and garlic is giving a very nice aroma

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640
Sweet corn kernals which is the main ingredient of our recipe 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.750
Crushed sweet corn kernels will help in thickening the soup

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
For the mixed boiled vegetables, i have taken French beans, carrot and cauliflower 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.580

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.900

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.700
It's been 4 to 5 minutes and you can see the soup has become nice thick because of the cornflour

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.880
