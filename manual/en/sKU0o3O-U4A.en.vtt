Hi, this is Josh with JHE’s Log Furniture Place.  You can find us online at www.logfurnitureplace.com.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.639
Today we will be taking a look at our Contoured Comfort Visa-Tete.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.639
It features two lounge chairs with

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.660
a table in the middle.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.169
The table does have a hole so you can stick an umbrella in there.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.169
The visa-tete is angled so it will go in a corner of a deck or a porch.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.300
It’s easier to talk to people; you don’t have to turn your head quite so far.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.370
The back is fanned and at a slight angle so it’s quite comfortable to sit in.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.300
The seats are contoured

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.750
seat slats

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.090
so they fit the shape of your body very well.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.670
They are also sanded on the end

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.290
so they will not cut into the leg, they are very smooth.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
We put this together with a mortise and tenon design

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.890
so it’s very strong and durable.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.490
The hardware we use is zinc dichromate.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.080
That is a finish we have put on all our hardware

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.300
so it doesn’t rust.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.130
The table comes assembled already.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.160
The backs come assembled and the seats come assembled.  All you have to do is put the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.189
legs and the arms on.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.510
Then fasten it all together.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.440
This is unfinished.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.790
We do offer it in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.060
a cedar tone outdoor finish.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.500
You can find this on our website at www.logfurniture.com.  If you go to our 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.610
