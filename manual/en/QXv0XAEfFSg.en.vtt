Now, I was reminded of Galaxy Express 999.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.120
Ramen and pork,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.899
from plastic and petroleum-

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.999
in the Galaxy Express 999.

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.809
I was surprised at the future.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.789
What is the raw material of this hamburger taste?

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.359
Russian roulette.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.530
(Myself to incorrect)

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.749
Many are 9s.
Galaxy Express 999 is a story the boy grow up.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.110
I want to grow up, too.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.870

I found an amazing snacks at the supermarket.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.190
In Nichie of Urasaki

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.170
It had been piled up like a mountain.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.060
Have been printed, Adult Umai-bo.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.890

Because
The middle-aged man in a convenience store can buy it?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.110
Dear Ordinary People without courage.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.700
Please confidence.
Now we have this.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.140
If I buy mail order Umai-bo, you wish to strict packing.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.240
There is a risk that is known to family and neighbors.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.050
(This is story of Umai-bo)

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.270
On the other hand, this is safe.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.310
This package is okay.
Because adults are printed.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.820

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.480

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.610

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.980
I ate a bit. But painful.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.990
Hoooot!

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.010
Woo! Strong cheese smell.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.020
Hokuto and South

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.940
I'm sorry. I'm not that childish.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.490

I have increased,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.000
The number of playing on its own.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.099
Vaaaaa!

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.699
Liquor is limited to adults.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:18.840
Yeaaa!

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.610
Same tone.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.340
So,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.940
Lot 9 is cool.
It's exciting

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.970
999, is the end of childhood.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.670
Watch, comment and rate, Thank you. See ya!
(Soft beer for children)

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.210
Tavern Track.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.620
Nippo Corporation.
Yaokin Corporation.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.870
Can not be found in print Umai-bo.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.030
Supermarket staff thought it was Umai-bo, it.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.650
The staff is hard working.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.489
Rice snacks ,Ozarks.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.459
This is the adult channel.
So, I found the adult Ozarks.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.190
Adult Ozarks.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.920
When I was 17,18,19,20,21,22 years old, I was thinking about adults.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.520
It is the smell of smoked.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.000
It is a good sound.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.900
Please drink.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.000
Will enjoy together.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.460
When I was a teenager, I thought I was an adult.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.470
In hindsight, it was a child.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.550
When I was 30 years old, I thought it was still a child.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.350
Kids think.  "I'm Adult".

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.630
Adult think.  "I'm children".

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.120
Me now?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.910
I do not care either.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.860
Idea of a middle-aged man.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.750
Your bubble disappears.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.449
Is the time you get home?

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.430
Someday, let's drink together.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.780
It is the topic of Dragon Quest.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.030
It is a card that charges a online play license.
However, because of server maintenance,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.690
it is sometimes not available.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.340
I hope, please extend-

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.930
the many time were not available.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.210
I'm stingy.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.160
I'm not playing right now.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.710
My daughter is playing.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.110
For health, note the excessive drinking.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.979
I am sorry. I'm an adult. I will not be childish.

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.940
There was a problem with the Umai-bo's pack.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.960
What do you mean?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.669
It is a pack of Umai-bo. However, a mixture of different snacks.

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.190
It is a different manufacturer.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.570
Karappa. This is also different companies.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.080
Adults or children, it is not critical.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.210
I'm a middle-aged man. But this I can not understand.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.460
Must grow.
