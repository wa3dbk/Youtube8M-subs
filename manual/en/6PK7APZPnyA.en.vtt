00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.970
Hi, welcome back. I don't know about you,
but I am ready to learn more about the Major

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.050
Arcana cards. Okay, and we're dealing with
three more, as I said there are 22 in total.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.829
So, right now we're going to be talking about
The Lovers, guess what that's focusing on?

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:27.509
And yes, as someone said before, "they're
naked", because these are, as you can tell,

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.230
very renaissance pictures and they did depict
naked people during that time. But it's dealing

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.000
with relationships and everything that involves
relationships. I'll read a little bit to you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.530
from the book, "It's fulfillment through a
relationship, love of one creates passion

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.640
for others, and it's material happiness and
security through a relationship". So that's

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.100
the lovers. The next is the Chariot. Now,
if you look, she is leading a chariot, and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.399
that's what that's about, is being leader.
Horses will only go where the reigns take

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:11.400
them, and basically it's being a leader for
your group, with the love and respect you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.670
should be giving a group when you are leading.
I'll read that a little bit to you "Horses

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.580
will only follow the reigns if they want to,
leadership of a team, collaboration and compromise.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.110
A victory obtained by working with others,
not against them". So it's working with everybody

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.580
involved. So again, it can go with a business
sense or something else too, sometimes family

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.150
issues come up in this card. The last card
we're going to talk about in this segment

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.320
is Justice. And someone mentioned Justice
looked very boring but, oh this is Justice,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.180
I apologize. Justice is not supposed appear
very excited, but it's really dealing with

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.159
balance, it's dealing with everything in balance.
Justice is also sometimes dealing with Karma

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.079
as well. So be aware of that. Karma, for some
people who don't know what that is, it's kind

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.409
of like, whatever you put out you're going
to get back. So, it's the Golden Rule, treat

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.989
people the way you want to be treated. So,
that is Justice. Great, so are we going to

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.409
learn more about the Major Arcana cards? Yep,
we're moving through. Great, coming up next.
