00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.620
My friend Mitchell is always full of creative,
imaginative and innovative ideas.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.240
She's always taking everyday objects and turning
them into something, well, extraordinary,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.570
if not spectacular.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.070
Hey beautiful people.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.090
Let's make an autumn wreath.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.300
This is gonna be fun and it's really super
easy and it's made out of all recycled stuff

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.609
that I promise you you have plenty of around
your house.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:44.579
The deal is that making recycled paper crafts
is not only cheap and easy but also really

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.210
a nice thing that you can do for society at
large, because we as a world throw away 68

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.450
million tons of paper every year and only
recycle 43 million tons.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.700
So, if we recycle enough to make a beautiful
autumn wreath this size, we will putting a

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.540
major dent in the carbon footprint of the
whole year, and making a cool autumn wreath.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.720
So the first thing I'm gonna do is take this
recycled piece of corrugated cardboard.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.970
It really can be from anything -- a cardboard
box or whatever.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.510
Then I took -- made a circle out of just something
as big as I wanted my wreath to be.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.119
And I cut it out like this.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.300
And now I'm gonna cut the hole out of the
middle.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.070
And I like using a click knife.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.270
And I made my middle circle out of this and
just set it on there and measured it out with

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.890
my fingers, because I eyeball stuff all the
time.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.280
I like my stuff a little rough-hewn anyway,
just like me.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.590
So, I'm making my wreath shape.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.479
We're gonna saw through this -- none of this
is gonna show, none of it.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.830
Ta-dah, now we've got a wreath shape.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.480
Alright, now, I've taken a bunch of old magazines
-- like this is from 1987.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.860
This is from '67.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.180
When you're using, like, magazine pictures
and stuff, you wanna look for a color palette.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.579
So I think we're gonna do like a brown family,
the green family, and some purple.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.120
That'll be good autumn, all-together colors.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.870
So I've gone through and just kind of flipped
around, dug around, and then I'm just looking

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.870
for color.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.620
Doesn't matter what the picture is or anything.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.019
So, like, I ran across that.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.099
That's a good autumn color.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.799
So I'll tear this out.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.379
And I'm just gonna cut this part off and throw
it like that.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.540
Put this in my little pile of greens.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.519
So that's how I've been flipping through looking
for stuff.

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:10.629
Then like this is part of the brown family,
so I'll use this in my browns.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.120
So, cut this off, stick that in, throw that
down.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.719
This is kind of a fashion-y thing, but it's
got a lot of purple and the yellow in it,

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.469
so I'm gonna use this piece too.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.309
I'm also using some scrap.

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:28.590
I took come scrap scrapbooking paper that
I had some pieces left over from, not really

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.749
enough to make a big, and big project on its
own.

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.290
So I started off with those and I cut some
leaf patterns out.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.430
And they're not even or anything.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.900
And then I'm gonna do that with these as well.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.199
So I'm gonna stack these up and I'm gonna
make them about that big, because we're gonna

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.340
do a big leafy pattern.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.180
And this is it -- you just cut these.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.159
And then it's just the pattern.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.430
So that looks really cool.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.519
And then you put it in a stack.

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.419
And, ooh, this could go on either side.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.959
I think I like this side better, even.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.099
Those are one of those happy surprises that
happen.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.139
With magazines, you can do so many pieces
at one time.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.150
But look at what these leaves start looking
like.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:35.160
And then you mix it in with these, like, fun
patterns in this purple.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.150
So I have a really good start right now on
paper.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.960
So I'm gonna go ahead and get started making
this really cool wreath.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.740
So I am grouping all the little oranges and
the greens and then the bright purple and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.740
reds together.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.509
We're gonna go backwards around.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.650
I'm just gonna lay some glue down here.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.970
And I'm folding it in the middle, each leaf.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.360
And I'm gonna put one in the middle.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.810
And then it gives it a little bit of volume.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.340
And then I'm gonna try and mix it up.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.060
And fold this here.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.780
So I'm gluing this down like that.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.680
And I'm not even paying attention about the
letters sticking up or anything -- I think

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.120
it'll look cool when it's all done.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.430
Oh, I like the way this is looking.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:39.830
Okay, we're almost done.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.060
Easy, easy, this weighs nothing.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.889
So we can hang it -- cut a piece of tape like
this, little slits like that.

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.340
You fold this over like that.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.580
You wrinkle it up a little bit.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.690
You stick it anywhere you want, and look,
there's your hanger, because this weighs nothing.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.130
And this means that you can hang it on a nail
or anywhere you want.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.080
And here we have a recycled paper autumn wreath
that looks amazing.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.949
Made of stuff that I had laying around my
house that I'm absolutely positive you do

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:19.960
too.
