second of three discussions on the
hummingbird. Special thanks to

I'm Susan Matson on on behalf of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
Perky-Pet®, I'd like to introduce Dr. Ross
Hawkins to our show. Ross is the founder

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.800
and director of the hummingbird society
which was created to educate people

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.150
about the hummingbirds and protect
peepers from extinction. During today's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
conversation, we'll also touch on their
massive appetite and how their mode of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
flight plays such a critical role. Ross
welcome to the show. Thank You, Susan. So I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.850
have to ask, why is mode of flight so
important? Well as most people know who've

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.559
seen a hummingbird, they hover, and this
is ability which is unique to the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.620
hummingbird. Other birds fly with a
powerful down stroke to provide lift; the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.800
upstroke doesn't. Hummingbirds are quite
different. They have powerful forward-

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.900
backward strokes. Each provides lift and
power. Wings are like paddles because the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.080
wrist and elbow joints are fused and in
effect, they have very long hands. If you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.119
picture holding a small electric fan
pointed down at such a high velocity

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.270
that it can support the weight of the
fan, you have a hummingbird. A specialized

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.110
part of their brain takes the visual
information from their eyes and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.329
translates it into muscle movement. So
that's to maintain a perfect hovering

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.270
position, and no other bird can do that.
Hummingbirds fly like helicopters with

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220
two differences. The helicopter blades
rotate continuously while the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.570
hummingbirds wings go back and forth,
reversing the wings angle with each move,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.720
and the helicopter uses aviation fuel,
but the hummingbird uses sugar from

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.860
nectar, and they both use incredible
amounts of energy just to stand still.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.380
What do I mean by incredible? For the
hummingbird, it means visiting one to two

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.500
thousand blossoms a day in which they
take in double their weight in nectar,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.260
and that's why feeders can be so
effective. One feeder is like having a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
yard full of flowers as far as the
hummingbird is concerned. So if you have

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.240
one feeder or you have a half a dozen
feeders, how should we place that in our

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.160
yard for them to be most effective for
the hummingbird? Well I think the first

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.060
consideration is that most feeders
should be positioned where you can see

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.670
them. that's part of the joy of feeding
hummingbirds. Absolutely. Feeders

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.750
should always be placed out of the reach
of cats if there are any in your area,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.959
that means 4 feet or higher. Feeders
placed in the shade won't have to be

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.870
cleaned and refilled as often. At our
home, we currently have 7 feeders: two are

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.239
window mounted and 5 hour glass feeders.
The Perky-Pet® 8 ounce

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.080
pinch wave feeder has always been
popular with both hummingbirds and the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.190
people who feed them. There's also a 16
ounce version if you have a lot of

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.049
Hummers. You can also look at the Oasis
model which we have used from time to

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.690
time. Window mounted feeders like the
Perky-Pet Garden Song make it possible

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.000
to have a feeder only a few feet from
your breakfast table, in effect, turning

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.120
your home into a bird and breakfast. Away
from the windows, we hang our feeders in

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.220
low tree limbs on Shepherd hooks and
from the edge of our pergola. Thank you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.090
so much,
Ross for that explanation. I'm not sure I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.959
actually realized how much the hovering
was a unique trait to the hummingbird,

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.769
and you bet it was, I just didn't know
they stay in the helicopter, pretty much

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.299
the only ones that hover. So Ross, do you
have any stories that may suggest that

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.670
hummingbirds do come back and are
persistent? Maybe they don't necessarily

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.739
move from a feeding source, and keep
going. Oh I have so many illustrations of

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.500
that, Susan. People tell me regularly that
when their hummingbird feeder is empty,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.320
the hummingbird will come up to the
window perhaps, while the person is

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.489
sitting in front of their laptop or
maybe washing dishes and will stare at

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.410
them through the window as if to say, "Hey
you! The feeder needs taken care of." Just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.430
last week, several people told me that
their feeders take it one step further

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.710
and actually come up to the window, and
tap on it with their beak. I thought both

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.360
of those were pretty amazing, but the
winner is a story of a man named Jonah

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.370
down at Ubatuba, Brazil, and he lives in
a village where there so few insects

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.260
that nobody bothers to put screens on
their doors for windows. Jonah has one

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.389
hummingbird who knows that when the
feeder is empty, he must fly into an open

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.610
window search for Jonah from room to
room, and when he finds Jonah hovers in

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.919
front of in space and squeaks at it.
That's a pretty smart hummingbird, and

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.210
you know what the message is - you're
neglecting your duties by not taking

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.830
care of my feeder. I think that's pretty
brilliant for a bird to learn that kind

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.290
of behavior. That sure is. For more
