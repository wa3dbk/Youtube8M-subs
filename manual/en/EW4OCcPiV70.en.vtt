00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.100
There is a special kind of light 
here and a kind of stillness...

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.500
...which makes one think 
about the people here...

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.000
...during the Viking Age.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
The remnants of Birka are visible, at least for me as an archaeologist.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.500
When you look at Birka today, you'll see an
island full of pastures with cows and sheep...

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
...grazing between stone mounds and terraces.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.100
With the ramparts, the area is full of traces of the 
Viking times. You can see it everywhere you go.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.100
Birka was very much a port city.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.200
We're right now sitting on the edge of 
what would have been the shoreline...

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.200
...in the Viking Age, or the time of Birka.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.400
Our work focuses on the main port of the city,
but also all the harbours around the island of Björkö.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.700
As you might imagine, we've found many different 
types of harbour structures around the island.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
During its existence, Birka was 
probably a pretty lively place.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.000
I imagine there were not many trees, 
all of them having been cut down.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.400
The city would have been full of houses, 
surrounded by ramparts and a palisade wall.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.000
The fortification on the top of the hill 
surrounded by its own rampart.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.900
Then there is the harbour...

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.400
...it would have had piers stretching 
10 to 20 meters out into the water.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.000
Then outside of that was the pole wall, in the water.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000
The main harbor of Birka was just outside 
of the so-called "Black Earth"...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
...where we're diving, about 20 -- 40 meters 
from the modern shoreline.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.000
There we've found wooden constructions and wooden piles 
with strange design details lying on the bottom.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We're investigating them in an attempt to understand how  
the pole wall was built, when it was built and what it was used for.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We've been down to the harbor and taken a peek 
at the archaeological site which I found interesting

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
because you can better understand how it all fits together

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
with trade and everything related to the port behind us.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It was interesting to see the excavations as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I think it's fun with the divers, I have never seen them before.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It was fun to see how long they could be underwater.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It was cool to see the equipment they were wearing as well.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
What we're doing now is taking up timbers

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that have already been marked out and measured in.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They are loose timbers lying on the bottom that 
we believe are parts of a larger construction.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We record and document them.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We'll draw them, photograph them and take dendrochronology samples, using the growth rings to date them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then we'll put them back in place.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We dig through things that they picked up from the bottom.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Did you find anything?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Yes, burnt bones and things like that.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Burnt bones, that sounds a little scary?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I don't think so.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.000
I think Birka is an ideal place to study
Viking age maritime port operations.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.500
It is an island completely full of Viking Age remains.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:40.500
I think this is one of the places where you as a visitor 
can actually see traces of the Viking Age.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is a place that everyone knows and many people have visited.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The parents who are here now with their children, 
they came here when they were children themselves.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000
There are some nights when the wind is still and you can 
hear the sound travelling across the water.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
From the fortress hill you can see Södertalje, Stockholm and the way further into Mälaren, but especially north to Uppsala.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Then it feels real, like when they were travelling with their ships here.
