00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:07.089
(Gates) I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE,   
  BUT IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS.

00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:09.692
CITY HALL HAS DECIDED           
    IT'S GOOD P.R.              
      WAIT. WHAT ABOUT THE CASE?

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:10.926
THEY'RE GONNA COMPROMISE    
            THE INVESTIG--

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.895
I FEEL THE SAME WAY             
    AS YOU DO,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.396
BUT A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.198
AND I EXPECT YOU                
TO COMPLY WITH IT.

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:19.034
FINE. THEN JUST HAVE THEM   
          STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:20.502
(people speaking indistinctly)

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.337
(Esposito) I LIKE THE VICTIM.   
WE SHOULD PROBABLY CONTACT--

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.873
HI. UH... WELCOME.

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.775
I'M CAPTAIN GATES,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.343
HEAD OF THE 12th PRECINCT.

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:32.981
IN COOPERATION WITH THE NYPD's 
    PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIVISION,

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:36.085
I AM HAPPY TO GRANT YOU   
  FULL ACCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.520
I THINK YOU WILL FIND   
            EVERYONE HERE

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:42.658
MORE THAN ACCOMMODATING.

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.604
WELCOME.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:57.256
WELCOME.

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.692
(laughs)

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.362
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.364
I MAY NOT REMEMBER HER NAME...

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.134
BUT I CAN PROVE THAT WE WERE    
    TOGETHER THAT NIGHT.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.569
<i>(moans)</i>

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.438
<i>(grunts)</i>

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:14.239
<i>MM.</i>

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.375
(Castle) WELL,              
THEY WERE TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.578
TOMMY LEE'S GOT NOTHING
              ON THIS GUY.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.979
I LIKE TO CHECK ON THE CASE   
    EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.815
NO POINT IN CHAINING MYSELF   
         TO THAT DESK

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.350
WHEN ALL THE ACTION       
      IS RIGHT OUT HERE.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.518
YOU WANT ACTION, CHECK THIS.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.253
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.255
THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE   
            WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.857
THIS IS EVIDENCE, SIR.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.426
OUR SUSPECT'S ALIBI             
  HINGES ON THIS.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.295
OH. <i>OH.</i>

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.963
(Beckett)               
SO DOES HIS STORY PAN OUT?

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.832
YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE
                HE'S COVERED

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.433
FOR THE ENTIRE    
        TIME-OF-DEATH WINDOW.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.368
(Gates) I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GOING 
ON THE TIME STAMP ON THIS VIDEO.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:44.837
THAT COULD BE FAKED,
                  YOU KNOW?

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.105
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING       
ON THIS VIDEO BEING FAKED.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.141
(Esposito) TV's ON            
IN THE BACKGROUND, SIR.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.442
AND THAT IS THE NEWS,           
     WHICH MEANS

00:01:50.477 --> 00:01:52.110
I CAN VERIFY THE TIME STAMP     
        USING THAT.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.245
OKAY.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.613
GOOD JOB, EVERYONE.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.048
KEEP IT UP.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.116
NO. TOO EASY.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:00.051
SO IT LOOKS LIKE          
WE'RE BACK TO SQUARE ONE, HUH?
