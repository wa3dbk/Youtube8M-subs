00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.399
Hi !

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.009
Today in video, I will show you how to make

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.060
a train cake

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.500
it's easy to do and original

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.159
as birthday cake for example

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:14.829
let's do the cake !

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.019
in a bowl pour 125g of sugar

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.700
add 4 egg yolks

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.890
mix

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.779
until it becomes clearer

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.319
add a pinch of salt

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.949
in an other bowl

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.970
Melt 150 g dark chocolate with 125 g butter

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.720
either bath or microwave

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.280
microwave for 50 seconds at low power

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.700
if it's not enough add a few seconds at low power

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.200
add the melted chocolate to the preparation

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.940
add half a packet of baking powder

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.940
add gradually 125g of flour

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.550
beat the 4 egg whites until stiff with a pinch of salt

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.000
Gently incorporate them into the preparation

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.000
pour into a mould buttered and floured

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.400
let cool completely on a cake rack

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.440
2nd step : assembling the cake

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.150
cut the top of the cake

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.300
Cut the cake into five equal parts

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.400
for a locomotive and two cars I only need 4 pieces

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.359
cut slice of cake so they have the same size

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:51.139
all must be aesthetic

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.799
I raise a little the locomotive

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:05.799
with the remaining pieces

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.639
let's do decoration

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.609
use small round cakes for wheels

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.279
you needs chocolate spread as food glue

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.409
spread it on the side and top of cake

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.559
place wheels

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.739
the theme is Easter, use small eggs for decoration

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.939
you can add Easter chocolate

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.749
put candies and candles for a birthday cake

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:35.000
for the fireplace made â€‹â€‹a small hole and place a Russian cigarette

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.900
the train is ready

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.430
for the presentation I use a baking sheet covered with aluminum

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.430
for rails, use wafers

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.600
Gently place the train

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:16.800
use pieces of Russian cigarettes to attach the train and wagons

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.029
to finish the decoration

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.900
put easter candies and chocolates

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.800
it's ready, enjoy !!

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.809
