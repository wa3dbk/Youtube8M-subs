00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.460
I’ve put in a new bed and it needs some
color, some flowers. This daylily is a good

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:15.840
bloomer, it’s a great accent piece, and
so I’m going to take this baby that it has

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.390
made, that is now matured, and transplant
it into the other bed. To do that, I want

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:32.189
to make sure that I’m getting between the
roots where they’re separate from the mother

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.660
plant. If it’s still connected some, I’m
going to cut through it. I want to cut straight

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:48.579
down so any cuts in the root are deep and
not close to the plant. Then I’m going to

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.950
come back on the other side and often times
you have to do this on all four sides but

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.820
this dirt is very good. I will probably only
have to do it on two sides. Now I’ll take

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:14.770
the shovel and I’ll go down and get the
rest of the roots, and there we go. So now,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:25.249
here we are at the new bed. I dug a hole with
this hand tool, and I’ve added sandy loam

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:33.170
and compost mixed together. And I’ve added
it into the soil I’m going to put back in

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.420
the hole, and into the bottom of the hole.
Now I noticed that the plant I dug up actually

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.200
is two plants. But, I don’t want to risk
disturbing that so I’m just going to leave

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.329
it as one. If I needed another plant, I could
even separate it more. I think I’ll leave

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:09.880
that as one. I’ve mixed this dirt up already,
like so, and then I will just cover it with

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:28.500
this really nice rich black gold. And then
I press it down, just lightly press it. Then

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.530
I will water it right away, and that’s it.
That’s how you do the planting.
