00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Behind the Blue Oval

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.000
Ford’s Lord of the Ring

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.860
My name is Paul Wijgaerts

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.020
In Team RS I'm the technical specialist - Performance Cars

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.110
Mainly responsible for the
developments of the suspension components

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.689
brakes, engines etc.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.970
Nürburgring was always 
on my list of tracks

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.690
that I wanted to be 
on when I was a kid.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.000
If you come here the first 
time and you drive the track

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.270
you think you will never ever be 
able to drive this track flat out.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.269
The Niki Lauda and James Hunts 
of this world say you need

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.670
at least 100 laps on the track 
to know your way around.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.219
Well you need at least another thousand 
laps to become really quick on the track.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.430
We want to be always X percent 
better than our competitors,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.430
and there's no better place to find 
this out than on the Nürburgring.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.910
I think we can say that 
my job is dangerous, yes.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.070
Exactly in that corner up there,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.009
there was oil on the track and I 
lost the front end of the bike,

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.170
and I hit the barrier 
at 100 km an hour.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.700
Ended up in hospital with four 
broken ribs right at my spine.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.479
I had a punctured lung.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.000
That day I swore 
never ever Nürburgring.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.450
That was really 
close that accident.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.500
That could have ended up 
completely the wrong way.

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.509
People that buy our car.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.569
When they in the evening sit at the
TV and know the car is in the garage.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.750
If they start thinking about "tomorrow
I'm going to drive my Focus ST",

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.469
then I know I've done my job right.
