00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.220
How to Make Your Eyes Look Bigger.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.460
When it comes to eye allure, big can be very,
very beautiful.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.090
Here are a few tricks to have everyone wondering,
"Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.090
peepers?"

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.730
You will need A pair of tweezers An eye shadow
brush A neutral eye shadow A medium-toned

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.300
eye shadow A pencil or liquid eyeliner An
eyelash curler And some mascara Some cotton

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.730
swabs (optional) A flesh-toned or white eyeliner
(optional) and a pair of false eyelashes (optional).

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.730
Step 1.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.440
Tidy up those eyebrows with your tweezers
or have them shaped by a professional—but

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.170
be careful not go overboard, as you want to
look natural.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.940
Step 2.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
Brush on a very neutral eye shadow using an
eye shadow brush, sweeping it from your lash

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.600
line to your brow bone.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.710
This should be subtle.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.230
If it's too light, it can overpower your eyes;
if it's too dark, it will make them look sunken.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.670
Step 3.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.250
Using a medium-toned eye shadow and your eye
shadow brush, sweep on a soft layer of color

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.030
into the crease of your eyelid for contour.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.409
Adding a line of flesh-toned or white eyeliner
to the inner rims of your eyelids makes your

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.049
eyes look bigger, but ophthalmologists are
divided over whether it's safe to do so.

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.149
Step 4.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.249
Add eyeliner.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:27.130
Avoid putting eyeliner on too thick or around
the inner half of your lower lid.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.560
Too much eyeliner will make your eyes look
smaller.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.979
Use a cotton swab or your finger to help smudge
pencil eyeliner.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.630
Step 5.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.380
Extend the liner just beyond the edges of
your eyes.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.070
This will help open your eyes.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.530
Step 6.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.729
Curl your lashes.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.990
The more your lashes curl and stretch, the
larger your eyes will appear.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.340
If your eyelashes are short or sparse, you
may want to consider wearing false eyelashes.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.929
Step 7.

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.529
Apply mascara.

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:59.119
Start in the middle of your upper eyelashes
and work your way out to the corners with

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.939
gentle upward strokes.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.969
If your eyes are deep-set, try applying mascara
to all of your upper eyelashes.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:12.070
Did you know Eyes can process over 35,000
bits of information in an hour—so no matter

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.340
how big your eyes look, the way they operate
is huge.
