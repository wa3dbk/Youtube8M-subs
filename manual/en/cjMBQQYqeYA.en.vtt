00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.680
I am going to apply some shea butter, the
first jar of shea butter that I purchased

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.130
is this one and I think that..I mean I know
it is a natural product it is one hundred

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:34.570
percent natural so there's variation in texture
and everything, this one actually crumbles,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.770
which is okay but it feels like there are
little granules in it.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.910
When I rub it on my hands they do melt.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:48.620
Anyway I have been using this batch for making
homemade deodorant.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.760
The next few jars that I purchased, it's from
the same company is a much creamier, definitely

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.180
more, butter. and it works really good.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.080
I basically take an amount, like fill the
tip of my finger, I like that it is heavy,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.500
I also like that it keeps my hair together.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.100
Usually when I apply it I immediately put
it into braids like right before I go to sleep

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.860
and then when I wake up I just take them out.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.630
Right now I am going to apply a light coat,
and I am going to grab a bit more, about the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:02:00.530
same amount.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:21.890
I've been using shea butter almost exclusively
for the past at least month.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.200
i don't feel like I have to combine it with
anything I can just use shea butter all by

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
itself.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.650
I feel like it is complete, like a very complete
butter.
