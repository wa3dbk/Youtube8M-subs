00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.880
Hello, today I would like to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
make you breath the fresh air of the country.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.980
by taking you to my mom and stepdad's

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.620
This nice little house is situated between

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.880
Saint-Cyr-the-River, Boissy-the-River

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.540
and AbbÃ©ville-the-River]. That's a lot of rivers, no ?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.920
And it's not so far from Estouches too   ouuuuuuhhhooouuuuhh

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420
So in the country house you have my mom,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.040
her name is Ursula.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.560
No, not 36 15 Ulla, no!

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.760
[Mom - Pole]

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.320
Well my mother, she smooths little

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.020
AAAAH! OH MY GOD I CUT MY FINGER MOM!

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.460
IT'S BLEEDING! I'M BLEEDING EVERYWHERE!

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.060
I will give you a magic kiss and it will be better, uh?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.160
MOM ! We have to go to the ER!

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.260
Oh! Let me blow!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.120
But she assures in many other domains.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.580
Hey!   how many times a week do you make love?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.580
Mom! pfff

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.960
Do I ask you how many times a week you make love?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Oh, 49.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.580
In the country house there's also my stepdad, Alain.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080
He's got a too crazy passion !!! Gardening.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.400
All summer we had so many flowers,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.540
it was just beautiful.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.380
Nights being cold, the zucchini got cold too.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.120
That was the lettuce, but it was not good lettuce.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480
Do you have marijuana?       - What?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.060
Marijuana.                   - What is mareehuanah?

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.060
laugh

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200
Oh, there's a dog too! Her name is Ulia.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.780
Yes, at first my stepdad confused my mom's name with the dog's.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.100
Shit happens.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.940
This dog's existence can be summed up in one thing : THE BALL.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.260
Thanks.                 - You're welcome.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.720
Ulia...

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.840
Oh, I got her!

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.240
When she doesn't find her ball, she gets you all she can find.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.240
Poor baby's been trained to never go home.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.960
So, well I torture her a little.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.320
Come on, get the ball.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.060
Get the ball.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.020
You only have to come inside...

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.860
Torture...

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.800
Well, they can get in whenever they want! All warm,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.520
with all of Mommy's love

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.780
And inside the house, there are many sympathetic things too.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.380
Such as good old comical books that make everyone laugh!

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600
Joking interlude!

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.840
Excellent ! What is green and stinky

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.140
in the woods? A dead scout boy !

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.820
What is the difference between a woman and a fridge?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.340
Have you ever seen a fridge fart when you put meat in?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.180
Look at me for 3 seconds please.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.880
Lovely family pictures.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000
Good board games!

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.820
Kemar, look, I found this great African game! You distribute grains like this...

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.120
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.780
I'm going to play video games.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.540
There's also that big blowing thing.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.540
 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780
And good music!

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:18.400
 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.160
Warning... There are mysteries too in the house...

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.820
Mom, what's in the hut at the back of the garden?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.680
Especially, you never go to the hut of the garden!

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.780
"Rrrrrrah! Cortex 91 pyramids, ya know mah name!"

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.840
Acorn!

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920
I should never have gone!

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.080
Finally we have fun in the summer house.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.280
Well, we try to occupy ourselves.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.300
I am your father.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.800
Gimme that, you.        - Shoot!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.800
Where?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.120
Look... Hey, stop, are you stupid or what?!

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.120
There's a shiny dot!

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.200
"Sony".

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.300
Wait. Wait.                  Shoot.                 Wait.
