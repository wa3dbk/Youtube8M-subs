My Christmas Wishlist!

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.620
Hey what's up guys Keaton here and a few weeks
ago I had the awesome opportunity of being

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.620
on Jeopardy.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.020
I made it to the final round and it was an
absolutely awesome experience but I ended

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.460
up getting the question wrong which was worth
$500,000.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.160
Maybe you guys can help me out and answer
it as I still don't know.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.000
So let me know in the comments section down
below, but it was 2012 rap songs and the puzzle

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.910
was..."I love bad blank, that's my blank problem."

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.020
I guessed a bunch of vowels, a bunch of continents,
or consonants and I ended up guessing, "I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.940
love bad animals, that's my unhappy problem."

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.880
I didn't get it right so let me know your
guess in the comments section down below.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.770
To kind of cheer me up a little bit and hopefully
cheer you guys up, I'm sharing some of the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.870
stuff that I want for Christmas this year
as that's what I celebrate and happy holidays

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.870
to all of you guys!

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.320
December is an awesome time!

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:18.400
We get time off 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:33.740
of school 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:43.610
so woohoo for that.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:02:29.909
Seriously, I don't 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:04:00.519
like 
being 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:07:25.039
in school.
