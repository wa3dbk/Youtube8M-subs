00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.400
Haaaaa

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.020
Well then today we're gonna do a "Natoo Gaming" session

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.320
So yeah I'm stepping into gaming test

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.700
Because It's actually a passion of mine

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.120
And for the first session I invited Mady

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.360
So let's go for this "Natoo Gaming" !

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.900
Let's go

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.680
So...

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.860
Erm...

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.460
It's not plugged in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.820
It's not on

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.680
I'll see

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.160
Oh but It's actually not plugged at all

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.060
Oh

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220
I don't understand anything, there are wires everywhere

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.080
What is that ?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.700
I don't know

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.580
Shit

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.080
What do we do ?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.140
Em well...

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.980
Is it okay now?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.520
Wait

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.020
Yeah

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.760
Go ahead

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.380
So this game has a beautiful interface

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.800
Natoo : Beautiful ergonomy
Mady : Pretty design, really pretty design

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.720
Its nice to the eye

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.400
Fluidity

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.900
Yes

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.080
Key word

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
It is the tenth edition of this game

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.100
(laughs)

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.260
Let's go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680
Always some little difficulties, little trickeries

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.160
It's a surprise everytime

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.760
Yes

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.260
I...

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.520
It's boring

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.140
Yeah

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.940
Well

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.460
Eh Ludovic !

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.240
What ?

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.120
Can you plug the console for us please ?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.180
I ain't got time for this !

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.560
Yvick ?

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.160
Yeah ?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.920
Can you plug the console for us please ?

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.320
No problem girls

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.720
Oh, actually it's already plugged in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.320
So It's done...

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.980
Ah

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.220
(laugh) We knew it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
Well yeah, we were kidding

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
It's not really well done

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.040
Nope

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.520
It's not really realistic, no one looks like that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.100
No

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.920
It's impossible to have boobs, em...

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.460
Boobs so big

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.900
Bitch

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.340
Come on let's play another game

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.840
Yes

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.240
So this time we see a really good game, It's the third edition

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.100
Good gameplay, here you see I'm smashing my enemies with grenades in the face

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.520
Mady : It's the demo actually...

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.520
You have not yet pressed START.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.440
Awesome

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600
Oh this shitty pony thingy there, look

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.300
You really have to be drunk to like this game

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.600
(laughs)

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.100

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.980

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.280
I put flowers in his mane, oooh

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.960
(laughs)

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.160
Hey watch out

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.380
Let's go, at a gallop !

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.140
Let's trot

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.400
At a gallop !

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.080
(laughs)

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.980
This game is awesone

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.280
(Singing a well-known french song)
"Ce sera nous, dÃ¨s demain [...]"

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.520
"Ce sera nous, le [...]"(they stop singing)

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.360
Man interrupting : Oh !!!

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.720
Ush !

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.340
Thank you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.560
Some people are working here

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.040
Thank you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.360
Well here a good old fighting game like we like 'em

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840
So the secret,  it's simple, you just have to smash every button

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.140
It works.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.120
If you want to succeed at your highkick, you can also do a cross, circle, high, jump, R2

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.220
You do what you want eh

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.440
Come on, to the left

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.840
Left left left

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.900
Here I take the shell...

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.820
And watch out, BIM

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.820
(laughs)

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.440
Gotcha !

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.040
Shit but I was first why do you send it to me

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.100
But I don't care you were in front of me

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.320
But it was'nt my fault, I was first !

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.360
But girl did I told you anything earlier for the banana ?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.740
Well no but it's not the same with the banana

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.660
But stop it the banana I took it I didn't told you anything either way

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.980
But it's a red shell it's not my fault !

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.540
It's not my fault it's a shell !

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.020
It's really garbage, your shitty gaming

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.540
Well then go ahead, go away !

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.880
Very good, go away !

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.320
With your shells !

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.240
Well then "Natoo Gaming" ends in a good, cheerful way !

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.040
And we'll see each other next week for the number two !

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.880
With DiabloX12

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.280
Em

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.100
Ten

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.220
Either way gaming ain't shit, I hate it.
