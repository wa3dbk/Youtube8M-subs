Hello everybody, I am Kate.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.890
Welcome to my series, Kate's Kitchen, where
I will be cooking up some simple and delicious

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.920
dishes that are great for sharing with your
friends and family and today I am going to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.410
be starting with Nutella cheesecake.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.330
[music]
Okay so I have got my food processor here

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.699
and I have got some lovely HobNobs here and
I am just going to break these up and pop

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.050
them in to the food processor first.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.560
So if you have not got a food processor then
not to worry you can just get a bag, put all

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.150
your biscuits in, and then get a rolling pin
and just bash them, which for me is a great

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.150
stress reliever.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.371
And also if you do not have HobNobs not to
worry, you can just use digestives, you can

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:43.310
use Oreos if you want to be extra decadent,
or you can use graham crackers, which I know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.700
a lot of people use in cheesecakes in America.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.670
Well, so there we go.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.590
To this I am going to add some melted butter
which I have got here.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.050
And then, as it is Nutella cheesecake, just
a tablespoon of Nutella.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:14.590
I am just going to grab the lid of my food
processor, pop it on, and then mix it up.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.760
Okay, so once it has started to plump and
get that, kind of, sandy texture about it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.350
I am just going to pop in about three tablespoons
of chopped, roasted hazelnuts.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.469
Just to give it a nice nutty flavor.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.579
And all you have to do is just pulse them
in until they are nicely mixed in.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.579
Cool.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.810
Yeah, that looks perfect.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:41.950
So I am just going to take my mixture and
pop it into a nine inch tray we have got here.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.939
So for the full method and all list of ingredients
just check out the description box down below

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819
and it will be there for you.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.229
So just using the back of a wooden spoon or,
as I like to do it, with the back of your

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.380
hand, just press it into the tin.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.149
So once you have done that just pop it into
the fridge to chill down and whilst that is

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.520
happening you can get on with making the mixture.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.740
Next up is to do the topping so I have got
500 grams of cream cheese here and I am just

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.810
going to pop this into a bowl.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.759
You can do this in the food processor again
if you want to but I am just going to do a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.350
bit of manual labor I think.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.439
And then some icing sugar is going to go in
as well.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.310
And then I am just going to grab a wooden
spoon and give it a good mix.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.840
So this is one of the easiest recipes that
I know and do but it is a real crowd-pleaser.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.569
It is really tasty and you will be surprised
that actually something this tasty can be

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.569
that easy to make.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.569
I feel like I am cheating.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.209
Then, to this mixture, we are going to add
the rest of this jar of Nutella.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.300
So this is about 400 grams worth that is going
in here now.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300
We are almost there.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.430
So now all the Nutella is into the mixture
I am going to give it a good stir and make

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.680
a lovely chocolate-y mixture.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.450
So now this is all mixed in and made this
gorgeous chocolate-y mixture I am going to

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:13.040
go back to the fridge and get out my base,
which is nice and set now, and pour it on

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.239
top.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.739
And then just get your spatula and smooth
it out and you are good to go.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.250
Try and be as even as you can.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.250
So once you have done that, first things first,
you can lick the spoon, which I am going to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.250
definitely do in a bit.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.060
I am going to get some more toasted hazelnuts,
this is about three tablespoons worth, and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.109
just pour them on top, scatter them evenly.

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.950
Just for a bit of decoration, a bit more flavor
as well.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.859
Okay so I am going to pop this into the fridge
to chill and while it is chilling why don't

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.610

tasty recipes like this?

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.280
So I put my Nutella cheesecake out of the
fridge and I have taken it out of it's tin.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.579
So all I am going to do now is I am just going
to put some extra raspberries on the top,

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.980
just some added decoration but you do not
have to do this.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.090
You can just leave that lie if you want to.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.319
Put these in the middle, I think.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.319
So that is Nutella cheesecake done.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.499
It is pretty much the most foolproof recipe
you can get.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:14.310
It is so simple and easy to make and and after
all it is a big jar of Nutella [??] you cannot

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.450
really go wrong with that.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.440
