SUBBED: Bannana Buiscut 9000 (o_o) This song is so good! ahahshshfiufisd

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.660
Saving a light abandoned, tearing away from lies and doubt

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.280
You'll find the truth still holding tight

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.640
In the hands of the night

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.120
Dusk air feeding into shadow play, dancing bold and glides away

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.640
Waiting and debating, will I ever see the secret you've been holding back?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.020
Climbing the walls you make and calling your name, but you keep them all away

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.440
Hiding all the ways you want to yell and scream

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.440
Why couldn't you just lean on me?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.640
Winding up and down, a heart I'll never know

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.260
Stealing your gazing eyes, pass the lies, and see the real me

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.640
Brave but lying, scared and crying, when did I ever lose track?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.400
'Cause of one thing I believed in left me long ago

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.780
So say the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.040
Worlds getting tricked by shadows, say that I'm only full of lies

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.140
Hear when I say "Just take my hand, trust me you can."

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.860
You'l never she me running. No, nothing scares me anymore

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.420
Don't look away, you'll be alright, leave your worries behind

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.360
Echoing a story or fated to be, see this is our destiny

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.080
Wait a little longer and I'll let you see the secret I've been holding back

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.280
Growing even darker with everyday, can't you see what's on the way

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.840
All your rosey memories are red and sweet

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.240
But prick til' you start to bleed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.980
Wanting to protect you from the world I know

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.820
Taking a stand again, let it end, and break this destiny

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.540
Fight til' I'm blue, I'm beside you, know that I'll never give up

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.820
Cause of one thing I believe in left without a trace

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.260
So say the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.400
World's being turned against you, say that there's no one by your side

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.000
Hear when I say "You're not alone, grab tomorrow."

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.340
You'll never see me running. No, nothing shakes me anymore

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.680
Scenarios stuck on rewind, I'll be ready to fight

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.560
Hehe I bet if I told her I loved her, she'd be like "Me too!"

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.160
Hahah Stupid B*tch

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.920
You tricked her! I don't want to see you anywhere near her. You got me?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.700
Hey, she was the one dumb enough to believe me!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.900
Tch

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.040
Ah How could I be so stupid?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.000
Say that they're all against you, say that there's no one on your side

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.020
Hear when I say "Just take my hand, trust me you can."

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.360
You'll always be by my side, now that I know what's true, I'll fight

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.140
Through every scene and every life, with these hands of the night

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.380
Say that we know the answer, say that we heard it all our lives

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.720
You'll never see me running, no, Nothing scares me anymore

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.040
I'll be ready to fight

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.520
