00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:09.387
What I like about cars like this is the link with normal cars

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:15.628
If you drive a Ferrari or Maserati, it is just a 'big' car. Everyone is impressed.

00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:23.139
But this requires more tast. If I drive new Golf R, I like to visit a person with als Golf IV.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:29.821
Same with a BMW M3, i visit someone with an old 3-series. They already like the brand and adore the topmodel.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:35.904
So imagen, you know someone with an old Audi A3. And tell them, I have somehting for you. And you turn up in this...

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:39.753
The reaction mostly is something like this:.......

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:46.225
Just to realise that THIS car is standing in front of them. I like those reactions.

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:54.513
The anonymous part of this car has dissapeared. No longer good for robberies and such.

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.139
The time you didn't notice this car is behind us. I looks massive!

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:04.325
20 inch wheels are standard. This one has 21 inch!

00:01:06.158 --> 00:01:11.017
Of course the bodywork has widened and this is new: that quattro sign in the front.

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:23.645
We have the mirror option, so people in front of you now what is coming.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:35.447
So lets start with the conclusion: this car is awesome, briljant. And why?

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.848
Most of all because it is so much more dynamic then its predecessor.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:43.912
That was a very noseheavy car. Only wanted to go straight.

00:01:43.912 --> 00:01:47.197
Of course it was still awesome, because of all that power, no complaining now in hindsight.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.679
But all that weight did matter. It never turned in to a very dynamic car.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.315
So when I drove the RS4 Avant a half year ago, I liked it so much more than the old RS6.

00:01:57.315 --> 00:02:00.228
And I was worried about this one. Could it be as much fun as that RS4?

00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:04.748
Luckily, that turned out allright. it weighs 100 kg less than before. but still over 1.900 kg.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:15.190
And it is so much more fun to drive. The weight never really bothers me. yes, in tight hairpins, the nose still pushes forward.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:23.206
But in fast corners, in really in the wet, it can do so much more than I expected on forhand.

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:29.549
Even on the highway I thought, hmm well, I don't know. But then in the hills. wow. Amazing at what speeds you can push this.

00:02:30.977 --> 00:02:37.256
No kilo's pushing all the time, when braking, etc. Unless you go crazy it is all okay.

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:41.983
That massive torque just sents you flying.  Of course 4WD with as crown differential

00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:49.425
And another diff in the rear causes torque vectoring, which neutralises understeer. Just hit the throttle and it pushes the nose inwards.

00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:54.522
And then you are having fun with a car of this size. It can be done!

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:15.416
While having that fun, I was never frustrated about all that weight. I didn't annoy me.

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:21.815
Something that dÃ­d happen when I drove the BMW M6. I didn't have that much fun.

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:28.522
The weight bothered me more in that car than today. That doesn't mean the RS6 is a better car, it has to do with expectation.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:37.885
So it showes how Audi made and presented this car. I offers what it should offer on all fronts.

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:41.603
And that didn't happen with the previous RS6.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:51.743
The engine now is a V8. From a 5.0 V10 to a 4.0 V8,, we keep those 2 turbo's but loose 2 cilinders and 20 PS: from 580 to 560 PS.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.672
But we do get more torque: from 650 to 700 Nm. So it is quicker than before: 3,9 sec to 100 km/h!!

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.870
With those number you can loose a lot of older Ferrari's at the traffic light.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.963
BUt of course you do not notice that 20 PS more or less when driving. It just is FAST! Unbelievable.

00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:17.425
That extra torque is usefull in  a car like this, you mostly drive in mid range revs.

00:04:21.475 --> 00:04:25.541
And it actually sounds more wild the the V10 did in the RS6 A little mean and rough.

00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.680
This test-car has the sport exhaust (black instead of chrome) and just wow...

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:46.476
For the whole package goes the same as with the RS4 Avant: it is exactly as an Audi RS should be like.

00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:58.305
It is not as dynamic as a Jaguar XF-R, but has the thoughness of an RS and I like the way it looks.

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:06.970
Any complaints, well yes, the steering for example. Still strangely heavy at some point. I don't understand.

00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:15.606
Steering doesn't have to be very heavy to be sporty. But they are improving, so lets hope they keep it up.

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:20.790
Apart from that? it ROCKS.

00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:39.459
+ more driving fun , more character - still a heavy car, a little bumpy for a travel car.
