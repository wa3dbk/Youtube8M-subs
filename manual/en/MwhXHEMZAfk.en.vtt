00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.700
Hello, DisneyCarToys here and today I'm showing
you this amazing Littlest Pet Shop Walkable

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.390
Dancing Cat.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.299
There are six different animals in this series
including: a dog, seal, ostrich, bat, and

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.299
octopus.

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.290
Well, I can't wait to see how this cat moves
and grooves so let's open this up.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.500
From the packaging and also from her outfit,
she looks to be an Egyptian cat.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.420
Which makes sense because I think cats historically
are believed to come from Egypt.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.119
Okay, let's get this thing out of here.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.120
I'm just going to rip this whole package up.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.469
Okay, come on kitty kitty kitty, let's get
out.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.780
And here's our dancing cat.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.420
She's got her arms up and looks like she's
ready to walk like an Egyptian.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.380
Well, I can't wait.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.719
Let's see her dance.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.160
I just have to pull off the tab here, and
there's a button in the back that you press.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.170
And wahoo, she's wiggling and uh oh.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.170
Oppsie.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.690
Look at her shaking her tail.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.480
Let's get her up.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480
Meow.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
There we go.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.480
That's more like it.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.790
Now she's just wiggling back and forth.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.790
It's pretty cute.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.850
I could honestly watch this for a pretty long
time.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370
It's mesmerizing.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.600
And here she is dancing from behind.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.880
Really it's just her upper half moving.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.630
It comes with two batteries but you can replace
it too.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.760
If you want to turn her off just press the
button there.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.352
Let's check out her pink and white outfit.

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:36.000
She's even got this random ear tattoo, and
the Littlest Pet Shop logo on the back too.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.780
The package came with a whole bunch of pamphlets
here.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780
Let's check them out.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.990
This thing is huge.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.560
Let's see what else we can buy here.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.400
Littlest Pet Shop Teensies.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.140
Those look cute.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.600
And then fairies.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.930
Those are pretty funky.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.040
Let's check the other side.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.390
This is just the normal Littlest Pet Shop
toys.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.010
It looks like this is our instructions that
we got here for our dancing pet cat.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.620
It just tells you how to turn it on which
is pretty easy.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.039
And one more pamphlet.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.140
What's this one?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.869
Oh, you can get clothes too.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.869
How cool.

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:16.090
Well, I'd better turn off our dancing cat
before she loses batteries.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.860
Or falls over again.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.550
See you later.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.670
The end.
