Hi! This is Diana for Expert Village.com and
I am going to show you how to make a different

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.020
kind of a bow for your package. Here we have
the same box we just wrapped, but I have some

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:21.179
thick ribbon that is very flat. So, I am going
to do the same kind of wrapping around the

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:30.880
box as I did with the other thin ribbon. Lay
it down on top of the middle, flip over the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:40.370
box, twist the ribbon in the back so that
it crosses each other, pull it tight and flip

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.640
the box back over. Now you can cut off your
ribbon leaving enough so that you can tie

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:05.820
it at the top, pull it tight and this is just
a regular knot. Now I am going to leave that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:17.290
aside for a minute while I make the bow. Pull
off quite a length of ribbon; maybe three

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:27.010
or four feet, start with the end in your fingers
like this, pull it out, make a loop, put it

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:35.270
under your thumb, twist it, pull it out and
make a loop on the other side, twist it and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.840
you can make this as full as you want. I put
usually about five or six loops on each side

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.310
and you can make the loops as big or as small
as you want to. Each one is the same now,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.510
fold out make a loop, put it under your thumb
and twist it so you are holding between your

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.280
thumb and your finger, the middle of every
loop. This takes a little bit of practice.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:17.240
Now, I am going to cut this off and I am going
to take a smaller piece of ribbon and this

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:32.180
is to tie the center of all the loops together.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.730
Pull that really tight and I am going to make
a double knot. Now just play with it a little

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.450
bit until all the loops are pretty and you
have a ribbon at the top of your box. Now

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:57.230
I am just going to tie them on or you can
just use a piece of tape, fold the tape over

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.160
to make it double stick on both sides and
you have a ribbon for the top of your box.
