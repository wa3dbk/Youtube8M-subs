00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.590
Skydiving is freedom. Absolutely mesmerizing. Like nothing else. Amazing. Out of this world.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.769
Freefall is like swimming, only less wet.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.750
One of the greatest things about Skydive South Shore is its proximity to New York City and the amazing views that are offered of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.320
the Hamptons and the Atlantic Ocean. And it
also helps that Skydive South Shore specializes

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.320
in first time tandem skydive jumpers. My favorite
skydives are always when...

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.469
something funny like that. My name is Nick. I am a tandem instructor. If you've got a toy, maybe a

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.469
hand puppet, a cookie monster, a pink
gorilla, I don't know, something like that, it's always a good time.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.590
My name is Erika Dufort. I am a professional
skydiving instructor. Upon arrival at Skydive South Shore,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.450
you'll arrive into our office,
you will be greeted, where you'll do some paperwork.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.889
Once we've done the paperwork, you'll meet
your instructor, he'll do a briefing, and

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:16.099
then you get to load the airplane with
your instructor. You've got about a 15 minute

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.469
scenic view of the surroundings. Then you'll
start getting hooked up. Now that's when you're

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.649
going to get really up close and personal
with your instructor. And then you make the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.319
jump out of the airplane into freefall where
you're going about 120 miles per hour until the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:37.319
parachute opens. At that moment, you're suspended
below this brightly colored parachute.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.459
And you're able to see everything at a nice, slow
pace.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:05.459
You get to learn how to fly the parachute and then you come in for landing. And you've
just jumped out of an airplane.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.940
The most incredible experience you could ever imagine.
