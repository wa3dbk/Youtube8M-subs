Happy Monday folks.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.880
Naomi here with your Fix for September 26th.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.750
In case you missed it, Star Wars: The Old
Republic got an official release date over

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.750
the weekend.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.300
Bioware says North American Jedis can pick
up the game on Tuesday, December 20th while

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.039
Europeans will get their lightsabres on Thursday
the 22nd.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.160
That is, unless you preorder the title, which
will get you early access to the game -- although

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.230
Bioware has yet to specify exactly when.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.880
Your subscription will cost you 15 bucks a
month.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.530
Or, you can purchase a Three or Six month
package at a reduced rate.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.949
May the funds be with you.

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.790
Dying to know what’s in store for you achievement
whores, in Modern Warfare Three?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.540
Well look no further.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.510
Thanks to Xbox360achievements.org, IGN has
the full list for your reading pleasure.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.999
We understand you’re eager to read, so you
can thank us later.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.030
Just make sure to finish the episode first.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.240
Especially if you’re a League of Legends
fan…

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.930
Because Dominion Mode is finally upon us.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.710
The new, free update to Riot Games’ already
free-to-play RTS will have you strategically

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.040
battling it out online with other teams of
summoners.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.100
The game is crazy popular (and did I mention
free?) so check it out at the link below.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
In related news, the console version of the
original Crysis now has a release date.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
The gorgeous PC shooter hits an HD console
near you, next month, on October 4th.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.920
It’ll run you either sixteen-hundred Microsoft
points on the 360 or twenty bucks on PSN.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
Now you can finally have fun shooting trees
in half without spending five-thousand dollars

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.049
on a new PC.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.689
Xbox-owning RPG fans, I hope you’re nostalgic
for the original PlayStation’s multiple

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:39.899
disc madness.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.800
The hot western RPG shooter hybrid, Rage,
is going to span 3 discs on the 360 and take

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.270
up a whopping eight gigabytes of memory on
the PS3 when it launches next month.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.859
The Witcher 2 will also be multi-disc when
it hits the 360 in the first quarter of next

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.859
year.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.249
It will include all the new content from the
2.0 update of its PC version and will span

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.249
2 discs.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.039
So, what do you think, fixers?

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.420
Are multiple-disc games like Final Fantasy
7 totally awesome, or in this day in age is

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.509
it just totally annoying?

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.570
Let us know in the comments section below,
or on facebook.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.340
And that’s your Fix for September 26th,
2011.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.280
