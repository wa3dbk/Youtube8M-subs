00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.220
Welcome to your free throw shooting challenge.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.929
In this challenge we will significantly increase your free throw shooting ability.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.940
We will concentrate on developing a routine, increasing consistency,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.060
and elminating pressure and fatigue as factors.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.730
Lets see it.  
Players and coaches, how many of you have ever lost a game by one point or two points?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.279
Free throws matter whether its in the first minute or the last minute,

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
and at some point you're going to shoot a free throw that matters whether it's in

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
the first minute or the last minute.  It's going to be a game deciding free throw.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.520
So we're going to talk about some ways that you can improve your free throw shooting.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.079
First we're going to start with building a routine.  
Every player has got to have routine.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.329
The routine doesn't have to be the same for every player, but every player

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.160
has got to have one.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.430
So Kyle, if you would step to the free throw line for me, couple things we are

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.559
going to concentrate on.

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.360
We're going to develop a routine for you, 
so I'm going to ask you some questions

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.469
that make you comfortable in your free throw shooting.  First thing I want you to do

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
is when you come to the line 
I want to make sure you got a positive thought in your head.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.659
Is there a time that you ever shot free throws and maybe made a high percentage

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.000
out of 100?  
Can you remember a time when you did that?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.090
Ok I want you to take that memory and I want you to put that in your mind, 
I want 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.490
that to be the positive thought

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.939
that you have every time you come to the free throw line.  So sometimes,

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.110
working through reps a lot of basketball is mental 
so free throw

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.729
shooting can be mental and with time the later the game gets, the more pressure

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:25.530
that comes

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.180
the more that you might have to think positive thoughts.  
But everytime

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.390
you step to the free throw line the first thing you're going to do is

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.189
get a positive thought.  So as we go through this routine and to start out our first progression, 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.720
we're going to shoot 10 free throws concentrating on

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.930
a good routine.  So the first step,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.970
a positive thought, you got it?  Next, I want you to make sure your breathing is under control.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.240
Deep breath, make sure you got a good deep breath in there, you got that?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.930
Now we're going to concentrate next on our legs.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.299
This is an interesting fact here, as players go through the game we talk

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.180
about when you get tired maybe recruiting your muscles and maybe getting a

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.590
little bit more leg bend.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.880
But actually great free throw shooters have very little leg bend in their legs.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.789
Reason being that when you're tired you don't want to shoot a different free throw from when

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.599
you're healthy and fresh.  
So just a little bit of bend

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.970
whether you're fresh or whether you're tired will keep your free throw

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.080
consistent.  So we're going to concentrate on a minimal leg bend as you shoot your free throw.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.910
So we're going to have a positive thought, we're going to get our breath there, we're going to have a little bit

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.629
and the last thing is

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.970
we're going to have a rhythm to our dribbles.  
Do you have a lucky number?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.000
Well my lucky number was 7, so what i always did was on my first free throw

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.879
was 4 dribbles and my second one was 3 dribbles, that 7 was a lucky number. 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.650
You can make yours whatever you want, whether its one dribble or two dribbles

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.890
or it adds up to a certain number like mine, but you're going to do that same routine every time. 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.920
So how many dribbles are you going to pick for us?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.650
So 2 on the first and 2 on the second.  So taking all 4 of those things in,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.680
I don't want you to worry about

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.720
anything else but concentrating on shooting a good

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.040
free throw with a good positive routine that you can use at every free throw you shoot.
