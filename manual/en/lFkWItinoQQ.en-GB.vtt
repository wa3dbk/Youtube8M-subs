00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.620
This is the Preston Park Demonstration Garden.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.400
We've got apple trees, artichokes, herbs ...

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.760
... and this side we've got raspberries, rhubarb,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.580
I came down after I'd had a whole knee-replacement ...

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.440
... and I needed to get out because I was just sitting indoors,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.800
... doing nothing - just getting lazy!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.340
If it's raining ...

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
... okay, you wrap up warm,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.000
... we've got the shed where we make our tea, shelter there, sit down

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.060
It's done me the world of good - the fresh air; the people are great, y'know ...

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580
I've just learnt a hell of a lot

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.900
Everyone who comes up here is on an equal footing - straight away

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.140
If there's any leftover stuff then the volunteers can take it home

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.520
I think it's more important to make sure that you're getting out side in the winter ...

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.640
... so it's nice to be keeping warm with the kind of 'heavier jobs'!

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.600
If anyone's having a cup of tea and trying to keep warm - we'll still be here.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.440
We're "Fork &amp; Dig It" and we run a Community Garden.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.840
We work on just over two acres of organic land growing fruit &amp; vegetables.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.860
We're open a couple of days every week - open to the community to come and join us ..

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.200
"Shall we get those tomatoes out first?"

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.700
"Yes"

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.800
I'm a great believer in 'the Power of Gardening'

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.640
There are people from all kinds of backgrounds who come up ...

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.820
... and all ages,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.800
... and other people who are just getting away from their desks &amp; screens and doing some Proper Work!

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.000
We always have a shared lunch where we encourage people to eat the food that we're growing up here.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.940
Welcome to The Secret Garden!

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.960
We're here to try and transform this place behind an old church ...

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.480
... which was overgrown &amp; unused and abandoned,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.060
... for a Community Garden that the whole community can enjoy!

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.580
You meet a really wide range and mix of people, not just old people(!) ...

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.460
... and it's great! there's something for everybody and you can learn from everybody, so ...

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.140
... all you construction workers out there, in your spare time come here ...

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.160
... so you're awy from the tarmac for a bit!

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.720
So Chris is bringing her bee-keeping skills and we've had our first crop of honey ...

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.500
... which is absolutely wonderful!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.420
And we've also had people construct the greenhouses for us:

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.220
- I wouldn't have had a clue about that!

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.620
We've had people building fences for us, around our pond ...

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.880
... and in fact we've had volunteers from schools doing heavy labour jobs, like digging out the pond for us ...

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280
... which has been brilliant!

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.140
And we need all sorts from the community.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.400
There are lots of different places you can just drop in, go and have a chat

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.440
The wonderful thing about Community Gardens is most people are real enthusiasts and ...

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.020
... and they love to tell you what's happening!

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.840
And it's really nice actually when people are interested in what you're doing.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.560
We're here to help people learn - to share that knowledge of how to grow your own food.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.200
So skills aren't necessary - just come up and get involved!
