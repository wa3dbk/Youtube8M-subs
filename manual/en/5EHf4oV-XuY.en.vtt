Hello this is Jaystepher here and I just want to show you my latest Lego house.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.119
And before any of you say it, yes I know it's not like one of my other houses,

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.759
and I just want to show you that I still have an inner-child in me,

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.089
but I actually still build out of basic Lego.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.710
but I actually still build out of basic Lego.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.490
This house is just mainly consisting of 2-by blocks.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.500
The roof system is all 2-by Lego.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040
There's no roof tiles. It's built the same way

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.050
as my other roofs.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190
So it looks cool. It's really strong, it ain't going nowhere.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.440
Here's the house.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.020
It's on a 16 by 32 base plate.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.240
Nothing fancy. It's just a basic Lego house.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
Inside.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.240
I used basic doors and windows. Nothing
fancy. No fancy architecture here.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.230
The whole goal of this was to make all the colors not touch one another.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.410
I really was surprised that I had a lot of lime green and pink Lego.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.870
I really was surprised, but I got these mostly out of those kiddie kits.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.070
The child kits

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.510
The ones that sell all the little big blocks and stuff because I never have enough big blocks.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.210
You know, I usually have these kind.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.259
You know, I usually have these kind.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.020
I have arches,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.270
fancy doors and windows and stuff.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.970
And cabinets are usually thrown in there.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.790
This time I decided just to keep it simple. It's just a one room house

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.770
with some basic windows. Nothing matches and this to me is cool looking.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.810
I just wanted to share this with you guys.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.450
I know I'm going to get some "thumbs down" for this, or people are going to be like

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.040
um... what happened to your Lego, did they burn down?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.990
No, I just wanted to do something funny, just for the laughs ... you know.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.120
So just to show some of you young YouTubers out there who like to build out of Lego,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.979
So just to show some of you young YouTubers out there who like to build out of Lego,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.280
you know, this is what I started off when I was younger.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.790
I just threw Lego together and hey look I made a house.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.510
Then you say, okay, well I'm going to make my house one color. I use to do that.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.619
Then I started making things different until I came up with my bigger houses where they look cool.

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.449
This is cool!

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.989
At least it's got four walls and a roof.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.949
You know, a door and a window you can get in and out. So it's something.

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:39.279
So that's my cool little house.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:41.309
Yeah.

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:46.679
