00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
"Carcinogenic Retrovirus Found in Eggs"

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.790
To recap: “Certain viruses commonly
infect and cause a wide variety of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.120
cancers in chickens and turkeys
destined for human consumption.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.000
They include the avian
leukosis/sarcoma viruses,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.450
reticuloendotheliosis viruses,
and Marek’s disease virus.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.880
The avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses and
reticuloendotheliosis viruses are among

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.859
the most potent cancer-causing agents
known, and can induce cancer in poultry

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.769
in a matter of…days.”

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.760
This is what Marek’s disease looks like;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.400
you can see all the little
tumors in the skin.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.660
It also can affect the
chickens’ eyes.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.210
What about people, though?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.300
Well, these viruses “are found present in
raw poultry products, including raw or

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.190
inadequately cooked poultry meat and
eggs meant for human consumption,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.230
[as well as]…vaccines grown in eggs.”

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.210
They cite a study in which
researchers went looking for

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.090
avian leukosis/sarcoma virus,
a carcinogenic retrovirus,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.740
found in commercial eggs right
off supermarket shelves,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.920
and found 14%;
14% of egg samples from 20

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.700
randomly chosen New Orleans retail
stores tested positive for the virus.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.969
“Thus the general population
is commonly exposed…

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.939
It is therefore of great interest
whether these agents also

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.810
cause cancer in humans.”

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.159
We don’t know for sure, but:
“This large study provides evidence that

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.469
a human group with high exposure
to poultry oncogenic [cancer-causing]

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.470
viruses has increased risk of
dying from several cancers.”

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.240
Beyond just poultry workers, with
regards to the general population:

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.039
“The public health implication that the
excess occurrence of some of these

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.340
cancers in these workers
may be associated with

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.669
exposure to oncogenic
viruses is not trivial.”
