00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.300
The treatment of colon cancer really depends

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.450
on the stage of the colon cancer. Colon cancer
is divided into four different stages.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.810
Stage 1 would be a small colon cancer, that’s
really localized to the lining of the colon,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.530
doesn’t involve any nodal involvement. And
that would particularly be fine with just

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.700
surgical resection and those patients have
a great outcome with just surgery alone.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.030
Stage 2 is when the tumor is a bit bigger,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.640
it’s invaded into the muscle or more, but
still there are no lymph nodes that are positive.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.970
Now for Stage 3 patients those patients basically

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.170
have nodal involvement of their cancer and
those patients benefit from surgical resection

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.630
of the tumor, followed by six months of chemotherapy.
And the goal there is so that we can treat

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.890
micro metastatic disease, meaning that small
cancer cells that are either in the blood

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.260
stream or the lymphatics so that we can reduce
the risk of a reoccurrence.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.790
And Stage 4 is when the tumor has spread to

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.890
another site, like the liver or the lung.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.490
But even in those patients, we used to say
this was incurable and we have found that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.400
we have had great success in treating patients
with Stage 4 cancer.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.570
We also have other types of agents, what we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.479
call biologic agents that actually are considered
to be targeted therapies that target particular

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.770
molecular pathways that have been shown to
have an important part in colon cancer.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.250
These biologic agents do have an important
role in Stage 4 colon cancers and that would

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.530
When the patients have a biopsy or a specimen,
usually in the metastatic setting is when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.213
We look for any potential genetic mismatch
repair protein defects, which might potentially

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.979
cancer. this is important not only for the
patients, but also their families, because

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:33.760
then we can identify whether particular screening
methods need to be performed for this particular

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.439
family if there is a lynch syndrome or a concern
for lynch syndrome.

The main challenges in removing tumors that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.990
occur in the colon and the rectum are anatomy
based. So patients who have say a tumor in

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.100
the colon, we have to make sure that all the
lymph nodes that are associated with that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.520
tumor come out. and especially in the rectum,
there are more structures that could potentially

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.600
get injured. So that’s why it’s really
important to have someone who does rectal

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.049
surgery all the time, someone who is familiar
with all the structures to have an operation

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.509
where there is minimal effect on any surrounding
structures.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.709
I think some of the most exciting things are

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.930
the minimally invasive techniques. So, we
do most of our operations with laparoscopy

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.220
meaning that you get small incisions instead
of a big long incision. And we can see up

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.870
close in ways that we couldn’t before. The
other big development recently in pelvic surgery

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.120
-- so for rectal cancers, is robotic surgery.
And that’s been really exciting too because

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.500
it really minimizes the size of the incisions,
it reduces the length of stay in the hospital

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.930
after surgery, and also there is a good cosmetic
outcome.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.220
After the cancer surgeon is done with removing

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.860
the tumor, you end up having a space within,
that area that the tumor was occupying. And,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.950
that has to be filled with something. And
that’s where a reconstructive plastic surgeon

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.590
would come in to do that.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.989
We try and take tissue from another part of
the body and move it into that space to help

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.040
fill that space to help prevent, that, that
gravitational dependent fall that happens

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.230
inside the belly.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.810
off of blood vessels, because the tissue that
you move has to have, an appropriate blood

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.739
based ona small blood vessel. and either we
detach that and then re-attach it to another

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.050
part of the body and have that tissue live
off of that blood supply, or we keep it attached

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.310
and are able to move it from one area to the
body to another area of the body. And the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.379
process is, actually, pretty complex.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.430
Collaboration and Tumor boards

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.410
As a patient, I think it would be a really

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.879
great cohesive experience to be seen at the
Stanford Cancer Center, and that’s because

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.900
we have the benefit of the Tumor Board and
this Tumor Board is a multidisciplinary meeting

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.739
where we have medical oncologists and we have
colorectal surgeons, we have liver surgeons,

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.390
we have thoracic surgeons, then we have the,
pathologists, the, the radiologist, and nurses

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.790
and just a bunch of people, anyone who could
possibly be involved in your care talking

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.190
about you for a long time. And everyone is
looking at your images on the screen, and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.849
everyone is talking about okay, what’s the
best approach for this person, and we try

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.599
to come up with a really good comprehensive
and holistic plan.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.680
I think everyone is at the top of their field

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.220
here, and we all collaborate well together.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.480
We’ve had many patients who show up on our
door step that have had tumors that were deemed

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.480
either unresectable previously, or were a
lost cause in the past. And we’ve managed

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.319
to take care of them.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.180
If there’s a solution, we’ll find it.
