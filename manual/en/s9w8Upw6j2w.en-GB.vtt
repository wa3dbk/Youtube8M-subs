00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.850
Welcome to Team Wild's Xtreme Hoggers. This
week we're back in the vast expanses of Texas

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.510
and trying to keep the feral hog population
under control with our good friends over at

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.280
L3 Outdoors. And today, is a special day for
pig hunting.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.510
I'm standing here today with Daniel Cases.
Daniel works for us and runs his own, he runs

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.290
the northern addition to L3 Outdoors. So basically
he covers north Texas, has his own dogs, his

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.130
own crew, and all that stuff up there, and
me and Krystal run south Texas down here.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.210
The crops just got planted and this is like
opening day of deer season for pig hunters,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.409
you know. This is the upmost time where the
farmers are going to take the most, absolute

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.860
most financial impact from the pigs.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.080
Absolutely. So I know you've got a good hunt
planned for us. What are we looking at?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.080
We're looking at, right now we've got some
budding crops, everything's cut so you'll

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.520
be able to see with the night vision and the
flir and stuff like that. Everything is covered

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.629
in water right now from the irrigation because
they're really irrigating that seed, trying

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.800
to get that seed germinated and growing.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.440
So we've got standing water out there right
now?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.660
Standing water, and if it's not standing water
it's just sloppy mud. You know, from the irrigation

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.780
running all day. Rob's my better dog right
now, he seems to be doing a lot better than

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.780
the other ones. So we'll team them together
if we can, try to get them within three to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.290
four-hundred yards of the pigs where they
can smell the pigs and send the dogs to the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.000
pig that way they can out run him in that
mud and muck.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.120
The team head out through the thick mud in
the darkness on the lookout for hogs. They

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.060
haven't been out log when the trusty flir
thermal imaging scope picks out a heat signature

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.090
in the field.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.090
Alright, what we're doing is, we just pulled
into our first field for the night and we've

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.159
scanned a couple of other fields but this
is the first field we've actually stopped

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:58.159
in for the night. Now, we've got six to eight-hundred
yards out in the field right now is a really

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.870
good boar, we can see him on the flir. Daniel's
got the flir. We're going to put the dogs

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.870
on the ground and hopefully we put the dogs
on the ground and start walking towards him,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.850
they'll pick up his scent before he hears
us sloshing through the mud.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.090
Yeah, right now our wind's good. The wind's
good, we're gonna grab the dogs and basically

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.090
just walk them right into it until nature
does its job and they get going.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.180
Alright so, we've just cast the dogs on the
boar and we're getting to them ASAP.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.250
They let the dogs go and they're on the bore.
Daniel and Josh make a run for it across the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.569
field to catch up with the dogs. Daniel's
got a huge hog but he can't hold on. It's

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.270
a beast of a pig that almost gets away.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.209
Daniel's in there again and he has it, but
the hog is putting up a really good fight.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.069
He performs what should be a fatal blow, but
the hog is so full up and pumped full of adrenaline,

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.480
Josh places a second blow into the opposite
side. The hog doesn't get far before he drops

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.099
and passes.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.840
We're standing in the middle of a crop field,
as you can see there's a pivot behind me.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.039
This is an irrigation pivot on a farm field
and this is that planted corn that we've been

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:29.039
talking about in other videos. This big boar
was out here feeding on this planted corn

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.349
and it's still got corn kernels on it. This
is one of those pigs, you know, like a lot

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.949
of people criticise and say "we'll why'd you
catch him with a dog instead of just shooting."

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.310
Well we can't shoot it, I mean we're standing
in six inches of water and there's no way

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.310
you're going to sneak up on a pig in six inches
of water. It's going to hear you tromping

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.449
through that stuff.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.490
Sloshing around, yeah.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.970
The only thing you can do is rely on the dog's
nose and rely on that dog's speed. I mean

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.380
we turned those dogs loose from 400 yards
away, you know. You can't make a shot at 400

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.720
yards but we're super excited we got a bore
now and that's the thing we live for. Right,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.370
Daniel? We have dreams at night about this.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.000
It's all we do.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.620
That's another huge hog out of action in South
Texas and plenty of damage saved on the nearby

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.190
farm, but, the night isn't over yet. The boys
get to it, and are on the track of the next

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.440
hog.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.000
We're tracking this pig and the dogs just
rolled out, we can see the pig in the field there.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.350
 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I've got them on the flir and they're headed
straight for it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.190
We gotta go, we gotta follow these dogs up.
We're tracking this pig and there's other

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.000
pigs moving in the field as we're tracking
this pig so we're gonna put the dogs on it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Come on, Daniel.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.720
Again it's a big one, and the dogs are on
it. Daniel's first in there again, and he

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.330
grabs the hog by its back legs. The hog kicks
and fights as Daniel struggles to hold on.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.380
So Josh plants the fatal blow and the hog
passes quickly. Its nerves continue to twitch,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.900
but it's definitely passed.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.389
That's two, two in the same field.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.699
Two big hogs in one night for the boys at
L3 Outdoors and it's been highly successful.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:34.770
That's two good boars, only in a matter of
minutes. Minutes. That's where the dogs come

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.000
in. They roll these big boars like this.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.550
With so much action in a short space of time,
it's not just the dogs that are panting. I

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.000
think these boys have earned themselves a
pint.
