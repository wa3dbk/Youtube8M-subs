00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.660
Hi, my name is Russ Baker with Limit Out Performance
Marine in Pacific,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.660
Washington.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.210
Today, we're going to go over the Power-Pole
system, the anchor

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.460
system, that just came out about a year ago
or so.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.830
Currently, we have a
Ranger bass boat and we have the eight foot

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.600
Blade series on here, great
product for anchoring.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.180
If you want to fish shallow fish, whether
it's for

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.940
spawn fish, or you're flipping bushes, this
is the best way to go and the

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.189
fastest way to go.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.310
The biggest things I want to tell you about
is you want to make sure if

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.540
you're going to do a Power-Pole system, is
to make sure you have the right

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.950
components and the right parts.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:45.149
Each jack plate is different on every bass
boat, salt water boat; each jack plate needs

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.020
a different bracket.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.690
When you
purchase your power poles, make sure you have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.250
the right bracket and th e
right bolt sets for that bracket.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.430
What I want to do is go over a little
bit, as far as the installation of the Power-Pole

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.620
system and the bracket,
the pumps itself, and the wiring.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
What I do not recommend anybody do unless
you're totally mechanically

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.270
inclined, is to install this yourself.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.220
What I'd rather see you do is to get
it professionally done at a dealership like

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.069
Limit Out Marine, or your
closest bass boat dealership to you.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.619
The biggest reasons for that is pump
location because there is not a lot of room

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.270
in the back of a bass boat.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.899
One
thing we run into a lot on some brands of

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.590
boats, for instance like this
Ranger, we had to actually custom build a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.359
bracket to install the two pumps
in a very, very tight location.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.299
Other brands, such as Skeeter, same
situation.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.390
You have three or four batteries, a battery
charger, and the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.630
fuel tank you have to deal with.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.090
You'll actually have to customize a
bracket to install the brackets with.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.729
The other thing, too, is on this boat, we
did something a little bit

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.729
different.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.030
Since we didn't have a lot of room in this
back transom area,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.499
what we decided to do is actually run the
hydraulic cables through his

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.749
cable tube for his engine.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.909
In this case, it was a lot cleaner application.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.279
On most boats, you'll see there are actually
two fittings with actual

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.329
hydraulic hoses coming through and then back
to the poles themselves.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.030
Wiring placement is a tough call because it
all depends on the actual boat

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.610
itself, how it's wired in the back, the placement
of the batteries, et

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.140
cetera, et cetera.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.659
When you actually get the Power-Pole installed
by your dealer, have your

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.650
dealer bleed the system, make sure the poles
go up and down evenly to where

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.040
both poles go down at the same time.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.189
You want to take this boat to the lake
after you pick it up, after the dealer has

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.129
installed the Blades, and
actually cycle through the cycles on the Power-Pole

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.349
two or three times to
make sure both of them come up evenly, and

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.390
back down evenly at the same
time.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.020
Occasionally you will have this.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.459
Occasionally, the brackets will actually
be installed between the motor mount and the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.769
transom of the boat.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.420
In that
case, what you try to do is line everything

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.420
up.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.060
If it doesn't line up,
sometimes you'll actually have to drill a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.060
hole in the boat.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.049
Use 3M 50-100
silicone sealant to keep water from intruding

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.860
into the boat itself.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.579
Sometimes actually, Power-Poles are mounted
right here in the back of the

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.579
transom.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.140
In that case, you want to make sure you have
an effective

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.129
watertight fit here as well.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.230
We don't recommend that because then there's
more stress on the transom.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.200
What we like to do is put it right in between
the jack plate and the motor itself.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.780
Wireless remote system does come with this.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.730
That was the other thing we
wanted to go over with you.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.170
You can use your wireless remote, or you can
do

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.569
a manual switch, or a foot switch.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.540
You can install a foot switch on your
bow.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.889
You want to just put it around your neck,
or in your side storage box,

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.180
that way you can just go up or down with the
poles itself.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.670
You do not want
to leave this in your pocket, just in case

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.310
you fall in the lake.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.290
What might
happen is this, this gets wet, fries the unit

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.250
itself, unless you actually
have a manual switch on the side of your console

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.250
location.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.670
Leave this in
the truck, get ready to go, pull it out, put

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.400
it in the storage box, and
you're ready to roll.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.120
Come see us at Limit Out Performance Marine
for your power pole installs,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.730
we'd be glad to take care of you.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.950
Take care.
