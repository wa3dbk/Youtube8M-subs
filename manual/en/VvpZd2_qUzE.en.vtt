How to Tell Your Kids You’re Getting Divorced.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.540
Breaking the news to your children that you're
divorcing is one of the most difficult conversations

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.670
you'll ever have.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.360
But if you handle it well, it will save you
all some heartache in the long run.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.290
You will need A good chunk of time A calm
demeanor and a reassuring attitude.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.290
Step 1.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.010
Make absolutely certain that you're divorcing
before telling the children about it.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.010
Step 2.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.040
Tell the children on a day when you and your
spouse can break the news together.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.960
And be sure to stick around to provide reassurance
and answer questions.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.730
Have the talk a few days before one parent
moves out, so the kids have time to absorb

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.560
the news.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.600
Step 3.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.390
Tell the kids that the divorce is not their
fault.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.880
No doubt you've heard this advice before,
but it's something you can't emphasize enough.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.960
Speak from the heart, and avoid cliches like,
"Daddy and I don't love each other anymore,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.810
but we still love you."

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.129
Step 4.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.670
Don't assign blame.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
Even if one of you is moving out to be with
someone else, avoid explicit, accusatory explanations

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.030
– even if staying quiet requires drawing
blood from your own tongue.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.590
Step 5.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.340
Reassure your children that they will continue
to be loved and cared for.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.399
If possible, explain any custody details you've
worked out so you immediately can put to rest

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.439
their concerns about where they are going
to live and whether or not they'll have to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.299
change schools.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.310
Step 6.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.039
Assuming it's true, emphasize that they will
still see plenty of the parent who is not

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.319
going to be their primary custodian.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.530
If you are sharing custody with your spouse,
explain to your children how that arrangement

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.530
will work.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.549
Assure them they will still see their grandparents
and all their other relatives, too.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:51.079
Encourage your children to ask questions,
and answer them as honestly as possible.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
Step 7.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.789
Be reassuring, but don't sugarcoat the news
too much.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.909
Admit that this is going to be a sad time
for everyone; just be sure to emphasize that

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.139
everything is going to work out.

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.329
Step 8.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.689
Don't be surprised if the children get angry
and blame you for the divorce.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.479
It's perfectly natural, but it will subside
as long as you stay honest with your children

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.080
and continue to communicate with them.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.830
Did you know Approximately 5.6 million children
whose parents are divorced live with their

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.500
grandparents, according to the most recent
US Census.
