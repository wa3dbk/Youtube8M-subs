Okay folks. In this clip I'm going to teach
you how to draw some pajamas. And obviously

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.670
there are a lot of different options you can
go with when you're drawing girl's pajamas,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.320
but I think I will go with the tank top and
baggy pants look just because, I don't know,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.940
it seems to me like a, that's a good one.
Seems comfortable. So we'll draw arms coming

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:37.469
down in our little pose here.
And we'll draw what will be the outline of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.409
the upper body just like that. Now what we'll
do is we're going to give this girl one of

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:50.239
those tank tops to wear to bed. Not like one
of those flashy or sexy tank tops, this is

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.199
a comfy tank top. It's not really supposed
to be for anything other than sleeping in.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.679
So we'll just draw that there and then what
we'll do then is we'll draw just a little

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.820
bit of stomach showing right here and we'll
come along the top and kind of draw the tops

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.850
of what will end up being her comfy pajama
bottoms. I got a little tie there. I don't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.560
know if they have ties but yeah, let's draw
pajama bottoms that come down just like that.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.110
They're kind of like big poofy baggy pants
for comfortable sleeping. Come up just like

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.910
that. And I guess this could also be like
a hip hop outfit if you really wanted it to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.430
be, but it's not my intention. I'm going for
pajamas, comfy pajamas. And then her little

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.640
bare feet kind of sticking out the ends there.
And

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.530
you can draw like obviously some pattern on
them. Most pajamas seem to have a pattern

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:04.030
of some kind. Little hearts maybe. You know.
Something kind of girlie for bedtime. Yeah.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.469
That looks like a nice little pajama combo
right there. Tank top, baggy pants. There

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.670
you go. Pajamas.
