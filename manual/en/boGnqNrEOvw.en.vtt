00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.720
Hello, today I'm showing you the Cars 2 Race
Day Lego Duplo set.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.900
This set includes 26 legos.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.370
I will now show you how to build this set.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:20.060
All you need to do is attach the lego body
to the lego wheel base, The gold and silver

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.910
tires are Lightning McQueen's, and just the
silver tires, those belong to Jeff Gorvette.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.930
He has the number 24, just like the die-cast
car.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.510
He's got a terrific painted on smile, and
headlights, a very cute car.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.770
And this piece in the back, it doesn't move,
it's fully attached.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.340
Here's Lightning McQueen, got beautiful painted
on accents as well, and both of them read,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.410
World Grand Prix on their bumper.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.980
We now have 22 additional pieces to build
whatever we want.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.840
Right now I am building a little gas pump.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.509
And the set includes a hose for the gas pump,
which is actually the same exact hose that

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.600
comes with Red the firetruck.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
Okay, now it's time to build the finish line.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.310
Wow, I'm just like Francesco, I'm triple speed!

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.780
Okay, it's almost complete, time to test out
the finish line.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.890
Lightning wins of course.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.140
The cars can fill up with gasoline and get
repairs at the fuel pump.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.650
Here's a wrench to adjust his lego top, and
Jeff Gorvette's fin.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.640
Now, it's time for some gas, gulp, gulp, gulp,
gulp.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.330
Okay Jeff, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.299
We are almost ready.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.770
Oops, guess we don't need that.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.740
Okay, let's pour some oil all over you here.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.270
Okay, now it's time to race, ready, set, go!

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.200
Lightning won again!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.980
Time to fuel up again Lightning McQueen, gulp,
gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.360
Hey, don't drive off with the fuel pump.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.540
There are a lot of possibilities with this
Cars Lego set, now I am building a trophy

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.060
stand for the winner, Lightning McQueen.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.670
Yah, great work Lightning McQueen.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.919
You could also build a storage shelf for your
tools and oil.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.279
Thanks for watching, and have a great day!
