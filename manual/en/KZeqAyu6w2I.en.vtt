00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.960
Now what I'm going to do is, go ahead and
start working on the front cover. With the

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.420
front cover, what you're going to want to,
is attach you ribbon, your string. Whatever

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.000
you're going to utilize to tie your book together.
So to give it that like, cute little look.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:33.470
I guess. So, o.k. So I know my entire book
is 4x4. So what I'm going to do on that eliminate,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.590
having the thing grilling. So since I know
my front is a 4x4. I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.550
cut a sheet up. I'm going to go with polka
dot. We're going to do polka dot. I'm going

00:00:45.550 --> 00:01:02.320
to cut that down to three and a half by three
and a half. Go that way. And set that to the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.740
side. So that's three and a half by three
and a half. Now I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.400
polish off, my edge. And what I'm going to
do with that, is simply just stress the edge

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.920
with my ink. And that's a really simple technique.
I mean, it just kind of, gives it a polished

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:27.690
look. Not old age look, as well. So along
the edges, I'm going to do that. That's how.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:46.680
Go ahead and secure my 3x3 black yarn. And
evenly space that, all the way around. Not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:02:00.110
on front of. So that's going to be our front
cover, start a bit. And I'm going to have

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.030
a title. What I'm going to do is, create my
title real quick. And move ahead and we'll

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.609
do that vertically. And I'm going to cut that
to 3x3. And we'll cut that down. Set that

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:34.969
to the side. Just secure that a little more.
Here we go. So I'm going to go ahead and stress

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:47.999
this in black. I'm going to go ahead and do
this with the black. And so with that, I'm

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:54.540
going to utilize memories from Close To My
Heart, acrylic stamp set. Close To My Heart

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.389
specializes in acrylic stamping. They were
the first and the difference itself is clear.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.079
It's just amazing, what these stamps are.
And what they can do and what you can do with

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.540
them. And every stamp set comes with a foamy
sheet. Which is nice because what that enables

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.459
you to do. Is if you're working on an uneven
surface. Like I am. This is going to give

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.650
you better contact between stamped image and
your sheet of paper. Go ahead and grab yourself

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.859
a block. I think, the two and a half by two
and a half is going to fit perfect for that

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:36.849
stamped image. So I'll go ahead and get my
double scrubber. And my spread stop. Spray

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:47.150
to clean my stamp. So here we are. And I'm
going to center that. And make sure you don't

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.329
roll your stamp. Because what you'll do, if
you get edge of your block because you're

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.969
rolling. And then, you'll get nasty images.
So now, what we're going to do is. Going to

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:14.339
take our ribbon and we're going to make our
heart tie. So kind of, center that. See, o.k.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:26.260
And I'm going to use a tape for this one.
And what we're going to do is, take down our

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:37.530
ribbon. That way we'll know, it's not going
to come off. O.k. Now that we have that. We'll

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:53.789
go ahead and we'll tape on or glue on our
title, there. And center that. And there's

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.340
your front cover.
