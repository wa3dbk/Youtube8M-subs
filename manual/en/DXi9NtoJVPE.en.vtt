00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.609
Here we go, I'ma comin'. I'ma comin', Luigi.
Remember when I teached you Rock n' Roll?

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.069
Yes, that was so funny! You were like -- that
was a good day. Wait, top of my head, it's

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:19.460
in-sync. Ehh, we really have to come up with
a better solution. But right now this is the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.100
solution we have. Welcome everybody, would
you? Welcome to the Gracie and Mommy Show!

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.640
Today we are -- I just took a shower, by the
way. Yeah she just got out of the shower.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:35.550
Today we are introducing a fun new little
collectible called Stackins. Like, what? Stackins!

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.219
They stack! They're like Tsum Tsums, Tsum Tsums,
you may have seen Tsum Tsums, but these, unlike

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.489
-- uh oh, we lost a Stackin! These are not,
um, so this isn't a Disney themed thing, these

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:57.620
are all cute little plushy super-soft animals.
And they are so adorable, thank you Funrise

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.839
Toys for sending us these cute little guys!
We're like, these are hot off the presses.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.659
Stackins. So um, right now you should be able
to start finding these at your Justice, and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.039
they come in this size and then in a bigger,
like medium size. Not like a giant size. Just

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:21.639
look at this guy. That's the bunny, what's
the bunny's name? Does it have a name? Bonny!

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.890
Okay, FNAF people, the bunny's name is Bonny.
Spelled differently, it's B-O-N-N-Y, not B-O-N-N-I-E.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.119
Look at the ears! Ooh, look at the ears! I
guess Bonny's a common name for bunnies. Yeah.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.380
And they're going to - and they have their
little Stackins logo on the side - they're

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.539
really really - they're very soft, very very
soft. I'm doing the thing where I have to

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.149
feel it on my face because I'm having some
M.S. issues. I'm like wait, is it soft? Yes

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.640
it is soft. So that's Bonny the bunny - Bonny
the bunny - and this is Poppy the puppy but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.400
she's pink! It's a pink puppy! Oh look, she's
got spots. Ah, she's taking the tags off.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.250
I know, the tags are bigger than they are.
Hello, hello! I am Poppy the puppy. Woof,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.250
woof, woof, woof, woof! Okay. I love tiny
plushies. I'm a big fan of tiny plushies.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.440
And then this one is another big one of Gracie's
- um, one is that? Kiki the fox. What kind

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.030
of name is Kiki? Kiki Dee, if you're old,
you'll know who that is. Look at Kiki the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.190
fox's little foxy face. Hello, I've got a
little foxy face, and I've got a little foxy

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.600
tail. Is he a pirate? But I am not a pirate.
Nope, nope, not a pirate. Do what you want

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600
cause a pirate is me. You are a pirate! Oh
my goodness. I am not a pirate, I am a fox,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.600
and I am a Stackins. So I stack on top of
other Stackins. And then last but certainly

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.610
not least is Checkers -- whatcha doin'? Commander
fell down. Oh no, Commander Riker fell down.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.240
Um, is, is, Checkers the cheetah. And what
I think is really cool, is that she's not

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.610
like regular cheetah colors, she's pink and
blue, and adorbs. Look at how cute the little

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.610
face is! And the smushyness of it all! So
um, these are the first four that are out,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.160
but there's gonna be more. I'm gonna stack
'em up here. Stackin' em. Look at that, look

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.500
at that, even with the M.S. I'm stackin' my
Stackins. And so you can pile 'em up on each

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.110
other if you want to, stack 'em with your
Stackins, or I mean you can just, like, you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.770
know, they're cute. These would be really
cute actually, Mom, Dad, Grandma, Easter Bunny,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.340
if you guys do Easter baskets for your family
members, like I love to -- you have cat ears

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.390
-- I have cat ears, oh no, oh no! So if you
like Easter baskets, these are like perfect

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.620
for Easter baskets. These would be cute to
put in Easter baskets, but just hope that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.650
the Easter Bunny doesn't steal them when the
Easter Bunny comes to hide the eggs. So you

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.070
may have to put a note on it -- "Dear Easter
Bunny, this is not an egg, just a very fat

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.650
fox." -- And this is not a gift for you, the
carrots are yours, the Stackins are mine!

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.200
And I think that we also have to put that
on Spats.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.550
It's like, "Dear Easter Bunny, this is not
an egg. Just our very fat cat." -- Just our

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.260
very large cat. Um, so like I said, Stackins
will be available at Justice, and Stackins

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.780
have a website, I'm not sure if it's live
yet, but it's StackinsFriends.com, so I'll

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.720
put that in the description, and um, they're
also going to have webisodes. So they are far

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.720
more than just adorable, cute plushies that
you can just smush! Smush! They're so smushy.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.210
I love how smushy these are. I love - which
one's your favorite? I like Bonny. You like

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.880
the bunny, I like Poppy the puppy. I like
the puppy cause the puppy's got like one eye's

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.430
got a spot and the other doesn't, and she's
got spots on her back. Kind of looks like

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.400
Dumbo, doesn't she? There is a little bit
of a Dumbo-esque thing going on with that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.910
bunny, which is... but you know what else?
It reminds me of Julie, because she's got

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.910
the long ears -- Jenny. M.S. is a dangerous
thing, let me tell you. Let me tell you. So

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.520
thank you again Funrise Toys for sharing these
with us, this is so cool. Remember when you

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.570
called Jenny Julie and Julie Jenny. I have
issues. I just have issues, like I got the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.740
right letter, um, so yeah these are gonna
be in Justice now, and then they're gonna

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.450
start showing up in Walmarts over the summer,
and you should be able to find both sizes.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:50.450
They sent us the tiny size because I'm trying
to keep the plushies to a minimum. Well, as

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.340
much as we can. Bunny, bunny for dinner! I'll
just use my knees and monkey feet. Oh, use

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.190
your amazing monkey feet. These are so soft.
Better watch out, like, don't get immune to

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.400
cat nip or Spats and Mary will be like "Oh,
toys?" - These would def -- I think if you

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.110
have a dog, be careful, they might like these.
Because these are fun to bat around. And they're

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.150
very round, they're very round. Stackins!
