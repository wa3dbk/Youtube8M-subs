00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.460
In 2008, two new Siwertell coal ship unloaders

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.120
were taken into operation at Hsinta power station in Taiwan.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.960
Due to Shallow waters around the power station,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.220
the unloaders were installed on a jetty

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.640
two kilometres out into the open ocean.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.940
Harsh offshore conditions and high environmental requirements

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.040
made the Siewertell unloaded the perfect choice.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.180
Each unloader has a continuous unloading capacity of 2,000 tons per hour.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.140
Ensuring that cape size vessels

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.480
are unloaded in record time

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080
without any dust emissions or spillages.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.460
With its unique counter rotating inlet feeder,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.440
the Siwertell unloader easily picks up cargo from the vessels holds

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.320
and feeds it into its vertical screw conveyor.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.840
[Music]

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.720
The adjustable speed of the inlet feeder allows the operator to control

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.000
and keep a constant high unloading capacity, throughout the entire vessel.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240
[Music]

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.760
From the vertical screw conveyor, the cargo flow

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.860
continues through the horizontal belt conveyor...

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.000
...that takes the material to the turret

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.720
where it drops down through a chute.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.800
To a gantry belt conveyor that leads the cargo to one of the jetty belt conveyors.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.760
A cover belt lifter and dust suppression system

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.020
keeps the transition to the jetty belt conveyors sealed and clean.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.360
From the jetty belt conveyors,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.820
the cargo is then distributed to the coal yard.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.780
The Siwertell unloader has a light and strong counterbalanced arm system

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.920
allowing for substantial savings on Jetty construction

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.180
It can work with high digging forces, if the cargo is compact or heavy,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.860
without losing its efficiency.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.820
With its four different motions:

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.440
Pendulum...

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980
Luffing...

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
Skewing...

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.560
and Traveling,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.760
the extremely flexible Siwertell can easily reach cargo in all corners of the cargo hold.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.160
TheSiwertell unloader

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.900
is operated either from the operator cabin...

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.760
...or from a radio remote control

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.620
To Avoid collisions

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.420
the Siwertell is equipped with an anti collision system

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.840
that prevents the operator from manoeuvring where there's a collision risk.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.160
A sophisticated human-machine interface system called Simon,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.760
that's the SIwertell MONitoring system,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.340
has been specially developed for the Siwertell

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.280
to assist the operator and maintenance personnel

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.380
in their handling and servicing of the Siwertell.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.600
Power supply and communication for the Siewertell

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.980
is through high voltage and signal cables.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.780
On the unloader, a transformer converts power to low voltage

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.420
which is then distributed to all drives through the switchgear.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.480
All installed in anair-conditioned room.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.500
When the unloading operation is at its final stage and the vessels tank top is reached,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.840
the Siwertell can lift a 25 tonne excavator, with its auxilary hoist into the almost empty cargo hold.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.700
The excavator can then assist and speed up the final cleaning operation.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.520
[Music]

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.880
Within less than 48 hours from its arrival,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.220
the cape size vessel can depart for a new destination.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.900
And the Siwertell unloaders are ready for the next vessel to be unloaded

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.760
in record time, without any spillage, dust emissions or disturbing noise.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.580
