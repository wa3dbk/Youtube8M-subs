00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.600
How to Build a Snow Cave.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.370
If you're stranded outdoors during a blizzard,
knowing how to build a snow cave can spell

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.030
the difference between life and death.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.340
You will need A clear head Firm snow and sticks
for ventilation.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.570
Because a cave-in could be deadly, snow caves
should be built in emergencies only.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.869
Step 1.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.020
Stay calm!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.300
Panic won’t help you survive.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.620
Step 2.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.949
Find a snowdrift that will be deep enough
to tunnel a hole large enough to lay in and

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.019
with walls that are at least a foot thick
for adequate insulation.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.290
If you can’t find a drift large enough,
you can pack your own pile.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.199
You must be able to pack the snow to reduce
the threat of a cave-in—if you can’t make

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.269
a firm snowball, you can’t make a snow cave.

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.479
Step 3.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.909
Determine which way the wind is blowing, and
tunnel an entrance into the drift on the side

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.610
that’s facing away from it.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.650
Step 4.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.480
Because heat rises, you’ll want the entrance
of your cave to be lower than the part where

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480
you’ll lay.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.290
Dig an impression in the entrance to trap
the cold air.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.780
Step 5.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.970
Continue burrowing into the drift so that
the main portion of the cave is about a foot

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.910
higher off the ground than the entrance, creating
a heat trap.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.142
A snow cave is not an igloo—it just needs
to be big enough for you to get in and out

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:33.610
of and lie in, not walk around or even fully
sit up.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.810
Step 6.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.590
Use a stick or other pointy object to create
two holes several feet apart in the roof for

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.590
ventilation.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.390
Poke them from the outside of the cave if
you need to—just make sure they pierce the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.750
cave so fresh air can get in.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.070
Step 7.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.520
Dig small grooves in the floor of the cave
to drain any moisture caused by your body

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
heat.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.330
If the cave gets damp, it will just make you
colder.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.330
Step 8.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.600
Mark the outside of the snow cave with some
of your belongings so rescuers can find you.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.061
If it’s still snowing heavily, try to put
them in a place they’re not as likely to

00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.860
be buried, like hanging from a nearby tree.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860
Step 9.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.450
When your cave is big and stable enough, get
in so you’re resting in the upper level.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.830
Reach below and pack snow in the entrance
to close yourself in and block out the wind.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.830
Step 10.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.340
Don’t leave your shelter until the storm
stops or help arrives.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.120
Did you know Mountain climbers trapped in
storms have survived in snow caves for as

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.150
long as 13 days.
