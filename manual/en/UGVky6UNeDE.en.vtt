00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.990
What's the difference
between ambient light and flash?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.130
Hi! Today we're here in the Groves with Chloe

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.900
who is our awesome model,
and we are going to do two shots.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.700
We are going to do an completely ambient shot

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.400
and then we're going to follow it up with flash.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
And we're going to completely change
the way this looks.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.130
We want both to look great.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.600
So we'll start with the ambient

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.360
and in order to do that we're using the sun,
which is coming from this direction.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.110
It's raking across Chloe,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.899
it's hitting this reflector and it's coming back.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.199
This is a silver reflector so
we get the most bang for our buck 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.990
and it's going to come forward
and just kind of fill in her shadows

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.100
and give her some light in the eyes.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.520
So let's start with that shot.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.620
Oh, and by the way,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.930
there's a lot of construction going on
around here so you'll hear lots of noise.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.330
So here we go. Chloe, you're on and... go!

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.230
Great. Okay!

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.999
So now I'm going to swing this
reflector out of the way

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.970
so that we're not using it at all.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.070
I don't want this of any use to us.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.130
'Cause otherwise it might reflect some of the flash.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.080
And we're going to turn on all our
flashes and show you what that looks like.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.450
The first set of flashes that we're going to
turn on is right behind me and this is the B2.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.440
It's the Off-Camera Flash set.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.600
I've got a softbox here and
I've got a hair light back here.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440
So I'm going to turn those on
first and see what happens there

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.670
and then we're going to build in
some background lights as well.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.040
So, let's turn on our flashes
here from the Air Remote. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.610
Alright. You ready, Chloe?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.149
Here we go and... good!

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.370
Excellent. Perfect!

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.870
Okay, so that's with one set of lights.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.790
Now we're going to compare it
once we turn on all of the lights.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.319
We can do that simply by turning
them on here from the Air Remote.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.580
So we're just going to turn on
the background lights

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940
and we're going to fire them all again.
So, are you ready? Here we go.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.740
Again...

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740
There you go, good! Just like that.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.740
Nice.
