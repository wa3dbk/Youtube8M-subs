This is what you look like

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.020
This is what you look like in ultraviolet

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.120
An ultraviolet camera can show not yet visible changes to your skin

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.000
mostly freckles

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.960
also other stuff

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.220
Everyone's born with good skin, pretty much

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.220
It ages at different speeds

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.260
Healthy skin is easy to spot

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.160
Glass blocks UV

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.160
So glasses look black

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.680
sunscreen also blocks UV

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.440
So this is what sunscreen looks like

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.120
stay beautiful

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.020
that's it
