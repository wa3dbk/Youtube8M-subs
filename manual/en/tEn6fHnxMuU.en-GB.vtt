00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.620
Jolla Tablet,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.290
Expected May 2015.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.571
Following on from last year's Jolla smartphone,
the

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:23.910
upcoming Jolla Tablet brings the open source
Sailfish OS to a 7.9" tablet with similar

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.259
specifications to the iPad Mini 3, but with
a very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.259
different design philosophy.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.620
The Linux-based Sailfish operating system
is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.050
derived in part from MeeGo, the operating
system

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.080
made for the very rare Nokia N9. As such,
it's a

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.100
fascinating glimpse into what might have been
if

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.160
Nokia had continued down the road with MeeGo,
and indeed Jolla employs many ex-Nokia staff.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.050
In
the same week that Nokia announced their N1

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.289
tablet, the Jolla Tablet is distinctly more
individual

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.109
and it probably has much more Nokia DNA in
it

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.699
that the Foxconn manufactured N1.
Sailfish is a gesture-based OS with sophisticated

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.009
multitasking, all designed to be open source.
In addition to native Sailfish

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.610
applications it can run Android applications
too, which can be downloaded from the Jolla

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.290
Store and other Android app
marketplaces.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.390
Inside is a 1.8GHz quad-core CPU and 2GB of
RAM

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.431
with 32GB of flash memory plus a microSD slot.
The

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:32.780
display is a 7.85" 2048 x 1536 pixel panel
(almost

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.760
identical to the current iPad Mini and the
N1). Inside

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.869
is a 4300 mAh battery, along with WiFi support,
Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS and a pretty

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.310
standard set of sensors. There's no 3G/LTE
version

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.869
of the Jolla tablet, but it is easy enough
to pair it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.869
with a smartphone. There's a 5 megapixel camera
on

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.060
the back capable of 1080p video capture at
60fps,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.060
plus a 2 megapixel one on the front too.
Jolla is crowdsourcing funding for this tablet,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.740
and at
the moment it has easily exceeded its funding

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.090
goals
which is looking promising. Jolla say that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.760
the first units should start shipping to funders
in May 2015. When it goes on general

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.410
release the retail price is estimated to be
$249.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.700
If you are looking for a tablet that is different
from the crowd then this is certainly worth

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.140
considering, it certainly looks
refreshingly different from Apple's offering

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.109
and most of the competition. You can find
out more about the Jolla Tablet at

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.659

at Indiegogo.
