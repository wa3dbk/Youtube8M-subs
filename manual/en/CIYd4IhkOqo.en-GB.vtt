Hey, everyone, it's Tanya Burr again with
another makeup tutorial for you. Last time,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.629
you saw me do minimal makeup look using very
few products just before I was going to the

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.019
hairdresser to get my hair done. Today I'm
going to do a day to night makeup tutorial

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.630
for you. So I'm going to show you how to take
your makeup from this really basic day look

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.160
into a glamorous evening look. So this tutorial
would be perfect for if you've been at work

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.740
all day, and your makeup is just not feeling
fresh anymore and then you just want to freshen

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.009
it up and make yourself look glamorous for
an evening out.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.960
I think it’s quite important to redo your
foundation especially if it’s been a hot

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.730
day in your face or something like that. I'm
going to use the Nelsons Pure &amp; Clear facial

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.239
wipes. These wipes are absolutely lovely.
They may be a little bit more expensive than

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.399
your average wipes, but they’re worth every
penny because they’re packed with natural

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.129
plant extract, which you can really smell
on the wipes. I can really smell tea tree,

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.460
which I really like because it definitely
makes me feel fresh at the end of the day.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.340
Flower power in a wipe format, that’s how
I like to think of them. Not only do they

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.399
take off your makeup quickly, and smoothly
and easily, they also cleanse away any impurities,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.509
calm the skin and add moisture. So my skin’s
definitely feeling fresher already and ready

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.619
to go on with a nice new makeup now. These
wipes leave my skin feeling really refreshed.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.759
They’re just so ideal to revive tired skin
and infuse energy before heading out after work.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.079
Now you just need to moisturise your skin
before adding any foundation. I’m going

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.969
to use Nelsons Pure &amp; Clear balancing moisturiser.
Just a couple pumps of this is enough. And

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.749
as you've already noticed, I haven't taken
off my eye makeup because I've only got a

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:39.029
tiny bit of eyeshadow and mascara on my top
lashes so I can easily just add to that. Okay,

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:42.889
so now I've really prepared my skin properly
for the makeup, it's just going to sit so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.829
nicely on my skin now and look really refreshed
for the evening.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.829
I’m going to use my Chanel Vitalumiere Aqua
foundation. I’m buffing the foundation with

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.229
a brush. I’m going to get a slightly more
professional finish for the evening, which

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.619
is exactly what I want. I absolutely love
that balancing moisturiser that I used. It’s

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.560
just such a good base for makeup. I think
it’s because it's so light and oil-free.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.580
It's just the perfect base for my foundation
to sit on.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.310
Now it's time to top up your concealer, if
you need to. I’m just going to use a little

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.310
bit under my eyes where it’s kind of worn
off in the day, and over any blemishes that

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.409
the foundation didn't cover. Oh, and that’s
my Rimmel Wake Me Up Concealer. So I just

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.250
dotted that where I need it and then I just
blend it with my finger.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.129
Next, I’m just going to take a black eyeliner,
this is the Rimmel Soft Kohl Eyeliner, and

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:52.949
just pop this on my waterline. And I'm going
to just add mascara to my bottom eyelashes,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.180
and that just made my eyes look way more glamorous
for the evening. And then I'm just going to

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:14.230
add a touch of mascara on my top lashes to
make them have a little bit more volume, and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.040
this is Revlon's Grow Luscious mascara, which
I really love.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.400
Another really easy way to look slightly more
glamorous for the evening is to contour your

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.799
cheekbones. I'm going to use this bronzer
from Chanel. This is a cream bronzer. I’m

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.540
just going to pop this in the hollows of my
cheeks. Because it's cream, it blends in really

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:44.230
easily. It just helps to enhance my cheekbones.
Like that. Then on the apple of my cheeks,

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.379
I just want to add a little pop of color and
I'm going to use this blush from ELF in the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:04:00.739
color Pink Passion. And then taking my Rimmel
Stay Matte powder, I'm just going to powder

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.790
through the center of my skin because I do
like my skin to look quite fresh and glowy

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.439
in most places but just not through the center
of my skin, through my T-zone. I like to keep

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.340
that quite matte.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.239
Then last but not least, I’m going to do
the feature of the makeup, which is a bright

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.510
pink lip. I’m using this one from Maybelline
and the color is called Pink Punch. It’s

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.620
such a gorgeous, bright, pink color. It's
just going to suddenly make my makeup look

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.560
really glamorous and just perfect for the
evening.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.669
Okay, so that's my finished look. I hope you
guys found this helpful and have fun recreating

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.949
this makeup tutorial, guys. Let me know in
the comment section below if you’ve recreated

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.520
it for a night out and if you had fun wearing
it. So thanks for watching, guys. Bye.
