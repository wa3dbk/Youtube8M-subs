00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
if you're a phone roadwarrior computer

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.490
junkie and you're like me with an iphone

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.080
you'll know that these lightning cables

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.100
just don't last very long I go through

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.470
one probably at least every two months

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
if not sooner the problem is these

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800
stupid little connections on the end

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.810
they actually corrode even with just the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.699
ambient moisture even if the cable never

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.630
ever sees dry air excuse me ever never

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
ever sees water well on top of that i'm

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.160
also road warrior we had 64,000 miles on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
my car in two years and always doing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.350
work on the go so i got course iphone

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.379
still stuck using an iphone 4s as well

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.739
and then i have my laptop which is also

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.189
a tablet well the reason why i went with

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.650
this specific laptop it's because it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.470
charges with a micro USB cord so that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.630
means everything i have can charge right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.310
from the Tesla Model S's USB ports or

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.479
you know for those even that don't have

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.400
a Tesla and have us some other insert

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.100
you know car make into the line here you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.659
know you just use a standard USB adapter

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.979
but it gets to me a little bit of hassle

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.320
because I literally have that would have

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.320
three wires hanging around here plus yes

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.770
i also have a flip phone why because

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.780
this thing does one thing and it does it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.689
very well it makes phone calls on this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.399
uses regular mini USB i don't know how

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.869
much longer that one's in the last so

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.479
are you going on eight years anyways i

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.090
thought this time around why not reduce

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.849
some of my cable edge so i don't have so

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.710
many and have to carry around someone

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.980
so I found this from jb d on amazon i

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.740
was very reasonably priced and it is a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.430
dual cable it's got both lightning and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:31.140
micro heroism yeah micro USB in its

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.790
amazon prime our part of amazon prime so

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.260
you can get it two days if you do order

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.350
I've already open it can I send zip lock

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.110
baggie here I've had it for a while I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.730
just thought I'd do a review on it

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.090
because I was actually impressed

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.100
extremely impressed with the quality as

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.360
I've tried plenty of aftermarket iphone

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.920
lightning cables and they just don't

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.940
last that last even less than the than

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.780
the factory OEM ones and I while I like

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.460
the form factor of the Lightning's I

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.520
really missed the old 30 was a 32 pin

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.710
what I'm the old original iphone

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.270
charging cable was I've actually been

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.520
using this dollar store cord for close

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.070
to four years now and against heavy use

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.840
especially being in the car and it's

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.830
still going one buck can't beat that but

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.840
like I said lightning cables just don't

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.520
seem to last this one's actually been

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.650
going on a very long time and here's the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.470
nice thing about it is you pop the top

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.500
off and now you got micro USB and it is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.520
apple certified by jb d i'll have a link

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.650
to the actual product and no i'm not i

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.440
don't get any referral credits or

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.790
anything like that i just found a nice

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.220
decent cable for a change so I'm always

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.570
getting ticked off where these things

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.890
don't last so you just got

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.709
here you go but when I need to use my

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.850
laptop or tablet depending on if I feel

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.060
like connecting or disconnecting it or

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.110
want to charge it there we go charging

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.380
away in stupid windows 8 brand new

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.470
laptop and it never never charges her

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.340
never act will never activate yes yeah

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.139
you gotta reinstall windows from scratch

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.760
no I'm not going to go through that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.070
hassle anyways plugged in charging so

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.110

five stars which I will be ordered it I

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.870
got this in two days it shipped out of

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.419
the local amazon distribution center and

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.960
i think it was just over ten dollars not

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.539
bad considering that the last time I

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.210
walked into an apple store this piece of

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.980
junk om one was 30

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.320
and even more expensive when I went to

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.830
China you want to China when the court

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.730
decided yeah like yours and decided not

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.370
to work anymore but yeah I definitely

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.360
take take this one over the OEM apple

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.600
cable any day works very nice another

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.810
thing is another problem with the apple

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.360
ones is because the end is so small and

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.160
the older ones you could grab the whole

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.960
thing you had a nice nice bit to grab on

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.780
to and these it's so small and they're

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.200
slippery a lot of people have a habit of

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.730
just taking it out by the court which of

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.150
course damages them but they and the JDB

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.660
ones they put a nice got a nice bit to

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.610
grab on to not just a tiny little cord

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.570
and that the Court itself is actually

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.230
thicker in a little more beefier than

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.560
the apple one so that's enough from

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.280
trying to sell a Apple cord i'm just

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.770
like i said happy i found one that works

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.490
in is actually a very decent quality and

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.840
i was able to charge at well I phone

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.240
charges at one amp but I was able to

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.480
charge my laptop at 2 amps so that is it

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.940
and also testing out

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.720
he testing out the Sony app from my

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.850
camcorder and realize it was that neat
