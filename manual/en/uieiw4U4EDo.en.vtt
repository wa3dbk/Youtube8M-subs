00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:14.348
Host: What to say! Our Sasha is still the fisherman. He caught a real goldfish for the duet. Interesting, whether Katya is ready to fulfill his first 3 wishes?

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:30.859
Norwegian musician Alexander Rybak won the Eurovision Song Contest, put aside his violin and came to Ukraine for only one thing - to sing with a young actress Ekaterina Kuznetsova.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.236
E: Hi!
A: Hello, nice to meet you! 
E: Kate.
I'm kidding. I speak Russian.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:42.841
E: My name is Katya.
A: I'll speak Russian very bad. You are even more beautiful than in your movies.
E: Now I'm blushing. Thank you.
A: Don't do it.

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:56.378
A: Well, honestly, I didn't know very much about you, I live in Norway.
I just like her smile very much, that she's so... down to earth, one can say.

00:00:56.378 --> 00:01:02.113
A: Do you understand what I say?
E: Yes.
A: That's it, she understands what I say.

00:01:07.988 --> 00:01:12.028
A: Wow! So you are at all... you're ... you are opera soprano.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:24.718
A: I think it is the first song, let her sing the entire first chorus on audience or on camera, and then the camera is just on me.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:32.439
A: Remember that I am a violinist, I'm not a singer. So you are not quite lucky on that.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.533
H: Our show just has started, but Katya and Sasha are already asking for the vacation. They want to go to the sea!

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:55.382
So, while they haven't yet finished packing their suitcases, please, welcome, Alexander Rybak and Kateryna Kuznetsova!

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:19.559
Ekaterina Kuznetsova and Alexander Rybak!

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:26.681
Rybak you are really cowboy, normal Norwegian cowboy. Again yours ovations for this duet. 

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:32.695
H: Do you know how did they meet each other? Sasha came to Katya and asked: "Are you fisherwoman?" She replied : "No" and he said "And I am Rybak" (Rybak means fisherman in Russian)

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:37.711
Sanja, how do you say "Zirka+zirka" in Norwegian?

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:43.051
AR: "Star plus star"...ups wait... 
Host: Can you repeat, baby? 

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:52.893
H: Do you know how do they sing in Ukraine, and exactly in Kiev, the song " "Komarovo"? Do you know it, Katya? I even wrote it to myself. 

00:04:52.893 --> 00:04:56.426
For 3 days, so to say, I will go to the "Puscha-Voditsa" (It is a place where a lot of Kiev citizens take rest)

00:04:56.426 --> 00:05:01.902
But our duet is going to the art-cafe now. Vasja, Vanja, welcome them!

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:13.005
Vasja: Have you understood, Vanja, the fame of our Zirka+zirka was spread all over the world? Eurovision people come to us.

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:20.366
Vanja: Yura (the host), how do you think, what is better: 2 winners of Zirka+zirka or one winner of the Eurovision?

00:05:20.366 --> 00:05:26.860
Host: Well...I don't know. I can say that the host of Zirka+zirka is the better than three hosts of Eurovision.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.833
Vanja: Why this bull is so weak? When you sat on him he didn't shake, but when you climbed down from him, he began to do that....

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:40.126
Katya: But it was a little bit hard, certainly. I practiced today in the afternoon, at least I tried. I thought that if I try to swing more, I'd just fall down.

00:05:40.126 --> 00:05:46.580
Vanja: Who was inside the bull? Kostjushkin from the "Chai vdvoem"? (one of the participant of the show)
Katja: No, it seems it wasn't him. I'd have felt.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.484
Vanja: I would like you to say the greetings to the audience of "Zirka+zirka", to those who are watching us now.

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:54.871
AR: I wish you happiness.
Vanja: I meant in n Norwegian.

00:05:54.871 --> 00:06:00.467
AR: [says in Norwegian]
