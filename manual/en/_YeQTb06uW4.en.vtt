Hi, Im gonna show you how to make your own kits for PES2016

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:07.652
So you can see how will they look in the game.

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:09.926
Let's go

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:16.272
First: we need an image editor, such as Photoshop

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.490
But you can use any other editor with the same purpose

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.655
Once you have an editor, you'll need a template, you can find it in the description of this video

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:35.768
Now, open the template in the editor and edit ir as you want

00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:40.074
I'm not gonna show you how to, because it's basic, and it's pretty easy to use

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:52.389
You can add some color layers,  badges...whatever, also, in the template you can see the name of every single part

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:38.142
Now, how can I see how will they look in the game without having PES 2015 in ps3?

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:40.276
We can't add kits in the ps4 yet as you know

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:45.987
So what we're gonna do is:

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.445
Download a 3D model for Blender

00:01:48.445 --> 00:01:49.633
(a 3D modeling program)

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:57.442
where we will open a 3D model that will look like the kit will look in the game

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:05.857
Just download the model and open it with blender and follow the instructions:

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:29.244
What we gotta do is:

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:32.758
Open the model, and add a image file, the template PNG or JPG file.

00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:33.743
Just like this:

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:05.362
Now you can see how will it look in the game.
