00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Hi everybody.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.650
This is Kiefer from DangerouslyHardcore.com.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.780
And today, I wanted to talk about ketosis
and keto sticks and how useful are the keto

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.780
sticks.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.130
They became a craze with Atkins.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.680
This guy loved keto sticks.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710
I swear he mentioned them in every other page
of his book.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.189
“Get out those keto sticks.”

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.070
I think he just had an obsession with people
peeing on sticks in the bathroom.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.100
I’m not exactly sure, because keto sticks
are actually useless.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.930
They don’t tell when you’re in a state
of ketogenesis – which is when your body

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.570
is turning fatty acids into ketones and you’re
effectively burning fat and you’re very

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.570
inefficient.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.570
This is a good state to be in.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.710
The problem is, keto sticks only tell you
how many ketones are coming out through your

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.710
urine.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.160
This could happen for a number of reasons.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.930
It can happen during the prep phase of Carb
Back-Loading or Carb Nite.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.739
It can happen first thing in the morning – and
does to a lot of people.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.880
It can happen after a training session.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.160
But it can also happen if you’ve been ketogenic
all day and have a large load of carbohydrates.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.720
That large load of glucose creates a surplus
of ketones that your body can’t use effectively,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.500
so you pee them out.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.330
So in that case, the keto sticks actually
tell you the wrong thing.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.610
They show you that you’re in ketosis, which
is just peeing out ketones.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.500
But in fact, your body is no longer ketogenic.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.330
So, keto sticks are absolutely 100% useless
for use on these diets if you’re trying

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.780
to learn about if your body is burning fat
or not.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.630
They cannot tell you that information.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.970
It’s simply a waste of your money.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.000
Or again, if you’re like Atkins and enjoy
peeing on a stick and potentially missing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.550
from time to time, and ensuring that you need
to wash your hands in the bathroom, then you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.450
can get keto sticks.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.530
Otherwise, I would just ignore them in the
store.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.950
Alright, that’s another tip from DangerouslyHardcore.com.
