00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.430
I am wearing the women's Microlight Alpine
jacket by Rab and this is a super light weight

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.189
750 fill down jacket.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.089
I can see this as being a great piece by itself
for more mild winter conditions when you just

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.079
need to take the edge off.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.500
I can also see this as being a great mid layer
if you are wearing a base layer and then a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.080
shell over top, so a great insulating piece
as well.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.590
This actually packs down into its chest pocket.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.430
So I have the jacket packed down and you can
see there is a sort of a double zipper on

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.800
that chest pocket.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.690
So it packs down to be really small.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.469
If you are using this as a backpacking or
a climbing piece, you know, when you don't

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.499
need it you can just tuck it away in your
back pack, you know, get it out in the evening

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.749
when it starts getting colder.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:53.039
So just a recall light weight piece and just
wanted to show you how to pack it down into

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.429
its pocket.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.870
The pocketing on this jacket is really straight
forward and simple.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.180
You have two hand warmer pockets in the front
and they are lined with just a nylon rip stop

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.180
fabric.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.210
So that really reflects your heat back to
you.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.899
I And then you have this chest pocket that
we talked about earlier.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.500
So it is a pretty big pocket beaus you stuff
the jacket into this pocket here.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.380
Going down to the cuffs you just have a stretchy
lycra cuff on each stuff.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.159
It is really light weight design.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.120
And then on the hem you have two draw cords
on either side.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.500
You can tuck those cords in just to make sure
that you are keeping all of your heat in the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260
jacket.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.340
Moving up to the hood there is a really cool
design in the baffling and in the cuff of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950
the hood.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.899
So I put that on.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.740
You can see that it goes all the way around
your face and you can cinch that down really

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.649
tight incase you have some really cold weather
coming in, but you also have a metal wire

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.780
on the edge of the hood here.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.270
So you can sort of adjust that however you
want.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.990
You can make it flat.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.960
You can sort of curve it around your face
if you are wearing goggles or glasses.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.399
You can curve it around that.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.620
So really interesting feature on the hood.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.920
This jacket is listed as being a slim fit
and this is a size medium.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.330
In most outer wear pieces of other brands
I wear a small and I usually kind of swim

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.530
in a medium.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
And you can see.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.120
This doesn't look, you know, too super big
on me.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.430
So, you know, if you are going to be layering
with it underneath, you might want to go up

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.430
in size.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.530
If you are going to be wearing a shell over
top you might want to stay with a size that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.750
you normally would wear.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.120
And Rab sort of does a European size and a
US size.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.790
So this is size 12 European and it is a medium
in US size.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.799
Just one last thing I want to mention on the
jacket.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.830
You do have sort of a storm flap here, you
know, behind the front zipper of the jacket.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.760
And all their colors are really nice sort
of contrasting colors in the jacket, but all

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.980
in all it is a really great stand alone piece
or layered with a shell.
