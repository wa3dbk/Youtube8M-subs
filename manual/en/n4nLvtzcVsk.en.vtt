00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.260
Welcome to FudeHouse.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.230
And Sweet y Salado.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.719
I'm at Dickson's Farmstand Meats in NYC to
talk about beef short ribs.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.860
Where do they come from?

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.369
Yeah, the ribs ok, but let's break it down.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.869
The short ribs that you and I love come from
what is called the rib plate (beef plate)

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.590
or sometimes more specifically called the
short plate.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.980
Well, where's that?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.980
Look here.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.410
Let's isolate it in the beef carcass.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.179
There are 13 ribs in a steer.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.210
First, let's separate the hindquarter from
the forequarter, and that always happens between

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.239
the 12th and 13th rib.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.640
Next, we split the forequarter in two.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.440
Now this is where it's get tricky with butchers
in different countries with varying standards

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440
and traditions.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.719
In America, some people split the forequarter
between the 4th and 5th ribs, others between

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.180
the 5th and 6th, and I'm sure there are even
more variations therein.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.890
It's all about your final plans with the meat
you're cutting.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.380
In either case, we're left with an arm chuck
there, and a rib plate here.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.730
Now this section here has a few cuts we all
know and love.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.429
Ribeye steaks up here.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.110
And the extension of the brisket (deep pectorals)
muscle down here called the Navel.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.479
Get rid of those, and we're left... with the
short ribs.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.479
Check it out.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880
Here's a full beef plate.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.320
See ribeye here, the same rib bones in the
RIB-EYE become the short ribs down here, and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.479
then, into the navel muscle.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.040
Oh, and, the skirt steak lives on the inside
of the rib plate there.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.290
Ok, a lot of info, I know.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:39.259
But here we go: remove the skirt, split the
rib section from the plate, when the rib bones

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.270
end on the underbelly of the steer, find the
cartilage and remove the navel.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.060
Edge it on the saw and there, finally, are
your short ribs.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.119
But that's just the beginning.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.570
Now the fun begins.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960
How many different types of short ribs can
we make from this?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960
(Let us count the ways)

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.079
On this plate we have 8 ribs.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.659
Rib #5 - 12.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.229
Keep in mind, that the muscles change throughout
the animal.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.580
So a short rib from this area won't look like
a short rib from this area, but they will

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.230
be equally tasty.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.670
The only ribs you can't use are the last ribs
(#9-12) on closer to the top of the back (dorsal).

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.980
Don't worry, you'll never see these ribs in
a butcher's case for sale -- there's just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.010
no good meat in them, it's all fat.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.160
They go to compost or to add fat to ground
beef or sausage.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.660
Let's cut our plate like this to make things
easier on ourselves, no?

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.530
This, we'll save for tasty ground beef.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.050
This section makes gnarly looking ribs but
they are really flavorful.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.560
The most traditional style of beef short ribs
are what some people call English cut.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.550
Cut between the bones, maybe about 5 inches
long.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.610
Each rib has one bone with meat around it.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.100
This is English cut, and cut from this section
it's English cut too, but we get that quintessential

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.310
short rib look.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.390
Like this.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.140
But now if you cut across the bones, you get
Flanken cut short ribs.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.000
In this case, instead of just one bone, each
piece of meat has several small pieces of

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
bone.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
See?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.060
They taste the same, it's just about style
and presentation.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.650
Now there's a way we can take it even further.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.100
If we cut our flanken ribs very thinly, and
remove this top muscle here, called the Lifter

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.770
(latissimus dorsi), along with it's silver
skin and fat, we get something called Kalbi.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.170
A traditional Korean cut that takes sugary
marinades really well, caramelizes on the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.100
grill, and, since it's cut pretty thin, is
very tender all things considered (no braising

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.100
necessary).

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.440
It ends up tasting like meat candy.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.860
Crusty and caramelized, beefy and fatty, cook
it to well-done and enjoy a really great tearing

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.010
action as you eat it with your fingers.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.370
The best looking ribs all around, the ones
you have to use for Flanken and Kalbi and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.490
those picture perfect English cut, come from
ribs 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.260
And it's all because of this muscle here.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.820
If there's nothing else you take away from
ALL this information, you have to know that

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.820
this muscle is what makes your short rib so
awesome.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.720
It's called the serratus ventralis.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.160
Quite possibly my favorite cut in the whole
animal [forget tenderloin].

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.100
Big beefy flavor (beefy) and great intramuscular
fat (marbling).

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.340
This is the muscle that you love so much when
you bite down into those beautifully braised

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.950
short ribs.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.760
So there it is.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760
The plate.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.910
English cut.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.910
Flanken cut.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.910
Thin cut flanken.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.430
And the muscle that runs through it all, the
serratus ventralis.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.680
For more information, talk to your local butcher.
