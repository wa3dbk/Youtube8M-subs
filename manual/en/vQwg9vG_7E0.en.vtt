00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The camera lens focuses light onto the film or sensor creating a crisp image.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You can play with your camera settings to control what is in focus in the image.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Try using focus to highlight a particular object or area in the composition.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.000
Or try having the image out of focus to create an effect.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Film speed is the measure of a photographic film’s sensitivity to light. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.140
So how fast it responds chemically when it is exposed to light. It is also referred to as "ISO" or "ASA".

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.200
Low numbers react slowly and they are used for taking shots in bright outdoor light.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Higher numbers react faster and can be used in very low light.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.100
A higher film speed creates a grainier image.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.200
When using a digital camera the film speed settings are designed to respond very similarly to a film camera.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.200
Although, digital grain doesn’t look as nice.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.000
Once you have set your film speed, the next step is controlling how much light gets to the film or sensor and for how long.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000
This is called exposure. Exposing your film to the light.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.000
You need to use a combination of aperture setting and shutter speed to get the correct exposure.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.100
They work together so if you adjust one you should check your light meter and maybe adjust the other.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.040
Your aperture affects how much light gets in by shrinking or enlarging the hole the light travels through.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.000
This is measured in ‘F-stops’. A higher F-stop means a smaller hole which lets in less light 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.000
and gives you a longer focal length or depth of field.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.000
Your shutter speed controls how long the shutter is open to let light onto the film or sensor.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
A fast shutter speed will let you capture high-speed action without it blurring.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you are using a low shutter speed to let in more light 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.000
then objects moving in front of the camera (or even your own hand shaking when you hold the camera) will result in a blurry image.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.000
In addition to its effect on exposure the shutter speed changes the way movement appears in the picture.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Very short shutter speeds can capture high speed action images

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.200
because they capture a tiny fraction of the action by opening and closing the shutter very quickly.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.000
A slow shutter speed lets light in for a long time, so fast moving objects can become blurred.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Both of these options can provide fantastic opportunities for experimenting with photography.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.160
Depth of field is how deep the focus is in the shot.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.140
A large depth of field means that objects in both the foreground and the background will be in focus.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.200
A shallow depth of field will only allow a small window of focus. 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.000
So if an object in the foreground is in focus the background will be out of focus.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.000
Depth of field is controlled by the size of the aperture and the distance from the subject,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and also the zoom function (if you are using a zoom lens).

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.200
Different types of light have slightly different colours. This is called colour temperature.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.060
The sun is very blue when compared with incandescent light bulbs (which are yellowish).

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.160
A good way to remember this is to think of a candle.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.200
The bottom (hottest) part of the flame is very blue, like the large hot sun.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.200
And the flame turns yellow as it gets cooler at the top, like smaller cooler light bulbs.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.200
Most cameras have settings where you can select which kind of light you are shooting in. 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.100
Or you can manually set your white balance using the manual button.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.200
Playing with the angle that you take a photograph from

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.060
can really make an image much more dynamic than if you keep the camera front-on and at eye-level.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.160
Low-angle shots tend to make the subject look really powerful,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.100
whereas high-angle shots make the subject look more vulnerable.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.000
Over the period of a day the light changes dramatically as the sun moves across the sky.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.100
Shadows change length and the colour of the light moves from bluish through to very bright and white.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Cloud cover also affects colour, brightness and shadows.
