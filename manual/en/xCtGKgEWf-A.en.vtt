I've been wanting to customize my plain keys
for awhile now. I finally decided to paint

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.320
them which makes it easy to tell them apart.
I want to show you guys my process and share

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.110
some ways you can customize your keys too.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.750
Nail polish is a quick and easy way to decorate
your key. Just paint it on the top portion.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.519
Paint two coats if you need to.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.519
A spool of thread makes a nice holder for
your key dry.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.010
If you don't have many colors of nail polish,
you can try acrylic paint too. I'm making

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.010
a stripe pattern using tape for this one.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.590
After it's all dry, put a clear top coat nail polish on to make it durable.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.729
Another option is to use a sharpie to make
your design. I'm going to make a leopard print

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.729
pattern on this one.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.040
For designs made with a sharpie, use a clear acrylic varnish to help seal in your design, otherwise the sharpie ink will rub off. Don't use clear nail polish

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.090
on sharpie ink though, it will make the ink
smudge and bleed.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.890
Make sure to let the keys dry for a few hours
or overnight.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.320
I hope you have fun customizing your own keys!
