Welcome back to Summit Racing Quick Flicks
I'm Al.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:24.400
Today we are going to talk about shocks specifically,
twin tube design versus mono tube design.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.290
On the outward appearance it's difficult to
tell the difference between a mono tube and

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.160
twin tube shock design but on the inside you
are going to be able to tell that they are

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.390
quite different.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.660
Take a mono tube design for example.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.780
It's a single cylinder that is filled with
a fluid that the piston moves up and down

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.220
in the fluid and on the end is a gas filled
chamber that absorbs the shock of the fluid

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.720
as the piston moves up and down.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.239
In a twin tube design there is two tubes and
the piston moves up and down in the fluid

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.780
in the inner chamber and the outer chamber
acts as a reservoir to again absorb the shock

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.689
of the fluid as the piston moves up and down.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.439
So what are the pros and cons of these two
different designs?

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.130
Well in a twin tube design, it's a low pressure
dampening system which tends to lead towards

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.810
a softer rid, now because its low pressure
under a heavy cornering you may get some unwanted

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.610
body roll and because the fluid and the gas
are not kept separate, under frequent cycling

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.439
of your suspension, the two may combine and
your going to get cavitation which means the

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.189
fluid is no longer going to support the piston
as it moves up and down.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.259
And the twin tube shock design has to be mounted
in the up right position.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.929
In comparison, the mono tube shock design,
it can be mounted in any direction and because

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.069
the fluid and the gas are kept separate, there
is less of a chance of cavitation.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.999
The mono tube shock design is more of a high
pressure dampening system so you are going

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.689
to get a little more of a firmer ride and
the valving in this shocks tends to be a little

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.289
bit more consistent.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.939
So I would love to hear what type of shocks
you prefer on your ride.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.030
