00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
*read the text on the screen.*

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.100
So, today I'm gonna be talking about something I really don't like.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.820
That's right, nosy people!

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.440
*comedically timed silence*

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.020
What, no intro for this one?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.920
*more silence*

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.740
Guess not. So one day, I was pretty-

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.140
*perfectly timed but extremely rude cutaway*

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.320
*disctinct "YOUU!"*

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.640
*intro continues as scheduled-ish*

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.020
No, because nobody wants to live in a world without cookies!

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.300
OFF THE PILL - WITH RYAN HIGA. This episode: Nosy People.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.800
*and Glitchmaster as caption artist*

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.820
So that was rude.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.900
Anyway, so like I said earlier, I'm gonna be talking about nosy people, and that really irritates me.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.960
*another silence*

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.660
The- The nosy people irritate me, not the talking about it.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.500
*I didn't think there would be this much silence*

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.760
So, like any other average day, I was in my room talking to myself, when all of a sudden...

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.920
Ryan: Hi, Ryan! Ryan: Hi!

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.120
Non-Grammar Ryan: How is me doing?

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.680
Non-Grammar Ryan: Me is good! How is I?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.240
"I am good!" "Good!"

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.560
*door opens to reveal Nosy Ryan*

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.820
Nosy Ryan: "Hey guys, what am I talking about?"

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.820
Standing Ryan: "Nothing!" Chair Ryan: "It's none of my business!"

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.720
"OK!" *eases out of conversation by closing door*

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.900
Ok, maybe it didn't happen EXACTLY like that, but see how irritating nosy people are?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.480
You know what people I'm talking about, right?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.080
It's those people that you weren't even talking to you,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.680
but they try to sneak into your conversation

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.200
because they think that they know that they know what you're talking about, when actually they know that we know that they know that they don't know what we're talking about, you know?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.120
*Know count: 8*

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.940
You know what, it might be easier if I just show you an example. Take a look.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.220
Chair Ryan: "Dude, that guy definitely farted, didn't he?"

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.780
Standing Ryan: "He did." Chair Ryan: "He did!

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.060
I heard it!" Standing Ryan: "I could smell it."

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.660
Chair Ryan: "I could smell ass from my seat!" Standing Ryan: "I know!"

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.660
Chair Ryan: "He tried to cover it up with his 'it's my belching, I'm photosynth.." *I have no idea what he's saying*

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.800
*Nosy Ryan pops up* Huh-huh, yeah!

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.640
"Was that what happened? Was that?"

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.700
"Was that?" *Nosy Ryan gets a 6x combo on 'Was that'*

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.380
You nosy people, stay home. Nobody likes you!

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.760
Go talk to your cat or something.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.960
And I know it may seem like I'm overreacting, but I have to deal with nosy people EVERY FREAKING DAY.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.880
Like when I went to the market earlier...

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.700
Cashieryan: "Ooh, I see you got the marshmallows, nice choice!"

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.640
Ryan: *sigh* *shakes head*

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.480
Cashieryan: "Alright, that'll be $42.99, will that be cash or credit?"

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.280
Ryan: *sighs again*

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.200
Cashieryan: "I'm gonna say credit."

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.820
"And one last thing, would you like paper or plastic?"

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.220
Ryan: "You son of a bi-"

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.000
And then after, I went to go get some food...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.420
Waiteryan: "Hi, can I take your order?"

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.020
Ryan: "No."

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.920
And then later, when I found out I was dying...

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.860
Ryan: "Oh my god, I'm dying!"

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.440
Dying Ryan: "Call 911!"

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.780
*braaang*

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.320
911 Responder: "911, what's your emergency?"

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.420
Ryan: "Wouldn't you like to know?"

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
*slams phone down* "Nosy bi-"

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.060
See how nosy the world can be?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.400
But let me tell you, the nosiest of all people have got to be

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.140
parents.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800
"What time are you gonna be home?" "Where are you going?" "Did you take out the trash?"

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.120
"Why didn't you take it out?" "What's the capital of Thailand?" "Did you just fart?" "Who's your daddy?"

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.640
And my favorite question of all, "How's your day?"

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.700
"You wanna know how my day was? You wanna know how MY. DAY. WAS?"

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.120
*dramatic buildup* "It was alright."

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.740
But seriously, for all you nosy people out there,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.280
I hope you know that we know that you don't know what we know, so stop pretending like you know even though you don't.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.460
Because every time you pretend you know what you know even though you don't know what you know, you're just lessening the value of knowing.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.440
And if you keep lessening the value of knowing, then pretty soon we're not gonna have no know, and if we have no know, then how are we supposed to know when no means no?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.520
You know what I'm getting at?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.060
"No." Exactly.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.782
Final "know" count: 23
