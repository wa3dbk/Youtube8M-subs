00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.560
 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.139
 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.900
Hi everyone. So we're going to try and help out a PlayStation gamer today

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.180
who's based in the UK and has found himself falling foul of Sony's ban

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.690
hammer.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.810
And from the way it's been described, it
certainly sounds to me like he's fallen

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.360
foul of a software bug

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.830
which unfortunately has led him to, well,
have all of his

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.910
PlayStation account banned which unfortunately includes his PlayStation 3 his PlayStation 4 and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.950
his PlayStation Vita.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.989
So let's quickly run through what happened to this poor chap.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.559
So he was playing Final Fantasy 10 on his 
PlayStation 3

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.739
and his friend asked him to chat. So instead of coming out of the  game and into

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.499
the chat system he got his Vita and was going to chat

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.589
using that. Now his Vita asked him to run
an update and that's where his problems

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:51.239
started.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.019
When he had run the update and it logged  back in  it

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.199
then when he tried to go to the chat system  asked him to log back in again in. In

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.249
attempting to log back in on his Vita

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.239
it then said his account had been banned. He
thought, oh, that's really unusual maybe

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.600
it's a

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.920
glitch so he logged out on his PS3, tried to login

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.969
and was banned. And having spoken to Sony  he has

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.009
a rather interesting story really. To begin with  they basically

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.340
said that he's been banned

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.170
and he's been permanently banned for invalidation of terms of service.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.840
Now his friend spoke to Sony who then gave
a slightly different story

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.000
saying that it might very well have been the PS Vita update

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.109
and he should try taking out his memory card
reinstalling the update and seeing if

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.229
that makes a difference and  unfortunately that made no difference and

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.210
he's still permanently banned. Now unfortunately Sony's customer service here seems to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.549
be

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.450
absolutely useless I think I would say.
Given the scenario we're dealing with here.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.609
Run firmware update, attempt to login,
permanently banned immediately

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.329
was fine before running the update. Any excuses Sony seem to be giving here

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.509
seem to be just from their

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.600
excuses playbook. They seem to be blaming this guy saying that someone had

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.679
hacked his account

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.780
and he, because he didn't tell them that his
account had been hacked

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.079
this other dodgy machine, supposedly.
Not that Sony have proved there's another

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.380
dodgy machine might I add in this scenario

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.940
has led him to be banned. Well my query there would be how can somebody

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.250
know their account has been hacked

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.120
and is running on a dodgy console if Sony's system doesn't tell you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.459
which consoles you currently are running on
and certainly doesn't give you any kind of

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.819
warning that oh, this other account has been logged in?

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.450
Or this same account has been logged in
on a new device.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.239
It does strike me that there's a dodgy firmware

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.150
issue here and Sony really need to help this guy out a little bit.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.510
He's been a PlayStation gamer since I think  2007 when he

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.629
registered his accounts, 150 friends 11,000
trophies

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.780
and he's owned every PlayStation product
that Sony have ever made.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.900
This is the kind of guy who's a core
gamer and maybe the benefit of the doubt

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.930
should be given here.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.959
Certainly with the scenario he seems to be suggesting

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.310
this does seem to be a software issue, an account

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.420
glitch within the Sony network. If

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.450
they can prove, can Sony, that it's a dodgy console

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.879
well fine, you should be able to prove it wasn't this chap that logged in on it

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.780
because presumably it would be a different IP address. Likewise when

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.480
the gentleman's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.620
offered Sony to send him the PlayStation Vita

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.290
the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4 so
that Sony can confirm there is no dodgy

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.040
firmware on

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.269
any of the equipment he personally owns, Sony have refused.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.500
Not only is this atrocious customer service from Sony

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.709
but it kind of flies in the face of well, Sony's gamer

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.040
credentials. They're meant to be all about
gamers here yet they've just killed

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.590
somebody's accounts that's what nearly
eight-years-old?

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.650
That's really unacceptable. Now this guy's in the UK which is why I'm mentioning

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.700
it and there's also a petition up now on
change.org where you can read through the full

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.780
scenario of what happened to  this poor chap and throw your

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.030
weight into it. For my part, I'm going to contact Sony's PR department and flag this with

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.420
them

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.629
because normally you're dealing with customer service people reading

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:56.420
from a script

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.170
and it sounds like they've given this poor
chap a bit of a runaround. So I'll

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.439
drop a note over to Sony's PlayStation PR
people in the UK

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.640
and we'll see if we can get this escalated a bit quicker.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.409
Obviously, what you guys can do is make
sure as many people as possible

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.450
know what happened to this chap, in part
in case other people have suffered exactly

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.959
the same problem with this firmware update,

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.109
but also so that we can just get Sony's attention a little bit quicker

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.210
and whatever's going on within their customer service side of things here

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.580
really does need tightening up. I think a little bit of

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.729
more open communication between Sony and
people who find themselves banned in

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.320
this way

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.250
would be a really good idea. At the moment this is poor customer service Sony.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.590
 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.570
It seems to be a case of computer says
banned and that's the end of it.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.759
Well as we all know computers are
infallible. Sony's network is

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.850
computers are fallible, Sony's network is
fallible and ultimately Sony's firmware

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.280
updates

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.910
are very very fallible. I don't believe this is the first time we've seen this kind of issue

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.430
occur.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.530
So visit the link on change.org. Register your vote as

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.310
a petition against Sony for this one and let's see if we can get this chap's

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.750
account

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.780
unbanned before the end of the weekend shall
we?
