00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.600
Now, I'm going to do the eye shadow for the
lid. This is where we're going to start out

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.540
with our really metallic silver. After we
put the base on and we have a nice pallet

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.789
to work with I'm really going to pile on the
silver. The silver is bright but it's not

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.230
dark so you really don't have to be afraid
of putting on a lot of it. We're going to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:26.430
put it all over the eye, we're going to do
a really dramatic look. I'm taking a pretty

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.080
small brush and, I'm just going to dip right
into the silver. I'm going to put it on a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:48.149
little at a time, and it's going to go on
pretty metallic, but you just want to put

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.469
on a little at a time, so not to overdo it
at first. Kind of gauge what the color is

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.040
going to look like. You want to keep it right
on the lid. So basically the lid of the eye

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.070
is the ball of the eye where the eye protrudes.
So you just want to keep it right on the lid,

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030
and you don't want to take it much further
than the crease, because again you want to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.020
keep it highlighted under the brow. If you
want to keep it natural just do one sheer

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
coat of silver. If you want to be a little
more dramatic, like I do. Just keep adding

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.409
and adding, just make sure it's all blended.
I also want to take a little bit and go right

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.430
underneath the eye too. If you're doing a
dramatic look you really want to pile on the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.180
silver. To look really dramatic, like very
metallic. Which is a very in look actually

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.719
for this year, very metallic look. It's very
in. Now just blend, blend, blend. Make sure

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:58.350
you get it nice and blended really be patient
when your putting on your colors. And there

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.960
we go, there is our metallic silver.
