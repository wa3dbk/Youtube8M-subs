Peter Jaworski:
College football is big business.

00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:15.030
This 
is Nick Saban.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.130
In 2013, he made north of $5 million dollars.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.520
Kirby Smart, his assistant coach?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.679
He made a comparatively meager $1.1 million
dollars.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.750
You know, the ushers get paid, the guys who
help the athletes do this get paid, the people

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.560
who sell merchandise make money.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.990
Everyone gets paid in dollars and cents--everyone,
that is, except for the 18 year olds.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:47.710
They tackle each other in war without killing,
risking injury, concussions… health consequences

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.763
that last for the rest of their lives.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:57.140
And all for a meager, tiny, infinitesimal
chance to maybe make the NFL, or more realistically,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.240
become a part of Tuscaloosa’s football lore.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.790
Why shouldn’t these college gladiators get
paid?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.740
The most common reason given by the NCAA and
others is that paying student athletes would

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.999
corrupt them.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:16.750
It would undermine the values and virtues
of amateurism in sport.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.992
Amateurism is the idea that you should pursue
an activity for love of the activity, and

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:24.259
not for the love of money.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.070
[grunts as he tackles a dummy]
But why should remuneration be thought to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.439
have a corrupting effect?

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.850
We pay professors and teachers like me, and
hardly anybody worries about the corrupting

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.579
influence of money in teaching.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.189
Is it not possible to play football while
getting five dollars for an autograph, or

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.350
maybe wearing a sponsor on your jersey?

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.509
But if opponents are so worried about the
corrupting power of money, why is the coaching

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.119
staff immune from it?

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.549
Or how about the president of the NCAA?

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.740
This year Mark Emmert will make a cool $1.7
million dollars.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.990
Why is it consistent with the goals of amateurism
for everyone surrounding the athletes to make

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.710
money except for those student athletes?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.149
It makes no sense!

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.680
In a particularly cruel twist, college athletes
get scholarships.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.470
And scholarships are in themselves a form
of payment.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.700
It’s just that the NCAA, they’ve instituted
a salary cap.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.879
A particularly low salary in an industry that
rakes in about $875 million dollars per year.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.239
You know, somebody’s getting paid--it’s
just not the athletes.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.540
Love of sport and making money at it are not
incompatible.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.810
College athletes should be paid.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:47.560
Maybe they can take me out for a fancy dinner
for making this video.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.860
Roll tide!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.819
Tim:
Hey guys!

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.420
My name is Tim, I’m a video producer here
at Learn Liberty, and I make videos like the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
one you just saw.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.849
But the reason I’m here is ‘cause I want
to invite you to join me and a lot of other

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.849
people in something called Learn Liberty Academy,
where we take these little videos to the next

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.849
level.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.480
So click here, or here.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.450
Actually, here, here, here, or here, or here.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
Any of those boxes will do.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.760
The point is, click on one of them, it’s
gonna be frickin’ awesome, I promise.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.730
Come hang out with us, join our community.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.840
Yeah, it’s gonna be great.
