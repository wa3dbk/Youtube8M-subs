00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Speak slow

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400
I know that you're weak so

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000
How am I to keep going

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Strong enough for both

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Deep depression while you sleep

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Obsessing with a dream

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Insisting you're alone

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Don't need to be bulletproof

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
But it sure wouldn't hurt you to fake it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You break at the touch

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Tear at the seams

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Turning to dust in front of me

[Guitar Riff]

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.680
Worthless just like every word is

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.000
Harder to interpret

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Softer that their spoke

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Breathe

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Just tell me what you need

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You're something more than cold

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Won't end till ya see it through

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But your eyes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Are a light shade of vacant

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.000
You break at the touch

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000

No not if I wanted to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It won't let me

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Go

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.000
You've got to admire fire

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That garners your father's ire

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But this burns

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Deeper than I go

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Don't need to be bulletproof

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But it sure wouldn't hurt you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
To fake it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You break at the touch

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tear at the seams

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.500
