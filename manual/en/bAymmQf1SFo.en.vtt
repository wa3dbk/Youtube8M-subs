00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.780
HiLight Tag is a convenient new feature of
the HERO4 cameras that lets you tag specific

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.540
moments while recording to make it easier
to find them later for playback, editing,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.120
and sharing. With HiLight Tag you can mark
specific moments in your video, right as they

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.820
happen. Once you capture an epic moment, tag
it. Let's cover the three easy ways you can

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.500
do just that.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.000
First, let's talk about adding
HiLight Tags from the camera. While recording video,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.540
press the Settings/Tag button on the
side of the camera. Each time a tag is added,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.140
HiLight Tagged will appear on the front and back
displays. Next, you can add HiLight Tags using

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.420
the Smart Remote, a GoPro accessory that lets
you control multiple GoPro cameras from distances

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.100
of up to 600 feet. While recording, press
the Settings/Tag button on the Smart Remote

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.680
to add a HiLight Tag. It's as simple as that.
This is a great way to tag an epic moment

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.820
when the camera itself is out of reach. Finally,
you can tag moments using the GoPro App. Similar

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.860
to the Smart Remote, you can use the App to
add a HiLight Tag, even when you don't have

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.060
the camera in-hand. While recording, tap the
HiLight Tag icon in the App to tag the moment.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.280
After you're finished filming, there are three
ways to view your HiLight Tags. One, HERO4

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.960
Silver's Touch Display, or the LCD BacPac
used with HERO4 Black. Two, the GoPro App.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.600
Or, three, GoPro Studio Software. On the camera's
display or using an LCD Touch BacPac, HiLight Tags

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.310
show up in your GoPro camera roll. Just
tap playback mode and any tagged videos will

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.680
be indicated by the HiLight Tag icon. In the
GoPro App, a video's tagged moment will show

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.549
up in the playback bar of that clip. And in
GoPro Studio, tagged clips will display the

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.640
HiLight Tag icon as well as the markers in
the playback bar, making it easier than ever

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.630
to find those incredible GoPro moments. As
you know, not every trick, every lap, and every

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.470
moment is created equal. You need to be able
to find those true HiLight Reel worthy moments

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.950
quickly, and now you can. Whether you want
to share them right away, or dial in your

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.980
edit using GoPro Studio later on, HiLight
Tag will make the task more convenient than

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.000
ever before.
