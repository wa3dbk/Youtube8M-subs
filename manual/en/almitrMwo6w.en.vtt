00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.250
What do you think is wrong with Terry?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Yeah I don't think she's ever matured.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.250

She can't do anything on her own.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.170
She's always relying on everyone. She's not independent. She needs to grow up.

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:40.523

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
So like when we are at school, and we're hanging out 
 with our friends, you're there--we just can't see you?

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:16.925

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
There's another TV upstairs. Go play it upstairs!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
