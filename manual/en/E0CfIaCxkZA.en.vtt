00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:30.549
*Wistling*

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.250
Hello and welcome to SilentPhill's new let's plays of

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:48.115
NO MORE HEROES!

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:50.989
To start off,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.478
we will explain a few of the game's mechanics.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.700
Part 1: Combat!

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:00.725
These will be explained during the games tutorials!

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.358
Oh! Uh... then Part 2: Game Flow!

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:07.732
Some call it repetative, I call it fun!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.633
First you get an invoice with an increasing

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.660
amount of cash after every assassination!

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.595
These are the entrance fees you must

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:18.115
pay in order to proceed to the next mark!

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.391
What the f...

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.390
Second! That being said, you must find

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.391
ways to earn the money!

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:26.264
Be it with part time jobs,

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:27.635
assassination gigs,

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:30.800
or free fight missions!

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.095
Which will all be explained as they

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:35.350
they come up throughout the game!

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.160
Third! After you have aquired the amount needed,

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.225
which you will be told when you do,

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:45.410
you must deposit the cash into an ATM...

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.190
and how that money is put into an ATM,

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.485
I do not know!

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:52.595
Fourth! When you head back to your hotel,

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.387
a hot, sexy, blond lady will call you with

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.845
all the yummy, bloody, juicy details!

00:01:58.301 --> 00:01:59.655
Sylvia: Hello Travis.

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:01.815
*Moan*

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.338
Fifth! When you make it to the specified marker,

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:05.850
you must first fight your way through

00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.361
your target's small fry!

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.337
Does not matter how, just as long

00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:11.601
as you leave no one behind alive!

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.287
Note that there are, however,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.870
times when you can skip enemies

00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.330
to make it to the next area.

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:27.287
However, you won't get paid for skipped enemies,

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:30.115
and plus, less blood equals

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:31.685
NO FUN!

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.888
Sixth! Fight the cold-hearted bastard you came

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.592
to see, and give him or her a kiss... of death!

00:02:38.593 --> 00:02:41.444
You will then rank up and must repeat all steps

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.385
again for the next rank!

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:46.530
Part 3: Items and Upgrades!

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.297
There are many items and upgrades to

00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:50.413
collect throughout the game,

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:52.595
however I will explain what they are

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.615
when they come up as well!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.815
Oh! Uh... then Part 4: Locations!

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.120
Same deal with the locations!

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:09.256
Ah! Oh. So, then, just get on with the game then?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.791
Yes! On with the game!

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:18.990
Travis: I know a lot of gamers out there

00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:20.225
don't have much patience.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:21.540
Least that's what Bishop,

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.190
the dude at the video store, said.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.032
So I'm at the register, and then I realize

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:28.620
I got no money.

00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.000
I was seriously broke.

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:31.411
Why?

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.230
'Cause I met this smokin' hot chick last night

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:35.680
at the Death-Match bar.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.419
Man, she smelled good!

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:40.409
So being the gentleman I am, 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.976
I bought her a drink.

00:03:41.977 --> 00:03:44.450
Anyhoo, I decided to get a job.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.978
The gig: Assassinate the Drifter.

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:50.355
So I went where I was supposed to

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:51.995
and waited for the guy to show up.

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.342
And there he was. This cat.

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:55.835
Well dressed, cool.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.662
Couldn't tell if he was "the shit,"

00:03:57.663 --> 00:03:59.115
or just plain old shit.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.870
Yeah, so he's stylin', fast, aggresssive,

00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:03.962
and packin' heat. Bada Bing!

00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:06.055
Or at least it was supposed to be...

00:04:06.443 --> 00:04:08.077
'Till she showed up.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.955
Her name: Sylvia Christel.

00:04:10.956 --> 00:04:13.615
An agent with this whatchamacallit association.

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:15.197
Sylvia: Congratulations.

00:04:15.198 --> 00:04:18.685
You are certified as the 11th-best hit man.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:22.300
How about getting rid of the ten killers above 

00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:24.338
you and aim for the top?

00:04:26.848 --> 00:04:29.835
Travis: I wanna be number one. How's that?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.508
Short and simple enough for ya?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.468
It's gonna be a long, hard road.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:36.640
But who knows?

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.120
Could kick ass...

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:39.765
Could be dangerous.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.935
Could totally suck.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.005
Whaddaya say, bro? Join me.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:47.123
Let's see how far we can take this.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:50.372
And for you there holding the Wii remote right now;

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.105
just press the 'A' button.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:53.980
Let the bloodshed begin!

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.460
Me: Oh yeah and just to let you know,

00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:01.605
this is rated mature, so for you kids

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:04.585
out there that aren't into blood, and cussing,

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:05.586
and all that stuff...

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.145
you know, you can just turn away if you want.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:18.937
Travis: Fuckhead! (Told you!)

00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:22.052
Me: Best... intro line... ever!

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.823
Travis: Yo, help me out here.

00:05:27.824 --> 00:05:29.654
Where's this Death Metal dude?

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:31.800
Guard: He-he-he-elp!

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:33.343
Travis: Bad answer.

00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:42.921
It's game time!
