00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.500
How to Make a Summer Flower Arrangement.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.180
Summertime, and the living is easy—so why
not the flower arranging?

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.480
Capture the spirit of the season with bright
colors, casual containers, and an easy, breezy

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.480
attitude.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.730
You will need A casual vase or container Some
cool water A variety of summer flowers A pair

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.640
of gardening shears or scissors Some flower
food or bleach and sugar And a flat surface

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.270
and a smaller, plastic container (optional).

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.410
Step 1.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.070
Choose a casual container that fits the feel
of summer in your location— an earthenware

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.510
pitcher, colorful jar, painted bucket, wicker
basket—anything that conveys a lighthearted

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.040
and laid-back summer vibe.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.579
If the container you choose won't hold water,
place a smaller plastic container—like a

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.630
yogurt or cottage cheese container—inside
it.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.630
Step 2.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.160
Fill the container halfway with cool water.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.100
Step 3.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.750
Add some flower food to the water and set
the container aside.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.549
If you don't have flower food, add a few drops
of bleach and 1 teaspoon of sugar per quart

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.549
of water.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.920
This will provide nutrients for the flowers
and rid the water of any bacteria.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
Step 4.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.270
Place the shortest greens and flowers in your
container first, trimming their stems one

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270
at a time to create a range of heights.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.850
They shouldn't be a uniform length—a summer
arrangement should mimic the unpredictability

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.409
of flowers growing wild.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.270
For the best summer wildflower effect, use
flowers picked from nearby fields and meadows.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.270
Step 5.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.330
Fill in your arrangement with gradually taller
flowers and branches, trimming them to various

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.299
heights, until you've created a wild, abundant,
overgrown effect.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.529
Step 6.

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.520
Change the water daily to keep your arrangement
fresh.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.209
Did you know Xeriscaping is a method of landscaping
with native wildflowers that conserves water,

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.929
reduces the use of fertilizers and pesticides,
and costs less than traditional lawn and garden

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.409
maintenance.
