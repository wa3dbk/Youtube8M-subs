Hi, my name is Annaliese Dayes from America's
Next Top Model and welcome back to Celebeauty

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.760
on VideoJug Beauty.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.139
From Disney Princess to edgy pop princess
we have no problem understanding why we receive

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.870
so many requests on You Tube to recreate Miley
Cyrus's style.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.699
So, that is exactly what we are going to do
today.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:23.699
[Music]

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.460
Miley Cyrus loves the grungy casual look and
outfit number one definitely shows that.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.129
First up, we have these crystal print leggings
from Forever 21 at 8.75.

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.469
They are quite psychedelic, mess with your
eyes slightly, but at the same time exceptionally

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:39.559
comfortable.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.149
Miley Cyrus is very young and she likes to
get a little bit risque and we have done that

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.260
with this black triangle bra from Urban Outfitters
at fourteen pounds.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.079
It is by the brand Kamichi.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.079
It is very comfortable.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.579
There is no underwiring and you will get a
little glimpse of it underneath the top that

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.579
you are wearing.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.589
And this speckled top is what we are going
to throw on over that triangle bra and get

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.769
that great slouchy effect.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.520
Miley Cyrus is all about comfort and this
top with the low sleeves and neck line is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520
great.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.439
Now Doc Martens are a staple piece to any
Miley Cyrus outfit.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.049
Now these are from Dr. Martens themselves
and are ninety pounds.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.850
These are the modern classic eight eye patent
boots.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.549
These are the ultimate grunge classic and
vintage piece; a statement piece for any outfit.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.200
To complete this outfit we have gone for this
bracelet from New Look at 5.99.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.899
It is cream and gold and it has got these
gorgeous pyramid spikes to it, perfect for

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.020
any rock chick like Miley Cyrus herself.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.480
Look two, is definitely more of a grungy summer
look.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.380
A little bit more skin on show.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.469
Miley loves a crop top and this one is from
Topshop at eight pounds.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.600
Loving the sleavelessness and the kind of
stretchiness too.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.820
Miley has got a great figure and this is the
perfect way to show this off.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.590
To pair up with the white top we have got
these white Levi cut off jeans.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.829
They are forty-five pounds.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.600
Levi's is the ultimate classic.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.210
I'm loving the ripped bottom and the little
detailing around there as well.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.970
And to keep those high waisted shorts up,
we have got this classic brown leather belt

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.860
from Urban Outfitters at twenty-five pounds.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.210
This is one of those classic belts.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.050
It is simple and timeless and goes with anything.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.660
This is a check shirt and it is by ASOS and
it is by the brand Avila.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.690
It was originally thirty pounds, but is now
in the sale for twenty.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.470
Miley loves to wear this around her waist
or simply chucked over a simple tee.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.280
These great boots are fifty-five pounds.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.420
They are from ASOS and by the brand Absence.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.160
They are biker boots with this great buckle
detailing as well as the zip as well.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.800
And to add in a bit of accessories, we have
got this twenty-five pound necklace from ASOS

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.440
by the brand Made.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.140
This necklace is definitely very unique.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.140
There is some chain.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.790
There is rope and even some charms hanging
off of it.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.360
And to finish off her super star look, we
have got this New Look, round tortoise shell

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.830
glasses at 4.99.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.700
I definitely feel like a celebrity and I am
loving this retro look.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.810
