00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.067
In a previous lecture we talked
about the storm tracks and how

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.200
they developed, how fast they
develop, and where they go,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.400
those were the storm tracks.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.967
Now let's talk about
points of cyclogenesis.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:39.900
Here we have the Pacific Ocean,
we have the Rocky Mountains, we

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.900
have the Great Plains, and then
we have the Mississippi River

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.500
here, and then we have the
midwest, and then Appalacian

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Mountains, and then
end up with the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.267
Coastal Plain, and
then the Atlantic.

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:58.233
So let me go ahead
and label these,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:06.133
the Pacific, and the Atlantic.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:12.433
And in between we've got the
Rockies, these are the Rockies,

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:21.233
and then the Mississippi, and
the Appalacian Mountains.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.433
Okay, so what we're dealing with
here is topography, and points

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.767
of cyclogenesis.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.500
Now we've talked about the
Alberta Clipper, and the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.933
Colorado Low, and
the Inside Leader.

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:38.600
What we have if you kind of
looked at that map that we had

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.300
in the previous video lecture,
all of those points began on the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.467
eastern side of the Rockies.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:51.133
So as the air descends, the
Rockies on the eastern side, it

00:01:51.133 --> 00:02:00.933
warms and will force
cyclogenesis to occur.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:04.600
These are the points of strong
cyclogenesis where the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.167
midlatitude cyclone will form.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:12.833
Now as it comes, we see in maps
that the midlatitude cyclone

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:18.367
does move from the Pacific Ocean
into the United States.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:23.400
As it does, it dissipates
because it's changing, it's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.467
forced to weaken because the
change in topography.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.933
Alright, so then when that
system hits the Rockies,

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.733
it's already dissipated.

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:39.200
Then, east of the Rockies, we
have cyclogenesis occurs,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.900
at particular points.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.200
Now the averages are Alberta,
Canada, Colorado, the Colorado

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.233
Low, and the Four
Corners region.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.300
So we have cyclogenesis
that begins here.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.733
As it progresses to the east
across the Great Plains

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:58.367
and into the midwest, it
continues to develop

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:01.233
and intensify if you will.

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.467
Once it hits the Appalachian
Mountains, there's a bit of a

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:10.900
weakness to its development, so
it will kind of weaken,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.633
dissipate a little
bit, but then once it

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:16.000
goes past the Appalachian
Mountains, it

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.267
redevelops, it
intensifies again.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:22.633
And if you're in the New England
area, or New York Boston area,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:26.367
sometimes we refer to these
redeveloping systems as

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:31.600
noreasters, a very gusty
wind storm systems.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.533
Another point of cyclogenesis
would be, not as intense as the

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:40.467
Rocky Mountain
cyclogenesis but here

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.800
east of Appalachian Mountains.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.567
This would be another
point of cyclogenesis,

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:51.300
but this is going to be weak.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.433
This is going to be strong.

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:59.033
Strong cyclogenesis east of the
Rockies, weak cyclogenesis east

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:03.767
of the Appalachian Mountains,
and in particular we call this,

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:07.167
not for this particular class,
but we call this the Hatter's

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.933
Low, it develops in the
Hatter's region of the

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:14.000
eastern coast of
the United States.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.367
So in essence, the development
of the midlatitude cyclone is

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:21.867
based on the topography.

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.600
So if we did not have these
mountains here in the United

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.100
States at all, then we could
expect that cyclogenesis would

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.533
not occur because we don't have
the changes in elevation.

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:41.700
The changes in elevation cause
cyclogenesis to occur.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:05:02.100
