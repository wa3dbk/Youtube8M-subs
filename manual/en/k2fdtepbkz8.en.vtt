00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.139
(jazz music)

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.770
Dr. Zucker: We're in the Etruscan Museum

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.471
in the Vatican Museums
in Rome and we're looking

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.904
at my favorite pot in the entire world.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:15.936
Dr. Harris: I can see why
it's your favorite pot.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.837
It seems to almost glow.

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.472
Dr. Zucker: The thing
that makes it so fabulous

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:21.357
is we have these two heroes and we have

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.188
a very simple image, but it's giving us

00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:25.607
so much information.

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:28.440
Dr. Harris: The heroes
are Achilles on the left

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.327
and Ajax on the right, two
of the great Greek heroes

00:00:31.327 --> 00:00:35.856
featured in Homer's Iliad
and Exekias, the potter,

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:40.189
who signed only two pots as
the potter and the painter,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.391
has identified these two
figures by including their names

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:46.893
above them, but he's also
telling us what's happening

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:48.059
between the two.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.284
Achilles on the left is
saying the word "four".

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:53.593
Dr. Zucker: You can see "tesara".

00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:56.226
Dr. Harris: And on the right, we see Ajax,

00:00:56.226 --> 00:00:57.826
saying "three".

00:00:57.826 --> 00:00:58.761
Dr. Zucker: "Tri".

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.526
Dr. Harris: We know immediately
that Achilles is winning

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.201
the game that they're playing.

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.659
Dr. Zucker: But this is,
of course, a metaphor

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.092
for the way that this myth will unfold.

00:01:07.092 --> 00:01:09.878
Dr. Harris: On either
side we see their shields.

00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:12.379
Achilles still has his
helmet on, although Ajax

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:14.512
has taken his off.

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:17.560
A moment of relaxation between battles.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.428
Dr. Zucker: They're on
the battlefield of Troy,

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:21.593
but Exekias has given
us even more information

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:24.494
than this, not simply
the rolls of the dice,

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:27.011
but in a larger sense, their fate.

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:29.959
Look at the way, for
example, that both figures

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.459
are hunched over and clearly focused

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.959
on the game at hand.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.227
Remember, these two men
are really close friends,

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:39.595
so there's an intimacy here, brotherhood.

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:42.760
Nevertheless, Achilles,
who has the higher roll,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.345
is holding his spears loosely.

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:47.011
You can see the way the points
are actually separating.

00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:48.760
At the bottom, you can see from the lines,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.678
they're not as parallel, but
look at the figure on the right,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:55.595
Ajax, whose spears are held
in a more parallel way,

00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:57.511
so that we know that
he's actually clenching

00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:59.595
with his fist, he's tense.

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.518
Dr. Harris: I even sense a
little bit of that tension

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:02.928
in his brow.

00:02:02.928 --> 00:02:03.595
Dr. Zucker: That's right.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.994
If you look at the brow
really closely, you can see

00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:09.795
that Achilles has a single
incised line to represent

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:13.329
his eyebrow, but Ajax has a double line

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.012
and it is a subtle clue that
perhaps there's a little bit

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:16.996
of tension there.

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:19.178
One other detail that can be easily seen,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:21.510
although it's really
subtle, look at the feet

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.010
of both figures.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.678
Achilles, again, is relaxed.

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:28.846
His heel is on the ground
line, but Ajax, his heel

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:31.626
is picked up ever so
slightly, so you can see

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:34.896
just a little bit of light
underneath it, which means

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.865
his calf is engaged,
those muscles are tense,

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.735
his body is tense.

00:02:39.735 --> 00:02:41.900
Dr. Harris: He's also a
little bit more hunched over.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.067
His head is a little bit lower than that

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.734
of his friend Achilles.

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.732
That does seem to mean something wider

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:50.617
than just this board game.

00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:51.850
Dr. Zucker: Anybody who
was looking at this pot

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.400
in the ancient world
would have known the story

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.382
of Ajax and Achilles that
Homer tells, as you said,

00:02:57.382 --> 00:02:58.533
in the Iliad.

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.317
Achilles is a great hero.

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:03.483
In fact, as a child, his mother dipped him

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.450
in the river Styx, which
had the magical quality

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.400
of making him invincible.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.810
It's just that she held him
by his heel, so his heel

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.698
was not protected and
ultimately, he would be killed

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:17.144
by an arrow that hits him there.

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:19.429
Dr. Harris: Hence the
term that we use often

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.394
of someone's Achilles heel,
that is their vulnerable spot.

00:03:23.394 --> 00:03:26.227
Dr. Zucker: Nevertheless,
Achilles will die a great hero.

00:03:26.227 --> 00:03:28.773
Ajax will have a more complicated fate.

00:03:28.773 --> 00:03:32.059
He will outlive Achilles, he
will carry his great friend

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.977
off the battlefield, but
ultimately, he'll be in a battle

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:37.810
for Achilles' armor.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.531
Dr. Harris: Achilles
had very special armor,

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.194
which had been made by the god Hephaestus,

00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:43.727
the god of the forge.

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:45.392
Dr. Zucker: Two people
would want that armor

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.296
and they would both give
speeches to convince judges

00:03:48.296 --> 00:03:50.808
as to who should get the armor, but Ajax,

00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:52.977
although he was much closer to Achilles,

00:03:52.977 --> 00:03:55.227
would lose the contest, have a bad moment

00:03:55.227 --> 00:03:57.866
where he slayed a bunch
of Greeks, and ultimately,

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:00.477
would kill himself on his own sword.

00:04:00.477 --> 00:04:02.477
Humiliation at the end of his life.

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:04.628
Dr. Harris: It's really
interesting to think about this

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:08.193
as an ancient Greek viewer
who knows that whole story

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:11.029
and what will unfold for
both of these heroes,

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.862
but the story is one thing
and the way that Exekias,

00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:16.599
the potter, has represented this moment

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.142
and these two figures
with so much nobility,

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:24.195
with such fine detail
in the shape of a vase,

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:26.930
which is so elegant, is something else.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.129
Dr. Zucker: Exekias really
was the great master

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.500
of attic black figure vase painting.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.617
These are black figures,
they are silhouettes.

00:04:34.617 --> 00:04:36.616
If you look closely, the decorative forms

00:04:36.616 --> 00:04:39.866
is mostly incised with a needle.

00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:42.450
Dr. Harris: And the black
surface is like paint,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.782
but it's not quite paint.

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:45.282
Dr. Zucker: This is slipware.

00:04:45.282 --> 00:04:47.738
The Greeks didn't have the
technology to get kilns,

00:04:47.738 --> 00:04:52.032
ovens hot enough to vitrify,
that is to create true glazes,

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:53.933
the way ceramics do now.

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:55.667
What they would do
instead is they would take

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:59.032
very fine particles of
clay, suspend them in water,

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:01.032
and use those as a kind of paint.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:03.198
Depending the amount of
oxygen that they allowed

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:06.099
into a kiln, they could
turn it black or red.

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.282
They would paint the
surface with this slip

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:09.782
and then they would burnish it.

00:05:09.782 --> 00:05:11.532
That is, they would take
a very smooth surface,

00:05:11.532 --> 00:05:14.832
imagine the back of a
spoon, and they would rub it

00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:16.616
back and forth so you get this surface

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:20.831
that is really glossy and
it almost looks like glaze.

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:23.667
Dr. Harris: When I look closely
at the decorative borders

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.902
on the handles or the
decorative border just above

00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:30.933
the (unintelligible) of figures,
I can see beautiful detail

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.101
and almost three
dimensional form of the slip

00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.534
is almost raised in areas,
so it catches the light.

00:05:36.534 --> 00:05:39.433
Dr. Zucker: The Greeks
did often use a syringe

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:42.616
to paint the finest
lines onto the surface,

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:45.568
so one could imagine,
almost, decorating a cake.

00:05:45.568 --> 00:05:47.950
You have a kind of syringe
and you have the icing

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.499
and it leaves a kind
of bead that is raised

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.785
against the surface and
at a much finer level,

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.290
that's what we're seeing here.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.367
Dr. Harris: So Exekias is a master.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:00.931
His pots stand out in so
many ways in their shape,

00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:04.066
in the painting, in the
detail, in the drama

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:05.699
that he was able to convey.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.737
Dr. Zucker: Certainly
the Etruscans thought

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:09.616
that was the case, because
they must have spent

00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:13.114
a good deal of money importing
this pot from Greece,

00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:15.333
across the Mediterranean,
all the way to the

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.532
Italian peninsula where they lived.

00:06:17.532 --> 00:06:20.782
So many of the great
pots from ancient Greece

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:23.737
are actually buried in Etruscan tombs.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:24.799
They were imported.

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:27.268
The Greeks did a tremendous
business exporting

00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:30.800
such pots, but Exekias was
one of the great masters.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800
