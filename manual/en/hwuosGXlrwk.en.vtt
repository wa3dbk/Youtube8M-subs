00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.930
With 11 seasons and five movies in the making,
the Naruto Shippuden series has been an astounding

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.610
success, winning over the hearts of nerds
in-training as well as a generation that grew

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.399
up with shows like Dragon Ball and Speed Racer.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.500
The combination of colorful ninja characters
and a thickening plot full of good guys, villains,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.979
and in-betweens hooks the imagination and
rarely releases its grip.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.201
The Naruto franchise, along with toymakers
turned game publishers Tomy Corporation, has

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:06.750
set its sights on the gaming community, and
in early 2011, released Naruto Shippuden:

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:24.140
Shinobi Rumble, a handheld fighting adventure
for the Nintendo DS.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.430
You'll be thrust into the riveting section
of Shippuden known as the Itachi Pursuit Arc,

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.820
where the shinobi of the Hidden Leaf Village,
along with Sasuke Uchiha who has just escaped

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.929
from Orochimaru's lair, are tracking down
Sasuke's enigmatic and evil older brother.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.100
I think it goes without saying that a large
part of this game lies in the storyline, but

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.140
as a guy that hasn't watched an episode of
Shippuden in my life, I was still intrigued,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:04.229
and the reason is two fold.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.610
Let's start with the fighting itself.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.090
If you've played the Ultimate Ninja games
that have been released as far back as the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
PS2, you'll already have a taste of what's
in store for you with Shinobi Rumble.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.170
After an explanation of the chapter, complete
with dialogue between notable characters of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.730
the series, you'll take control of the main
character.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.290
The battle takes place on the top screen and
your abilities include weak and strong taijutsu,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.950
a warp function that will help you escape
hairy situations in battle, a double jump,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.870
and of course, your special techniques.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:52.040
However, this feature, which should be the
most exciting factor in any battle, is not

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.300
necessarily Shinobi Rumble's greatest strength.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.490
The response time between tapping on your
touchscreen and the subsequent execution of

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.810
the ability can range from a quick execution
to repeated taps on the screen, wondering

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.430
why the damn ability won't activate.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.140
Also, the stoppage in battle in order for
a cutscene to play on the top screen can mess

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.070
up the continuity of the battle, and any fan
of good fighters knows that this is unacceptable.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.650
Still, it offers a point in the battle where
you can catch your breath and assess your

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:43.200
opponent for a few seconds.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.860
Dialogue in-between battles guides you through
the Itachi Pursuit Arc quite efficiently.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.840
The only beef I have with it is the lack of
voice dialogue.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.610
If the developers could have incorporated
all the voices from the show, there's no doubt

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.270
this game's stock would have gone up.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.270
If anything, Naruto Shippuden Shinobi Rumble
serves as an interactive story rather than

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.770
a fighting game.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.440
Pick up any copy of Clash of Ninja for the
Gamecube or Ultimate Ninja for the Playstation

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.150
2 all the way up to XBOX 360 or PS3, and you'll
see the improvements as compared to this watered-down

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.040
handheld fighter.
