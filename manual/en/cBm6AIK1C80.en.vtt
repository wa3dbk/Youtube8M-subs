00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.880
We are going to come in here with my small
gouge and clean this foot up, do a little

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.960
work on that, turn the speed down and turn
it down quite a bit. In fact I'm going to

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:24.400
turn it down really slow and bring it up slowly
on it. Now I can come in here and start to

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:37.981
do some work. Using kind of a pulling cut,
I'm not using the bevel cut. I'm just using

00:00:37.981 --> 00:01:01.430
the bottom edge of the gouge, working in a
little closer to this. Now I have started

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:16.939
to make that a little bit concave there so
it is going to sit on my foot here. We have

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:39.229
a little tiny foot right there you can see
is taking shape. That has got the outside,

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.810
I have got a little bit of a ridge here and
I need a little bit more work right there

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.489
and then I'm going to remove the center and
get rid of that little nubbin in there. Now

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:54.079
I have left a little bit, I'm going to sand
out past here each time a little farther on

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.130
each grid to blend these two surfaces. That
feels pretty good.
