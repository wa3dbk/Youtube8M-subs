00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.870
Alpha waves are a particular type of brain
activity where a big group of your neurons

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.279
all fire together, in synchrony, ten times
every second, at 10-Hertz. So it is like 10

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.850
fires every second, this big group of neurons.
How big the alpha peaks and troughs are represents

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.350
how many neurons are contributing to this
electrical field. It was thought, in the past,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.509
that alpha waves represented just kind of
the idling process the brain. So, when you

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.109
put your car in neutral and it just starts
to idle, that was thought of what an alpha

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.609
wave was; just kind of your visual cortex
stopping processing. But it has come to be

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.019
found in many more brain areas that this is
kind of a general inhibitory mechanism in

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.670
the brain. So it is not just an "off"
that just happens whenever you are not doing

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.559
anything. But you can selectively choose which
parts of your brain to inhibit with these

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.319
alpha oscillations. So, okay, I have a goal.
I want to pay attention to all the stuff that

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.990
is in my lane while I am driving and other
stuff in that lane or oncoming traffic. And

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.170
so, to do that, it is not magic. Your brain
has to selectively boost some processing and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
decrease some other processing. And that is
what we think where alpha oscillations come

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.799
in is that they can target those different
circuits selectively and any brain area can

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.439
express this alpha activity as a way to dampened
down the activity there.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.020
It has become clear you can kind of give people
feedback in real-time about their alpha. So

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.659
you can measure their alpha and then tell
them how much they have. And then say, Okay,

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.409
increase it." And they do not necessarily
know how to increase it. But they will just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.649
try something. And, if it works, you will
give them feedback and slowly you can get

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.289
them to boost up or dampen their alpha.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.799
I think that is a really exciting avenue of
research. People are really trying to integrate

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.719
brain imaging and robotics and control arms
and control movements. But for people that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.109
do not have disabilities and people that do
not need to control robots across the room,

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.229
how can brain imaging help the average person?
I think that the future is going to bring

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.200
a kind of monitoring of our online states;
besides just "Oh, I am getting tired and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.349
I am yawning." You will be able to see that
you are getting tired or that you are not

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.049
paying attention or that you are getting anxious
and maybe be able to adjust these things in

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.430
real-time.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.470
The cool they about this technology is that
there are starting to be these startup companies

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.730
that are making more and more portable EEG
systems so that you do not look like you are

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.610
wearing an EEG thing. It is just a simple
band or on your glasses that you are wearing.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.590
Also there is a group here, John Rogers'
group, that makes flexible, conformable EEG

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.599
electrodes that you can stick and they will
stay like a tattoo onto your head. So you

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.830
can imagine people wearing them more permanently
around the sides their head. I know the U.S.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.830
archery team and the marksman team already
uses portable EEG systems to train people

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.260
to get in the right cognitive state as they are
leading into their shot. And they know that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.569
a certain state is the best for getting the
optimal targeting. And so something like that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.150
might be better, not just for archers and
shooters in the Olympics, but for the average

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.510
truck driver, the average mum that is driving
to get groceries, should maybe also have something

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.959
warning her when she is not paying attention.
And as that field progresses and the technology

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.620
advances, our ability to understand people
in the real world environment and how their

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.090
brain processes the real world will undoubtedly
improve.
