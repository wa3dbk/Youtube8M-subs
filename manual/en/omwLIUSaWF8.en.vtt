Hey Stampers!
Diane Dimich here with ddstamps.com

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.670
Today I'm going to show you how to make this
card using a technique that I have in another

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.490
video
that I will link to this video

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.240
It shows you a really easy way how to cut
the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.109
paper so that if you take a pack of
Stampin' Up! Designer Series paper,

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.400
2 packs of the coordinating card stock
you can get 75 cards!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.949
with the base, and then I did a different
embellishment

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.119
on the other card
I did this flower on this one, and

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.670
I want to show you quickly how I did that!
To begin with, I'm going to come in with

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.650
a piece of Designer Series Paper
this is one of our Bohemian DSP

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.070
It is beautiful!
It has really bold, bright colors

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.090
This isn't all of it, but I'm just going to
start with this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.460
I'm going to come in with my paper cutter
I took my 12"X12" sheets,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.420
and I cut them down to 4" X 12" strips
and then cut at 5 1/4", that's what this sheet

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.790
is
I show that in the other video

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.509
so come in here,
and cut off 2" of this piece

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.920
and this is going to end up being the base
for my card

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.650
so the base of my card is a 8 1/2" X 11" piece
cut in half, so that made it 8 1/2" X 5 1/2",

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.710
scored at 4 1/4"
fold that in half

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.860
I'm going to take these two pieces of paper
one of them I'm going to flip

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.840
it doesn't matter which side you flip
It's going to line up here

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.890
you're going to see that you'll have a frame
going around it

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.890
so there is your base
then I'm going to come in with a little strip

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.850
of cardstock
these are just some of the 1/2 " strips that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.950
I cut off
that whole strip of 4" X 12" paper

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm just going to line that up there
that gives you your base for your card

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
and then I'm going to use the stamp set
Crazy About You

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.540
I love this flower that is in the stamp set
It's bigger than what this picture shows on

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.970
the front
This is a great set!

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.800
It has all these great flowers and
lots and lots of different words

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.230
that you can put together
to make your card say what you want it to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.920
so I'm going to start with a little Bermuda
Bay

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.540
and that big, bold flower
I'm stamping that on my card stock

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm inking it up in Stampin Up Bermuda Bay
and stamping it three times

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.500
there we go!
This one didn't stamp very well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.730
but that's okay because we're going to punch
these images out

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.920
and not going to be using that section
line it up with the punch that matches

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.930
punch it out
the other two, you come in with a scissor

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.900
and trim them out
so this one over here, I'm going to cut along

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.569
the outside
flower on the inside of the stamped image

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.060
(cutting in fast forward)
(music playing)

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.090
On this one here, because this has that little
flaw

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.700
I'm going to cut out the inside flower
on the stamped image

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.019
(cutting in fast forward)
(music playing)

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.819
Once I have that done
I'm going to go ahead and put some dimensionals

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.340
I'll add a dimensional to the big flower
and then put this one on there

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.910
crooked, kind of kitty wompus
add another dimensional

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.190
and add this flower on there
like I said, it doesn't have to be

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.120
straight or perfect
but you can see how you get a dimensional

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.879
flower
This technique would work with any of the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.739
flower stamp sets that you have
So once I've done that

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:15.090
I'm going to go ahead and add 2 dimensionals
to the back of this flower

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.539
and then just add that to the front of my
card

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:23.020
then, I took a little strip of the Very Vanilla
It's just a little 1/2" strip

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:32.060
and the Thanks stamp
of the Crazy About You stamp set

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.910
And I'm going to stamp that on there
and then I'm coming in with the banner punch

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.520
This banner punch is awesome
It has these gutters that are 1", 1 1/2" and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680
2"
So your cardstock slides right in there to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.800
punch a banner
but if you wanted to punch a banner that is

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.500
a little bit smaller
this is just 1/2"

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.860
I'm going to slide this in, until it hits
the back of the punch

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.650
then make sure it's lined up between these
edges

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.250
punch down
and you end up with a banner

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:11.720
I will add right to my card
like that!

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.150
And then to top that off
I'm going to take one of our embellishment

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.840
pearls
and add that to the top of the flower

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.960
There is your card!
It's quick and easy!

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.960
Using these dimensional flowers is very trendy
right now

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.500
and it can be done with any of your floral
stamp sets

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.030
so go and look and see what you have,
and then make a couple fun embellishments

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.620
I hope you enjoyed that
I will link this to my website

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.250
where there will be a list of products
for this project

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.370
you'll also have the ability to sign up for
my newsletter

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.780
where I send out tips, tricks and techniques
