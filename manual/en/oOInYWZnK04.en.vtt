00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:31.770
A stagnant stench in ominous clouds,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.910
Sparrows fly away low in the sky

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.260
Into you,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.870
 into you, 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.990
into you

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.270
It’s staining -

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.160
This… extremely, I don’t know… this…

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.660
Extremely black rain.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.050
Ah, if I could be beside you, if i could go to you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.180
I would be able to protect you…

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.710
Ah, as this cold rain pours down on you again

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.830
I want you remember…

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.620
Be drenched, be drenched, my love

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.010
I’ll let you under my umbrella

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:50.040
That pale skin doesn’t really fit you

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.320
Don’t forget, 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.660
don’t forget, 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.990
don’t forget

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330
That for your sake…

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.680
If you were with me,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.940
 if you were with me

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.730
You would be happy…

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.050
Ah, if I could be beside you, if i could go to you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.000
I would be able to love you…

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.740
Ah, as this cold rain pours down on you again

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.760
I want you remember…

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.660
Be drenched, be drenched, my love

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.310
Ah, if I could be beside you, if i could go to you

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.400
I would be able to protect you…

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.030
Ah, as this cold rain pours down on you again

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120
I want you remember…

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.960
Be drenched, be drenched, my love
