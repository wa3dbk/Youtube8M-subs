Hi! My name is Leslie Burnick and I’m speaking
on behalf of Expertvillage.com. Today I’m

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.110
going to talk about proper care of the saxophone.
Even though the saxophone is made of brass,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.380
it does have pads underneath each of the main
keys. These pads should not get overly wet,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.210
they are certainly made to get a little bit
damp when you are blowing, but you don’t

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.830
want to get them too wet. So just be careful
not to. Really should not be playing out in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.579
the rain, although certainly with marching
bands you do end up getting stuck in the rain

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.260
at times. You may want to get some kind of
a polishing cloth to keep in your case, just

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.570
to keep your sax a little bit shinier. When
you are done playing you’ll be taking the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.210
reed off. I will go ahead and show you, we’ll
take the reed off and again this is one of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.430
the main things that you want to be doing
with your saxophone in the proper care. They

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.750
do sell these little swabs, they are all a
little bit different. You can do this with

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.420
the mouthpiece off if you wish and just run
this through, this will help dry out the inside

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.830
of the mouthpiece and then you can also use
it on the neck and again they have all different

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:39.310
designs with this. So just run that through
each end. With the saxophone swab they have,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.810
the swab itself generally has a little sort
of a plastic insert thing, which helps expand

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:56.350
it inside the saxophone. One end of the string
will have a weight, you drop that into the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.080
saxophone and then the string comes out of
the other end and then you just pull that

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.270
through. That way you are going to keep your
saxophone nice for a long time.
