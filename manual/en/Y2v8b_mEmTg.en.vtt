00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.320
So, we are going to do the video now. Sit!

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.880
There we go!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.840
This video is about cleaning the ears

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.760
of a dog that doesn't like cleaning the ears...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
... and a dog that will bite you, if you try.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.740
This dog is not aggressive, he is just afraid ...

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.000
... of having his ears cleaned.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.200
When you already say it, then we get nervous ...

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.100
... for example we use ear cleaning solution ...

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.140
... and we show this to the dog. Dexter, here, we are going to clean your ears!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.820
Come here, let's clean your ears!

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.700
We see, this is not gonna work ...

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.340
... and what we do now is, we are going to be easy on him ...

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.680
can you come up? sit here closer ..., yes.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.200
come here SIT, SIT!

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
you have to relax, yes, that's a good boy.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.900
good boy, relax!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.420
we are going to try this with patience, right!?

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.560
And we can do two things: We can use this here...

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.580
We can use those little cleaning things, those ... (I apologize, but i cannot say the word Q-Tips at this point - the dog knows that word!)

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.000
and then we can use paper towels (Again i cannot say the word Kleenex.)

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.020
we can have him sniff it first. Here: SNIFF!

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.060
Look at this. SNIFF! Nothing special, right?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.460
We put this in the ear without doing anything. Just like this...

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.740
Maybe we can clean it. Looook, that was sooo good!

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.440
Clean it here in this ear ....

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.400
Very good. Our next step would be ...  NO! SIT!

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.340
Come on SIT, don't escape! Good boy!

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.440
Then we use the cleaning solution and put that on the paper towel.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.900
And then we try. Now we don't tell him to SNIFF first, because he will smell the solution.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.460
and we see he can smell it, and he is not cooperating with us. We try not to react to this (not easy)...

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.220
NO, no we don't go bad, no!

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.380
We go in there with the fingers only (he obviously likes that).

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.520
That feels good, right? Does that feel good?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.220
Look sniff! oooh, that was in your ear!

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.800
There was smelly stuff in your ear!

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.440
Then we wipe on the outside only.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.540
And then we make our way into the ear. Look at this!

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900
Look, that helps, yes!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.180
I am in there basically with the cleaning solution.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.280
If there is more dirt, we can try a Q-tip.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.900
Let's try this. Let's sniff first and then we see if we can do this...

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.640
We are not allowed.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.020
OK, we start again with our finger only. Oooh, the finger we like ...

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.900
the we add the Q-tip to it, and we have to be very very careful to not damage the inside of the ear ...

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.800
and we have patience, and we play with the Q-tip in there ... look at that!

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.120
What helps, is when the dog has big ears ...

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.880
Oooh, good boy!

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.980
Good boy. And we didn't put any of the cleaning solution on there yet.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.340
That would be the next step. Here we add some

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.680
and sure the dog can smell this, and when you get to close you get in trouble again...

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.160
we know, we don't mind, when we go in there with the finger...

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.220
because it feels good, when we rub ...

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.960
he is just afraid to get stuff in there

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.280
look at you, what a good boy!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.840
Loook! That is a good boy!

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.860
Step by step we go through with this...

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.620
and eventually we get the ear cleaned.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.120
The more often we try this way, the more often we do it ...

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.700
the more he will trust us, that we don't hurt him ....

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.880
this is one thing we have to avoid: No pain in this situation, don't hurt the dog by accident.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.080
we need to do this, when the dog ear is healthy!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.680
You cannot go in there with a cleaning solution, if the ear is scratched for example.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.700
and eventually it gets a lot easier when you do it

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.940
same is going to be done with the teeth .... just touch as often as possible

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.700
you need your teeth brushed, how would you like that?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.440
how do you like to get your teeth brushed?
