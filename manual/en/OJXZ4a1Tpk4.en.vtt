Hey! This is Josh from The Mother Truckers
talking about country lead guitar. For me,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.860
my approach towards country lead, I came from
a blue's background so I kept seeing the blue's

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:28.579
pentatonic scale every where and also I knew
my major scales and I tried to blend them

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:38.270
together. Country lead guitars mostly leans
twards the major sound but if you just take

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:48.390
it note for note, it doesn't have any balls
so I think what a lot of players did is they

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.200
sort of outlined some of the major scale so
instead of going, they would use this instead

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:19.149
so you could get that more bluesier sound.
So you could use those sort of bluesy runs

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:28.590
without it sounding too major or too poppy.
So that is sort of the approach I've used

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.220
trying sometimes to edit out some of the color
notes and that way I can use a lot of the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:44.600
same bluesmix, same positions. Like here's
your classic pentatonic and here's your classic

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:55.479
major. Now I felt comfortable in the blues
and you can basically do the same thing in

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:10.250
country, not just in major position. That
was a little sloppy but obviously you have

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.870
to keep conscious of which note you are landing
on in the blues. so i wouldn't land on that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.510
same, because that's a 6th note. So if I want
to resolve, I have to keep aware of where

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.319
my E notes are.
Stick with the major scales but try not to

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.540
stick to them too literally and put some bends
and a little blues inflection and a little

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.569
jazz anticipation and you will have a pretty
cool sound.
