00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.859
10 Weirdest Looking Cars Ever Made.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.459
Number 10, Dream Car 123.
This auto inventor had a vision that most

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.800
others would never have dreamed up, which
is probably why it is called the Dream Car

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.920
123. It looks like a spaceship from a 1960s
science fiction movie.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.320
According to a report, the auto weighs 8,000
pounds, stops and turns instantly and only

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.559
takes 3.5 hours to charge. The inventor also
designed a tower garage that can capture the

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.859
sun and wind and act as the vehicle's charger.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.429
Number 9, Electic.
This funky looking auto was being touted as

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.890
the first energy autonomous car because it
includes a solar panel and a wind turbine

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.280
for its power. It can also be recharged via
an electrical outlet to boost its lasting

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.350
power. The energy from the elements can only
power the car up to 14 miles per energy charged

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.309
day.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.360
Number 8, 1938 Buick Y Job.
This 1938 Buick Y Job is a good example of

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.980
a concept car and was built at General Motors'
plant in Detroit, Michigan. It was never intended

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.050
to be mass produced but instead used as an
model to test new ideas. Harley Earl was GM's

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.350
first design director and this beauty was
made under his direction. The integrated fenders

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.690
and hidden headlamps were new concepts that
were integrated into Cadillacs and Buicks

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.450
in later years. The front and side grilles
were intended to add yet another luxury feature,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.670
yet they may have overdone it.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.970
Number 7, 1967 Dodge Deora.
This Deora looks like a futuristic El Camino

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.890
and was designed as a pickup. The front end
of the vehicle looks very much like the rear

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.880
end of many cars because there is no visible
hood. Detroit's Alexander Brothers were responsible

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.550
for this design that was promoted as the pickup
of the future according to an article in Popular

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.640
Mechanics. Luckily, it was a concept car that
never made it to the future.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.009
Number 6, 1942 Oeuf Electrique.
The literal translation of this French-named

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.350
car is "Electric Egg". It was designed by
Paul Arzens from Paris whose career background

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.200
was in designing trains and painting. He ultimately
decided to try his hand at designing cars

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.140
and came up with this bubble-like three wheeler
that ran on batteries. The bubble top was

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.600
constructed from aluminum and Plexiglass and
curved by hand rather than machine. It never

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.590
made it into mass production, but judging
by the popularity of the Smart car, it would

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.200
probably do well in today's environmentally
conscious world.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.390
Number 5, 1970 Ferrari Modulo.
Ferrari is known for their sleek concept cars

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.860
and this unusual-looking one was created for
the 1970 Geneva Motor Show. This Ferrari Modulo

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.220
was designed by Paolo Martin of the famous
Italian Pininfarina group, that Ferrari often

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.090
pairs with. Its top speed is 220mph and it
is so low to the ground and aerodynamic that

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.319
it gets going from 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds.
Evidently a recent buyer James Glickenhaus

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.720
has been planning to bring it back to its
original state.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.970
Number 4, 1935 Bugatti Coupe Aerolithe.
This 1935 Bugatti Type 57 S Competition Coupe

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.150
Aerolithe was introduced at the Paris Auto
Show. The back wheel covers are classic and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.020
the details are complete luxury. According
to an article in the businessinsider.com,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.760
the original vehicle was taken apart and used
as parts following the Auto Show. However,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.580
it was recreated in 2007 by reviewing paintings
of it and has not been put on display.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.630
Number 3, 1948 Tasco.
Originally, this auto was made by The American

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.480
Sports Car Company and later coined TASCO
which is its acronym. German designer Gordon

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.060
Buehrig was inspired by WWII fighter planes
and was meant to be a sports car. It is the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.730
first car ever to sport a T-top roof and the
interior dash panel resembles that of an aircraft.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.090
Buehrig patented his one of a kind T-top roof
and later sued Corvette for using it on its

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.519
1968 model. Unfortunately, he was paid very
little for his patent and it became almost

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.669
a trademark for Corvettes.

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.110
Number 2, 1910 Brooke Swan Car.
The notable thing about this car is that they

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.990
cost three times as much as a Rolls Royce
back in 1910. The high price came with its

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.930
own set of luxury amenities and accessories
such as gold leaf accents, Indian silk upholstery,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.980
shoots out boiling water from its beak and
leaves faux excrement from the rear. The car

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.520
is generally on display at a museum in The
Hague.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.590
Number 1, 1956 Buick Centurion.
This 1956 Buick Centurion was ahead of its

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.930
time as its features were so forward thinking.
The front seats automatically slid back for

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.060
ease in entering and leaving as soon as the
door was opened. Plus, it included a screen

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.870
on the dashboard that helped the driver see
what was behind the vehicle from the rear

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.250
view camera. The two door four seat concept
car sported the dual paint colors which was

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.300
very popular in the 1950s. The bubble roof
was cockpit style,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.810
giving this auto a futuristic appearance.
