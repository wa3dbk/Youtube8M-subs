Hey wassup guys Devin Trent here founder of
FeelGoodFitness and todays topic is stretches

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.210
before running.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.890
in this video im going to show a quick, easy,
and efficient two minute warm-up you can do

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.350
before your morning run.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.460
Since your body and joints stiffen up during
the night while you sleep, I especially recommend

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.060
these pre-run stretches if your an early morning
runner.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.810
The purpose of these three active stretches
is to get your body nice and loose, get oxygen

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.722
flowing to the working muscles, and to lubricate
your joints before we go to work on them on

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:29.722
our run.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:33.280
I don't recommend static stretches before
you run, because that could actually hurt

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.600
your performance so we're going to save those
for after the run.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
So!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.440
Let's get to it..................

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:52.140
The three stretches are walking high kicks,
walking quad stretch, and high knees.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.170
We're going to do these stretches for forty
seconds each, giving us a total of two minutes.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.649
First up, walking high kicks.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.689
Remember, when doing high kicks to inhale
with your leg down and exhale as you bring

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.649
it up to meet your hands.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.090
Flex your feet and feel that stretch in your
hamstrings.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.369
Also, be careful not to kick too hard or else
you'll bang your joints.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.060
Second up, walking quad stretch!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.939
Now this is just a simple quad stretch, the
only difference is we're adding a walk to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.939
it.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.159
You simply grab your leg behind you and pull
it up to meet your buttocks!

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.060
Finally, high knees!

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.709
Now, remember we're doing these active stretches
for forty seconds each so don't go too hard

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.229
on this one or else you'll burn yourself out.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.409
Just lift your knees at a height and speed
that you can sustain for forty seconds.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.009
So their you have it!

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.419
A quick and easy warm-up you can do in just
two minutes before your morning run.

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:47.439
It'll get you loosened up and Feeling all
Good inside!

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.549
