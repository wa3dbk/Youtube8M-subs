Hi! This is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village and today we are

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.710
going to put together this very elegant frame
for a wedding invitation. Now before you do

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.340
any of this, you have already taken the wedding
invitation or the picture whatever you are

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.730
going to put in there and you have already
put it on your wax paper, traced it, laid

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.730
out your pretzels, glued them and shellacked
them and painted them; that part has already

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.960
been finished. Then you have your product,
the empty frame, and you want to take your

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
ribbon and you want to weave the ribbon through
the frame from the back to the front, going

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.379
over a joint and under, over a joint and under
all the way around. When you get back to the

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.080
end, you are going to take your hot glue gun
and draw a bead right down the joint, very

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.660
carefully push your ribbon down in and then
another bead on top of that for the other

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.120
piece of ribbon. Then you are going to want
to put your invitation on the back. It is

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.330
really a good idea to take your glue, put
it underneath and then also go across the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.680
top because it gives it a better bond. Once
you have put your ribbon through your wreath,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.750
you are ready to embellish it. You want to
lay it out, so that it pleases you before

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.450
you glue anything on. I found stickers in
the scrap booking section of the store that

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.380
had a lot of things to do with weddings, but
for this particular wedding, it was a very

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.850
black and white wedding, and a very black
and white frame. So I just chose the black

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.920
and silver with the hint of pink and then
I found these really nice little bows with

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.200
the pearl that went with the pearl in the
ribbon and put them on the frame as well and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.509
then on the back of this frame, we will put
from here to here a little wire, so that this

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.869
one will hang like a picture frame and not
have anything sticking up like you would if

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.899
you are making perhaps a wreath or an ornament.
So you want to make sure that your words are

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.370
all visible when you do your wreath so you
put it around and make sure that it fits and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.450
it will be very special, completely unique,
wonderful gift for that very special bride

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.150
and groom, the Wedding Invitation Picture
Frame.
