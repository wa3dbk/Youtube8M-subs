00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.119
Our next stop is going to be the front office.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.939
I'm going to get into the driver's hatch.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.180
This is almost for comedic effect, you can
have a look at how big this hatch is compared

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.070
to my feet, and of course, if you go in legs
forward, you have to rotate 90 degrees in

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.940
order to get them into where your feet can
actually get the rest of you to come down

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.400
in.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.200
I haven't yet figured out a proper way of
doing this, so bear with me.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:07.670
You would not want to be getting out of here
if the tank was 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.390
on fire.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:27.869
Now my leg is on the wrong side of the gearbox.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.750
After finally having managed to get myself
into a position where I can finally reach

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
the controls, it's actually fairly simple
and easily laid out.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.270
You can't argue that the driver does not have
good visibility.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.120
Between the visor and the two periscopes which
are rotatable and can be moved up and down

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.030
in elevation, he's actually got a pretty good
view.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.020
The only catch, of course, is he's got metal
on top of him so he can't stick his head out

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.900
the top, the only way in or out is through
that very narrow port.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.990
Most of the instruments are to the left, oil
pressure, temperature, panel light switch,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.540
fuel gauges, and your speedometer.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.530
The rev counter is on the right hand side.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.069
Two his direct front he's going to have his
two steering levers, he's got his clutch,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.620
which is quite heavy, the brake, which is
very squishy right now so I don't trust this,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.430
and the accelerator is to the right of that.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.189
Right in the centre he's got his five-speed
gearbox, which also has a reverse gear.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.690
Apparently, only 2nd gear was to be normally
used for driving, because there is an interlock

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.250
that has to be lifted up to move out of the
way before the gear lever can be pushed over

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.180
to the side to come down into first or forward
into reverse.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.200
The controls for the electrical system, the
12-volts, are over here, that's where Master

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.540
Power is.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.780
To get yourself going, once you have yourself
turned on with the knob, and then you check

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.531
all your panels, make sure everything looks
right, your fuel pump is running, or what

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:09.510
have you, set your hand throttle to the appropriate
level, make sure you're in neutral, push down

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.620
hard on the clutch to release the weight on
the starter motor.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.770
Button marked 'Starter'.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.950
Push and hold, engine roars to life, you also
have a device called a 'strangle', on the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.570
right hand side here, and the strangle is
what the rest of us would call the choke.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.620
Go figure.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.420
Anyway, eventually the thing will idle correctly,
and away you go.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.901
Just make sure that at all times, unless you
are actually putting a steering input, that

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:39.569
you have pushed your steering levers all the
way forward especially when starting the engine,

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.430
apparently the manual says that the tank doesn't
like that.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.780
The British actually put a bit of thought
into the bow gunner's position.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.020
In addition to his conventional unity periscope,
forwards, backwards, left and right, most

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.629
bow gunners you simply had a machinegun that
you sprayed bullets out of and you either

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.019
had a generic pass-through port, let's say
on the T-34, or on the Sherman you'd look

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.290
through your periscope and you adjusted the
tracer onto the target.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.340
The British, however, have actually put a
proper gun sight onto their Besa, with your

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.889
trigger and handle for the right and an additional
handle for the left, so by putting your head

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:25.440
down you actually had very good control with
an accurate sight, it's one of the few machineguns

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.210
in the bow that you probably could actually
hit what you were aiming at.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.159
The Besa itself is a 7.92mm machinegun, very
well regarded by its crews.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.080
The catch was that it was a caliber which
was not used anywhere else in the British

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.639
Army, or in fact, any of the Western powers
at all.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.229
In fact, 7.92mm was used by the Germans and
the Romanians.

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.440
However, that said, if there were any benefits
to be found, if you were attacking and you

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.910
can find enemy ammunition, I don't know if
they ever thought about putting it into the

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.520
Besa, but I guess it was possible.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.210
The last thing you will note in the driver's
compartment, to my front left, just out of

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.160
the camera shot, is the access for the lubrication
systems that I mentioned for the suspension,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.440
and you'll also note, possibly, that the interior
of this vehicle is narrower than the exterior

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.620
of the vehicle would imply, and again, this
a fact of the Christie suspension system taking

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.720
up room in between the outside armour plate
and the inside crew compartment.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.610
It's just much narrower.
