- Hi!

00:00:01.224 --> 00:00:02.490
- We're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.033
- And we have found some more
chocolate eggs to try out!

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.459
These have penguins inside.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.167
- [Parris] One of our great
followers over on Instagram

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.847
told us that our local
supermarket here in Texas, H-E-B,

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:22.378
had a new kind of chocolate surprise egg,

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:24.178
and sure enough, we looked at our H-E-B.

00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:26.546
Here they are, 99 cents each.

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:28.345
Let's see what 99 cents buys you

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:30.516
in a surprise chocolate egg.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:32.688
When was the last chocolate
egg video that we did?

00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:33.651
How long has it been?

00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:34.429
- A couple months?

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:35.787
- [Roxanna] Long ago.
- [Parris] Months!

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:37.761
Roxanna is in the mood for chocolate after

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.292
surviving day four, right?

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:41.163
Of school?

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:42.266
Everything going okay?

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.170
- It's going so much better.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.571
A lot of the sophomores
are being so nice to me.

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:48.965
- Wow, I'm happy to hear that.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.660
Everything still going well for you?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.842
- Yeah, it keeps getting better.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:53.539
- Good!

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.791
Well, and now we've got chocolate eggs.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:59.251
These are chocolate plus toy surprise,

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:02.188
and the copyright on the box is 2015,

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:03.348
so these really are new.

00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:04.452
There's 12 different toys.

00:01:04.452 --> 00:01:06.519
Let's open 'em up and see.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.528
99 cents is a pretty good deal

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:11.500
for a chocolate egg and a toy.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.823
Did they break in shipping?

00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:14.669
We will find that out.

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:16.771
Everybody's make it through shipping okay?

00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:17.305
- Yeah.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:18.698
- Oh, broken here.

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:19.638
- I got's a crack.

00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:20.590
- Ah, oh well.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.272
- Mine's intact, so just
like one little chip up here.

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:24.073
- Pretty good.

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:26.001
They are cute, the aluminum is cute,

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.370
but the egg is just egg-shaped.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.473
It's not like the Yowie eggs

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:30.250
where they have the shape of the figure.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.910
Okay, let's open them up and--

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.470
Oh, so many pieces.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.079
This is how they're allowed to
sell these eggs in the U.S.,

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.354
'cause the chocolate's already broken.

00:01:41.354 --> 00:01:43.293
There's no chance you wouldn't
know there was a toy inside.

00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:44.489
- Oh, same.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.358
- Yeah, how is it they're in the box,

00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:47.264
and they're so broken?

00:01:47.264 --> 00:01:48.227
Hold on one second.

00:01:48.227 --> 00:01:49.285
- Oh, look, it's sorta like a--

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:51.236
- Ximena! Look, her's made it!

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.034
- Yowie egg thing, because it has

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:54.299
like that thing in the middle

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.704
to split the chocolate in half.

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:56.273
- Right.

00:01:56.273 --> 00:01:57.271
- Except mine is the only one

00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:59.907
that actually got split in only half.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:00.870
- Ximena's very observant.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.914
There is this lip on the egg,

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:07.314
and this does seem to, I
guess, satisfy the FDA,

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:10.518
or whoever it is here, that
says you can't put toys in food,

00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:11.819
because people could choke on them,

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.026
so by having that, you...

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:16.126
Show how there's a little
blue line right there,

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.193
so you can see that
it's not all chocolate.

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:20.484
That's supposed to be the visual clue that

00:02:20.484 --> 00:02:22.430
tells you that, hey,
there's a toy in here.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.369
Anyway, that's good.

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:25.712
I don't have much of a toy.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.970
That's not very heavy,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.467
but let's try the
chocolate first, and see.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.720
Yeah, go ahead Roxanna.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.549
Oh, now you gotta break it, how sad.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.644
Not a lot to it,

00:02:38.644 --> 00:02:39.817
the chocolate in this one.

00:02:39.817 --> 00:02:41.654
I remember that from before.

00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:42.684
This is the same company that makes

00:02:42.684 --> 00:02:44.054
Spider-man surprise eggs.

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:44.890
Remember we did those?

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.852
- [Roxanna] Mmmmmm.

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:48.617
- The chocolate's okay.

00:02:48.617 --> 00:02:49.662
What do you think?

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:51.246
- It's okay.

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:52.692
- It's okay.

00:02:52.692 --> 00:02:54.527
- Yet I keep eating more.

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:56.535
- Didn't say we weren't gonna eat it.

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:58.195
Just said that it's okay.

00:02:58.195 --> 00:02:59.670
They have these also,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.202
you probably don't have H-E-B near you,

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:03.106
unless you live in Texas,

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:06.531
they have these, last
I saw, at Five Below,

00:03:06.531 --> 00:03:08.110
and they're about a dollar, also,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.142
so you might be able to find these.

00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:13.211
I haven't seen this
particular penguin one, yet.

00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:15.448
Check out Five Below if
you'd like to find them.

00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:17.584
- Coincidental thing happened.

00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:19.224
- Yes, what happened?

00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:22.652
- There was a pep rally?

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:23.586
- [Parris] Umm hmm.

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:25.688
- And it was neon-themed.

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.196
I found out on the bus, and...

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:30.498
- Oh, and you were already dressed for it.

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:34.205
- In my natural instincts to automatically

00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:37.669
dress that way before I
even know I'm supposed to.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:38.877
- This is bigger.

00:03:38.877 --> 00:03:40.874
You could use it like a mouth and breathe

00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:43.811
(indistinct speech) breathe in chocolate.

00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.444
- [Parris] Mmmmm.

00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:47.445
- This is so good.

00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:49.015
- Kind of aromatherapy.

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:53.157
- I could do this all day,

00:03:53.157 --> 00:03:55.159
just have egg after egg after egg.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.721
- We did that in Mexico,
don't you remember?

00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:57.824
- And we got sick!

00:03:57.824 --> 00:03:59.763
- I remember that, that was fun,

00:03:59.763 --> 00:04:01.386
and really good.

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.467
- Too much chocolate, we
just started acting weird.

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:05.533
Suddenly everything was funny, to us.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:06.601
Everybody ready for the egg?

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.830
We'll save a little chocolate for later.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.358
- Yep.

00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:10.524
- I think they pull apart.

00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:12.323
(egg banging on table)

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:13.614
- Press to open.

00:04:13.614 --> 00:04:15.111
- Oh, the girl can read!

00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.110
- [Ximena] On both sides.
- [Parris] Other than me.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.317
Okay.

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:19.958
- Got it, kinda.

00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:23.389
Oh my gosh!

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.841
What in the world was that?

00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:26.917
- It's all slippery from the chocolate.

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:28.730
See, this is a dangerous food item.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.659
The FDA was right!

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.853
- I just saw it flying in towards my face

00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:33.525
and it was a blur!

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:34.860
- [Ximena] I got it open.
- [Roxanna] No,do it like this.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.728
No, you have to go like this,
and then just go like that.

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:39.841
- Look, there's that, and there's that,

00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:41.466
you press on it, and it opens!

00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:43.266
- Okay, I got it, yep, here we go!

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:46.644
One, two, three, oh.

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:48.641
Just paper and more paper in mine.

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:49.814
Oh you got the good stuff!

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:51.102
- That means you got stickers!

00:04:51.102 --> 00:04:53.517
- Oh, you're right, it is stickers, okay.

00:04:53.517 --> 00:04:55.154
Oh, these are cute.

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:55.920
I'd rather have a toy.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.883
Oh, Ximena got the actual penguin,

00:04:57.883 --> 00:05:00.223
the little stand-up penguin.

00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:01.993
Roxanna, I think, got the next best one.

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:05.232
She got a little deck of
penguin playing cards,

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:06.300
and I got the stickers.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.321
Let's show ya'.

00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:09.794
Here's a little paper inset
that comes inside the egg.

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:12.639
It shows you all 12 things you can get,

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.704
and then the first one
I'll show you is mine.

00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:17.694
It is stickers.

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:20.457
Here they are.

00:05:22.937 --> 00:05:24.202
Here's Ximena's penguin.

00:05:24.202 --> 00:05:26.675
I think this is the coolest one to get.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:27.709
Good job, Ximena.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:29.752
Okay, Roxanna, let's take a look at yours.

00:05:29.752 --> 00:05:30.820
Here's the box of cards.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.351
I pulled some cards out to see
if maybe they were penguins,

00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:35.162
at least on the face cards, but no,

00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:37.357
but on the back, Roxanna did point out,

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:39.191
on the back of each card

00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:41.002
there is a picture of a penguin.

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:43.928
So what did you think of these
new penguin surprise eggs?

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:46.865
- I liked the little figurine,
and the mini playing cards,

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:48.665
and the stickers are cool.

00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:50.278
- They're cool, okay.

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:51.207
What'd you think?

00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:55.306
- (clears throat) I love the chocolate.

00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:56.780
I mean, if it's chocolate, it's chocolate,

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.185
and chocolate's always good.

00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:58.742
- I agree.

00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:00.182
- No matter what kind of chocolate it is.

00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:01.145
- There's better chocolate,

00:06:01.145 --> 00:06:02.388
than not better chocolate, but okay.

00:06:02.388 --> 00:06:04.419
- Yes, but chocolate is still chocolate.

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:04.884
- Okay.

00:06:04.884 --> 00:06:06.126
- Yeah, I mean, there is some chocolates

00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:07.786
that are absolutely so horrible

00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:10.062
that even though it's
chocolate, it's horrible,

00:06:10.062 --> 00:06:12.117
but this wasn't that kind of chocolate.

00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:14.195
- So, see, there are chocolate's that bad.

00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:15.635
- That's frosting.

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:16.830
- You get those at Easter.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.595
Some of those bunnies are--

00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:22.136
Those solid bunnies
that are two feet tall,

00:06:22.136 --> 00:06:24.075
and eight pounds, and they're 99 cents,

00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:26.200
oh, that's not good chocolate.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.943
- It's not?

00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:27.639
- No.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.707
- But those are so good.

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:31.618
It's like, they taste just like my eggs.

00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:32.852
- Very inexpensive.

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:35.720
- No, what I'm talking about is that they,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.949
it's not really chocolate,
but they call it chocolate,

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.760
so, technically, you have
to call it chocolate,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.921
but it's not really chocolate,

00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:43.057
so that's the only chocolate that's bad.

00:06:43.057 --> 00:06:45.565
- But no, my eggs though, my eggs!

00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:46.865
I mean, I know they're really cheap,

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.292
but it's like, some of
the best chocolate ever.

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:50.662
- Oh, Roxanna, okay.

00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:53.007
- Sometimes cheap isn't necessarily bad.

00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:55.828
- Our viewers will tell
you here, in the comments,

00:06:55.828 --> 00:06:57.372
people who live outside the U.S.,

00:06:57.372 --> 00:06:59.102
that the Kinder eggs,

00:06:59.102 --> 00:07:01.538
and the chocolate in
that is SO much better

00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:02.551
than this kind of thing.

00:07:02.551 --> 00:07:05.245
- Well, the Zachary
chocolate's really good.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:07.845
That's who makes my eggs!

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:08.646
- I know.

00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:10.248
- And it's delicious!

00:07:10.248 --> 00:07:11.479
I get it every year.

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.666
- You love 'em, that's
good enough, alright.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:15.589
