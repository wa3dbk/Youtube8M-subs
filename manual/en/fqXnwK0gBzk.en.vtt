00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.970
THE COUNT: Oh!

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.750
Hello there.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.540
It is I, the Count.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.330
Yes, they call me the
Count because I

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.210
love to count things.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.670
Today I'm going to tell you a
story about when I was a very

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.062
young little count.

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:19.256
Yes, I'm going to tell you about
my first day at school.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.930
[SINGING]

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.884
The first day that
I went to school,

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:29.250
yes, I remember clearly.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.314
My mommy made me leave at home
the spiders I loved dearly.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:41.190
I felt a little sad as I walked
through the classroom

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.430
door, but then I saw
more children than

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.673
I'd ever seen before.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:50.140
Ha, ha, I cried.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.230
My new school will be fun.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.370
For I can count all of the
children one by one.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.723
Yes!

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.330
I'll count Gregory and Sue.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.195
That makes number 1 and 2.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.190
I'll count Boris and Igor.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.110
That makes number 3 and 4.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.700
Morris, Jane, and Eloise,
5, 6, 7, if you please.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.420
Theodore and Adeline make
number 8 and number 9.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.338
And then, I will count Ben,
for Ben is number 10.

00:01:19.338 --> 00:01:19.790
Yes!

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.760
There's Gregory, Sue, and
Boris, Igor, Eloise, and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.340
Morris, Theodore, Jane,
and Adeline, and Ben.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:38.490
And that makes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.310
The teacher taught
the alphabet.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.160
We had to learn each letter.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.450
The alphabet was not
much fun, but then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.860
things got much better.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.920
The teacher said, my children,
dear, it's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.925
time for numbers now.

00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.300
Can anybody count to 10?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.748
A small voice yelled, and how!

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:07.490
Just watch, I cried, before
this class is done, I will

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.256
count all of the children
one by one.

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:10.593
Yes!

00:02:10.593 --> 00:02:12.740
I'll count Gregory and Sue.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.230
That makes number 1 and 2.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.810
I'll count Boris and Igor.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690
That makes number 3 and 4.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.174
Morris, Jane, and Eloise,
5, 6, 7, if you please.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:25.102
Theodore and Adeline make
number 8 and number 9.

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:31.490
And then, I will count Ben,
for Ben is number 10.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.570
Yes!

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.870
There's Gregory, Sue, and
Boris, Igor, Eloise, and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.590
Morris, Theodore, Jane,
and Adeline, and Ben.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.228
And that makes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.590
All right, everybody!

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.860
All together now!

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.600
There's Gregory, Sue, and
Boris, Igor, Eloise, and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.924
Morris, Theodore, Jane,
and Adeline, and Ben.

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:57.196
And that makes 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:57.196 --> 00:02:57.685
Yes!

00:02:57.685 --> 00:02:58.174
Ha, ha!

00:02:58.174 --> 00:03:01.597
But those are only just some of
the children in the class.

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:03.553
Next, I must count the
rest of the children.

00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:06.813
Then I must count the children
in all the other classes in

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:07.465
the school.

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:10.230
And then I will count all the
children in all the schools

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.820
everywhere.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.180
Ah!

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.656
Let me begin.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:14.624
There's Irmingard, that's 11.

00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:16.592
There's Gerhard, that's 12.

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:17.895
[? Runabi ?] is 13.

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:20.310
Steve, 14, Tara, 15.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.610
Oh!

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.860
I love it so much!
