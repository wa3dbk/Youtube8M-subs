00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.240
THE LAST TIME IT GOT ME
WAS PRETTY CLEVER.

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.208
I'LL GIVE IT CREDIT.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.812
IT WAS A TUESDAY,
LIKE 11:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.181
AND I WENT TO A GROCERY STORE
NEAR MY HOUSE.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.083
SO, JUST GET THAT VISUAL
IN YOUR HEAD.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.418
IT'S A GROCERY STORE,
11:00 A.M. ON A WEEKDAY --

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.654
LIKE SIX OTHER PEOPLE IN IT.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.989
IT'S BASICALLY EMPTY.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.190
I JUST WENT IN THERE, LIKE,

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.225
"I'LL WALK AROUND
AND SEE IF I NEED ANYTHING."

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.195
WHICH, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
IS A VERY DEBAUCHED,

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.398
ROMAN-EMPEROR WAY
TO GO SHOPPING,

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.233
WHERE YOU'RE LIKE,
"OH, I'LL JUST WALK UP.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.136
"LINE ALL OF YOUR GOODS
ON PARALLEL SHELVES.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.539
"I SHALL WALK BY AND REVIEW THEM

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:41.308
"AND SEE IF ANYTHING
CATCHES MY FANCY.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.045
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.748
"WORK HARDER FOR MY ATTENTION,
HARD PRETZELS,

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.717
IF YOU WANT TO RIDE
IN MY CHARIOT."

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.853
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:00:56.924 --> 00:01:00.060
I END UP
IN THE FROZEN-FOOD AISLE,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:03.931
AND I'M LOOKING AT A SHELF
OF LEAN CUISINES.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.700
SO, GET THAT VISUAL
IN YOUR HEAD.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.468
IT'S A WALL OF --

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:11.538
IT'S LIKE THE WHITE BOX
WITH A LITTLE ORANGE CORNER.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:12.639
WELL, IT'S THE ORANGE CORNER

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.107
IF YOU'RE GETTING
THE CAFE CLASSICS,

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.444
AND IT'S THE GREEN CORNER IF
YOU'RE BUYING THE SPA FAVORITES.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.913
THERE'S A LEAN CUISINE
TO FIT EVERY LIFESTYLE.

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.181
AM I RIGHT, PEOPLE?

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:24.618
IT'S A PRETTY FANTASTIC PRODUCT,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.920
I'M GETTING $25,000
FOR THIS SETUP,

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.223
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST BEAR WITH ME.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:33.093
ALL RIGHT, SO...

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.628
AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO --

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:35.796
I'M JUST LOOKING AT THEM.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.632
"OH, THAI NOODLES
IN PEANUT SAUCE. OKAY.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.635
PASTA PRIMAVERA. MEH."

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.338
AND AS I'M LOOKING
AT ALL OF THEM,

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:49.243
TOTO'S "AFRICA" STARTED PLAYING
ON THE AMBIENT MUSIC.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.211
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT --

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.114
IT WAS THE COMBINATION
OF 11:00 A.M. ON A TUESDAY,

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.483
LEAN CUISINES, TOTO'S "AFRICA."

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:02.289
I HAVE NEVER FELT
MORE PEACEFULLY,

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:08.729
EFFORTLESSLY,
JOYOUSLY SUICIDAL IN --

00:02:08.762 --> 00:02:11.465
IT WASN'T EVEN DESPAIR OR --

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.601
IF I'D HAD A GUN RIGHT HERE,

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:18.305
I WOULD'VE JUST BROUGHT IT UP,
ONE SMOOTH MOVEMENT.

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:20.841
JUST, LIKE, GOING, "OH,
THEY HAVE FRENCH-CRUST PIZZA.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.676
â™ª DO, DO, DO, DO, DO, DO

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.178
PFFFVVV!
