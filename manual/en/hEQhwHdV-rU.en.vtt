Welcome to Frog TV -- I'm Adam Baker.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.269
In this video we are going to focus on one of the most visited locations in Costa Rica

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.289
The Arenal Volcano.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.919
The Arenal Volcano National Park

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.759
is found in the northern region of Alajuela,

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.279
next to the small town of La Fortuna.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.899
Most tourists visit the Arenal area before heading to the beaches as part of their Costa Rican Adventure, 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.170
and with good reason.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.430
Costa Rica is home to six active volcanoes,
the most famous of all being

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.090
the majestic Arenal Volcano.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.470
Rising up to 5355 ft (1633 m),

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.320
in is thought to be a relatively young
volcano,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.880
at around seven thousand years old.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.680
It is one of the ten most active volcanoes
in the world,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.750
making for an exciting visit.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.070
Last major eruption was back in 1968,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.240
and it remains a stunning iconic image of Costa Rica.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.000
The geothermal activity in the area
means that the surrounding vegetation is lush

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.770
with plenitude of plenty flora and fauna.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.110

many of them

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.650
can be spotted in the Arenal region.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.180

Springs Resort. It has an array of
