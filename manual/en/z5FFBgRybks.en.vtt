00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.430
Hey everyone, it's Tatiana! Back with month
8 of the NoNo review.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.899
Now, for this month, I'm going to be honest.
It sucked

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:15.060
Completely, sucked. I'm still using the NoNo
twice a week and I didn't see any reduction.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.769
My hair is not even slowing down anymore.
So, no results. I don't know.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.619
I've been checking my tips to see if I need
to change them. No.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.429
The levels on the NoNo are still showing that
it's usable and still good. I have been using

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.260
the NoNo lotion.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.219
So, hopefully by month 12 I see results because
month 12 is going to be my deciding factor

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.170
and I'm going to tell you is this product
is worth it or not.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.920
How am I going to twll if this product works
or not. I'm going to be basing it off my under arms

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.200
Before I started using the NoNo when I shaved
you could still see the dark hair underneath my skin

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.730
So it kind of had that five o'clock shadow
look no matter how well I shaved.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:12.520
So if by month 12 I can lift up my underarms
in the mirror and not see a five o'clock shadow.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.890
I'm going to give it a thumbs up

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.420
and a yay. Now since there weren't any results
for me to tell you guys on how great this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.220
thing is working. I'm going to do a Q &amp; A

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.060
There have been a lot of questions I get every
month about people going do you think I should

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.140
buy the NoNo?

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.799
Okay guys, I am testing out the NoNo right
now. You can not ask me do you think I should

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.180
buy it.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.920
I'm not going to give you an answer of yes
you should buy it or no you shouldn't because

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.240
I'm still in the process of testing it out.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.649
If by month 8 after watching this video you
think it's worth it go for it!

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.700
If you don't then stick with me all the way
through month 12 before buying it.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.259
Now, I have compiled a few Q &amp; A's that I
have gotten over and over that I am going

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.869
to be answering today.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.340
Ok first one: Is the NoNo a permanent hair
removal?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:19.920
No. To my knowledge it is a semi-permanent
hair removal so that means from what I know

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.290
is once you get the desired hair removal

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.400
your hair will take way longer to grow back
in. So you are going to be using the NoNo

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.040
less and less.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.670
Next question: How to use the NoNo on your
upper lip.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.650
Okay, I have had A LOT of questions on this.
I have a way that I use the NoNo on my upper

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.720
lip to prevent burning or hurting myself

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:56.140
because this is such a small area. So I usually have the small tip and I go from the outside into center.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.890
Like that and then you just repeat on this
side. Outside to the center. Outside to the center

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.409
I've heard people do this which does not give
you enough room for the NoNo to really glide

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:10.790
on your skin.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.970
Which will most likely cause it to skip and
burn you.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.840
Third question: do you still shave because
I still have a stubble?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.840
Yes, after I use the NoNo I usually always
have a stubble. Like I have never had a moment

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.989
where I just use the NoNo

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.090
and my skin was smooth. No, I use the NoNo,
I buff my skin with the little buffer and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.450
then I shower, shave the areas I have used
the NoNo on

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.480
and then I apply the NoNo lotion and let it
grow out until the next time I use it and

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.549
I repeat the process again.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.709
Question four: How often do you change the
applicator tips and what does it cost?

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.110
Okay, I have only looked on eBay for the applicator
tips and I think there were three big ones

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.049
for $50

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.620
So I don't think you are going to get anything
cheaper than that unless you are buying maybe

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.329
one size tip instead of three

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.200
or two. So I think it just depends but the
NoNo lotion is $50 so I'm guessing the tips

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.890
are going to be around $50

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.380
And as far as how often to change them, that
again depends on your hair type, how often

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.060
you are using the NoNo.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.000
In my month 7 review, I actually did explain
how to know when your applicator tips need

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.880
to be changed.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.080
Next question: Where did you buy your NoNo
cream?

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.540
Ebay--$50.00

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.400
I like using ebay but there have been times
where ebay is not the best site so I don't

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.600
know the actual NoNo website sells the cream
for but mine is 8 oz for $50

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.300
Hopefully that answers some of your guys'
questions. Now if you have anymore questions

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.920
comment down below and I will try to answer
them.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.530
and if I don't answer them I will probably
carry them over into month 9 video. If I don't

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.250
see anymore progress with the NoNo

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.280
And if you don't feel comfortable posting
comments on this video then just send me a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.150
message on my facebook page or youtube

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.250
and I will get back to you as soon as I can
but hopefully I start seeing some results

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.440
because this sucks.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:36.120
Like I feel like I am back to month 3 and
4 to where I wasn't seeing results and I am

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.930
still using the NoNo twice a week and using
the lotion combination

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.940
So fingers crossed.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.960
Alright guys, thank you for watching and I
will see you in the month 9 review for sure.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.460
Take care
