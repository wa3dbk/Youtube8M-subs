00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
THESE BABY FLOUNDER
ARE MAKING HISTORY.

00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.571
Nice little habitat for
our babies, isn't it?

00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:08.641
AS THE FIRST FLOUNDER
STOCKED INTO GALVESTON BAY

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:11.076
THEY REPRESENT HOPE
FOR A TEXAS FISH

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.580
THAT IS, WELL, FLOUNDERING.

00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.148
POPULATIONS HAVE FALLEN
BY ABOUT 50%

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.945
IN THE LAST 30 YEARS,

00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:20.686
WHICH IS BAD NEWS FOR THE
LEGIONS OF FANS

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.555
THAT ENJOY CATCHING
AND EATING

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.653
THESE TASTY FLATFISH.

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:26.693
BIOLOGISTS ATTRIBUTE
THE FLOUNDER'S DECLINE

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.061
TO HABITAT LOSS
AND OVERFISHING.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.365
TO BOOST FLOUNDER
POPULATIONS,

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.036
TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.800
HAS TIGHTENED CATCH LIMITS.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.170
AND THE AGENCY IS
TRYING SOMETHING NEW:

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.181
FLOUNDER STOCKING.

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:43.241
We've been stocking red drum and
spotted seatrout for a number of years

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.611
and the focus in the future
is going to be Southern Flounder.

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:47.280
BUT FINICKY FLOUNDER

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.916
DON'T FIT EASILY INTO
THE EXISTING HATCHERY MODEL.

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:53.218
COMPARED TO REDFISH
AND SEATROUT

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.055
FLOUNDER HAVE A MORE
COMPLICATED SPAWNING PROCESS.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.156
Where a red drum
produces millions of eggs,

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.693
Southern Flounder may produce
only 100,000 at the most.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:02.128
There come some eggs.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.131
SO THE FLOUNDER TEAM MANUALLY
FERTILIZES THE EGGS

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.896
AND NURTURES THEM UNTIL
THEY'RE READY TO RETURN

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.970
TO THEIR BAY OF ORIGIN.

00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:13.040
We want to keep the
genetics of the fish sound.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:15.408
Wherever we get
the adult stock from,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.011
those fish, their progeny,
will go back to that bay system.

00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:22.253
BUT GETTING ENOUGH ADULT
STOCK IS NO EASY TASK.

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.150
THE TEAM NEEDS HUNDREDS
OF FLOUNDER

00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:25.785
TO GET VIABLE EGGS.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:29.028
LUCKILY, SOME SELF-PROCLAIMED
FLOUNDER FANATICS

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.320
VOLUNTEERED TO HELP.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:31.658
Oh, it's awesome, man.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.436
It's rare in your life that you get to
get involved in some kind of project

00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.333
involved with conservation
or something

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.731
and actually see it happen
in your lifetime.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.233
These things take a long, long time

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:43.833
and to see Parks and Wildlife
makes these kinds of strides

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:46.038
in a pretty short span
is amazing.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.406
FOR THE INITIAL STOCKING

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.943
ABOUT 8,000 FLOUNDER
FINGERLINGS

00:01:49.945 --> 00:01:53.145
WERE RELEASED INTO SABINE
LAKE AND GALVESTON BAY.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.648
Working with a new species
is always exciting.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.951
So if we can continue to increase
tenfold every year

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:01.086
we're going to start
seeing some numbers.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:03.023
Each little flounder
is a ray of hope.

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:06.301
FOR TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE,
THIS IS LYDIA SALDANA.
