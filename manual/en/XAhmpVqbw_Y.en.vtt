Hi.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.640
I'm Jeanie Tse, and I'm here to talk to you
about schizophrenia and the brain.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:16.309
So there are a couple of things that we see
in brain development for people with schizophrenia.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.570
One area we have learned some things about
is the neurotransmitters, or the chemicals

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.669
in the brain that are involved in schizophrenia.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.180
A lot research tends to be focused on dopamine
and acetylcholine.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:37.170
So, dopamine was initially a focus of research
because earlier anti-psychotic medications

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.100
were all dopamine blockers.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.660
And so, we knew that if you blocked dopamine
in the brain some of the positive symptoms,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.010
like delusions or hallucinations, would subside
or go away.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.210
And so, we know that that's implicated.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.149
Acetylcholine seems to be involved in interacting
with the dopamine, but also independently

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.750
in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.000
We're doing a lot of research, too, on the
structure of the brain in schizophrenia.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.120
What we know is that the cortex of the brain,
or the grey matter in the brain, is thinner

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.290
in people with schizophrenia, and that there
seems to be a lower volume of brain tissue,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.430
and decreases in brain volume over time.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.110
And things that contribute to those brain
decreases in volume include both the number

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.570
of relapses that somebody might have on schizophrenia,
so the amount of times that they get sick,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.550
but also the medications that we use to treat
schizophrenia may decrease brain volume.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.930
So, it's a bit of a catch-22.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.040
And our science is so crude that we don't
necessarily know what these decreases in volume

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040
represent.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.940
However, we know that both the disease and
it's treatment may decrease volumes, which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.390
is bad news.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.720
Lots more research needs to be done about
this.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.080
There's been some research, too, as to the
relationship between head injury and schizophrenia.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.950
This is still largely inconclusive.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.219
We don't know for sure that if you've had
a head injury you're going to be more likely

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.409
to develop schizophrenia, or that effects
your prognosis.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.430
But we know that head injury has many effects
on thinking and mood and behavior.
