Hi, I'm Doug McKinlay and you're watching AdoramaTV.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.539
Now we've all seen those great pictures of athlete's frozen in motion - the 'Decisive Moment'.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.950
But how do the photographers get those pictures? I often get asked what 
my settings are when I am looking

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.810
to freeze action, but you know,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.410
there's no simple answer.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.390
AdoramaTV presents

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.390
Stay Focused with Doug McKinlay.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.059
There's no magic answer when it comes to
shutter speed for stop action photography

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.739
There is constantly changing variables, could be the light,

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.540
the angle of the light, subjects speed, the lens you're using.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.059
So it's up to the photographer to make a
decision on the spot

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.440
for each situation. Of course, shutter speeds are the key component for great

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.159
stop action pictures.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.250
On bright sunny days you are going to get really fast shutter speeds and lower ISO's.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.690
Cloudier days may be slower shutter speeds augmented with 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.049
high ISO's. Now each photographer is going to have to make their own decision

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.340
given the light situation they're in but
as a rule of thumb

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.390
1/250th of a second is enough to stop action

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
if it's coming across the front of the lens.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
1/60th however can stop action with the subject coming
toward you but either way

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.900
I always set my camera to shutter priority,
that way I know I have complete control

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.150
over the shutter speeds.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.470
Now focal length of the lens is important too.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.710
Currently I'm using this: 70 - 200mm 2.8.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.939
The reason being is I can isolate my
subject

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.060
from the background I'm not too
concerned about the backgrounds here, I'm more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.869
concerned about the action in my subject

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.869
The longer lens allow me to really
really get tight.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.030
Don't forget to check out Adorama's latest contest where you could win some amazing prizes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.560
One key thing to keep in mind

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.849
when taking fast action pictures is your
images have to show motion.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.870
For example if you use a really fast shutter speed

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.260
on a car on a road it's going to look like
the car is just parked.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.069
So you need to find something that's got
obvious action, obvious motion

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.379
like an athlete, or swimmer, or skateboarder

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.140
and catch them at the peak of the action
'Decisive Moments'

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.980
When you freeze some things it's like stopping time

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.069
you able to see subjects in ways you
can't in real life

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.019
and it can be quite beautiful or even scary. When shooting moving subjects it's best to use autofocus

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.370
and set to servo mode - this allows the lens to 
continue refocus as a subject moves.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.859
Pressing the shutter button half way down
activates the autofocus

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.389
and only when the subject is composed
to the photographers liking should the button be 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.060
pressed all the way down

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.840
thus taking a picture. An important
thing to keep in mind with this technique is that the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.319
subject was always be in the autofocus
target zone - 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.579
a series of focus boxes depicted in the
viewfinder. Fortunately most DSLR's 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.190
allow for reconfiguration of these boxes
across the viewfinder

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.480
allowing photographers to choose which
part of the scene they want to concentrate

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.070
and focus on.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.240
Sometime subjects are just moving too
quickly, they are

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.750
coming really fast at you or an acute
angle you just cannot lock focus.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.150
So the trick to deal with this problem
is you pre-focus, you pick a spot in the scene

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.740
where you know your subjects gonna cross

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.500
and just as they hit that spot you take the
picture.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.570
So to burst or not to burst

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.430
that's the question. So you might think
you've got a really fast motor drive and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.290
it's going to be easy,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.710
your going to to grab any shot you can see
lots of action,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.790
stopping action. The problem with the burst
rate is that sometimes the actual image

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.350
you want

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.880
falls between the frames and you miss it,
so I think it's best to start shooting a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.650
one-shot

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.750
and pick your subjects property, watch for
the action,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.950
a 'Decisive Moment' as Cartier Bresson used to say.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.510
