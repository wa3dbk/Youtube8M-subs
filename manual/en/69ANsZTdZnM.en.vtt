00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.820
great to have you with us on the show
today we talked on the bonus show

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.430
yesterday a little bit about you on
masks

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.480
proposal for this version kinda

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.009
he he at one point was talking about
evacuated tube transport which is kind

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.280
of like

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.869
underground tunnels that are used for
transportation the idea would be that it

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.390
would be very very fast and safe
transportation the new idea is hyper

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.850
loop

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.619
which would actually be a tube system
rather than an underground

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.900
tunnel or rail it's just the tube system
and these electromagnetic tubes would

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
run

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.420
initially along the i-5 corridor so you
could get from San Francisco to Los

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.180
Angeles really really fast

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.809
very very cool idea lot of information
out on on

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.160
about it online I don't wanna go through
the details I think it's kinda been

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.460
covered a lot but what I want to talk
about something else

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.660
which is we have to be ready for Big Oil

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.300
to lobby hard against hyper loop

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.539
and I've given an example for a while
now which is

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.010
about when we talk about why don't we
have faster trains in the US in a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.120
perfect example

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.869
is when I fly down from our our current
at least for the next couple of weeks

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.540
headquarters for the David Pakman show
in massachusetts to DC

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.950
I if I want to drive to DC depending on
traffic it's about a seven to eight hour

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.490
drive

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
I wanna take the train it's also about a
seven and a half hour somewhere between

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.400
7n eight hour train ride

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.640
I wanna fly it's a 50-minute flight

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
roughly fifty to sixty minute flight but
I've gotta drive

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.049
40 minutes to the airport I've gotta be
there an hour before down at an hour and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:34.829
40 minutes

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.009
then I've got the 50-minute flight so
now I'm at

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.619
you know about three hours total and
then I've gotta get outta the airport so

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.560
on and so forth

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.509
if we had faster trains right where it
would get me there

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.700
instead having seven or eight hours in
something more like three and a half per

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.460
four

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.270
all of a sudden I'm not flying and I
certainly would never consider driving

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.649
it which I guess now I would do if it
was like a last minute thing I had to go

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.890
to Washington DC

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.320
the airplane the airline lobby

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.470
and the automobile lobby both have

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.780
strong interest in lobbying against
faster train travel

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.489
this is going to have the same a fact

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.599
we are going to see airlines lobbying
against those who fly San Francisco to

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.050
LA many times a day

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.360
we're going to see automobile even
though it's a it's a nightmare to drive

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.599
in that part of the country

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.670
will see the automobile lobbies a going
hard against this

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.000
and I think it's good to be aware that
Lewis whenever we talk about any of

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.910
these new technologies lobbyists are so
powerful

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.150
now we have to remember to think about
are they gonna be four against this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.569
because it actually will make a
difference in how likely it is to happen

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.959
right and that's really too bad of
course these lobbyists will never

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.090
be able to get the someone Mike like
mosque by

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.540
you know they can of course get to the
politicians that have to approve

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.769
exact was these rails so we'll see
you're not gonna buy you one must put

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.530
presumably

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.360
but you are going to be able to buy
politicians who will stand in the way

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.370
up getting the approval permits and
everything else that would be necessary

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.080
for this
