00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:06.102
- [Louise] It's been a long year.

00:00:06.102 --> 00:00:08.526
The intense and stressful lifestyle has

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:11.069
really taken a toll on my face.

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.438
I ask myself daily, "Can I go on?"

00:00:14.438 --> 00:00:19.149
"Can I go out with my skin
looking so sensitive?"

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.868
Day after day of dealing
with this sensitive skin

00:00:22.868 --> 00:00:24.942
has driven me on my search to the

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.882
ancient Reimer treasure of this desert.

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.965
The Matravers Magic Lamp.

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:35.340
(Intense flute music)

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:41.299
(Chimes)

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:46.345
- [Genie] Who dares disturb my slumber?

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:49.228
- It is I, Louise Benbow,

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:51.347
Regional Vice President of Scotland.

00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:53.382
- Oh, Louise, How are you?

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:54.983
- Hey, hi, I'm good.

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:57.752
- Good. You get three wishes.

00:00:57.752 --> 00:01:00.085
- Get me out of this desert.

00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:03.883
- Your wish is granted.

00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:06.030
(twinkle)

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.067
- That's better.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.734
Now, something fabulous to wear?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.453
(pop)

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.630
No, it's not the one.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.083
No.

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:22.215
This is the one.

00:01:24.298 --> 00:01:26.881
- One wish left, choose wisely.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.747
- Make my dry, rough skin
smooth, soft, and beautiful.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:37.621
- [Genie] Your wish is my command.

00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.788
(twinkle)

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:44.985
And as a part of this
wish I present to you

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:47.318
the Arbonne Calm collection.

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:50.278
Use it wisely.

00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.266
- Thank you.

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.512
He left as magically as he had arrived.

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:59.896
But, he left behind a set
of four clinically proven

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.720
botanically infused products that

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.553
hydrate and soothe sensitive skin.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.877
A gentle facial cleanser.

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:11.375
A light-weight restoring facial lotion.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.704
A soothing, hydrating facial serum.

00:02:14.704 --> 00:02:17.121
And a calm, soothing eye gel.

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:23.452
My skin and my life were changed forever.

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:26.119
(calming music)
