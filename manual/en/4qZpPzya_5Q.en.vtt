Hi everybody, Bohus here for Fotodiox. And in

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.910
this video we're going to look at
assembling the Wedge,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.160
the GoTough Wedge. It's our new
two-handed mount

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.250
for GoPro's, action cameras, even a
full-size DSLR.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.359
So here are the pieces that come in the box.
It's just

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.369
four bits that you can put together a
couple different ways.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.939
You get two handles, in fact, if you want
you can use the handle

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.719
just to hold up a camera. Get kind of a
pistol grip thing going. Because these are

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.390
all quarter twenty mounts, that's what
you're going to notice

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.100
about the Wedge. There are dozens of
mounts built in

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.070
so you can mount any number of cameras,
microphones, LCD screens--

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.500
all kinds of stuff. So first thing I'm
going to do

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.030
is let's put the handle on this folding
part. Now,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.670
this is the wedge part of the Wedge. You
can have this it at practically

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.010
any angle that you like. I'm gonna
extend it out.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.649
And we've got these little quarter
twenty

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:10.649
screws like so.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.180
There's the second handl. So that's the
beginning of our mount. And you can

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.909
just decide what angle, you can even use it like this if you want,

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.290
with quarter twenty threads on here for
other accessories, or

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.130
this is the upper deck, we usually put
this on the back. There's even a handy

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.700
ruler

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.369
silk screened on the back, you never know
when you need one of those. But you can

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.409
assemble it so that it's at its widest, or,
you know, bring that in a little bit.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.100
and have some extra room over here
to mount stuff.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.950
I'll build it out to its widest. And then we'll
secure the handles with these

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.200
thumbscrews. Okay.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.670
So this is one configuration of the Wedge. And what's interesting about it is I say

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.600
there are tons and tons of ways to mount
accessories on here.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.810
Along the upper deck there are threaded

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.319
quarter twenty holes and non-threaded quarter
twenty holes,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.400
Why non-threded? Sometimes you put
an accessory in, you screw it in,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.560
and it's facing the wrong way, so with the non-threaded hole

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.019
you can bolt it through and then face the light, the microphone, whatever,

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.200
exactly the direction that the want. Along
the bottom we've got some five

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.620
eighths mounts as well as more quarter
twenties,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.840
you've got these sort of angled slots so
you can mount a camera facing whatever

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.000
direction that you want.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.910
You've got a tripod standard quarter
twenty tripod thread right here in the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.350
middle,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.049
and you've got two slots so you can mount a
camera

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.310
anywhere along here. One thing we've tried,
and this is actually kinda fun,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.120
we'll have two GoPros on here, each facing a
different direction, so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.019
you can get the action coming and going.
Or another idea is to have your DSLR here

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.459
and have GoPros up here shooting in
slow motion, shooting the exact same scene

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.670
so you get it in both regular full
DSLR beautiful quality

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.459
and that unbeatable slow motion that
GoPros are known for.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.200
So really there's just no limit to how
you can mount stuff on here, I'll just put a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.609
little

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.910
GoPro on. So imagine running your mics
up here,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.400
having a little LCD preview screen, having another camera pointing this way,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.930
and there's another quarter twenty thread at the bottom, you can actually mount this whole

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.820
thing on a tripod.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.290
So really, we give you sort of the beginnings

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.570
of a very extensive rig that you can
configure and mount whatever way you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.519
want and it's just for easy pieces

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.970
that come apart and fit right in your camera
bag, You can be ready to shoot

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.060
whenever and whatever happens. So that's
the GoTough Wedge

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.590
and that's from us here at Fotodiox.
