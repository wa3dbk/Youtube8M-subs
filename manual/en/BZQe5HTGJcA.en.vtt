Hey guys Kyle Ward from Handy Toyota just
wanted to give you a brief update today

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.469
we'll be installing a supercharger on a
2015 Toyota Tundra Platinum. What that

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.439
entails is replacing a whole bunch of
stuff- the spark plugs, the fuel injectors, we

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.470
have a new idler pulley on top as well
as a fuel pump so now instead of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.159
running a regular unleaded, it's going to
switch to the premium, jump the

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.489
horsepower significantly, and throughout
the video I'll have a couple of pictures

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.600
showing you what it looks like when it
was all torn apart. Here's some of the extra parts, well

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.760
extra now now that we put the
supercharger in. Like I said we took all

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.600
the spark plugs the fuel injectors some of the coolant line

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.149
got a new air filter in box and
everything in there for you as well just

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.379
to make sure that the supercharger stays
cool then gets the air intake that it

00:00:47.379 --> 00:01:06.220
needs to provide a boost.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.190
This truck being the Platinum you're going to
get the LED daytime running light, you'll get

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.500
the color keyed front bumper and an upgraded
grill on it as well obviously with a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.600
nice sleek design. All the colors really
pop and with the 20 inch alloy wheels I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.250
mean it's just a phenomenal looking
truck. This one also has the brushed

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.990
stainless steel step boards your
power folding outside mirrors in addition

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:41.510
to on the rear we have a TRD dual exhaust
as well as a TRD rear sway bar now to make the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.130
truck a little bit more unique we had a
TRD supercharger installed on this so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.200
what it's going to do the kit will take your
horsepower from 381 up over 500 501

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.119
horsepower it's also gonna take the foot pounds of torque
from 401 up to 550 this specific kit is a

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.150
Toyota factory part so it's the Toyota
Racing Development gonna give you the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.369
high flow fuel injectors with a single belt
drive in the lower heat range spark plugs

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.370
it's also got a separate water to air
intercooler system with a custom

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.400
low-temperature radiator

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.740
so up top here is a separate cooler

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.810
just for the supercharger so it has its own reservoir
to keep the temperatures correct also

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.140
gonna come with a performance air intake
system with a TRD reusable performance

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.210
