00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:04.851
But there must have been a death star canteen, yeah? 

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:10.480
Where Darth Vader could just chill, in between battles...

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.759
I will have the penne ala arabiatta.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.421
You'll need a tray.

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:21.433
Do you know who I am?

00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:27.455
Do you know who I am?

00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:31.415
This is not a game of who the fuck are you.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:40.618
For I am Vader, Darth Vader, Lord Vader. I can kill you with a single thought.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:46.315
You'll still need a tray.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.817
No, I will not need a tray. I do not need a tray to kill you. I could kill you without a tray.With the power of the force which is strong within me.

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:59.381
Even though, I could kill you with a tray if I so wish.

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:05.686
For I would hack at your neck with the thin bit, until the blood flowed across the canteen floor...

00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:08.458
No, the food is hot. You'll need a tray to put the food on.

00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:17.449
Oh! I see. The food is hot! Oh sorry, I did not realise.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.316
I thought you were challenging me to a fight to the death.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.251
Fight to the death?! This is a canteen. I work here.

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:38.106
Yes, but I'm Vader. Lord Vader? Everyone challenges me to a fight to the death.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:46.929
Darth Vader? Lord Vader? Sir Lord Darth Vader? Sir Lord Death Vader? The Death Star? I run the Death Star. 

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:50.378
What's the Death Star?

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.533
This is the Death Star! You're in the Death Star!

00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:57.359
This is a star?

00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:05.472
This is a fuckin star. I run it. I'm your boss!

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:08.498
You're Mr Suzuki?

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:11.354
No. I'm.. Who is Mr Suzuki?!

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:15.479
He's head of catering.

00:02:15.754 --> 00:02:18.398
I am not head of catering!

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:24.222
I can kill catering with a single thought!

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.230
What?

00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:38.514
I can kill you all with a thought! I can kill me with a thought! 

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:40.070
Fuck it, I'll get a tray.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:48.638
This one is wet! And this one is wet. And this one is wet. And this one is wet. This one is wet. This one is wet. Did you try this in a rainforest!?

00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:55.734
Why, with the power of the death star do we not have a tray that is fucking dry.

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:01.943
No, no, no I was here first!

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.699
You have to form a queue if you want food! Oow, can I have the penne ala arabiatta please!

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:14.511
No, no, no. Do you know who I am?

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.594
That's Jeff Vader that is!

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:20.736
I am not Jeff Vader. I am Darth Vader.

00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.254
What? Jeff Vader runs the Death Star!

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:28.016
No, Jeff...I run the Death Star.

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:29.907
Are you Jeff Vader?!

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:31.848
No! I am Darth Vader.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.714
Are you his brother? Can you get his autograph!

00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:40.199
No, ok, I'm Jeff Vader. I'm Jeff Vader.

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.374
Can I get your autograph?

00:03:42.374 --> 00:03:57.653
No! Fuck off. Or I'll kill you with a tray. Give me penne arabiatta or you shall die! And you, and everyone in this canteen. Death by tray it shall be.  

00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:08.230
Ooooow. Do you want peas with that?

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:20.395
Peas?! It doesn't work with peas! Unless you stick them up the penne tubes and then it will be all weird. 

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.839
Fine, I'll have some peas.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.015
That was cut out of the final film.
