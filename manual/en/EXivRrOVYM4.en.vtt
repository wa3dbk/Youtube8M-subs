00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:06.500
You may think of kale as a bold-flavored,
large leaf, leafy vegetable

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.867
that requires a lot of time
to clean and prepare,

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:15.300
but this organic baby kale has
very tender leaves, they're small,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
they're sweet, they're ready to use
right out of the package raw like this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.567
for the salad
that we're preparing today.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.433
Fresh ginger root looks like this.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:28.267
It's very fibrous, but you can
easily mince it or chop it up.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.267
Sometimes when I have
a big piece like this,

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.433
I'll even throw it in the freezer
and I'll grate it from a raw state

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.000
into different dishes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.300
Ginger has
a very bright, clean flavor

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.000
that enhances and complements
other ingredients.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.167
Seasoned rice vinegar
is made with some sugar

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:46.600
to help cut the acidity
in the vinegar.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.067
I always have this on hand
in my pantry to use for salad,

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:52.667
so we have everything
we need for this recipe.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.567
I just pulled these toasted almonds
and pumpkin seeds out of the oven.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:01:00.833
I had them in a 400 degree oven
for about five minutes

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.367
until they were
nice and toasty

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.767
and now I'm gonna let them
set aside until they cool off.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.567
While that's happening,
I'm making the vinaigrette.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:13.033
So, let's start out
by adding some orange juice

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.733
along with rice vinegar.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.167
Olive oil.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:23.667
A little bit of sesame oil.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:32.733
We have minced shallots along
with some finely chopped fresh ginger.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:38.233
And finally some chives
that have been chopped up as well.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:42.067
I'm seasoning that with some
salt and pepper, not too much,

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:48.300
but just enough
to really help pop the flavor.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.567
Let's put the lid on here.

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:54.600
And I'm blending this
to a nice, smooth puree.

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:04.433
Okay, the vinaigrette is made and
now I'm adding our dried cranberries,

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.033
some sweetened ginger,

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.433
sometimes also called
crystallized ginger,

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.400
the nut mixture to that,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.700
and the vinaigrette.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.000
Pour that on there and toss it
as you're pouring to blend it all,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.600
to combine that to a wonderful,
crunchy, hearty, delicious kale salad.
