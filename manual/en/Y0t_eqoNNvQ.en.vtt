Hi my name is Dave Andrews. Today I'm going
to show you how to enable or disable the Aero

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.389
effect in Windows Vista. Aero is a Microsoft's
way of adding a little more touch to the way

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.450
Windows open and close and look in Windows.
So I'm going to show you here how to enable

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.490
and disable that effect. You might want to
enable or disable it because it uses a lot

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.370
more processing power then normal Windows
would. Begin by right clicking on your desktop

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:35.320
and go to personalize. This pulls up the personalization
options for Windows Vista. The window we're

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.030
interested in is the very first one, Window
color and appearance. This opens up the window

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.089
color and appearance dialog, but we want to
see this little bitty link down here at the

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:53.480
bottom that says open classic appearance properties
for more color options. Click on that. This

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.409
opens a dialog that has as you can see color
schemes, Windows Aero is the one that is selected.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:08.930
To turn Windows Aero off, you can go for Windows
Vista basic and press apply. That will take

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.400
about two or three seconds for it to adjust
and I've just turn off Aero. If I minimize

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.259
this window you'll see it will just jump away
it won't fade away or slide down to the bottom.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:27.080
It just jumps. To turn it back on, you want
to go select Windows Aero again, and just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:39.280
press apply. Now Windows Aero is now enabled.
If I were to minimize this window now, you'll

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.990
see the difference. Notice how it faded away
and just slid towards the bottom very gracefully.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.320
If you want to really go for performance in
your computer, you can select Windows classic.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.829
A lot of people think of this as not a very
good looking look, but as far as performance

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.399
goes, it gives you the best performance. Everything
is a little more blocky but it renders a lot

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:11.370
faster. This dialog is a very easy tool for
allowing you to speed up your windows desktop.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.810
My name is Dave Andrews and I've just showed
you how to disable and enable Windows Aero

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.900
effects in Microsoft Vista.
