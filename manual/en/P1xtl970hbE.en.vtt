then lift up and remove the engine cover.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.640
Then reinstall the oil filler cap. Next, disconnect
the crankcase vent tube from the intake resonator.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.129
Loosen the hose clamps that secure the stock
intake tube to the air box and throttle body.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.440
Remove the stock intake tube.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.670
Rotate the crankcase vent tube 180 degrees.
Release the retainer at the valve cover port

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.540
and then remove the crankcase vent tube from
the valve cover port. Remove the two air box

the air box mounting grommet from the frame

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.950
rail. Install the heat shield mounting bracket
onto the heat shield using the provided hardware.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.920
Next, install the filter adapter onto the
heat shield using the provided hardware. Install

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.420
the edge trim onto the heat shield. Some trimming
