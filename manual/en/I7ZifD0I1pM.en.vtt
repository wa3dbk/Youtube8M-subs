00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.270
20 years ago, Honda en Land Rover worked together on a new compact SUV.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:28.993
Honda ended up making the CR-V alone, though. LaRo came with the Freelander in '97.

00:00:29.653 --> 00:00:38.061
This more compact model made Land Rovers a lot more attainable.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:52.305
The Freelander was very succesful. The first 2 gens were sold for 9 years.

00:00:52.305 --> 00:01:08.201
Time for the 3rd gen. No wait, it's dead. Or actually, it's now this Discovery Sport.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:30.434
Earlier, I drove this with spikes and mostly on snow. But now, in tarmac!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:45.964
It's new yet very similar to the old car. Nothing wrong with that.

00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:57.914
On the inside, too. It's nice and high-class yet familiar.

00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:10.060
However, the info-tainment system is a bit slow and these buttons are silly.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.112
Plenty of space in the back - you can even seat 7 people!

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:28.415
Earlier, I did learn this handles itself well on rough terrain.

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:32.804
Especially considering it doesn't have low gearing and LSD's.

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:45.693
On tarmac, it's fine too. Underneath all this it's basically an Evoque.

00:02:48.546 --> 00:02:59.204
It has a 9-speed auto box with a very short 1st gear, which helps offroad.

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:14.519
Best of all, like the Freelander, this makes driving a LaRo possible for more.

00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:27.171
This SD4 has 190 PS, 4WD and an automatic, but a ED4 with 150 PS, FWD and manual 'box follows.

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:33.051
It will be 10000 euro's cheaper than the last Freelander.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.460
+ Quite affordable; spacious!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.776
+ Unrefined drivetrain; no LSD
