Hi everyone, it’s Helen here. As you know I’ve been really busy over the past

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.390
couple of months working on

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.500
different kinds of projects and also moving house

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.110
So today I thought I would do a really quick video update you guys with

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.740
what’s been going on with my life

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.650
The first update is regarding my recently published cookbook

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.960
To my great surprise, the book has received amazing support from my viewers and readers.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.480
and it has been selling so well on amazon that

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.079
Sahabook- a publisher in Vietnam contacted me

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.790
and offered to publish the book in Vietnam

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.620
in both English and Vietnamese versions.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
The English book is now selling at most tourist places like Tan Son Nhat airport at Gate 17, Saigon post office, etc.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.070
It’s so cool to see my book displayed at the bookstores

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.870
and I was even more thrilled to see some tourist actually

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.260
pick it up to have a look

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.589
The Vietnamese version called “Mon an Viet voi Helen” is now also available for purchase on Amazon.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
It has also been published by Sahabook and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.710
available now for purchase in most bookstores in Vietnam.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.740
You can check out my website or the links I will put below to know how and where to get the book.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
The book has also been featured many times on Vietnam TV like

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.530
VTV1, VTV4, VTC10, etc.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.110
OH, and because of the success of the book,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.320
the people from Createspace – the publishing company of Amazon

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.490
have contacted me personally to congratulate

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.860
and also offer a free conversion service to Kindle for my book.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.270
How awesome is that! So now if you have a Kindle, you can also get

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.409
copy of my book to your Kindle, too.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.080
The second update is regarding my new

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.520
cooking studio. I've been moving quite a few times since started Youtube

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.100
and cooking in various rent houses from

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.189
dormitory and flat share in Germany to serviced apartment in VN.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.610
Finally I have managed to build a studio kitchen for Helen’s Recipes on my own!.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.510
It’s so tiring yet so so exciting to witness

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.930
the construction process

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.160
from day 1 when the first brick was layed

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.730
untill the final finishing touch. If you would like me to do a detailed

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.620
kitchen tour, I would be really pleased! By the way, I have finally received

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.239
the Silver Button

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.620
from Youtube. I know I have surpassed the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.310
100,000-subsriber milestone

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.620
a while ago but finally I received the Silver Button from Youtube

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.079
and now I will surely put it in a very
special place in my new

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.450
kitchen studio. Finally some more updates regarding my online store

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.620
helenKIT. As you might have
already known

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.420
It's selling hand-painted T-shirts and aprons

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.910
for Vietnamese food fans

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.230
It’s one of my efforts to create artworks that honor Vietnamese cuisine.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.609
Since the first launch in November last year, we have been working really hard to

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.060
develop more new products.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.140
Now most of the popular Vietnamese dishes like Banh mi,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.160
pho, goi cuon, nuoc mam are featured

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.440
on aprons and T-shirts with fun slogans.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.709
You can now also customize the message to make it unique presents for your beloved.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.480
We also have promotional campaigns

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.790
