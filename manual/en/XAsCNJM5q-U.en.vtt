Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.050
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the upper storage drawer on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.310
It’s a really easy job; all we’re going
to need is a putty knife.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.070
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.100
Now the first step in this repair will be
to empty the storage drawer completely, then

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.680
we’ll remove it from the refrigerator and
set it on a suitable work surface so that

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.730
we can remove the front from it.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.480
Now with the drawer removed from the refrigerator
and completely emptied we’re ready to disengage

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.960
the front from the drawer; it’s held in
place with a little lip on the bottom here,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.269
it needs to be pulled forward so with a putty
knife slide it in that gap, just pry it forward

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:59.999
gently, and at the same time you can press
down on the front, then slide that out of

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.100
the old drawer.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.170
Set that aside.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.880
It’s a good opportunity to clean any debris
that may be in any cracks here.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.750
We’ll take the front from our old drawer
and we’re going to line up that slot with

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:32.619
this edge, same on the opposite side, make
sure it engages completely in that track.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:55.759
Flip it over, we’ll need to pull that lip
out far enough to clear the drawer, make sure

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:08.119
it 
snaps firmly over that, and then we’re ready

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.229
to reinstall the drawer in the refrigerator.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.810
Now that we’ve reassembled the drawer we’re
ready to install it in the refrigerator, line

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:27.180
up the sides of the drawer with the rails,
tilt it up slightly, just to verify that it’s

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.110
in properly you should pull forward to about
that position at the catch, and our repair

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.610
is complete.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.799
That’s just how easy it is to change the
upper storage drawer on your refrigerator.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.090
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
