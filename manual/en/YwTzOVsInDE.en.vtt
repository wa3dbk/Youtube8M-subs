[Ryan laughs]

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.400
Michael: Saved, by the railing.
Geoff: That's why you put safety rails on buildings.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.480
Ray: My head was in Gavin's asshole.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.460
Gavin: I got the most amazing picture.
Ryan: Alright Jack, you no longer have a car.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.720

Ryan: Woo, 500 dollars.
Jack: Hold on, I gotta get a new wrecking ball.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.900
Geoff: We should put at the 
end of the Things to Do,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.880
We should put like a, like a 'Wish You Were Here' thing.
Michael: Oh, dude, a portrait.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.620
Ryan: Oh, I wonder if I can shoot your phone.
Gavin: You gonna shoot my phone?
Geoff: Huh? Can I do what now?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.520
Jack: Pull into this intersection, you see me floating?

Jack: Alright, where's Gavin?
Michael: Gavin, what was that squeak?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.240
[Ryan laughs]

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.300
Gavin: Ryan was like, 'I wonder if I can shoot your phone while you're doing a selfie?'

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.440
Gavin: And just clubbed me in the head with a gun.
[Ryan laughs]

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.280
Michael: You didn't pick us up.
Jack: I thought, I did.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.240
Gavin: Can you pick me up too?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.680
Jack: Where you at? Come over then.
Gavin: I'm just down the road.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.420
Geoff: Well, we're in a 2-seater, so...
Gavin: I can get in the chopper.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.500
Ryan: Not if he's got the under-slunk car.
Gavin: Nah.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.900
Ryan: Whoops, whoops. Uhh, whoops.
Geoff: Please pick us up fast.
Jack: Goddamnnit.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.200
Ray: Uh, Ryan fell off the building.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.700
Geoff: Are you serious?
Jack: Alright, I've got the chopper with- it's clear if anybody wants to get in and get a lift up to the top.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.460

[Michael honks his car]

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.460
Gavin: Is everyone in? Who's not in?
Geoff: Goddamn that thing is fucking obnoxious.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.340
Michael: You mean amazing?
Geoff: Yeah, that's what I meant.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.460
Michael: did you see the logo?
Geoff: Yeah, that is pretty- no, where's the logo?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.420
Michael: Why can you never see it?
Gavin: It doesn't show up for me.
Ryan: Yeah, I can't see it either.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.200
Ryan: We need to re-publish it.
Michael: You guys are fucked.
Ray: It's definitely there.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.360
Michael: There you go, see?
Ryan: There it is.

Michael: Geoff, we look fucking classy.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.060
Geoff: Yeah we do, dude.
Michael: If you could take a fucking picture, now would be the time.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.300
Geoff: I know.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.620
Jack: Very shiny wrecking ball.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.680
Geoff: Fucking cozy in your car.
Michael: Oh, you can though.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.080
Michael: You really can take a photo. But you can't do it- you can't do a selfie in the car, that's bullshit.
Ryan: Nah, no selfie.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.180
Michael: Oh, I can take a picture of the logo though, I'll do it.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.920

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.200
Jack: Heads up, Ray.
Michael: Ok, so this is still, uh, this is still round one.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.220
Ryan: Nailed it.
Gavin: Wait, wait, I need to get out the chopper.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.340
Ryan: Just jump out.
Gavin: Yeah, just, I'm gonna jump off the edge of the building at this rate.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.040
Michael: And~ go.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.400

Michael: It's still the same round, actually.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.460
Ryan: I ain't afraid, let's do it.
Michael: New car, same round, one winner.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.020
Geoff: All the marbles, in a bag.
Ryan: Do I get bonus points if I shoot one of you out of the car?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.920
Ray: What's the name of that guy from Twisted Metal, is it Mr. Grimm?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.560
Michael: That is the guy on the motorcycle, yes.
Ray: Ryan looks like Mr. Grimm.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.640
Geoff: Oh god, woah!
Michael: Holy shit, woah. Ray, narrowly avoiding that one.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.060
[Gavin chuckles]
Michael: I'm gonna see if I can get a picture, like right as you fucking hit somebody.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.760
Michael: Where are you guys? Oh, there you are.
Geoff &amp; Jack: Oh, oh, oh.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.500

Jack: Haha, too high?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.100
[Michael chuckles]
Ryan: Little high, little high.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.660
Jack: Ok.
Ray: You're still too high, that was just a precaution.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.220
Ray: Brace for impact.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.980
Michael: Dammit.
Geoff: That looked awesome.
Jack: Is the car in a good position?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.480
Ray: Should we make a rule Ryan where you have to stay in the 17?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.780
Ryan: Yeah, let's do it.
Ray: Alright.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.000
Ray: New rule, stay in the 17.
Ryan: Blood rules, gotta stay in the ring.
Michael: Box it in, box it in.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.600
Ray: Unless you roll out, obviously. Roll out.
Ryan: Uhp. Ow.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.840
Geoff: Woah.
Ryan: That hurt, that hurt.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.760
Jack: I clipped somebody, I think.
Ryan: I went out, I went out of the ring.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.000
[Laughter]
Ray: Yeah you did, get back in.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.960
Jack: Alright, I'm coming back.
Ryan: Whoops, no, no, no, no, not him, there we go.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.400
Jack: Who's shooting at me?
Ray: Ah, you know, for LOL's.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.200
Ray: Hup, that was way too early roll.
Geoff: Woah.
Ryan: Yeah, little high.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.280
Geoff: It looks per-, it looks dead-on from the car.
Gavin: Are you getting gnarly pictures, Michael?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.420
Michael: I'm getting something. I wouldn't call them 'gnarly'.
Jack: You still in the car Geoff?
Geoff: Yeah.
