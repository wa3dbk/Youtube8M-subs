My name is Zhang Hongyu.

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:39.032
I come from Inner Mongolia, China.

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:42.542
I'm a painter engraver.

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:46.412
I studied at the School of Fine Arts

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:52.412
in Mongolia, China in 2003.

00:00:52.412 --> 00:01:00.344
In 2004, I came to Paris 
to study at the Beaux-Arts in Versailles.

I love Indian Ink, because
I began making calligraphy

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.559
with Indian Ink.

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:20.389
For me, Indian ink 
is also my tradition.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.247
I work with lines,
with music.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:33.272
Music helps me find the strength,
the rhythm, the moment of the line.

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:40.060
Sometimes, to make the lines,
I may jump, I may dance,

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.928
above all I want the lines to travel.
Each line has its own life,

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:53.193
and together they make
an energetic space.

I don't have a precise idea
or theme before I start working.

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:10.300
I know the goal for all my themes
is always to find the strength,

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:17.111
the moment, the rhythm,
to make an energetic space,

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.507
it's always my goal.

People often ask me 
who my portraits are,

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:32.490
they are various characters
who don't exist,

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.767
but they're all me,
all my portraits are me.

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:45.860
Trying to find my style 
is not my purpose,

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.581
but until now,
I've been doing whatever I want to.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.036
Someone may tell me,
"Ah, that's your style !"

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:58.245
but that's the way I work,

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:02.275
I'm not especially trying
to find what my style is.
