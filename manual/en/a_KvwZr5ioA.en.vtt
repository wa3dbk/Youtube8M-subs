00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.839
If you've ever visited California you've seen
Agapanthus, or Lilly of the Nile all over

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.320
the side of the road, and they grow easily.
They're a South African plant that has adjusted

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.400
well to changing its' environment. They're
found all over the world and they're easy

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.460
to grow. I love to call them Aggies Panty's
because I have nicknames for all of my bulbs.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.910
But you can call them Lilly of the Nile or
Agapanthus, or anything you want to call them

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.119
because they're a gorgeous South African plant
that is easy to grow. This particular Agapanthus

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.050
is called Getty. It was actually hybridized
in England from original stalk that was found

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.050
in South African. So its know has a Headbourne
Hybrid, which it was hybridized at a castle

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.990
in England at the Headbourne Castle. Because
the stalk is originally from South Africa

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.790
and it has been crossed many times, I still
consider it a South African plant. An Agapanthus

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.830
is just a root with an eye, so I just cover
it about three inches deep in full hot sun.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.400
Any they've got to be root bound to bloom,
so my trick is to plant like two or three

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.420
bulbs together at one time, so they're just
a mound of root, you want those roots to be

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.880
crowded. So the more the merrier. Whenever
I'm planting Agapanthus, I want to crowd them,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.420
because you want them to bloom. And if you
put one by itself you might not get blooms

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.580
for a couple of years, but you put three or
four together and you should get blooms that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.630
first summer in full hot sun. Beside white,
there's another popular one called Pinocchio

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.730
or sometimes a similar one is called Peter
Pan and it's a shorter variety Agapanthus,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.400
so it's only one to two feet tall. And it
is a dark dark blue, as opposed to others

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.740
that are a lighter color. And again, it's
just a root, and you just cover the root about

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.770
three inches deep in full hot sun. They've
got to have that hot sun all day to do well.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.659
And good drainage. They don't want to sit
in water. In the Northwest, I've gotten them

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.220
to grow for about 15 years now. And they are
in a raised bed, with good drainage in full

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.590
hot sun and I never lose them. Because once
their roots are established they do well.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.090
You just don't want to put them in a pot and
have that pot freeze solid in the winter,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.140
sometimes you'll lose them, so throw the pot
in the garage to be safe. Besides the whites

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.080
and the dark blues one of the most popular
is the Donau. And it's a lighter blue and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.159
it?s a large it gets two, three, four feet
tall with big blue blooms. And I just love

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.540
them, all my Agapanthus. Because hummingbirds
love them too, all the colors. They're so

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.999
easy to grow; you just plant them and forget
them. They are drought tolerant, they do like

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.609
water in the summer, but even if you never
take care of them, they'll come back for years

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.260
to come. A great South African plant. Next
we'll talk about Red Hot Pokers from South

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.280
Africa.
