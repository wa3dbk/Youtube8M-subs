00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.728
As you probably know, the new Seat Leon is coming early 2013

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:25.052
The press photo's have been published, but the actual release of the car will be in january

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:29.744
That's why we've taken this Seat Leon Cupra R

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:36.211
As a tribute to the generation Leon that we absolutely love

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.849
... and THAT is why

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:13.735
As I said, I'm driving the Cupra R

00:01:13.735 --> 00:01:16.814
Currently, the fastest Leon available

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:21.049
The Cupra 310 was a limited edition, which was available until 2009

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.431
2.0 TSI, 265 BHP, and a electronic limited slip diff.

00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.934
Which is the Scirocco R setup

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.437
But, I think this one is more appealing 

00:01:33.437 --> 00:01:37.562
I think this car is less "flashy", it has a pretty simple appearance...

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:42.550
Not as prominent as the Golf R

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.599
This car is more "no nonsens"

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:52.933
If you look carefully, you know what you're dealing with.. But only the true petrolheads will recognise this as a Cupra R instead of a normal Cupra

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:17.344
This Cupra is available from €37.500 (NL)

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:22.885
Which is €7.000 less than a Scirocco R, and €10.000 less than a Golf R

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:24.795
But you really notice the price difference..

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:26.699
Especially inside of the car

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:35.210
The Scirocco and Golf have great looking interiors, featuring leather, a great navigation system etc

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.415
This interior just looks a bid old..

00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:41.802
It is really obvious why it is cheaper..

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:44.312
It has a navigation system from a Polo

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:46.383
A lot of plastics..

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:50.180
The steering wheel has been flattened, which feels great. Nice and sporty

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.600
But they mounted a Cupra logo on it which feels like it comes from a toy store

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.087
It is just solid plastic.. 

00:02:59.948 --> 00:03:03.168
It also has a great lever and a central rev counter

00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:13.167
which really contribute to the driving experience of this car!

00:04:05.337 --> 00:04:09.294
How do you know if you're looking at a Cupra R..

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:11.477
The little R logo's..

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:17.241
19" Potenza rims, which just look amazing

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:22.524
It think the styling has been done better than on it's big brothers

00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:30.137
I really like it when it isn't obvious you're driving a really fast car

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:33.162
The exhaust for example..

00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:35.673
It is just one big pipe on the left

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:40.804
Not like those perfectly centered ones on the Golf R

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:43.657
I really like that

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:50.030
It just isn't "out there" like it's brothers are

00:05:01.862 --> 00:05:08.470
If you look at the competitors.. You obviously have the Scirocco and Golf R

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.960
We have made acceleration video's of the three cars, which we lined up next to each other

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.188
So you can see the difference between three cars which are basically the same..

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:58.657
What is the best way to describe this car...

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:03.238
It basically is a "budget" Golf R

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.470
But is think it's more enjoyable!

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:14.735
It's €10.000 cheaper, for which you just have to accept the less luxurious interior

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.912
It is sportier than the Golf R, sounds better as well..

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:23.542
It's faster.. To 200km/h

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:28.170
I would keep those €10.000 in my pocket

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.040
And go with this Cupra R!

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.828
But you do have the problem of the new Leon..

00:06:36.828 --> 00:06:39.976
Which means there will be a new Cupra as well..

00:06:39.976 --> 00:06:46.358
With the same, or even more power..

00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:48.342
But..

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:49.977
You'll need to have some patience.. 

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:51.636
I don't have any patience!
