00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.410
Hilah Johnson: Welcome to a very special episode
of Hilah Cooking.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.370
I'm Hilah, and as you can see I don't know
how to temper chocolate.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.940
Like I thought I did because I thought I was
a genius and I could do everything, but I'm

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.930
about to go to Bacon Takedown and I'm totally
late, but my chocolate didn't set up right

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.250
and I'm afraid that bacon dressing is going
to be the only thing I have going for me today,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.539
but fuck it, we have to go.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:35.600
Hilah Johnson: Okay, so here we are.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.190
It's like 3 o'clock.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.760
I'm an hour early, so plenty of time to prepare
and I think I get a complimentary bacon apron,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.609
so that's nice.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.679
I think I'm set up.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.129
Let's go get beers.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
I forgot to mention before that I made this
bacon dress.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:38.770
At least, if I don't win I have a bacon dress.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.960
Take that!

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.759
Hilah Johnson: I'm here with Marcelo Nascimento
of Lucky 13 Cocktail Catering.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.759
Marcelo Nascimento: How are you?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.759
Hilah Johnson: I'm good.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:52.759
I'm Hilah from Hilah Cooking.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.759
Marcelo Nascimento: It's nice to meet you
guys.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.759
Hilah Johnson: He's got a Bacon Bloody Mary
to tell us about.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.759
Marcelo Nascimento: Absolutely!

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.759
We actually took Tito's vodka and we infused
it with fresh bacon, some jalapenos, onions,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.759
and garlic.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.909
All the kind of beige flavors that you have
and not only just like a regular sauce you

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
cook with.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.010
We took that whole process and decided to
add the Bloody Mary mix to it.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.579
The Bloody Mary mix itself is made up fresh.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.920
It has the grocery tomatoes, which we grilled
and then curated.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.382
It has bacon, onions, horseradish, Worcestershire,
all the kind of basic building blocks we put

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:18.382
in a Bloody Mary and we're trying to add as
much as bacon to it as possible.

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:23.519
We really wanted you to taste the bacon and
we think it's kind of neat.

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.560
We also stuffed the black olive with the pickle,
bacon.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
Hilah Johnson: Yeah, can I try that one?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560
Marcelo Nascimento: Absolutely!

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Hilah Johnson: Wow!

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560
I think that's the best Bloody Mary I've ever
had in my life.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560
Marcelo Nascimento: Well, very cool, thank
you.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.560
[Music]

00:02:31.560 --> 00:03:03.620
Hilah Johnson: I'm here with Matt Timms the
inventor of the awesome Bacon Takedown 2010.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.650
Tell us, when was the first bacon takedown
that you entered in?

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.799
Matt Timms: I did a takedown six years ago
in my apartment and just for friends and it

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.819
was just me and it was just as about chili
and I was thinking to myself I should totally

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.519
make this a bigger deal.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.640
I went down to this bar, down the street I
love to go to and I just started doing chili

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.989
contests down there and people flooded it,
but this is New York, this isn't Texas.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.300
You wouldn't think something like that might
happen, but actually it turns out people are

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.810
crazy about chili.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.659
I was thinking, oh my god, I've got this great
idea that maybe people are also having crazy

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.520
opinions about other stuff, say, for example,
bacon.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.280
Anyways, that was like years ago.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.390
I had this idea last year and it was insane
and I thought I could take it on the road

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.380
and that's why I got it with me out here.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.200
Hilah Johnson: Are you going to other cities
after this?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Matt Timms: Yeah.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200
I'm going to --

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
Hilah Johnson: Where are you going?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200
Matt Timms: -- Houston, New Orleans, Chicago,
and Minneapolis.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
Hilah Johnson: How long will you be gone?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.110
Matt Timms: I'm not going to be away for long,
I'll keep going back and forth.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.469
I like in Brooklyn, I'm going to stay in Brooklyn
and fly back out.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.030
This is the coolest job on the planet.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.030
If I can keep this going on --

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.030
Hilah Johnson: Yeah.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
Matt Timms: God.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.030
Hilah Johnson: Yeah, I know.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.579
So, just basically you just eat bacon all
day long to talk to people.

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.579
Matt Timms: I know.

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.170
I don't know if I'm -- I may be a little nervous
today.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.970
I just want this to go well, so I don't know
how much space there is in my stomach for

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.970
bacon.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.970
Hilah Johnson: Yeah.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
Matt Timms: I'm going to try your bacon candy.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.970
Hilah Johnson: Okay, my cup of candy.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.970
Matt Timms: Oh, yeah.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.970
I heard about it.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.970
Hilah Johnson: It's a chocolate-bacon fantasy.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.120
Matt Timms: I heard about it.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:45.880
Hilah Johnson: Yeah.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:56.140
You've got a tagline to everything.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.140
Hilah Johnson: Oh my god!

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.300
I totally won the People's Choice Award, what
the fuck.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.300
Matt Timms: Yes, she did.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.300
Hilah Johnson: I was not even expecting.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300
Matt Timms: Congratulations Hilah.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.850
Hilah Johnson: I was not expecting that at
all and then -- but you know what else is

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.270
awesome is this is the first time that I've
ever won anything in my life.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.160
In the 30 years that I have been alive in
every one of these things, expect for now.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.750
Matt Timms: That's sad, but true, but cool
and true.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.800
Hilah Johnson: Yes, thank you Matt.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.130
Thank you, Matt Timms.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.130
Matt Timms: No doubt.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.320
Hilah Johnson: Hey, and good luck on your
future journeys with Bacon Takedown.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.480
Matt Timms: Hilah's the greatest and guess
what else?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480
Hilah Johnson: What?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.900
Matt Timms: I'm going to check out your blog
tomorrow.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.040
Hilah Johnson: Oh, you should because you'll
see this one it within the week.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040
Matt Timms: I'm in it.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.080
Hilah Johnson: Yeah, you're in it.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.080
Matt Timms: Chili-takedown.com, FYI.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.090
Hilah Johnson: Yeah, chili-takedown.com; got
it.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.470
Matt Timms: That was a good time.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.690
Hilah Johnson: All right.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.460
Matt Timms: Thanks for winning.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.790
Hilah Johnson: Thanks for having me.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.900
Okay, bye.
