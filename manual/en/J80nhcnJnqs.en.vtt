Hi, I'm Shaun Schaefer on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, we're going to be learning

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.612
how to play a drum roll. Now that we know
how to play sixteenth notes, we're going to

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:14.339
switch it up a little bit. We're still going
to play sixteenth notes, but right now we've

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:22.610
been playing our sixteenth notes right left,
right left right left, right left. Or alternating.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.490
Now what we're going to do is we're going
to practice playing sixteenth notes double

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.350
stroke, if you will. And we'll get into like
single stroke, double stroke later. But actually

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.260
we're going to be playing it a different sticking.
And instead of right left, right left, right

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.440
left, we're going to play right right, left
left, right right, left left while we're counting.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.380
So let's get started. One-e and ah two-e and
ah three-e and ah four-e and ah. One-e and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:56.190
ah two-e and ah three-e and ah four-e and
ah. One-e and ah two-e and ah three-e and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:12.820
ah four-e and ah. One-e and ah two-e and ah
three-e and ah four-e and ah one. Now as you

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:22.260
can see, when you play right right, left left,
right right, left left, they should or the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.951
intent is to make them sound exactly as if
you were playing right left, right left. You

00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:31.520
should be able to play sixteenth notes right
left, right left, to right right, left left,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.780
or alternating to double and it shouldn't
sound any different. It's going to because

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.330
you're playing differently on the, in different
spots on the drum. And that's going to make

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.310
different sounds. So keep practicing the right
right, left left and if it's too fast, once

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.869
again, pull it back and slow down. But you
started basically playing a roll. Now we're

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.260
just going to get into some more mechanical
things and how to do different things and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.990
make it sound like the roll that you want
to play. So let's take a look at our next

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.020
step.
