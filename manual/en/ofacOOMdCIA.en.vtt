00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.180
Nokia C6.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.680
Expected Q2 2010.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.660
One of a trio of new social networking phones
from Nokia, the Nokia C6 is pretty much a

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.720
straight replacement for the unloved Nokia
N97, featuring a 3.2" touchscreen display,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.210
WiFi and 3.5G support, GPS and a 5 megapixel
camera.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.910
Nokia say that the C6 is aimed at social networkers,
and it includes built in support for Facebook

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.680
and Ovi plus popular webmail and instant messaging
applications. But at it's heart, the C6 is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.110
a Symbian smartphone running the Symbian^1
operating system (also known as S60 5.0).

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.510
Nokia say that the home screen is customizable
to allow direct access to favourite features.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.820
The technical specifications for the Nokia
C6 are very close to the N97 - there a 3.2"

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.689
360 x 640 pixel touchscreen display, a 5 megapixel
camera with autofocus and flash, HSDPA support,

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.660
WiFi, integrated GPS, microSD expandable memory
(with a 2GB card in the box), a media player,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.670
FM radio and 3.5mm AV connector.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.659
Charging is done through a micro USB connector,
hopefully Nokia have sorted out the quality

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.840
problems with the connector which has proved
unreliable in some current models. A moderately

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.470
large 1200 mAh battery is quoted as giving
the Nokia C6 up to 5 hours talktime on 3G

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.710
and 16 days standby time.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.420
It's worth noting that the keyboard arrangement
is more conventional that the N97, with four

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
rows of keys and a small space bar in the
middle. The navigation pad has moved from

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.350
the left to the right and there are three
keys on the front of the unit in the same

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.210
style as the 5800. The large screen and slide
out keyboard mean that this is a fairly heavy

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.880
device at 150 grams.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.960
The C6 is a fairly sophisticated bit of kit,
but Nokia's naming convention puts it just

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.861
one place about the mass-market C5 which indicates
that Nokia are aiming the C6 squarely at the

00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:24.920
upper midrange market. The price is very appealing
too.. all this technology comes in at just

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.490
â‚¬220 before tax and subsidy.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.610
The C6 is hardly a radical phone, it's simply
an improvement and evolution of what Nokia

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.170
have produced before.. and this is probably
what gives the phone its appeal. Nokia say

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.360
that the C6 should be available during Q2
2010 in black and white colour schemes.
