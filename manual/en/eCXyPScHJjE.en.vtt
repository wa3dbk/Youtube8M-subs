00:00:00.528 --> 00:00:07.528
The Jagdtiger 8,8 German Tank Destroyer is a real monster.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.576
Large and powerful,

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:13.911
solid and… slow!

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.969
Well, everything is relative.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.115
The sheer size of this German vehicle will give you confidence.

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:31.011
This is not some scrawny tank destroyer, this is a true giant!

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.128
It’s true, you can’t expect to be invisible

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.086
on the battlefield in something this big.

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:37.519
But, to be honest, you won’t need to be!

00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:40.346
They might spot the Jagdtiger — ok, fine.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.756
But just let them try to penetrate it!

00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:47.099
Its front armour can cause intense frustration

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.902
for almost any vehicle you meet in a battle,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.243
especially because the Jagdtiger 8,8 gets preferential matchmaking.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.651
You won’t face opponents higher than Tier IX.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.359
Having such nice armour on your front,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.846
naturally you’ll have weaker points at your sides and rear.

00:01:04.053 --> 00:01:05.770
That’s not a surprise to you, is it?

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:09.307
Hiding your weak points from the enemy

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.767
is one of the most important skills in the game.

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:14.559
Delivering fire effectively is perhaps the only skill more important.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:16.886
Speaking of delivering fire…

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:23.420
The Jagdtiger’s gun is pure pleasure.

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.151
Nice fire rate.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.406
Nice armour penetration.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.137
Nice aiming time.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:32.026
It’s accurate enough to hit a squirrel’s eye,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.450
or an unprotected turret hatch, at 100m —

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.101
whichever of those you need to hit.

00:01:37.378 --> 00:01:38.801
Its damage per minute…

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:44.834
ah, its damage per minute is almost 2700 points.

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:48.802
That’s one of the top three DPMs of any Tier VIII vehicle!

00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:54.678
All in all, this is a mighty vehicle with an iron nose

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.534
and a gun that is fantastic in every respect.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.631
You already know you want one for yourself…

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.200
JagdTiger 8.8. Made in Germany.
