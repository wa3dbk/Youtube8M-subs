RYAN LARSON: So now, that we have all these
chords down and we wrote all these information

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.669
down at home, we can go through and play through
this whole piece like a breeze. I'm going

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:15.190
to do that right now. I'll call out the chords
as I play it, right? Three, flat 3 and this

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:38.280
is 7th chord, 2 minor, flat 2. Again 3, flat
3, 2, flat 2, 2, 5, 7 to flat 3--oh no, wait--5

00:00:38.280 --> 00:01:05.050
to flat 7 to flat 3 to flat 6 to flat 3, then
we went to 4 minor, flat 7, 3 major. Then

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:56.600
we're at the top of the 4, right? And that's
the whole piece of the chorus. I ended on

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.389
the 1 and we should have went back to the
top of the 4. That's okay. So go through and

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:04.540
then you have all these information down and
under your fingers and make sure you just

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.739
really get it embedded into your brain so
you can go through and do this to any tune

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.510
in any Real Book that's written in B.
