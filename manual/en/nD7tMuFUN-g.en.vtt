00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.319
It's long and skinny like a tube and has huge
pectoral fins because it lives in the open

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.459
ocean!

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:19.439
I'm Jonathan Bird, and this is Shark Academy!

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.679
I'm a Blue shark and I've got huge pectoral
fins.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.679
You know why?

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.160
Because sharks sink and they have little airplane
wings to keep them from sinking.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.310
And the bigger your airplane wings, the slower
you can swim!

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.940
We're talking ginormous pectoral fins…so
they can cruise slowly in the open ocean.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610
That's what makes a Blue shark so pelagic.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.010
A pelagic animal is an animal that lives far
from shore in the open ocean where the water

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.580
is really really deep.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.230
They have no swim bladder.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.790
Straight to the bottom of the ocean if they
stop swimming.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.890
And those pectoral fins act like airplane
wings, keeping that shark soaring along, without

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.050
sinking way down there in the deep ocean.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.860
You might wonder…why are they called Blue
sharks?

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.040
The back of a Blue shark is very very blue.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.650
It's iridescent blue.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.650
But you know what's weird?

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.429
When you look at the underside of a Blue shark,
it's white.

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:13.990
This is called countershading.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.119
Countershading is a camouflage technique used
by sharks in open where where their dorsal

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.630
surface is darker, and their ventral surface
is lighter to help them to be harder to see

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.540
either from above or below.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.720
Biologists have put tags into Blue sharks.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.330
What they have learned about Blue sharks is
that they travel thousands of miles over the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.330
year.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.259
In fact, sharks that have been tagged in New
England have turned up in Portugal and all

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.259
over Europe.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.049
They have turned up in the Caribbean, and
they have even come all the way around back

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.689
to New England making these huge annual migrations
between pupping grounds and feeding grounds.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.179
Blue sharks are so skinny that they even make
me look fat, which is really hard to do because

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.000
I am wicked svelte if you know what I'm saying!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.929
Blue sharks are so skinny that they fit between
the bars of most shark cages, so there's no

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.260
purpose to even being in the cage with a Blue
shark, because it's very unlikely that a Blue

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.330
shark will bite you.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.170
On the internet it said that Blue sharks are
not dangerous at all, but that one time I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.450
was diving with them and they bit my finger
off, that was not cool man.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.170
I'm just kidding it's still there.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.340
Blue sharks live in the open ocean first of
all.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.830
They are far from land.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.000
People are not generally out swimming 100
miles off shore.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.490
You don't look like food!

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.570
You’re a human!

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.390
They eat like fish and squid and stuff.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.600
They're not interested in you.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600
You're ugly.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.880
You smell, you swim funny.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.330
They don't bite people.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.580
Unless you are in a shipwreck, it's very unlikely
you are ever going to see a Blue shark.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.050
As a result, Blue sharks are simply not that
dangerous to people.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.430
They are almost never implicated in shark
attacks.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.230
The Blue Shark's whole purpose in life is
to be cute.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.550
It's what they do.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.870
They're like…kitty cats.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.010
Blue sharks are viviparous.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.070
Viviparous man!

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.070
Viviparous!

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.400
Which means that they produce live offspring.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.150
