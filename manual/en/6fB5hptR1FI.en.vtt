00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.710
Stretching is another very important part
of cheerleading. You want to stretch so you

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.440
don't pull any of your muscles. To begin,
we're going to start out by rolling our wrists.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.840
You're going to roll both of your wrists together
and your ankles. Second thing is that you're

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.490
going to want to stretch all of your major
muscle groups. Your arms first. You can reach

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.730
one over the other and pull it straight. Both
arms of your right and left arm. They're going

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.400
to go up and over. You're going to pull it
back to stretch out those muscles back there

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.240
just like that. Another thing you can do is
you're going to reach to the side, your right

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.760
side of your leg, reach down, hold that position
for a while, then switch sides, go to your

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.039
left, then you're going to reach down the
middle. Reach right down in the middle to

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.680
stretch out those back legs. Good. Now, we
can roll our neck too. You're going to roll

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.690
to the right, to the left, back, and front.
That again stretches all your muscles here

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.949
so you don't pull anything while you're doing
your cheerleading. To continue our stretch,

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.310
we're going to head on to the ground in saddle
position like this. Both legs are going to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.979
be straight out and you're going to reach
over to the right. You're going to want to

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.310
stretch all 3 of your muscles groups; the
right, the left, and the center. The next

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.960
position is we're going to go to pie position,
that means both leg go forward. You're going

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.480
to point those little toes and reach forward.
Grab them real good. The next thing you want

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.470
to do is flex the toes to pull them back.
You're going to stretch that calf muscle right

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.869
down here. Good. Next thing is butterfly position.
You're going to pull your legs in almost like

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.880
a pretzel we call that. You're going to press
down those knees real tight. Good. The next

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.329
thing we do is called pose. You're going to
put one leg over your other leg like that.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.430
Put your arm back behind that knee and stretch
the back and your leg. It works the back right

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.130
here and your leg muscle.
