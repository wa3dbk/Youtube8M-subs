Evolution Series Floor Box - Raised &amp; Wood
Floors

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.139
This video will show you how to install an
Evolution Series Floor Box into a raised or

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.020
wood floor, so you can begin to bring large
quantities of power, communications, and audio/video

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.040
devices into any open-space application.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.640
The tools you'll need to complete the installation
are: a drill, both a Phillips and a flathead

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:35.290
screwdriver, a hammer, lyman pliers, electrical
tape, 8 30 second nut driver, an adjustable

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.290
wrench, and a tape measure.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.690
To start, position the floor box in accordance
with your job site floor plans or your engineering

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.170
blue print.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.440
Determine the wiring path of your box and
remove the appropriate knockouts.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.379
Mark and cut a hole in the wood floor or raised
floor panels based on the dimensions needed.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.670
Measure the hole to make sure the box will
fit properly.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.940
The hole should by 15 3/8" by 11 9/16".

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.020
Next, remove the cover by unscrewing the 4
screws and lifting the cover off the boss.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.640
Remove the modules by unscrewing the screws
that secures the modules to the base of the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.490
box.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.400
Lower the box into the hole cut on the floor.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.550
At the front and back sides of the box are
adjustable toggle clamps that are used to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.230
secure the box to the floor.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.260
The clamps are positioned to allow for up
to 1 and a half inch thick floors.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.210
Tighten the clamps so that the box is held
securely to the floor.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.220
Remove the knockouts from the plates with
the device modules and attach the appropriate

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.070
cable fittings to the plates with the modules.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.910
Cable fittings are sold separately.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.640
Attach devices to mounting brackets using
the fasteners provided with the devices, and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.350
reattach the backplate to the module using
the screws provided.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.480
Attach flexible cabling and terminate to appropriate
devices.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.610
Now, you'll be ready to reinstall the module
into the box.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.980
Reinstall modules into the box by placing
them in and twisting upward.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.820
Replace the screw provided to fasten the module
to the base of the box.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.390
Next, attach the wire guides to the sides
of the box.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.290
Reattach the protective cover until you're
ready to install the finish cover.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.819
Complete your installation by attaching an
Evolution Series Floor Box cover (sold separately)

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.409
with the instructions supplied with the cover.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.299
That completes your installation of the Evolution
Series Floor Box.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.959
Your box is now ready to supply power, communications,
or A/V wherever it is needed.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.340
One box, works everywhere, changes everything.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.779
Legrand -- designed to be better.â„¢
