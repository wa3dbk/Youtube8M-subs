00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.820
The all-new Dodge Dart and I got off to somewhat
of an inauspicious start last summer when

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.080
I tested a Limited model with the optional
turbo and standard stickshift; far from a

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.060
winning combination.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.440
But this time around I've got the racier GT
model, a late addition to the Dart lineup

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.720
powered by the biggest Tigershark engine.Initially
destined to be the Dart R/T, a high performance

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.230
model which the company is said to be still
considering, Dodge threw everyone a curveball

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.010
and delivered this GT model instead -- identical
in every way to the planned R/T model except

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:53.329
with a lower price, wearing a base MSRP of
$20,995.This Alfa Romeo in disguise restores

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.100
life to Chrysler Group's dormant compact sedan
offering and the 2013 GT is slotted as the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.200
top dog in a 5 trim lineup which starts at
a sub-$17,000 SE model.But contrary to the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.780
mismatched 1.4-liter turbo and 6-speed manual
which made driving the Dart Limited a chore,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.369
this GT model runs with the normally breathing
2.4-liter 4-cylinder with nearly 25 more horses.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.590
Rated at 184 horsepower and 174 pound feet
of torque, this mill may lose some low-end

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.979
to the turbo but without the lag present it
feels much livelier and plays substantially

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340
better with the 6-speed auto.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.380
And this isn't the dual clutch transmission
that's optional with the turbo, instead it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.100
a traditional automatic with the preferred
north-south AutoStick manual shifting.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.899
And though MPG numbers drop precipitously
with this GT powertrain, you can feed it regular

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.719
gas while the turbo prefers premium.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:04.119
Still, it's rated at 21mpg city/30mpg highway
and my weekly average was right at the EPA's

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.259
combined estimate.Now this is the Dart to
have.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.360
With its unique frequency damping shocks,
more power, quicker steering and an excellent

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.840
PowerTech transmission, the GT is a much more
satisfying and athletic drive.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
And the more aggressive Conti rubber really
aids in the handling.Though the ride quality

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.019
becomes decidedly more firm and at times will
rattle you around, the GT heightens its connection

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.220
to the driver, bites harder when pushed and
brakes with authority.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.750
It's a pleasure to drive and the MultiAir
engine and sport-minded transmission combine

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.819
to make a unique, let's go soundtrack which
permeates the otherwise quiet cabin.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.049
The GT won't blow you away with its power
delivery from a standstill but its reaction

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.680
times in the midranges are enough to push
you back in the seat.Similar to the Limited

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.060
model, the GT also offers up an impressive
interior design with rich quality, high tech

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.930
and thoughtful touches.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.609
It looks expensive and when optioned like
this one comes with a wide array of amenities

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.620
such as remote start with heated seats and
steering wheel, the best infotainment unit

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.511
in the biz with the 8.4" UConnect system which
is info packed and works intuitively, auto

00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:31.040
high beams, rain sensing wipers and blind
spot monitor with cross path detection.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.260
For all you see here, the $25,620 as tested
price is extremely reasonable and for that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.620
you also get the great GT looks including
the LED racetrack tail lamps.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.680
It just goes to show how a single trim level
can take on a completely distinctive flavor

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.489
from the rest of the nameplate.
