00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.550
Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.940
I'm Chance, and welcome
back to Advice With Chance.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.690
Today, our topic is going
to be about mistakes.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.380
In recent times,
my life has just

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.944
been absorbed with me making
just mistake after mistake.

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:21.110
It seemed like I couldn't
dig myself out of the hole

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.770
that I dug myself into.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.015
I just kept digging
myself deeper.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:26.890
The reason why I made
all these mistakes is I

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.610
just try living too
fast and in the moment.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.720
I got careless and forgot
to slow down and think

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.790
about what I was actually doing.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.030
A very wise history teacher
of mine once told me this.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.690
He says, Chance, the
idiots in this world

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.385
keep making the same mistakes.

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:44.800
The smart ones, they
learn from their mistakes

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.161
and find ways to prevent
the mistakes in the future.

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.250
Now, when he told me
this, I was overwhelmed,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.210
and I had to think about
it for a long time.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
But I knew I'd never forget
these insightful and incredible

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.662
words because these words
are the exact truth.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.860
It is too often that we as
humans have too much pride

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.370
to acknowledge our mistakes
or don't give enough thought

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.550
towards learning from
what they did wrong.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.050
I mean, isn't that why most
relationships are torn apart,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.140
why fights start, why the
global crime rate is rising,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.990
why wars are started?

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.670
We need to take the extra
time to focus on our errors

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.850
rather than focus our blame
on others for our hardships.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.620
We have to realize, no
matter how hard anyone tries,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.990
no one will ever be perfect.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.530
We have to make mistakes
in order to grow.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590
It's inevitable.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.550
I myself am guilty
trying to be perfect.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.600
I've had the tendency
of beating myself

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.750
into the ground for
the things I do wrong.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.000
And I've dwelled in
my own self-pity.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.740
But I've learned, through both
the consolation of the ones I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.300
love and through my own
acceptance of myself,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.650
that what I was doing was wrong
and was actually blocking me

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.010
from growing as a person.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.730
Although it's natural for us to
feel guilty and beat ourselves

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.650
up, it is one of the
most destructive things

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.270
we can do to ourselves.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.800
The things we did in
the past are over with.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.530
Yeah, it may still affect
your present and the future,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.910
but we can't just
wallow in the past.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.650
Everything will
sort its way out.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.920
I mean, it may not seem
like it, but it will.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.750
It slowly is for me, but I
know it will sort its way out.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.999
What we got to do is focus
on making ourselves happy.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.540
We got to focus on
the things that we

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.040
could do different
in life to prevent us

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.820
from repeating
the same mistakes.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.190
We got to focus on building
ourselves a better future.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.640
This is all really simple, yet
every decision that we make

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.020
adds to the complexity.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.520
The message that I really want
to send out to you guys today

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.038
is this.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:53.140
Look, you're never going to
be perfect, so stop trying.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.465
Just be the best
person you can be.

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:57.290
And it's OK to make mistakes.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.160
In fact, as long as you learn
from them, I encourage them.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.840
Because that is really what life
is all about, making mistakes

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.530
and learning from them.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.760
Don't be an idiot of this world.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.110
And remember to give love and
effort from all your heart.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.655
I'm Chance.

00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:16.780
This is Advice With Chance.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.300
Thanks for watching.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.800
Bye.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:04:03.437
