00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.120
let

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.310
straw you freedom lovers libertarian
style out there

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.879
i know you don't consider a rick perry
to be pure libertarian

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.019
but uh...

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.099
but one thing he does share will gerry
chances with guns

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.339
and as i understand that uh...

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.189
we gotta be free carry around

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.760
weapons of

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.589
of killing weapons

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.829
and uh... here is rick perry

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.380
talking to is uh...

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.760
he's been it in texas seven as a
reporter repairing

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.870
uh... come out

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.720
with a solution for what happened for
the the horrible tragedy happened in

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.670
uh... newt

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.369
have access to

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.509
uh... to weapons in in their school and
and that pilot the crowd of about ten

00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:00.659
o'clock when governor perry even alluded
to on in texas teachers speak that he'd

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.920
in favor of letting local school
districts defied guns on campuses

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.140
could mean paper campuses speaking to
the northeast tarrant county tea party

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.440
so we're gonna lal

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.690
local school officials to make the
determination of this uh... this notion

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.530
of whether or not guns

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.980
in their particular schools are a good
idea

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850
that doesn't seem to be a terribly
thoughtful process i wonder how much

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
statistical knowledge each one of these
principles are gonna have about the the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.970
a relative safety that is involved in
having everybody armed to the teeth

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.170
in their schools

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.560
but of course he's uh... talking to the
uh... tea party gazans so uh...

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.430
we'll see

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.659
we would do that

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.970
four days after a young gunmen killed
twenty children

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.360

the massacre in evil but that need your
