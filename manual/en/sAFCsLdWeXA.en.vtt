vat19 presents a speed
dating love story.

00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:04.220
[DING]

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.060
OK, switch partners everyone.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.300
Well, you sure are the
prettiest girl I've ever seen.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.090
You're like a dolphin,
leaping into the sunset.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.446
Man, your skin looks so smooth.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:17.920
Can I touch it?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.000
[DING]

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.716
You know, I'd be
very good for you.

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:27.572
[FART]

00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:28.536
[DING]

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:32.670
[SLURPING]

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.290
I get around salads,
stuffings, just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.990
the other day I had
turkey for lunch.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.172
Gobble, gobble.

00:00:43.172 --> 00:00:44.134
[DING]

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:47.370
[DING]

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.870
[SIGH]

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.580
Well, I just got out of
a serious relationship.

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:56.740
There I go over sharing
again, Lamb hated that.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.455
But, I guess I'm ready to
jump back into something.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.109
No I'm not, no I'm not.

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:07.810
I'm sorry.

00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:09.738
Lamb!

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:15.080
[DING]

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.646
Yeah, I know, I'm huge.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:19.446
[DING]

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.820
Anchovies aren't
really my thing.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.350
What do you mean
you don't like me?

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.874
You never even tried me!

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.040
You know, someday there's
gonna be a restaurant that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.248
serves nothing but anchovies!

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.150
[DING]

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.600
Well, I live in my
parents basement.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.060
My friends call me the sack.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.676
[DING]

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:45.420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330
Aren't you gonna sit down?

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.882
Sweetie, I don't think
you can handle me.

00:01:49.882 --> 00:01:51.090
I'll just give you heartburn.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.030
I have a dark side too.

00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.580
Hey.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.410
I'm Tabasco.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.960
Tabasco and dark chocolate make
an unexpectedly delicious pair.
