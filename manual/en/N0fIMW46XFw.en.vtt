00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.603
(soft tune)

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.921
(cat screeches)

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:14.745
(laughter)

00:00:14.745 --> 00:00:16.130
- Yes, it is a kitten video

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.681
and yes we are talking
about the science behind it.

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:19.926
- Because it's not just cute,

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.193
this is an ounce of insight
into the energy management

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:24.352
of cold and warm blooded organisms.

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:26.409
(swooshing)

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.967
(soft tune)

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:30.433
- [Julie] Kitten here's no King Kong

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.957
and these bearded lizards
certainly aren't Godzilla,

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:34.874
but they're less than climatic encounter

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:36.585
underscores some of the major differences

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.576
between team warm blood
and team cold blood.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:40.867
- [Robert] Let's talk about mammals.

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:43.278
We have mammary glands to pump our young

00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:44.548
full of nutricius milk.

00:00:44.548 --> 00:00:46.825
We have furry coats and
a warm-blooded system

00:00:46.825 --> 00:00:48.611
that keeps us running at
a constant temperature

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:50.674
regardless of what the
environment's doing.

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:52.671
So we can remain active for long periods,

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.756
super alert to threats posed
by alien floor creatures.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.251
- [Julie] But being an endotherm
is far from a cake walk.

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.141
Our regulated temperatures
come at a steep energy price,

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.176
it's like maintaining a
constant 70 degree temperature

00:01:04.176 --> 00:01:06.118
in a fancy office building.

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:07.511
- [Robert] So we're constantly eating

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:09.344
and eating and eating.

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.853
- [Julie] Meanwhile,
cold-blooded animals, ectotherms,

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:16.188
enjoy improved energy efficiency
because they don't have to

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:19.159
burn off stored energy to
maintain their body temperatures

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.936
and they can survive longer
periods without food.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.497
- [Robert] So our bearded
lizard friends here

00:01:23.497 --> 00:01:26.555
literally keep their cool
while kitten flips its lid.

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.384
They conserve their
energy, saving their burst

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:30.627
for when it's absolutely
necessary, but they're always

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:32.619
at the mercy of environmental temperature.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.954
Cold air means slowed muscles

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:36.010
and even a slower immune system.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.294
- [Julie] Your body regulates
its own heat at 98.6 degrees

00:01:39.294 --> 00:01:41.987
fahrenheit, 37 degrees
celsius, while ectotherms

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:44.319
use their environment
to regulate temperature

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.795
like say a lizard
warming itself in the sun

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.794
and this drastically limits
where ectotherms can live.

00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:51.413
- [Robert] If you visit
a temperate enough region

00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:54.853
such as say Hawaii, you'll find
plenty of ectothermic houses

00:01:54.853 --> 00:01:57.331
where people manage just fine
without artificial heating

00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.273
and air conditioning.

00:01:58.273 --> 00:01:59.855
They simply roll with the limited changes

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:01.252
in environmental temperature.

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:02.971
- [Julie] Of course they
may also get wall lizards

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.965
from time to time.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:06.134
- Clearly that's not a
problem inside the area.

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:08.330
So are you still a proud
member of team warm blood?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.743
Or do you think you'd like to
give team cold blood a try?

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:11.576
What do you think?

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:12.620
