hi welcome to Le Gourmet TV today we're
going to be making pork and sauerkraut

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
in a slow cooker eat it on New Year's
Day it's thought to bring you good luck

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.570
in the new year
so start by putting our pork into our

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:22.439
slow cooker pot. I'm going to clean my
hands now all gunky alright so I'm going

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.019
to add some caraway seed and some
sauerkraut which I picked up from a

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.780
local deli now this is the base of the
recipe now me I like to have a little

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:48.059
extra onion and because I find the
sauerkraut to be a bit strong for me I'm

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.050
gonna add an apple

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.410
doesn't have to be cut too fine just put it
in there so now we're gonna cook it on

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.710
high for one hour and then we're gonna
turn it down to low and cook it for an

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:49.979
additional five to six hours getting the
pork up to 160ยบ F all right so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.950
there you have it slow cooker pork and
sauerkraut serve it up with some

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.869
potatoes maybe a few vegetables you like
I may have beer with mine enjoy
