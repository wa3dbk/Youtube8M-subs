00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:11.589
(rock music)

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.728
(heavy breathing)

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:25.698
(somber music)

00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:27.177
Voiceover: A professional
ballet dancer's job

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.448
is extremely physically demanding

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:31.312
and much like professional athletes,

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:34.400
a serious injury cannot
only keep them from dancing,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.796
it could end their career in an instant.

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:39.112
Voiceover: I came down from
a jump and my back went.

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:40.646
Voiceover: It's the
worst fear for a dancer.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:42.808
Voiceover: My neck was so bad,
I couldn't move my right arm.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.265
Voiceover: I tore an ACL on my right knee,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:45.853
I've had a stress
fracture in my lower back.

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:46.953
Voiceover: Am I going to be okay?

00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:48.056
Will I still be able to dance this role?

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:49.954
Voiceover: I didn't know if I was
going to be able to come back.

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:51.704
Georgina: Being injured sucks, regardless

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.003
of where it happens in your career,

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.104
because you feel like you're missing out.

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:57.364
It doesn't matter if you're a principal,

00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:59.558
if you're a soloist,
if you're senior corps.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.836
You're essentially not performing

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:04.409
and someone else is
stepping into your roles

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.865
and most of the time you get them back,

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.664
sometimes you don't and
that's not usually the case,

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:11.897
but that's always a fear every dancer has,

00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:15.140
that they're going to
be completely replaced.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.905
Voiceover: After finally getting
her corps de ballet contract

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:20.892
with the company, Claire
sustains a stress fracture,

00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:22.936
just two weeks into the season.

00:01:22.936 --> 00:01:25.375
Claire: This is my first
time I've been really injured

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.827
to the point where I couldn't be dancing

00:01:27.827 --> 00:01:30.320
and it's not like I can
just dance through it,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.536
since it's the bone, it's
something that you actually have

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:38.104
to just rest and let heal, so
that has been really difficult.

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:42.482
I'm not used to taking time off when
things are still starting back up

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:45.026
and when things are happening.

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:47.065
Right now I'm not taking
class, I'm not doing anything.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.666
I'm just trying to stay off of
it and I'm going to be missing

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.553
pretty much all of fall season.

00:01:52.553 --> 00:01:55.529
It's frustrating, because
I just am starting back

00:01:55.529 --> 00:02:00.171
and this is my chance to prove
myself and now I'm injured.

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.954
(music)

00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:06.290
I've been sitting in on
certain rehearsals right now,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.314
because they're teaching
a lot of new things,

00:02:08.314 --> 00:02:12.058
but I'll probably start to
stand in on certain rehearsals

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:14.626
in flat shoes, just to be learning things,

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.976
and not be falling behind.

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:19.185
I've gotten some advice from older dancers

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.276
and that means a lot, because you're like,

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:25.489
"Okay, I'm not the only one
who's been through this."

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.194
Obviously, but sometimes
it feels like that.

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:30.443
Giovanni: Injury is a
part of a dancer's life,

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:32.681
just because of the physical
nature of what we do

00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:37.837
and the wear and tear and the
fact that what we do is unnatural.

00:02:37.837 --> 00:02:40.793
The body was never meant to
be in the first position.

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.509
You're turning the hips
in a very awkward way.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.204
You're placing stress in
certain joints in your body

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:47.611
and when you multiply that

00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.461
times however many
hours we've trained for,

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.859
you realize the potential for injury

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.450
is all around the corner, it's everywhere.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.298
Chase: This is tedious and it
sucks, but I know it'll be okay.

00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:05.939
It's just time consuming
and just in the middle of -

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.755
For Christ's sake, it's the
first week of season. (laughs)

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:12.371
It was during my second
show and I just had

00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.038
a lot of good stuff
lined up for the season.

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:19.012
I went from best shape of
my life to out in one jump.

00:03:19.012 --> 00:03:21.756
You just never know, it's just part of it.

00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:24.111
It sucks, but what are you going to do?

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.541
What can you do?

00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.445
It's broken, it's not like you
can deny that, it's broken.

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:34.057
I'm going to go sit on my ass and
watch football and drink a beer.

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:35.656
Megan: I lost a lot of
confidence in my dancing

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:38.381
when I went through all of my injuries

00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:41.021
and that really bothered
me, but I knew the only way

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:46.120
for it to come back, I knew it
wasn't gone, that I can get back,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.222
the only way to do it
was just wait it out.

00:03:48.222 --> 00:03:54.781
(music)

00:03:54.781 --> 00:04:03.910
(machine sounds)

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.445
Craig: I ruptured my
achilles tendon on stage.

00:04:06.445 --> 00:04:10.757
I did my dance and the very last
jump off stage my achilles snapped.

00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:12.992
I heard it, it was like a carrot snapping.

00:04:12.992 --> 00:04:17.459
It was a sound that I, for a
while, couldn't get out of my head.

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:20.148
Fear came into my head.

00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:24.443
I freaked out big time,
because as an older dancer,

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:28.371
I knew that I didn't have many years left.

00:04:28.371 --> 00:04:31.107
I didn't have ten years left to dance.

00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:34.725
A year is a lifetime for a dancer.

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:37.805
I'm still at the point where
seeing people do those big jumps

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:41.362
and for a split second I don't
know how they're doing it

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:44.707
and it's just in my head a little bit.

00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:46.197
When you're out and you're hurting,

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:48.899
it's more painful to come
and watch other people

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.767
doing the thing that you love
so much and you can't do it.

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:57.467
I am coming back tomorrow,
but I'm still not there yet.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.779
I'm still at the beginning of
jumping and figuring things out,

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:05.312
but I still don't know if I'll be
able to jump as high as I did before

00:05:05.312 --> 00:05:11.410
or move as quickly, so we'll
see what my body can take

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.059
and hopefully I will fall back into
place, everything will be okay,

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:21.186
but this is still something
that's not definite.

00:05:21.742 --> 00:05:23.781
I've been doing this for 14 years now.

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.792
When you're younger,
you're able to jump back

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:29.526
and do things more easy,
but the longer I wait,

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:32.945
it's not just my achilles, but
it's my back, and it's my knees

00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:38.154
and can you do this again,
do you want to do this at 34?

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.615
I do.

00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:44.835
(music)
