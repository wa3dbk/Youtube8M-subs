00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.930
Whassup, everybody.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.799
My name is Kid Glyde.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.879
I'm the leader of the Dynamic Rockers, pretty
famous B-Boy.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.200
I travel around the world, I organize events.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.670
I've been dancing for 15 years.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.359
So I think I'm pretty credible to teach you.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:24.070
Be positive, be strong, let's do it.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.170
Swipes!

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.410
Man, this move I love so much — me and this
move go way back.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.730
This was like the first power move I learned;
it was the first power move I learned.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.230
But anyways, swipes.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.320
Basic position, right here.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320
Ok?

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.970
It looks funny, but like I said, exaggerate.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.660
You have to exaggerate.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.180
Alright, your legs opened up, knees bent.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.570
I'm in a based where I can't really move,
right; my left hand is down.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.340
Once again it's not on my palm, it's on my
fingertips, okay?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.340
Bam.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.180
My waist is up, my hand is up.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.600
Now, what we are going to work on first is
just jumping up, alright?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.080
That's all you got to do — keep doing it.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.420
Trust me; you are going to need this.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Jump.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.790
Jump even higher.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.020
Jump even higher, hold it.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.130
There you go.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.909
Now once you get that you want to try something
a little bit more daring.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.759
As soon as you jump you are going to let go
with your left hand and jump to your right,

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.759
bam.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.490
Both hands are on the floor, alright?

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.740
As soon as you have both your hands on the
floor you can kind of briefly hold yourself-real

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.170
quick, and the go over your back hand and
then turn to get back into that same position

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.750
that you just saw me in, alright?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.760
So you're going to jump and turn, alright?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.590
So let's just work on the jump and turn.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.360
Okay, so jump, turn, alright?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.320
Once you get that you are going to turn all
the way, alright?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.860
So jump, turn, freeze, okay?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.060
That's a swipe.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.099
You might not get it the first time, but I
know everybody tends to do this first: turn

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.620
then jump, because it's easy.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.459
Watch how easy this looks.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.459
Looks easy right?

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.180
This doesn't look easy, but it looks way,
way cooler, alright?

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.629
So, to get a perfect swipe, you have to jump
first.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:39.620
It's like a brief second when you jump and
then turn, but jump — you need the height.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.950
So, practice the jump over and over and over
again.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.903
It's a fear-based move, but once you get it,
trust me, you won't be scared anymore, okay?

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:53.010
So you are going to jump, turn, jump, turn
and that's swipes.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.140
Don't be scared.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.959
Get it, it's worth it.
