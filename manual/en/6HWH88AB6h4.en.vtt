00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.510
Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm checking out Raxiom's chrome and smoked

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.090
projector headlights, fitting all 94-98 Mustangs.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.699
Raxiom is currently the industry leader in
producing a wide variety of cool and stylish

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.820
lighting for your Mustang, all backed by a
full 2 year warranty.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.360
These lights from Raxiom are definitely for
the SN95 owner out there who enjoys more of

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.730
an aftermarket type of look, these lights
have been designed to replace the 2 piece

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.180
factory lights, using a sleek 1 piece housing
available in your choice of either smoked

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
or chrome.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.310
Taking a closer look at the smoked option
here on our 98 GT, you can see they achieved

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.280
that aggressive appearance by pairing a black
housing with a dark smoked lens.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.180
On the other hand the chrome option achieves
that bright clean look, by utilizing a chrome

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.920
housing along with a crystal clear lens.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.430
As for that more aftermarket type of look
I just mentioned, you can see why: these lights

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.110
feature a more modern projector style light
which besides looking cool, is going to produce

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.080
a brighter, more focused beam of light.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.890
In order to further increase the modern styling,
Raxiom has also included some very cool halo

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.729
accent lighting, which surrounds the projector
itself.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.990
When the whole package is in action, it definitely
gives the front end a very unique look to

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.490
say the least.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.520
These lights do include both 9005 bulbs for
your high beams, and H3 bulbs for your low

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.940
beams, along with the quick splice connectors
needed for the install.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.100
Speaking of the installation, you will need
to wire in the halos and accent lighting to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.659
your cars parking lights, either using the
supplied quick splice connectors or a soldering

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.659
iron.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.540
Other than that, everything else is completely
plug and play, and should only take you about

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.440
an hour from start to finish.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.130
Whether you're into the bright clean styling
of the chrome housing, or the more sinister

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.600
look of the smoked, one thing is for sure,
these lights from Raxiom will alter the look

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.619
of any SN95 and they can be found right here
at AmericanMuscle.com
