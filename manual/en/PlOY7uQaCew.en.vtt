00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.370
After you've selected a color, you've got to
figure out how much paint to buy.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.680
It's important to purchase enough paint
to complete your project

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.770
but without a large amount of leftover
product. To estimate the amount of paint needed for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.820
your project, follow the steps in this
section

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.030
or visit www.behr.com to use the handy
paint calculator.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.680
One gallon of exterior Behr Premium Plus

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.850
Ultra Paint Primer in One or Behr
Premium Plus paint

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.910
enough to cover 250 to 400 square feet
of surface area

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.300
with one coat, quarts, are available a
smaller amount product is needed.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.630
Five gallon pails are available if you are
painting a very large area.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.540
Many factors determine the number of
coats will take to cover your existing

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.210
surface.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.290
You may require more paint if you're
painting a porous surface,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.540
a rough or textured surface, a
previously

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.700
unpainted surface or if you're making a
dramatic color change.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.100
Choosing a deeper intense color may
require multiple coats

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.299
or the use of a tinted primer. Behr colors
that require a tinted primer

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.709
or multiple coats are marked with the
symbol on the color chip.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:11.810
You may require less paint if you are
painting a smooth surface,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.969
primed or sealed surface, if you are not
making a dramatic color change

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.009
or have a house with many on unpaintable
features, such as

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.020
window panes or decorative stone. Your
application method will

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.539
also affect the amount of paint needed.
To estimate the size of the house body,

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.749
first, measure the perimeter the house.
The perimeter of

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:36.829
this house is 128 feet. Next, measure the
height a house from the foundation to

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:37.630
the roof line,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.439
excluding gables. The height of this house is 18 feet.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.240
Now, multiply the perimeter of the home
by the height.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.340
An average window is 15 square feet.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.679
An average door, is 20 square feet. You
can subtract

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.829
doors and windows from your wall area
calculation, for a more

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.159
accurate estimate. If you have gables,

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.489
multiply the width of the gable by its
height and divide by

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.330
two. Do this for each gable.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
Add this to the body. Remember,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.410
each gallon of paint cover roughly 250 to
400 square feet.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.990
To put two coats of paint on this smooth
siding, we'll need 12 gallons a body-color.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.080
As a rule of thumb, you'll need one gallon
of paint

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.880
for trimming gutters per eight gallons
body paint. If you'd like to be more precise,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.780
measure the linear feet guttering the
project, each linear foot of gutter

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.390
approximately one square foot.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.830
In this example, there are two hundred
feet gutter. If you're painting the trim the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.850
same color, add or estimate all the length of trim

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.210
for your entire house for a total length.
For example,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.600
you might have 453 feet of trim various types.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.620
One estimate of trim width is six inches
wide

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.170
or half a foot. Your trim may be wider
or narrower

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.310
but this provider estimate. Multiply your
total trim length by 0.5 feet. This house

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.290
is approximately

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.860
225 square feet trim. Add the trim and the
gutter calculations together.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.270
This house has a total of 425 square
feet.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.320
So we'll need, two and a half gallon to
paint

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.630
to put two coats on the gutters and trim.
Doors are easy to estimate,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.300
multiplied the width and the height, for the
number square feet. This door

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.340
seven feet by three feet or 21 square feet.
So,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.670
one quart is enough paint to apply two
coats, to both sides at the door.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.200
This is the basic information you need
for determining how much paint to

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.330
buy. Remember, as a shortcut, you can also
use the handy

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.319
online paint calculator on www.behr.com.
