Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.731
Today, as you know, it’s the holiday season!
So we’re gonna be making something

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:21.921
holiday themed, something to keep up warm!

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.691
We’re gonna be making some hot cocoa! And,
for the first on Nerdy Nummies,

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:30.461
we’re gonna be making those cute little
cookies called side of the cup cookies.

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:34.651
That sit on the side of your teacup or hot
cocoa cup or coffee cup.

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.271
OK, so let’s get started!

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:42.391
The first thing that we’re gonna do is make
our sugar cookies, and I’m using a

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:46.531
pre-made sugar cookie package, but you can
use your favorite sugar cookie

00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:49.791
recipe if you want to, I’m just doing this
to save time.

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:55.451
So what you’re gonna do is open it up, merp!
Take your big mixing bowl and pour

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.291
your mixture in, berp-boop-boop-boo-boo-boo-booooo!

00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.721
Ba-nee!

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:06.091
Now you’re gonna add 1 egg, and then 1/3
cup of butter.

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:10.711
And then you’re gonna take 1 tablespoon
of flour.

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.421
Now you’re just gonna mix it all together until
everything is evenly combined.

00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:20.281
After I mixed it up in the blender I’m just
using my hands, it’s almost there, it’s

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:24.641
still a little bit sticky so you can just
take a little bit extra flour,

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:28.110
sprinkle it on there, until your cookie dough
isn’t so sticky.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.091
Now you’re just gonna take a little bit
of flour, sprinkle it down on the table

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.400
so that the cookie dough doesn’t stick to
the table.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.601
Spread it around.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:41.481
Boom! Flatten it out, take a rolling pin,
and you’re just gonna roll it flat.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.151
Now you’re gonna take your little 8-Bit
Heart cookie cutter, I bought this at

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:52.091
on online store at Etsy, so I’ll put a link
down below, but you can use

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:56.731
any kind of cookie cutter that you’d like.
They even have side of the cup cookie

00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.281
cutters that already have a built in notch, but I’m
gonna show you how to make it if

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.241
you just want to use a regular cookie cutter.

00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:07.570
Alright, so you’re just gonna cut out a
bunch of hearts, and put the cookies

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.681
on the pan. Once you got all your little 8
bit hearts on the cookie sheet,

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:14.891
what we’re gonna do is cut out the little
notches. All you’re gonna need is a

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:21.001
sharp cutting knife. And what I did, is you’re
just gonna count 1, 2, 3…

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.821
On the 3rd point, we’re gonna cut him out.

00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.230
You're not gonna cut all the way up, you’re just leaving
a little groove for it to sit on

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.261
the side of the cup.

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:32.321
Alright, here we go, I just wanted you guys
to take a look,

00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:36.730
this is what they’ll look like. And now
you’re gonna heat your oven to 350

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.550
and we’re gonna bake these for about 7 minutes.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.161
And you want to keep you eye on them, because
as soon as they start to turn

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.071
golden brown they’re ready!

00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:46.881
And while these are baking we’re gonna head
over to the kitchen and we’re gonna

00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.050
make some heart cocoa!

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.390
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum!

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.140
To make our hot cocoa, the first thing that
you’re gonna do is you're gonna take 2 saucepans

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.990
and put them on the stove. You’re gonna
fill one of them with boiling water,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.080
in the 2nd pan, we’re not gonna turn the
heat on yet, you’re gonna combine

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.010
1/3 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 a cup of regular
sugar, and just a pinch of salt.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.351
Once your dry ingredients are combined you’re
gonna take 1/3 cup of your

00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:19.260
boiling water, and add it to the dry ingredients.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.830
Then you’re gonna turn up the heat to a
slight boil, and stir everything together

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.601
until everythings evenly combined.

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.980
Once your hot cocoa’s at a light boil, you’re
going to turn down your heat, let it

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.450
simmer for 2 minutes, just keep stirring it,
so it gets really thick, and then

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.811
we’re gonna add 3-1/2 cups of milk, and
then stir it in and re-heat it.

00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:43.791
After you add your 3-1/2 cups of milk and
you mix it up, you’re gonna turn

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:46.931
your heat up, but don’t bring it to a boil,
just right underneath.

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:51.101
And also, you can use any kind of milk that
you want, so if you have a

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.251
sensitivity to dairy, you can use soy milk
or almond milk, I’m using

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:58.661
regular milk, but you can use any kind of
milk that you like.

00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.420
Once your cocoa is hot, you’re gonna remove
it from the heat and we’re gonna

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.670
add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.010
That’s the last step!

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:10.371
Ooooh! Now our hot cocoa is ready, let’s
go put it all together!

00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.901
Our hot cocoa’s all ready, our cookies are fresh
out of the oven, make sure

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:17.001
they’ve had plenty of time to cool before
you do this.

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:20.540
A lot of people just leave them plain, and
just stick them on the side of the cup

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.281
just plain, but I’m gonna be adding a little
bit of red frosting on top.

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:30.071
And, this is just red cookie icing, and I
put it in a plastic bag with a number

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:35.511
2 tip, and I’m just gonna be
tracing the inner part of the cookie.

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:40.031
Once you’re all done frosting your cookies,
I took the hot cocoa off the stove,

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:44.851
this recipe makes about 4 cups, and I poured
it into a pot with a little

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:48.671
pour spigot, I’m just gonna pour my hot
cocoa in, be careful, it’s hot.

00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.751
This is optional, I’m just adding 1/8th
a cup of half and half, it will cool

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:56.401
down your hot cocoa just a little bit.

00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:00.791
Now I’m just gonna put a little bit of whipped
cream on the top, because I love whipped

00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:02.851
cream. Or you can do marshmallows!

00:05:03.891 --> 00:05:04.391
Boop!

00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.191
Bewp!

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:09.511
You’re just gonna stick a little cookie
on the side!

00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:12.381
Last but not least, I’m just gonna sprinkle
a little bit of cinnamon on top

00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:14.281
because I love cinnamon!

00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:15.531
Come out! OK!

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:18.651
Ta-da!

00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.671
Here you have it! This is 8-Bit Heart Cocoa,
it was perfect for the holiday season,

00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.821
something nice and warm!

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:29.261

00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:50.471
Oh! Before I forgot, this cute little cup,
I found it at Target, if anybody

00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:55.041
is wondering. With the little red handle and
the red inside, it’s by the brand

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:56.381
Threshold I believe.

00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.341
OK, ah, just trying to be helpful!

00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.521
OK, thanks you guys, bye-bye!
