00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:07.159
So, now that we've got all our zones wired
in...

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:12.308
We were smart enough to
previously do these two knockouts at the top

00:00:12.308 --> 00:00:15.558
right corner of the VISTA-21iP
panel.

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:19.609
The reason they have these knockouts is to
fit in the antenna for

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:20.879
the GSM board.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.988
Obviously, with our clearance here, we're
not going to be

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:27.799
able to have our antenna stick straight up,
but we'll be able to run it

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:28.799
parallel.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:29.799
It'll be okay.

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.728
We've got this little white piece that comes
along with the VISTA-GSM4G

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:39.909
unit, and it just snaps into the top there
and gives us a nice sturdy spot

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:40.909
for the antenna.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.569
We're going to take our GSM.

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:45.159
It came with these three
standoffs.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.028
We popped them off the GSM, and we already
pushed them right

00:00:48.028 --> 00:00:49.028
into these three holes.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.859
So we've got one here, one here, one here.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.629
You've got your little connector board that
matches up with the connector

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.939
on the back side of the VISTA-GSM board, the
side that has the SIM card.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:07.899
Every GSM from AlarmNet comes with the SIM
card already installed, and all

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:19.459
you need to do is go ahead and align the standoffs
with the GSM card and...

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:25.299
Oops, gently.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:36.119
I don't have as much leverage on the ladder
as I would

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:47.279
like... press that board on, down on all three
standoffs into the

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.279
connector.

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.859
It sits in nice.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.539
We've got our little antenna coming off of
our GSM.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.849
There's a washer and a
nut here.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.319
Take that off, and we feed it up into this
little plastic white

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.319
piece.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:13.438
Put the washer back on and put the nut back
on.

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:26.589
Screw that down
tight, which gives our GSM module a nice,

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:30.199
tight connection for our antenna.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.038
We've got our nice flat-blade antenna here.

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:36.298
Again, if we try to run it
vertical, obviously it's not going to work,

00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:42.899
so we're going to run it off to
the side here.

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:50.059
We just need to thread it in.

00:02:50.059 --> 00:03:11.678
It's hard to get a grip up
here, so I'm just using the antenna to get

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:18.548
that connection as tight as we
can.

00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:25.358
We've now installed our VISTA-GSM4G cellular
antenna card.

00:03:25.358 --> 00:03:26.878
This is a 21iP board.

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:28.988
You can see there's an Ethernet jack to run
your

00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:30.139
Internet connection.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.339
We're going to have to come back another day
to run

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.938
our Ethernet back to our router.

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:39.818
That's always an issue, is getting an
Ethernet cable from your router to your panel

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:44.378
in the 21iP board, so we're
going to go ahead and just activate just with

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:46.678
the GSM for now.

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:49.589
So, we now have our GSM.

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.038
Our panel is all good to go.

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:58.669
All we need to do is
put the panel door back on, plug in our transformer,

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.658
plug in our battery.

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:04.598
We're going to go ahead and use the old battery
that was with the Destiny.

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:07.848
The old installation company had a date on
here, so we can see it's fairly

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:10.139
fresh, May 2012 of last year.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.098
These batteries normally last about five
years.

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:16.458
The panel doesn't come with one, but, again,
we didn't need it since

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:18.578
we had a good one from the old board.

00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:21.699
So, we're good to go here.

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.909
Come on, follow me.

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.219
We're going to go do the
keypads now.
