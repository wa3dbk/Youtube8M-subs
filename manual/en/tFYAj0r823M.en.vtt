Okay.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.320
Let s talk Pneumo and Hemothorax.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.520
Okay, when we get into this, we re talking
about air or blood within the pleural space.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.020
Cause, we have our lung, and our lung is surrounded
by what s called the pleura, and the pleura

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:28.510
is a little sac that allows lung to move in
an out so that we can breathe comfortably.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.300
Now, what can happen with pneumothorax is
that air can get inside this space, it can

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.050
actually shrink the lung, as air escapes in
here, and it s not able to get out.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.170
With hemothorax, this can fill with blood
and it can push the lung in because this pleura

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.269
is an enclosed cavity and that air, that blood
cannot get out.

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.180
Okay, so that s what a pneumothorax and hemothorax
is.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.380
So, there s a couple of different kinds of
pneumothorax. Again, pneumothorax means air.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.260
Okay. Spontaneous pneumothorax is that, on
this lung space here, you can get little blebs,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.760
B-L-E-B-S, and those little blebs can actually
rupture and cause air to go out into the pleural

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.000
space. That air builds up pressure will cause
the lung to go down. Those blebs can be spontaneous,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.530
that can also be caused from emphysema or
asthma. Okay. So, those would be primary and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.670
secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Tension
pneumothorax, on the other hand, is when that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.980
pneumothorax, that air in that space become
so great, that it actually causes the mediastanum

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.850
to shift as it s pushing all these space over,
this whole area shifts. Our trachea is gonna

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.790
be deviate towards the unaffected side, it
s going to actually cause a lot of pressure

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.520
in the heart which is going to affect venous
return and we re gonna see a decrease in blood

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.800
pressure. So, that s what s gonna happen when
it becomes a tension pneumothorax. Shift in

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.590
mediastanum, disruption of venous return to
the heart. And this is an absolute medical

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.980
emergency. Okay. Hemothorax, on the other
hand, as we said, is the blood accumulation

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:11.680
in the pleural space. Now, this can also happen
for trauma, from trauma, it could also happen

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.239
iatrogenic, meaning, in the hospital, from
surgical procedures and things like that.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.170
So, assessment. First, we re gonna see is
dyspnea, decreased breath sounds on affected

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:32.030
side, we re gonna have unequal chest expansion,
of course because half of our lung fields

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.549
are not going to be expanding as air is not
entering or unable to enter. We re gonna see

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:43.519
tracheal deviation on tension pneumothorax
towards the unaffected side. Okay, so our

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.060
trachea is going to deviate towards the good
lung because this area here is all pressed

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.599
over. Okay, we re gonna hear dullness on precussion
on the affected side in hemothorax, with all

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.549
this blood in here, it s gonna sound really
dull percussed and we re gonna have hyperresonance

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.769
on pneumothorax. Okay, that affected side
is gonna be filled with air. When we percuss,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.499
that s just gonna sound hollow. Some things
we can do if the pneumothorax is significant,

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.900
we can put a chest tube in and that can drain
out the air. We put that in a water seal.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:25.360
If the hemothorax, the way we get rid of hemothorax
is we actually do what is called a thoracentesis.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.240
The patient lies down on the table, okay,
this will be their head, they lie down, the

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.219
physician puts a large bore needle in and
we can suction out all of that blood. Okay,

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.829
so that s the kind of a treatment for tension
pneumo and hemothorax. Again, chest tube would

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.120
only be kinda needed in a very significant
pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.849
Okay, guys, that is the pneumo and hemothorax.
