Heather Nicholds: Hey guys this is Heather
from healthy eating starts here. Alright,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.860
I got a question recently about how to help
with muscle cramps. And my answer is that

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.580
there are three minerals which are present
in healthy, whole plant foods that can help

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.900
ease muscle cramps and those are calcium,
magnesium and potassium. There are three minerals

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.990
that help regulate the nerves and regulate
your muscles so that they donÕt spasm quite

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.990
as much.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.859
So if you get a diet rich in those on a regular
basis you should prevent muscle cramps from

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.239
happening. And then if you find you get muscle
cramps, you can take some supplements for

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.140
those nutrients and/or, so you can do this
in addition to taking some supplements if

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.399
they are really bad or if they are just cramps
but not such that they are making your life

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.399
miserable then you could just have whole foods
which are very rich in those three minerals.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.340
Alright so what I wanted to do is show you
two plant foods for each of those minerals

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.300
that are very rich that I had in my kitchen.
Alright, for calcium I have some almond milk

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
which is very rich in calcium although it
is a little bit misleading because it's fortified

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.350
with calcium, but still a good source.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.880
And then I have got some sesame seeds, which
are very, very rich in calcium. Tahini is

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.670
another one, it's just ground up sesame seeds
and then tofu and anything made with soybeans

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.200
is going to have quite a bit of calcium.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.350
Now I am just going to go over two for each
mineral and then I am going to put a really

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.170
detailed chart because I love charts, which
you can check out on my site. Amaranth is

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.200
one of the top sources of plant-based magnesium.
I don't have any in my cupboard right now.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.040
I do have quinoa which is also very, very
rich in magnesium so we got that, and rolled

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.300
oats. Most people have rolled oats in their
cupboard, very, very rich in magnesium. And

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.289
like I said there are a ton more. So check
the chart on my website and you can see more.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.750
Alright, and then potassium, now this is what
everybody thinks of when they think of potassium

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.390
is bananas, right. Bananas are a fantastic
source of potassium. But do you know what

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.860
has even more potassium? Avocados. So these
two are fantastic and then potatoes and acorn

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.370
squash are another two good sources that I
will throw out there and then again check

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.950
the chart, there is lots in there.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.030
Alright so, if you are feeling that you have
some muscles cramps, those are some good foods

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.800
to help regulate that. And what I am going
to do this week is I am going to make a recipe,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.730
I am actually going to make some cupcakes
packed with foods that are rich in calcium,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.020
magnesium and potassium so they can be like
muscle relaxant cupcakes.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.060
And what I am going to do is use some ingredients
that I showed there as well as some others

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.319
which may be arenÕt quite as rich, but do
still have a good proportion of calcium, magnesium

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:16.330
and/or potassium. Those being some cocoa powder,
dark chocolate would count as well, almond

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.349
butter and molasses, just blackstrap molasses.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:32.930
So stay tuned for my calcium, magnesium, potassium
rich cupcakes and enjoy my super duper chart

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.239
and thatÕs it for today. So IÕll see you
again soon. Bye guys!
