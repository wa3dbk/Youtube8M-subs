00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.890
Hi, I am here with Sony and I want to talk to you about the Sony wireless speaker

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.460
system.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.520
Or as I like to call it- the speaker ball!
The Sony speaker ball uses Bluetooth

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.619
and NFC technology, so you can enjoy your favorite music

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.400
and great sound without any wires. You can also make and receive hands-free

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.150
calls.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.460
It's fun and compact design makes the Sony speaker ball the perfect travel

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.260
companion.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.860
Use it while you're hanging out, working out,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.940
even laying out. The best part-

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.449
the Sony wireless speaker system is so simple and easy to use.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.749
Begin by charging your wireless speaker.

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:47.699
To do this, open the jack cover. Connect the supplied micro USB to the speaker

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.909
and the other end to a computer. The
charging indicator will light up.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.780
Once fully charged, you can enjoy five
hours of continuous music.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.280
To pair the speaker bar with your device,
slide the power switch located on the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.229
bottom of the ball.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.909
The speaker will begin pairing automatically and the Bluetooth indicator will flash

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.640
blue.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.000
On your device, a list of detected devices
will appear on the display

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:23.470
Select your Sony speaker.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.630
When the connection is made the
Bluetooth indicator will light up blue.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.620
That's it! You are now paired and
ready to go. You can adjust the volume by

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.410
using the plus and minus buttons on the side of
the speaker ball,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.440
and when you're finished using the
speaker, just slide the power switch

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.940
to off.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.940
