00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.049
You guys remember Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast
Club, Sixteen Candles.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.220
All those amazing movies featuring Molly Ringwald.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.689
Well, specially in the Breakfast Club, Molly
Ringwald shows off her dance skills, right?

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.970
When they're in detention.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.660
Well, we're going to learn how to do the Molly
Ringwald today.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.570
We're going to start off with the right foot,
you're going to kick it out, boom, step down.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.610
Kick the left foot out, down.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.910
Kick and kick and kick and kick.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.820
Now you can kick any way you want.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.860
Boom, boom.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.840
As it get's faster, you're going to hop.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.450
Hop down, hop down, hop down.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.649
Arms are going wherever you want them to go.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.450
This is more of a fun and fancy free dance.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.549
Not necessarily look good, but to feel good,
right?

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.710
Now to add the head, just kind of look wherever
your foot's kicking.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.710
Okay?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.340
Don't think about looking any specific direction.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.030
Just kind of go with it, Okay?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.750
It's going to feel better as you do it faster.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.450
So we'll try it faster and then we'll do music.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.600
So we have five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.170
One and two and three and four and flip.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.920
Boom, boom, boom, whip around.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.170
Ha, ha, ha.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:02:11.360
Let's try music.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.950
Have fun with the Molly Ringwald guys.
