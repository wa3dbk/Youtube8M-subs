&gt;&gt; JENN: Welcome to Seneca Libraries!

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My name is Jennifer 
and I’m a Digital Services Librarian.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Seneca Libraries is your gateway
to teaching and learning at Seneca College

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we have resources and services
to support all members of the Seneca community

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Our four libraries are located throughout 
the GTA at Seneca’s main campuses.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Our largest library is located at 
the Newnham Campus which is 
in the east end of Toronto

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
while our second largest library is
located across the city at Seneca@York.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Our King Campus library is located 
in picturesque northern York Region

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
while our Markham library is located
within the heart of business

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and industry in the east end of the GTA.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
As well our online library,
located at library.senecacollege.ca,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is available online 24/7 from any computer
anywhere in the world.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
One of our greatest assets is our staff.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Our staff is always available
to help you with your research and questions.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let’s have a look at some
of the ways they can help.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
&gt;&gt; SARA: There you go.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Thank you,
you have been a total lifesaver!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
&gt;&gt; SARA: Hi, my name is Sara,
and I am a reference technician
here at Markham campus.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That student has a big paper due tomorrow.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was glad that I was here to help
her find the information she needed,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
however, had she come to me a little sooner

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I would have been able to help her so much more,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
perhaps in finding articles,
ebooks, online videos,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or do a more efficient Google search.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt; ANGELA: Hi, welcome to Borrower Services,
my name is Angela, how can I help you?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Um, do you have this textbook?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt; ANGELA: I think we do have this textbook.
It's available for a two-hour loan

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but you can only use it inside the library.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: I have an exam this afternoon
and I forgot my textbook at home.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
&gt;&gt; ANGELA: Ok, glad I can help.
I just need your student card.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
&gt;&gt; JENN: Those are just a few ways
we can help you in the library

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but we can also help you in the classroom.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Here’s Mara, she’s one of our Liason Librarians

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and she’s teaching students about
academic honesty, research and citation.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's listen in.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
&gt;&gt; MARA: So the best place to start
your research for your assignment

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is on the Seneca Library Subject Guide
designed for your program.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
&gt;&gt; STUDENT: Once I find the article,
video or whatever for my assignment

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
do I have to come into the library to read it?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
&gt;&gt; MARA: No, not necessarily.
Most of our resources are available online.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
All you need is your Seneca username and
password and an Internet connection

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and you can access all these resources.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
&gt;&gt; KEN: Alright, so the power button is 
right here, the eject button and the zoom. OK?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
&gt;&gt; TEACHER: Hi Ken, there seems to be
a problem with audio in the classroom.
Could you please come help me?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
&gt;&gt; KEN: Sure, no problem.
Let's take a look.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Working in A/V Services,
I'm often called to classrooms.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Going to these kinds of service calls
keeps me connected with staff and faculty.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
&gt;&gt; KEN: Looks like someone has turned off
the amp. I'll turn it back on.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
&gt;&gt; TEACHER: Thanks for all your help Ken,
I really appreciate it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
&gt;&gt; KEN: No problem, let me know
if you need any other help. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
&gt;&gt; JENN: In addition to the services
we provide to staff and students,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we also have some great spaces for those
looking to study or work with their group.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
At each campus we have areas for quiet study,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
areas for groups to meet to work on their projects

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
as well as comfortable areas for
reading, chatting or relaxing.
00:03:16.000,00:03:18.000]
Many of our quiet study areas
are wired so that you can

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
use your laptop, or
charge your phone or MP3 player.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We have spaces for you to do research,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
preview videos, or even
just photocopy documents.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You can browse the paperback collection

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or search through our reference books,
magazines and journal collections.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
&gt;&gt; PRESENTER: So Jennifer, what do you think
about the revised timeline?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
&gt;&gt; JENN: Um ... I choose C?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Here’s a reminder about how
Seneca Libraries can help you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
&gt;&gt; SARA: At the reference desk
we help you find books, articles,
videos, websites, and more.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
&gt;&gt; ANGELA: At borrower services
you’ll find copies of most textbooks,
reserve items

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
as well as information on your library account.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
&gt;&gt; KEN: At A/V services you can
borrow cameras, camcorders, watch videos,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and get help with electronic classrooms.
Come by and see us.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
&gt;&gt; MARA: Do you have a research question?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Or you may want to know more about
citation style guides or plagiarism.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Feel free to contact us.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You can drop by, email us or IM.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We are always here to help.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
&gt;&gt; JENN: Thanks for joining us for
this brief look inside Seneca Libraries.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
As you can see, our staff, resources
and spaces are here waiting for you.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So what are you waiting for?
