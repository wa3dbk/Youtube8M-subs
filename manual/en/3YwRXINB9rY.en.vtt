00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:08.208
(♪♪♪)

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.880
The Daylight company has
been designing lamps

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.181
for over 20 years,

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.683
and feature a number of
specialty lamps.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.785
As with all Daylight products
these lamps offer

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.388
energy efficiency,
colour corrective lighting

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.357
and they reduce eye strain.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.525
I want to show you a few of
our specialty lamps

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.196
that you might find helpful
for your specific needs.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.265
The combo lamp has long been
an industry standard

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.433
in most studios and offices.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.168
It features
a circular daylight tube,

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.437
and a round incandescent bulb.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:39.506
The circular tube shines
light on all sides

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.508
so it creates no shadows,

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.877
and is colour corrective
while the incandescent bulb

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.413
is a warmer colour
more consistent with

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.315
everyday household lighting.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:52.619
These lights can be
used together or separate.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.855
Originally designed for
the manicure industry

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:55.856
the slim line table lamp

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.491
quickly became
an instant hit.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.559
Whether you're drawing,
reading, quilting, sewing

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.662
or doing
any type of art or craft,

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.698
the slim design lamp can
provide the light you need.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.733
The slim line table lamp
features a stainless

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.935
brushed chrome finish

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:11.405
that will compliment
any modern workplace or home.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.873
It has two flexible joints.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.275
The slim line table lamp can
be moved and configured

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.243
into almost any position

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.979
simply by
redirecting the light.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.847
If you're working on
a drawing surface

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.550
this lamp can extend out
35 inches across a table

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.386
or it can be raised
as high as 21.

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.955
You can also swing
the arm around

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.824
to cover almost any area
and workspace.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.794
The lamp comes with
a powerful 11 watt T tube

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:37.030
to give you an unmatched
quality of light.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.066
Sometimes you need to
see things a bit larger

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.300
than what they are.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.970
Here we have our five inch
magnifying lamp that features

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.707
a three diopter lens for
1.75 times magnification,

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.643
a 13 watt bulb,
a semi rimless lens

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:51.645
for optimal viewing
of all details,

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.647
and a protective
removable cover.

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:56.383
The adjustable metal arm with
the internal springs

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:59.119
allows you to get a lot of
life out of this product.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.354
