00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.950
Installing a map on a DynoJet power commander.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.940
Kyle Bradshaw here with this week’s Cruiser
Customizing tip of the week revolving around

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.040
the Power Commander III.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.349
What we want to accomplish with this tip is
to show you how simple it is to map your own

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.930
Power Commander. Des Walden here of Cruiser
Customizing is our premiere mapper of Power

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.930
Commanders.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.210
She’s going to walk us through step-by-step
how simple it is to map one of these power

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.210
commanders.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.160
So we’re going to start by opening this
kit. We’re going to take a look at the components

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.990
and then Des is going to walk us through what
each of the components do, how we use them,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.480
and how we get this unit mapped.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.250
So after opening this kit we find the unit,
install instructions, the CD-Rom with all

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.840
of the maps on it, we’ve got a warranty
card, we’ve got a 9V connector, and a USB

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.820
cord. So Des, you’re the pro here at Cruiser
Customizing, you map just about every Power

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.690
Commander that goes out the back door--can
you show us how this work and show us how

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.690
to map this for ourselves?

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.690
[Des] Sure.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
[Kyle] Sweet.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.690
So this 9V adapter, what does this do, Des?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.280
[Des] This here, actually, if you happen to
not have your computer near your bike, you

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.110
can simply attach it to a 9V battery and then
you can actually map it while you’re at

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.070
your desktop at home and just simply insert
the white piece right on in there. And you

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.580
will see the power go on right there.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.320
[Kyle] Now that we’ve got power connected
to the Power Commander, we know that that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.140
unit is ready to go. The next step is we’re
going to plug in the CD-Rom, which is going

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.310
to contain all of the maps needed to be able
to download, and then this is the USB cable

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.041
that plugs the Power Commander up to the computer
so that we can get that information from the

00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.400
computer back down into the Power Commander,
correct?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.400
[Des] Correct.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.830
[Kyle] Cool. Let’s get that done.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.060
So, Des, we’ve got the Power Commander,
we’ve got the power applied to it, we’ve

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.570
got the USB cable plugged in, we’ve got
the CD downloaded, and I see that you just

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.540
went to PowerCommander.com and now we’re
going to find the map for this, correct? So

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.350
how do you find the correct map for your bike?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.510
[Des] Okay, once you get there you can actually
select--there will be three options. You will

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.840
need to select your bike make, and in this
case we’re doing a Harley, so you would

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.129
click the drop-down option, select Harley-Davidson,
and we’re going to be doing this for a DynoGlide

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.430
Models. So you would select your Dyno models
and then you would select your year which

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.379
in this case will be a 2007. We’ll go ahead
and update with the maps and then if you scroll--

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.730
[Kyle] Oh, sweet, so it brought up a picture
of the bike, and then below the bike I see

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.670
a bunch of maps. How do know which map is
correct?

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.250
[Des] Well the most common thing that a lot
of people I have known have done would be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.480
to actually select the closest thing possible
or you can actually go to your local dealer

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.990
and they will be able to map it on their Dyno
for exactly with what you have. In this case,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.940
we’re going to be doing this for the big
shot staggered on this exhaust with the Screaming

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.110
Eagle Air Filter. That’s the M814-005.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.290
[Kyle] I see it’s up here, what, #5?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.290
[Des] Yes.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.550
[Kyle] Okay, so you’re going to click on
that. Yeah, basically your computer system

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.950
is going to ask you if you’d like to save
the file. You click save, it will download

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.239
it for you here. And then you can just exit
right on out of that. Go to your Start menu,

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.480
in the lower left hand corner, it should be
right there under New Installs or New Software,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.380
you just click right on that. It’s going
to give you this main menu here. You simply

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.160
go to Open Map File.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.231
[Kyle] Those are all the different maps.

00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:33.790
[Des] These are all the different maps that
I have mapped.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.069
[Kyle] Wow, you’re a busy girl.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.170
[Des] It’s what I do in my spare time. This
one here, as we were talking about, we were

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.650
going to do the 814-005, so you just find
the file that you saved it under--okay, so

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.500
the 814-005, there we go, right there. Now
that you have it here, after you’ve already

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.459
plugged in your 9V power source, you can actually
plug in your USB cord, so then after you’ve

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.849
selected that you just click open and that’s
going to open the map right here.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.250
[Kyle] So here’s the map. Now, how do we
get this map that’s on your computer screen

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.850
down here into this Power Commander?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.250
[Des] Well after your USB and your power source
has been installed and you’ve brought it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.870
up here on your software, all you need to
do is click “send map.”

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.540
[Kyle] Okay and how do I know that it’s
actually sending?

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.700
[Des] You will see that in just a second.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.470
[Kyle] Okay.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:44.080
[Des] There we go. This one here says “Power
Commander map sent successfully.” If this

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.990
does not come up right away, you will see
the lights on your DynoJet Power Commander

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.630
scroll up and then scroll down.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.390
[Kyle] Okay, so now that we’ve got this
Power Commander mapped, is there any difference

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.620
in the mapping between sport bikes, Harley-Davidsons,
Metrics--do they differ in the way that you

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.620
map the Power Commander?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.690
[Des] The only way it really differs is selecting
your bike model and getting the maps set up.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.289
[Kyle] Okay, but the basic process is the
same.

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.289
[Des] Correct.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.080
[Kyle] Well, Des, you made that look super
simple. So basically you insert a CD in the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.250
computer, download the software, go to Power
Commander’s website, download whatever maps

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.840
you need, sync it to your Power Commander,
walk out to the bike and install it, and you’re

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840
completely done.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840
[Des] Yep.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.280
[Kyle] Seems like it couldn’t get much more
simple than that.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.650
[Des] It’s not a problem at all.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.930
[Kyle] Well thank you Des for your time today.
Thank you for teaching us how to properly

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.270
map a Power Commander.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.740
A special thanks to Des for helping us out
