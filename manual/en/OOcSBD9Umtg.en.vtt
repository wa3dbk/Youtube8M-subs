Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to troubleshoot your water heater.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.620
Now there are two basic types of water heaters
that are in use primarily. There is this type

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.910
which is a gas water heater and then there
is also an electric water heater. So we're

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.490
going to talk about the gas water heater first.
If you do not have hot water there are some

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.040
things that you can check just to make sure.
Now the first thing is we want to come over

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.480
here and there is this cover plate right here
that we can remove. Now most of the water

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.620
heaters operate off a pilot light and there
is a small window once you remove the cover

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.120
plate that you can look down in here and what
you should see is you should see a glow down

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.690
in there. Now if you do not see a glow then
that means that your pilot light has gone

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.690
out. This particular water heater is equipped
with an igniter so if that happens then what

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.520
you want to do is you want to rotate your
control knob to the off position and you want

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.680
to let it set for probably about 30 seconds.
After you do that then you want to rotate

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.600
it back to the pilot position and the knobs
are clearly marked where it has a pilot and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.110
an on. Now once you rotate that to the pilot
position and line it up with the front there

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.690
is a cut out on this that allows you to depress
this red button. So depress the red button

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.060
and then what you want to do is you want to
snap the igniter until you can look down in

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.850
the inspection window and see that glow. Now
once that happens then we will rotate the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.710
unit back to the on position and then you
want to again check and make sure that your

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.860
pilot light is on down below. Once you do
that particularly if the water has been on

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.900
you should automatically hear your igniter
come on. Now with an electric water heater

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000
what commonly happens is that you may throw
a breaker so then you want to locate your

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.819
main breaker box and you want to locate the
circuit breakers for your electric water heater

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.799
and it should be clearly labeled in there.
You just want to double check those so you

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.329
can pop those off and then reset them and
then most of the time that's what you have

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.819
to do for your electric water heaters. Now
beyond that if those simple things do not

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.120
work to get your hot water heater working
you may have a more serious problem or you

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.829
may have a malfunctioning water heater and
that is something you can either take care

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.860
of yourself or call a plumbing professional
to check out for you. So I'm Tim Gipson and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.449
that's how you troubleshoot your water heater.
