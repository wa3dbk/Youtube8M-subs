00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.279
The time has come to assemble the dish. I
have a 9 by 13 glass pan. I'm just going to

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:14.219
coat the bottom with a little bit of olive
oil just so nothing sticks. And then our first

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.572
layer is going to be the polenta that we just
finished. Now that it's nice and thick and

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:23.189
is going to make a nice solid base. So let
me bring it over from the stove. It might

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.411
be a little hot. Let's see. Ah, beautiful
consistency. There we go. Get it all down

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.660
inside, and it's going to be, oh just the
smell of it, I mean you can smell it and you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
can know what it's going to taste like. That
parmesan comes right out, there's the garlic

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:52.920
smell, beautiful yellow color. Put this back.
Oh, steaming. So then just spread it out evenly

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.980
over the bottom of the pan. It's almost like
we're making kind of a almost like a casserole

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.290
in a way. And we've been doing this the whole
time while the vegetables were roasting. And

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.210
it's been about 45 minutes, they should be
all ready to go. Let's take a look at them.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:22.450
Ha ha ha, look at that. They have all roasted
down, so like I said they got way smaller

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.340
and nice steam coming off of there. And got
the caramelization on them. It's going to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.770
be awesome. The parsnips and the carrots have
softened. This is a little messy let me we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.810
need a different one. So now I'm just going
to arrange these on top and be kind of delicate

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.091
because I don't want to smush them too bad.
Get them all over as a top layer on top of

00:01:52.091 --> 00:02:03.820
this polenta.
Yeah and that, our secret ingredient of the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.730
fennel adds such a great smell to it. It smells,
I just burned myself. Don't touch a hot pan.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:21.700
Not a good, not a good idea. Not a good tip.
Let me, let me spread this all around, fill

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.340
in all of the gaps. There we go. Gorgeous.
You just don't want to mess up, you don't

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.560
want to mess up your pretty polenta too much.
Just kind of coat it. So, we've got our layer

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.349
of polenta, the layer of vegetables, now we
get to do a delicious topping.
