-Howdy folks.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.790
So this morning
we're going to do

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.784
another hairdo in our
waterfall braid series.

00:00:07.784 --> 00:00:09.700
We've been filming
different waterfall braids,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.590
adding a little pizzazz
into the strands.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.310
And today we're going to do
spiral curls into the strands.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.950
You're going to love this one.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.030
So we've started.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.400
I've already done the
waterfall braid into her hair

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.040
and I've done it on
both sides and then

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.460
I have just taken it all
the way into the back

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.490
and just secured
it with a ponytail.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.320
OK.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340
So then I found this
nifty little tool

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.060
that a neighbor just introduced
me to, a teenage neighbor.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.280
And it's called the
Conair Spiral Styler.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.100
And it's 3/4 of an inch
and you will love this.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.050
Now, it's just like a
spiral curling iron.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.060
You guys, some of
you are probably

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.600
familiar with how you have to
wrap the strands in between,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990
except that has this nifty
little button on the bottom.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.040
Watch what it does
when I push the button.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.650
Can you see that?

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.700
So it tightens the
hair down in there

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.350
and it gives it a really,
really nice spiral shape.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.420
Great for dance recital curls,
prom curls, anything like that.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.050
OK.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.497
So on her hair I've already
added some hair protectant

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:17.080
just because we're
going to be styling

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.065
her hair with heat this morning.

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.290
So we're going to spray
a little on there.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.650
Now what I'm going
to do is just take

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.850
the strands that are falling
through the waterfall braid

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.540
and I'm going to add them in.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.840
There's a little button you
push to hold the end up.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.650
And then you just
wrap the hair in.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.930
And it just, you don't
have to do it yourself,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.810
it just wraps it
up for you right

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.670
through those middle sections.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.480
Now watch the nifty button.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.040
Push, hold it for
just a few seconds.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.590
Let it go.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.580
And then we're going
to just unwrap it.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.621
And look at that curl.

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.640
So, so so fun, so easy.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.710
Love, love, love.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.010
OK, so we're just going
to keep doing that.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.910
Again you're going
to secure the end

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.840
into this diet-- I can't
talk-- to spiral styler.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.020
Wrap it up to the top,
push the nifty button,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.345
hold it for a couple
seconds, and then unwrap it.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.230
And again you're going
to have fun curl.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.910
So I'm just going to
do that all the way

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.610
through just any of the strands.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.140
So I was doing this
a few seconds ago

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.560
and my other daughter, one of
my older girls came in and said,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.050
oh, I love this hairdo.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.440
I want to do my hair
like that for prom.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.592
Which it would be a
very fun prom hairdo.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:45.330
Push the button.

00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:52.891
Here we go.

00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:53.390
Unwrap.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.660
And it does go pretty hot
so you can choose depending

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.360
on how your hair handles
heat whether you have

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.490
it super hot or just
a little bit hot.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.170
So this is the only
thing I have found

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.510
is that if you have layers like
she kind of does on the end

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.510
you can't pull the
hair through-- I keep

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.810
dropping that
one-- quite as far.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.140
You have to just hang
on to that little layer

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.600
or go back and just wrap it up.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.460
There's a fly in here.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.460
I don't know if you can
hear that on the camera.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.267
And then unwrap.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:44.850
I guess that must
mean it's summertime

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.016
because we're getting flies.

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:50.320
OK.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.210
Again, you're just
going to warp it.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.630
I love this is, just the button
pushing just because it seems

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.500
like it adds so much
little curl to it.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.810
Now when I'm done I am
going to put some hairspray

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.459
onto her hair
because I just think

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.410
that helps hold the
tightness of the curl

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.820
and helps last
throughout the day.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.780
But you can also add
a little hairspray

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.960
before you run it through
the curling iron too

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.632
and that will also help with
the holding for the day.

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:36.340
So if you have trouble,
like if your hair

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.500
has a hard time
keeping curl, try

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.980
spraying a little bit of
hair spray in your hair

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.320
before you do the curl and then
also after and that will help.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.320
And I think we've got two
left, three it looks like.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.680
So do you like this hairdo?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.572
-Yep.

00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:12.524
-How come?

00:05:12.524 --> 00:05:14.984
-I don't know, I just like
the way that it looks.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.940
-And you guys get the idea.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.726
One more after this.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:57.830
And the thicker the strands
are obviously the longer

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.720
you need to hold it in
because it takes longer

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.540
to heat the hair through
and also the less tight

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.510
the curl is going to be.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.720
Like these front ones
were super, super tight

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.280
because they were
really thin strands.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.440
So if you have super
thick hair I'll

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.285
show you like in the back
part where I had the elastic.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.230
OK.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.349
Turn to the back.

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.140
So in the back part
where I had the elastic

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.610
I just divided
into three pieces.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.440
And there you go.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.520
So fun.
