00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey guys, so I decided to make a video
series dedicated to the Twelve Principles of Animation

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.960
as described by the legendary animators
Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.929
So the first
principle is Squash and Stretch

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.199
This is the principle that animated
objects will get longer or flatter to emphasize their speed, momentum, weight, and mass.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.130
Here's a bouncing ball that
has Squash and Stretch.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.500
And here's one without Squash and Stretch. See the difference?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.200
The amount that an
object squashes and stretches says something about its mass

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.280
The more squash and stretch, the softer
the object

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.840
the less squash and stretch, the stiffer
the object

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.039
This first one looks like a water balloon and the second one probably would be a bowling ball

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.119
Squash a stretch applies to characters
too.  

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.260
Look at how this figure is stretching from the speed that he's coming down with.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.559
Then he squashes after he lands, before settling in his pose.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.910
You can also use squash and stretch to
exaggerate facial expressions.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.230
Let's add some squash and stretch to this
face.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.320
When his eyes are closed, his face is squashed, and when he opens his eyes in disbelief,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720
his face stretches up and settles back
to normal.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.159
It's very important to keep the volume of the object consistent.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.779
This is what a lot of people mess up
with when they're first trying to do squash and stretch.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.490
They'll elongate the ball like this and
flatten it like this.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.580
This is what you should NOT do. the
overall volume of the ball must be the SAME.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.270
So as the ball gets longer, it also gets
narrower.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.930
When it gets flatter, it also gets wider.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.490
The same goes with cubes. If you're going in with one line, the other lines must go in the opposite direction.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.400
The cube should start out narrow, get flat, get narrow again, and then rest.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.120
In-betweening with cubes is
easy because you can measure the line in between the two lines and then connect them to make the cube.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.360
If you master squash and stretch with cubes, the next step is to try to do it in 3D.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.780
Another important note is that the ball does not have to be stretching the
entire time that it's falling.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.500
When it's just starting to fall, it
should have its normal shape for the most part,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.840
and then when it's just about to hit the
bottom, that's when it has the most stretch.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.390
So do not overdo Squash and Stretch in this sense.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.760
Alright, that is all I've got
for Squash and Stretch.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.800
The next principle will be Anticipation.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.110
Hope you learned something and I'll see
you guys in the next video!
