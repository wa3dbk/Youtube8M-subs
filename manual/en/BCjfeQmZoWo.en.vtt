00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.019
&gt;&gt;Micah Jackson: Seminary of the Southwest
is a community of Christians and we’re all

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.460
doing the best we can to become the person
that God is calling us to be.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt;Scott Bader-Saye: We do more than educate
the mind.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.040
We’re thinking about how education involves
the whole person, so that we see for instance

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.780
the ways in which the intellectual virtues
are connected to the moral virtues.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.320
&gt;&gt;Rebecca Guengerich: Before my faith was
always about informational, but when I came

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.350
here to the seminary if was all about formation.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.430

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.760

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.829

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.870

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:04.990
&gt;&gt;Bishop Dena Harrison: Leaders of the church
must have the skills to integrate all experience

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.180
into the life of faith and that’s what I
think I received at the seminary that has

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.340
been most helpful.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340
&gt;&gt;Micah: Formation is an important word for
us.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.400
The discipline of the classroom, of chapel,
of living in community.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:31.230
All of those things put together build us
and form us.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.040
&gt;&gt;Scott: And I think we’re interested not
just in the formation of individual students,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.240
but we’re interested in how we form a community
because part of the calling for the students

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.630
is to go from here and form communities.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.659
The question becomes how do we link ourselves
with other lives in such a way that we form

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.539
communities that can really have an impact
on the world.
