Hi! This is John for Expert Village. Today,
we are talking about dog grooming and right

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.720
now we are going to show you how to properly
rinse the dog, that has already been soaped

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:18.550
up and lathered. You turn your water on and
make sure it is warm. Once it has warmed up

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.010
enough come up to the head, you want to rinse
the water, rinse all the soap off of his head,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.969
make sure you pay special attention to the
eyes, you want to rinse all the soap off of

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:48.390
the ears, making sure you donâ€™t get any
water down in his ears. And you want to work

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:00.030
your way down his head slowly, rinse the muzzle,
rinse his beard, other side, the muzzle and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.500
the beard, okay. And now you want to rinse
the rest of the dog and basically you start

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:24.720
up at the neck work your way down the back.
You always work from the top down. I am going

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:37.150
to rinse his front legs next. Rinse off his
feet, make sure you rinse in between his pads,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:02:00.640
same with the other leg. Good boy now rinse
it on the other side. Rinse his

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.580
belly. It is very important to have your hand
in there so you can feel that the shampoo

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:24.091
is being rinsed off, you never want to have
shampoo left on your dog. You want to rinse

00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:45.320
up in between his legs. Rinse his rear-end
off. Work down the back legs and his tail,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:03:06.599
get his other back leg. Okay, he is clean
and rinsed and now he is now ready to be dried.
