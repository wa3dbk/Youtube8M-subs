00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
Mrs. Obama:
I just want to speak to you

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.667
about our visit
to Robben Island,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.333
an experience I'll never forget.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.633
Located off the coast
of South Africa,

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:18.166
from the 1960s
through the 1990s

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:22.433
this island housed
a maximum-security prison.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.000
Many of the prisoners there
were activists

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.433
who worked to bring
down Apartheid,

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.700
the South African government's 
policies that discriminated

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.633
against people of color.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.600
Among those imprisoned
at Robben Island

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.934
were three men who went on

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.600
to become President
of South Africa,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.300
including Nelson Mandela

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.433
and the current
President Jacob Zuma.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.567
So, as we toured the island,
I couldn't help but think

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:51.834
about how this place must have 
shaped these leaders.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:54.767
We saw the rock quarry
where they spent their days

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.033
doing backbreaking work
in the blinding sun,

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:01.533
and the tiny cells where
they spent their nights.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.500
It was amazing to
see Mandela's cell,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
a tiny room about six
feet wide where he spent

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.000
18 of the 27 years
he was in prison.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
He slept on a thin
mat on the floor,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.333
and when he stretched
out to sleep at night,

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:22.433
his toes touched one wall while
his head grazed the other.

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:25.900
Yet, despite
these conditions,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.533
Mandela and his fellow
prisoners never lost hope.

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.200
As Mandela once said,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.133
"Prison, far from
breaking our spirits,

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.433
made us more determined to
continue with this battle

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.734
until victory was won."

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:45.467
So when these prisoners
were finally released,

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:48.033
their spirits were
far from broken.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.734
Mandela went on to lead the
movement to end Apartheid

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.100
and set up a new
democratic government.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.066
He won a Nobel Peace Prize

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.967
and became South Africa's
first black President.

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.834
While very few of
us will ever encounter

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.734
the kind of discrimination
and brutality

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.266
that Nelson Mandela endured,

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.734
all of us can learn important
lessons from his struggle.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.433
We can learn about the
importance of standing up

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.100
for what you believe in,
no matter what the cost.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.567
We can learn about how,

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:23.000
with self-discipline
and courage,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
we can overcome the most
unthinkable hardships.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.633
And we can learn about
the power of forgiveness,

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:36.367
to turn enemies into friends
and to help us move forward

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.500
from a troubled past to
a more hopeful future.
