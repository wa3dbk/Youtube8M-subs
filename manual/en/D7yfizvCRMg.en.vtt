This is Cool Cats R Us showing all you cool
cats out there how to do The Twist!

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.089
Alright the Twist is very easy.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.870
I'm going to show you what it looks like real
quick and then and we'll get in to how to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.870
do it.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.309
So it just looks like this.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:26.449
Alright, so you want to get on your toes on
this one with your heels off the ground.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.089
All you do is shift from the left to the right.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.140
So it's left, right, left, right.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.000
From the back view it's left, right, left,
right.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.320
You go a little faster and shake your butt
a little while you're at it.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.309
Then you can put up your hands like this and
move them to opposite ends.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.660
From the front here.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.070
So it's left, right with your hands up.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.429
left, right

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.360
So with it zoomed in some here it's going
to be on your toes with your heels up and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.210
shifting to the left and to the right.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.750
To the left and to the right.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.649
From behind it's on your toes, heels up, you
begin shifting to the left and to the right.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.440
To the left and to the right.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.579
Then you get going a little faster like that.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.619
Then you can even do it on one foot.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.939
Raising the toe up and doing it on the other.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.289
Faster shifting from the left to the right.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.359
One foot, one foot.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.420
Whenever you get that down you do it regular
speed it looks something like this with your

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.090
arms up and your shifting back and forth and
do a little bit of one leg, and have a little

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.210
fun with it and go down and up.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.869
Alright, so that's the basics of the Twist.

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.960
Real simple, real easy dance.
