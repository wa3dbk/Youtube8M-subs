00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.860
Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.480
I love it when I find worms in my
organic soil

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.060
but I hate finding worms in my apples and pears

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.800
So today I'm going to share some tips on
controlling one of the worst culprits when it

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.340
comes to wormy fruit, the coddling moth

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.460
The first step to prevent coddling moths is
orchard sanitation

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.080
Last fall, I was really careful and very
conscientious

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.540
to pick up all dead fruit that was left
on the tree

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.430
I cleaned up all around the base of the
tree I picked up all dead fruits and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.370
cleaned up all the leaves raked really well

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.730
I don't want to give any place for the coddling moth larva to hide

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.600
All throughout the season were going to inspect

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.789
and monitor our trees and make sure that
there's no fruit on the tree that has

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.869
any little worm holes if so pick it off and destroy it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.480
Also want to keep the area underneath
the tree clean if any fruit has dropped off

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.780
make sure and pick it up and clean it
off and destroy it as well

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.220
In areas with low concentrations of coddling
moths

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.269
orchard sanitation and mass trappings
may be all that you need

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.080
This is a cardboard trap with a sticky
bottom

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.439
inside I'll place a lure with a sex pheromone to attract and trap coddling moth males

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.239
which will reduce the number
of eggs laid by the females

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.780
I'm going to hang this trap in my pear tree

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.890
You want to have about one to two traps in small trees and two to four for larger trees

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.180
You want to hang the trap as high in the tree as you can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.160
I'm going to take this trap down

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.100
so I can show you how to maintain it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.600
About every one or two weeks you want to take the traps down

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.460
and maintain them clean 'em off make sure there's no little coddling moths on them and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.660
take a popsicle stick and just rough up the sticky substance and that will increase the life of your trap.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.500
In areas of high
populations of coddling moths

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.840
orchard sanitation and mass trappings
may not be enough

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.740
It's time to pull out the big guns

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.660
pantyhose!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.499
Also known as apple maggot barriers

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.669
for best results these barriers should
be put on fruit that is less than one inch

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.049
in diameter

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.829
but to show you how they go on I'm going to use a ripe apple

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.160
slide the barrier over the apple and close

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.979
These can cut coddling moth damage by as
much as eighty percent

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.509
This Cyd-X insecticidal virus is
another option which is organic and

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.739
OMRI listed

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.569
This naturally occurring virus attacks
the larva of the coddling moth and you can get it in a

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.269
home gardening size or commercial size

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.450
This is best sprayed when the coddling moth
eggs are hatching

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.560
contact your local agricultural
extension office for the exact timing in your area

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.660
If you have a really big pear and apple orchard like maybe a hundred trees or so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.360
you could use a confusion pheromone lure 
like this Isomate-CTT

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.679
or a crop protectant like this Surround which is made from kaolin clay

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.889
thats the same active ingredient as Kaopectate

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.709
Both of these products may require a license
to apply so be sure and call your county ag

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.930
department

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.570
So enjoy the worms in your soil and keep
the worms out of your organic apples

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.190
