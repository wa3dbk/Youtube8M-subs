You can use different chillies (mild chillies)

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.040

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.360
1/4 teaspoon of mango powder (amchoor)

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.220
For batter we need

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.980
1/2 cup of besan (gram flour)

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.260

1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro (hara dhania)

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.480
And about 1/4 cup of water.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.440
First I am going to make the filling.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.340
Potatoes

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.360
Cumin seeds

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.780
Coriander powder

Salt

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.180
Red chilli pepper

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.180
Cilantro

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.620
And mix it well.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.060
It looks good.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.620
Filling is ready and now I will make the batter.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.360
Besan

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.180
Salt

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.540
Cilantro

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.020
Baking powder

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.240
Cumin seeds

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.680
Mix it well.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.940
And make the smooth batter.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.640
This will have thick batter like the pan cake.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.320
Make sure there is no lumps.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.200
Add the water slowly to make the batter.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.580
Batter looks good.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.420
I used 1 tablespoon more than 1/4 cup of water.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.100
Batter is ready.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520
And now we will prepare the chillies.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.180
Make a slit vertically, but do not remove the stems.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.900
And take out the seeds.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.820
Looks good.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.380
So make a slit vertically.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.340
And remove the seeds.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.140
These pepper don’t have that many seeds.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.540
So now I am going to stuff the peppers with potato filling.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.680
So just take some and push it in.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.880
Just make sure you don’t break the peppers.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.180
Next.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.540
So just fill them slowly.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.340
So all the chillies are filled and I have little bit filling left over.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.840
I am ready to fry them after dipping them in the batter.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.559
Heat is on, medium high.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.840
Oil should be moderately hot.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.040
Dip the pepper in the batter.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.160
Make sure it is covered all around.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.660
And then just drop it slowly in the oil.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.120
And like you see oil is sizzling.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.760
So this is just right.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.700
It shouldn’t get cooked right away.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.680
If it gets red right away, it means oil is too hot

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.080
and vadas will be ready, too quick.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.080
And won’t be crispy.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.060
So just one at a time.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.600
Dip it and put it in.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.720
One at a time.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.680
Mirchi vadas are looking good.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.860
So just wait about a minute before you turn them.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.560
This has been about 2 minutes.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.040
So you have to turn them few times

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.240
and they will be golden brown all around.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.540
So it should take another 2 minutes

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.620
before they are ready.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.340
These colors are looking good.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.900
It has been 5 minutes and mirchi vadas are ready.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.600
As you see they are looking really nice in

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.710
color, golden brown all around.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.060
So take them out.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.560
I take them out over paper towel

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.160
so it will absorb the extra oil.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.760
Mirchi vadas are looking superb.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.900
Very nice golden brown color.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.180
They are crispy outside and soft inside.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.680
Today I will be serving this with tamarind

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.980
chutney and hot cup of tea.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.560
This is my kind of spicy and hot food.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.980
Enjoy.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.200
Thank you.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.460
