00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
one of the coolest things about IK
booster is the ability to have the power

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.279
of the biking create with south the
drawbacks of inflexibility

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.189
so if you want to have a character
interact with and object or surface

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.539
you don't need a fancy rigged to do this

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.359
the supposedly complicated intrigue took
less than a minute for me to set up here

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.369
i'll be explaining how to fix command
works and give you some practical usage

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.550
examples as well just to get our feet
wet but she's a very simplified setup

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.950
say we need to temporarily have i'd k
function to make this riggs right arm

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.610
interact with the table as the rest of
the body moods using the fix command on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.680
the wrist

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.400
let's see what happens when we move this
guy's towards self

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.500
know how the wrist is still rotating

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.080
week don't want this

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.110
so a second fixes required at the tip of
the hand that prevent the hand itself

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.230
from rotating now when we move the
figure the hand is firmly planted on the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720
table

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.520
we can also covet elbow or movie any
other part of the character by clicking

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.570
and dragging

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.230
and it'll react like you expect it to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.010
the majority of i_q_ brewster users get
stuck at this point this looks very cool

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.770
but there's an extra step required to
make the fix come and work in animation

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.060
by doing some animation we can see the
rate behaving like one would expect on

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.470
the key frames

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.430
but when we scrub the timeline after the
fact

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.560
the harm is floating around the stroke
me crazy for the longest time

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.329
the fix command does this because i keep
booster is a part time

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.570
i k system essentially meaning that the
only time i k dues into a fact

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660
is when you're manipulating something

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.650
this is also the reason why you can have
been insanely complex i keep mister

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.359
ridge

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.650
you have zero overhead or top innocent
your scene

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.500
anyways back to the subject uh...

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.149
so how can we get the scanned the stick
in place

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.000
during the animation

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.170
the answer is baking the motion stay
with me here because there's more to it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.730
than meets the eye

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.799
multi selecting items nike booster is
achieved by holding down the control key

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.469
not the shift key

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.900
this is most handy for fixing or on
fixing many items at once

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.510
note that you can temporarily disable
all fixing bite you there holding the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.939
control key as you mean it deleted item

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.080
or going into the hike a booster

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.070
menu and un-checking

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.299
global f_x_ i k by the way uh... while
we're here i'd like to leave the i_ cave

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.189
bind

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.789
option unchecked

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.569
to avoid unwanted slipping wall moving
around and manipulating my rigs

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.459
i'm not going to cover what actually
does in this tutorial but libya and

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.970
sharks can save you a lot of headaches
anyhow so using the control key we need

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.109
to morty selected the tip in the base of
the hand i want to stress that

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.849
what you have selected while baking is
critical to making it work properly

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.739
you have to have the fix items selected
while baking

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.790
make certain that your key frame mode is
set to current

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.309
otherwise you end up baking parts of
your character that don't need baking

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.079
today can i keep mixture you simply hold
down the right mouse button and drag

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.769
across the timeline

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.360
when you let go of the button you get a
pop-up list that essentially asks

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.040
what you'd like to do with the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.839
range of key frames

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.689
selected bake keys

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.989
hit ok and it's done

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.729
it works beautifully

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.199
note that you can actually undo baking
nike brewster which is pretty damn cool

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.089
but there is yet another question that
this brings up

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.569
what if you want to make changes

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.399
after baking and your past the point
uh... being able to undo stuff

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:43.939
well there's different ways to approach
this but i'll give you the solutions

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.569
that are used in production

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.169
say we want to change that warrant ation
of the skies elbow

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.360
to make a change

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.980
to this hiking animation after baking

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.360
the simplest way is to set your key
frame moved to child

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.190
select the highest part of that i can't
chain and using the same right-click

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.749
drag method we're going to select the
option delete keys

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:06.630
kato k

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.500
and now we can repose the character at
the start framed in rebate that time

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.549
range if you don't do the two week
action first

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.059
the changes that you make in the first
frame will not take effect upon

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:18.169
repeating

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.349
now i can imagine that some people would
want to save the baking process as the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.909
final step to completing their
animations so that they can make changes

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.770
without having to tweak iniki frames

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.819
my suggestion in this case is to utilize
peak spots as a visual guide to help you

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.419
keep track of what parts of her
animation need baking

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.169
you can set bake spots via the right
click menu

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.449
or you can do it even faster by holding
the old key as he dragged across the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.610
timeline

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.680
i recommend against performing the
actual baking action through bake spots

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.209
for various reasons that are not going
to go into here

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.039
just know that most of the time

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.529
it is far more convenient suggest use
the right click multi select method for

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.439
baking

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.960
finally there's something

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.599
that i should mention before wrapping up
this tutorial because i feel the topic

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:08.719
is related

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.129
if you watch my

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.339
i k brewster starter guide video

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.499
i mentioned how these keys down here
stand for global axis disabling for i'd

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.249
keep mister controls

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.819
it turns out that this function is very
candy

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.080
when used in conjunction with the fix
command

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.680
say we want to move this character's
hands around

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.340
but we want them to not lift from the
table as we do so

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.649
all you have to do is click on the y

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:36.460
so that it's great out and look what
happens

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.150
all of my movements are

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.629
involving only the x n c planes

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.440
so if you've ever needed to restrict
what i keep mister is doing for control

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.020
that's not a problem

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.419
remember that you can actually hotkey
this as well so you don't have to move

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.030
the mouse around us much

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.950
that's the gist of the fix command
obviously can be used to help you pose a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.100
character or chain of bones as well

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.480
and there's some other little things
that the fix command can do to enhance

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.490
your control but the average user will
probably stumbled okay that's a wrap dot

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.310
hopefully everyone found this tutorial
helpful

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.990
