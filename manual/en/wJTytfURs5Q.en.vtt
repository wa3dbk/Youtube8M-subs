00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.560
So here I am going to talk you through the
process of how to record and share a pencast

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.230
with the LiveScribe Pulse SmartPen. So in
step 1 we are going to turn on the smartpen.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.200
So there is the off button there. So turn
it on. The display reads LiveScribe and then

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.619
“Starting…” and then it changes to show
the time. So it is 9:51AM. Okay so step 2

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.890
is to write a problem with the Smartpen on
the dot paper. So in this case I am going

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:48.309
to write a very simple problem. Add 23 plus
34. Okay. And then step 3 is to tap the “Record”

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.890
button on the bottom of the page, followed
by step 4 which is to solve the problem with

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.930
writing and voice explanation and then step
5 is to tap the “Stop” button. So I am

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.830
going to tap “Record”, going to write
and solve the problem with my voice and writing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.640
and then you will see me tap the “Stop”
button. Here goes.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:28.299
Here we are to add 23 plus 34. Well let us
begin by writing the 23 on the top of 34 and

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:37.500
line up the 3 and the 4 in the one’s place
and the 2 and the 3 in the ten’s place.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.370
Now underline that and now we are going to
add 3 plus 4 and that is 7 and then we have

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:56.030
to add the 2 in the 23 (which is really 20)
to the 3 in 34 (which is really 30) and 20

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:05.079
plus 30 is 50 and we write here that really
is indicating 50 so we end up with 57 for

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:15.900
our final answer here. So 23 plus 34 equals
57.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.989
So you probably noticed me right then just
tap the “Stop” button. Well great. So

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.569
we are 2 minutes into this and now what we
are going to do is step 6 which is dock the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.540
smartpen to sync with the LiveScribe Desktop.
So let me move this and bring over the cradle

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.480
and I am going to dock the smartpen and then
we will see the display on the smartpen change

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.439
in a moment indicating that the recording
is transferring. Here it comes. We will see

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.609
the display change. There – it has changed.
And now I am going to go to the LiveScribe

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:05.639
Desktop Software.
Okay so there is the LiveScribe Desktop Software.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.609
It is transferred the ink but not yet the
recording. So we can see up here at the top

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.861
it is transferring recordings off of the smartpen.
It is also building a search index or rather

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:25.749
rebuilding it. So the ink turns green indicating
that the recording has transferred. And if

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:31.510
we go back and look at the smartpen you can
see that the display is back to just showing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.099
the date or the time.
Okay so back to the smartpen. Step 7 is to

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.749
find the page with the pencast. Look for black,
which is static and green, which is dynamic

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:52.299
or active ink. We found the pencast. Now in
“pages” view, this is step 8. We are to

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.730
click active ink to activate a session. So
we are going to click on anywhere in this

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.939
green to activate a session. So that activates
the session and now the ink is replaying and

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:16.860
I can hear my voice explaining this.
Pause button here and then I am going to go

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:33.629
to step 9 next, which is to click the upload
pages and audio button on the main toolbar.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:41.389
So in step 10 we are going to name our pencast
and click OK. Alright. So we will do that.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:56.650
I am going to call this add 2 numbers with
2 digits. OK and now click OK. And now it

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.210
is uploading the pencast and we get a notification
that the pencast has been uploaded successfully.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:12.759
So click OK and now step 11 is to click the
LiveScribe Online button and what is going

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.900
to happen – ahh in fact, there it is already.
So we can see the pencast there and we could

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.860
go fullscreen to make it larger and then scroll
down just a little bit. We could replay this

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.180
pencast right there so you can see and I can
hear my voice. So make it scrub ahead and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.009
we can see this. OK.
So there is the pencast. But in step 12 what

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.969
we need to do with that pencast is to make
it public. So we are going to click “Make

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:53.319
this file public” button. Right before I
do that – I just want you to notice these

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:59.969
links here: Facebook, Embed this file, Share
with community are not yet available. So I

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.490
am going to click “Make this file public”
and now we get some additional options for

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.780
sharing our file. So step 13 – we can either
click “Get a link to this file” or we

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.240
can click “Embed this file”. Or you can
certainly “Share onFacebook”. What I am

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.199
going to do in this case is click on “Get
a link to this file”. There is the link.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:36.780
I am going to press Ctrl+C and copy it to
the clipboard and click “done”. And now

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.969
I am going to open up a browser and paste
this link into the browser. But you can paste

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.840
this link into an email or into a blog or
wherever you want it and you can do the same

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:57.590
thing with the embed code. So now I am going
over to the browser and paste this link there.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.889
And now it is going to open up and there is
the pencast.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.379
And that is all there is to it! Thank-you.
