00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:09.230
The Toshiba Encore is really a solid 8-inch
Windows 8 tablet.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.320
Its biggest selling point is the fact that
it features an Intel Atom processor, which

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.990
means although your only paying €350 for
it, which is €100 cheaper than the Microsoft

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.290
Surface 2, you are actually getting a Windows
8 Pro tablet and not an RT edition.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:32.029
This is a full x86 compatible edition of Windows
and that means all of your legacy Windows

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.309
7 applications will run.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.879
It also comes with Microsoft Office installed,
which is another major selling point.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.960
Designed to largely compete against tablets
like the Dell Venue in terms of specification

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.300
and price point, the Encore comes with a 1.33Ghz
processor, Intel HD graphics and 2GB of RAM.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.129
You won't be able to run the more processor
intensive applications that you can on the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.929
Core i5 clad Surface Pro 2 tablet, but it
is very responsive.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:06.860
Web browsing is extremely fluid with the pinch
and zoom and page rendering far faster than

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.760
some of the other tablets I've reviewed recently.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.030
Although the tablet comes with 32GB of storage
and an SD card slot to expand it, the system

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.460
only recognises 22GB out of the box and only
11GB of that is usable.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.140
The reason is because about 10GB of it is
hidden in a recovery partition, but you can

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.000
remove this to get the full capacity of 32GB
back.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.250
Alternatively you could just buy a microSD
card.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.050
The device comes with HDMI output, which is
rare enough these days and very handy for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.240
exporting this to an external display.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.170
However the mini USB port is a pain, although
it's mainly used for charging, when it comes

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.810
time for you to plug in an external device,
you'll need a host USB adaptor to do so.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.260
The design is fairly thin but not quite as
thin or light as the Dell Venue.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.880
Its plastic metallic design feels more industrial
than aesthetically pleasing, nevertheless

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.070
it's certainly not bad looking.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.700
Its battery life is a reasonable 7 hours of
general usage but its the cameras that really

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.390
impressed me, specifically the rear 8mp camera,
which takes really good photos and excellent

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.330
video with great quality sound recording.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.050
Incidentally as an experiment, I tried to
get a wireless LAN connection going between

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.940
my iMac and the Encore.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.080
It was excruciatingly difficult but that's
actually more a failing on Apple's side as

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.610
every OS since Lion seems to make Mac to Windows
Networking very difficult.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.320
I just about managed to copy Quake 1 over
to the Encore and found a compatible Windows

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.220
8 .exe launcher online.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.980
Of course I was naive to believe that I could
play the game using the touchscreen, an input

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.670
it wasn't designed for but it was a good demonstration
of legacy applications running on this Windows

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.080
8.1 Pro tablet.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.709
I did manage to pair my Apple Wireless keyboard
and mouse via bluetooth and that allowed me

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:09.970
to use the Encore like a full Windows PC,
which really useful and of course, I could

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.520
play Quake properly.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.960
The display is sharp and the 1200 x 800 resolution
is good but the brightest could be a little

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.610
better and colours aren't as vibrant as I'd
like.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.459
The pixel density is average for its display
size at 189 ppi.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.130
If you're looking for a full Windows 8 tablet
that's cheaper than the Surface Pro 2 and

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.870
can be docked to a keyboard, mouse and display
for use as a full desktop machine, the Toshiba

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.080
Encore won't disappoint.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.940
It can even be used as an Xbox second screen
companion device and is fully compatible with

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.599
smart glass.

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.420
All this for just €350 from Harvey Norman.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:22.220
A worthy mid-range Windows 8 tablet and a
great effort from Toshiba.
