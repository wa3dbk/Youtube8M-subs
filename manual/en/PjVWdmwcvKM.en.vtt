Hey guys, Dr. Axe here, Doctor of Functional
Medicine and founder of DrAxe.com.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.760
Today I'm going to talk to you about essential
oils for weight loss.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.700
So many people today want to learn how to
burn fat and lose weight fast but also safe

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
and effectively.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.590
For that reason, essential oils are one of
your best choices.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.579
I want to be up front with you and let you
know you're not going to start using essential

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.780
oils and lose 20, 30, or 50 pounds.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.770
But it could help your body in losing weight,
support your body in that way, and also help

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.350
you lose a couple of pounds as well.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.070
There are really three main essential oils
that I really believe can help your body in

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.070
weight loss.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.010
The number one essential oil is grapefruit
oil.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.499
Grapefruit essential oil actually works with
your body in activating enzymes that help

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.899
your body break down brown body fat.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.880
We know that the essential oil of grapefruit
actually comes from the grapefruit peel, which

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.520
is very high as well in certain compounds
like d-Limonene, which helps support the metabolism

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.400
and even cleansing and drainage of your lymphatic
glands.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.729
For that reason, grapefruit essential oil
is the number one oil that can help your body

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.020
in burning fat and losing weight because of
how it activates enzymes in your saliva, which

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.700
helps break down body fat in your body.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.950
The second best essential oil to support weight
loss is cinnamon oil.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.460
Cinnamon oil has been shown time and time
again to help regulate blood glucose levels

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.570
and something in your body called GTF, glucose
tolerance factor.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.610
For that reason, cinnamon oil is also fantastic
for anybody with diabetes.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.210
It helps keep those sugar cravings at bay.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.780
It helps balance blood sugar, which long term
will help with weight loss and help reduce

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.560
those cravings for sugar.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.149
The third essential oil that supports the
body in weight loss is ginger essential oil.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.609
Ginger works because it also reduces sugar
cravings and helps reduce inflammation in

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:04.880
the body.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140
It's so important that if you're going to
lose weight, that you're also reducing inflammation

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.450
and also supporting digestion and absorption
of nutrients.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.840
The compounds in ginger are called gingerols.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.840
Gingerols have been scientifically proven
to reduce inflammation in your intestines

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.290
and overall improve absorption of the vitamins
and minerals you're consuming.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.420
If you're absorbing more vitamins and minerals,
that supports your body's cellular energy

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.790
which also supports weight loss.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.750
So if you are looking to lose weight by using
essential oils, I recommend grapefruit oil,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.050
cinnamon oil, and ginger oil.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.160
Sometimes you can get those in compounds,
or you can use those three individually.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.070
You can put one single drop of each in water
and drink it that way, or you can actually

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.300
put it on topically or diffuse it.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.630
When you're putting it on topically, I recommend
using a carrier oil like coconut oil, especially

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.380
when you're using the cinnamon oil.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.200
Again, you can actually add it to things.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.560
Or again, one of my favorite ways is just
diffuse it.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.960
You can diffuse it on your desk at the office.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.490
You can diffuse it around your home.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.970
It has a great scent.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.220
It will activate things in your body that
will actually support weight loss.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.990
Again, to lose weight try those essential
oils.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.760
Essential oils have been used for over 5,000
years.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.570
They're one of the most powerful forms of
medicine in the world.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.250
Grapefruit, cinnamon, and ginger are probably
the most effective essential oils for weight

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.250
loss.
