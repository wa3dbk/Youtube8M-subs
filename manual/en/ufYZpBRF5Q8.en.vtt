00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.640
Hello once again folks.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.980
It is Paul here with hookah.org and I have
a very requested video for you guys.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.840
This one is my top five picks for favorite
and best modern hookah tobaccos that you can

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.250
get as of right now June 2014.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.640
Lets start off very simply with Nakhla Mizo
Mint.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.950
I think that this is pretty much my top pick
for any mint on the market.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.400
There are some other great mints out there
but this one just has that wonderful balance

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.860
of sweet mint flavor with a really strong
menthol kick and more than anything, what

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.750
really sells this one for me is it is super
stable.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.409
It maintains its flavor throughout the entire
session right down to the last puff, and it

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.050
stays minty on the shelf where I've had a
lot of other mint flavors lose their potency

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.050
over time.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.810
Nakhla Mizo Mint I've had one pack for the
better part of a few years and it has maintain

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.329
every little nuisance.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:22.520
Next up is actually what I'm smoking right
now, which you can obviously see gives great

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.890
clouds because that’s what you expect from
Social Smoke.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.659
This is Social Smoke Mango Habanero.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.320
You have heard my rant about this one.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.920
You have heard me rave about this one and
I knew it was going to hit my top five list

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920
right away.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.189
The first time that I smoked it, and I've
been smoking it for months now, absolutely

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.189
love it.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.509
It is an off the beaten path kind of flavor
that offers something that no other tobacco

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.890
on the market offers right now.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.359
That distinct spicy characteristic with a
little bit of a pepper note, really beautiful

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.040
stuff and the mango flavor is wonderfully
sweetened.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.259
I think that they are both balanced perfectly.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:06.590
I love it and if you haven't tried it, I really
cannot suggest it enough.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.230
Next up we are going to go to Tangiers with
Peach Ice Tea.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.010
I have listed Peach Ice Tea as one of my favorite
flavors for the better part of five maybe

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.470
six years at this point and it has yet to
be unseated.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.349
Tangiers does peach flavors better than almost
anyone else on the market.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.840
I have yet to find a pure peach flavor that
rivals Juicy Peach, but Peach Ice Tea has

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.120
that sweet tea flavor in the background that
it hits you on the back note and it is just

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.560
a perfect balance to the really sweet juicy
flavor of fresh peaches.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.569
I really love that tobacco and I'm going to
keep that on hand right until they stop making

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.599
it.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.970
Next we’re going to stick with Tangiers,
Tangiers Mimon.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.159
Mimon is a mint and lemon flavor that I think
once again is just about perfectly balanced.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.800
It is more of a natural lemon than a lot of
people expect.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.260
It’s a bit oily.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.290
I know that sounds unpleasant but I swear
it has this really sweet nice lemon oil flavor

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.410
that does not come across like a cleaning
product.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.090
It’s really nice and balanced by a really
great natural mint flavor that I think is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.360
just beautifully refreshing.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.879
It helps me come back anytime I over smoke
myself on one particular flavor.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.209
I load up mimon and I am clear as a bell and
my palette is refreshed.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:02.200
Wonderful stuff available in both Noir and
Lucid, and both of them have a really nice

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.709
thick rich mouth feel to them.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:16.470
Lastly, we take a trip back to Social Smoke
with Social Smoke Arabian Nights.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.030
This is a Turkish coffee flavor that has nice
hints of chocolate and earth, really nice

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.510
rich coffee flavors with a great velvety mouth
feel to it, and some sweet spice notes on

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.230
the back end that really keep me interested
throughout the entire session.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.880
It is one of my favorite tobaccos.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.530
I have enjoyed it since it first came out
and I will continue to enjoy it for a very

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.530
long time.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.370
I've used it successfully to introduce a lot
of people to a more savory side of hookah

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.130
to a more traditional style of tobacco and
flavor.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.320
It is a great tobacco all around that I think
you'll absolutely enjoy and you might want

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.510
to check out if you’ve only been smoking
candy and fruit flavors at this point.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.210
This is my list of the top five modern style
tobaccos that I am absolutely in love with.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.520
They are the best in my standards and they're
the ones that I keep on hand at all times.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.460
