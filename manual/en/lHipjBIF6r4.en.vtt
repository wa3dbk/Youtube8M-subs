00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.609
The MTS-255 Shotgun is a double action shotgun
which essentially lets you fire semi automatically.

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.790
It has the highest fire rate but is average
otherwise.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.849
The main problem is the small magazine size,
you only get 5 slugs between reloads.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.810
Move around the map so that you stay in close
quarters and always fire from the hip.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.990
Due to the high visual recoil of the MTS-255
aiming down the sight and getting successive

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.289
shots on target is difficult.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.080
Therefore always fire from the hip and try
to avoid fights that are at the edge of your

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.330
range.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.930
Usually it takes more than one slug to kill
enemies so reload frequently in safe positions.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.670
Taking out multiple enemies is hard due to
the small number of slugs between reloads.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.360
Since the MTS-255 only has average range and
damage you have to be very close to enemies

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.840
to kill them.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.460
Therefore stay away from objectives and don't
attack enemies that are out of your range.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.840
If they aren't allerted try to get closer.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.670
If they are try to retreat or use cover to
get to them or lure them closer.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.180
The high recoil of the MTS-255 makes it hard
to hit successive shots, even when you fire

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.409
from the hip.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.460
Use the Foregrip to keep the recoil under
control.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.359
To increase the range of the MTS-255 us the
Muzzle Brake which helps especially at the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.359
edge of your range.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.610
There are several problems the MTS-255 has,
such as the recoil, flinching and range.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.189
Use perks that help you out with each of those.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.869
Marathon gives you unlimited sprint making
it easier to get close to enemies quickly.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.700
Steady Aim reduces the hip fire spread of
the MTS-255 giving you some extra range and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.549
letting you kill more reliably.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.719
Amplify lets you hear close by enemies.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.579
If you don't have headphones use Ping instead.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.490
Focus reduces flinching which is helpful even
when you fire from the hip.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.610
In summary the MTS-255 is good at taking out
single enemies at short range.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.969
Use the Foregrip, Muzzle Brake and selected
perks to increase your range and make it easier

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.310
to get close to enemies.
