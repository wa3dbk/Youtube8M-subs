00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.501
In the movies, when people have heart attacks,
they often clutch their chest in pain and

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.950
collapse on the floor.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.370
But in real life, that's often not the way
it happens.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.400
We bring you the bottom line on secret symptoms
of a heart attack.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.390
Hi, I'm Pilar Gerasimo, with a Bottom Line
Expert report on heart attacks.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.920
I'm here today with Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum,
director of Women's Heart Health at Lenox

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.059
Hill Hospital in New York City.

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.640
Dr. Steinbaum, I notice that in the movies,
there are these incredibly dramatic events—you

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.060
know, people have heart attacks and they clutch
their chest, they fall to the floor, they

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.649
die instantly.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.280
But in real life, I understand that that's
not actually the way it happens.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.789
Can you tell us a little bit about what does
it actually look and feel like to have a heart

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.789
attack?

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.399
It's not always that Hollywood heart attack.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.039
There are often more subtle signs.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.179
Definitely chest pain or pressure is the most
common symptom people have, but it could also

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:09.210
be shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, back
pain, jaw pain, vomiting, even flulike symptoms,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.010
so don't exactly expect that Hollywood heart
attack.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.230
You just described a whole bunch of symptoms,
many of which could be everyday ailments.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.210
It might be indigestion—I ate something
too spicy... or I'm coming down with the flu.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
How do I differentiate between these every
day things and something that could be much

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.280
more dramatic?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.500
When you think about what a heart attack is—which
is actually lack of oxygen to the heart muscle—that's

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.850
when you get the symptoms.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.040
So if it is happening with exertion and with
really exercising and then if it is relieved

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.720
with rest, think about your heart.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.660
If you have indigestion, you take something
for your stomach and it goes away, so it's

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.180
probably not your heart.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.470
If you have pain, you take an anti-inflammatory
and it goes away, again, probably not your

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.470
heart.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.960
But if the symptoms come back, you really
should not dismiss it.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.020
And think heart first!

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.720
It is better to be wrong than to be sorry.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.940
So I know that there's sometimes confusion
about the difference between a heart attack

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.550
and cardiac arrest.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.709
Could you explain the difference to us?

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.019
Cardiac arrest is truly sudden death, and
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.329
When someone has a heart attack, it's damage
to the heart muscle.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.749
We can intervene...we can open blood flow
of that artery to the muscle...and we can

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.489
actually prevent people from having heart
damage.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.579
So it's a very important distinction.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.780
One there is nothing we can do about, unless
maybe if it is witnessed and we can do CPR.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.380
But for people having a heart attack, it's
about intervention, getting to the doctor,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.209
getting to the hospital as soon as possible.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.420
The bottom line on heart attack symptoms is
that they often disguise themselves as other

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.230
ailments, but if you're dealing with symptoms
that are being made worse by exertion and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.730
aren't responding to relatively simple treatments
and remedies for things like indigestion or

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.530
flu, it's probably time to be on the safe
side and call your doctor.
