00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:15.524
The Magic of the Mountain of Orpheus

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.395
The name of the Rhodope mountain
was known as early as Antiquity.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.272
It had been mentioned by Homer, Vergil and Ovid –

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:24.741
the most legendary authors
of epic poems.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.176
Rhodope is a mountain
which fills all senses.

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:32.074
The crystal clean air,
untouched nooks of beauty,

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:36.018
incredible natural phenomena,
formed thousands of years ago...

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:37.126
and of course,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.790
the mountain resounding with the
wonderful the Rhodopean song.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.634
Have you heard the legend of Orpheus?

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:45.123
The mythical singer,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.564
who was enchanting everyone with his
music: people, beasts and birds.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.398
He was even a rival of God Apollo.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.162
During the campaign of the argonauts,

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:57.492
Orpheus deafened the dangerous song
of the sirens and saved the heroes.

00:00:58.182 --> 00:01:03.014
He was born here, in the Rhodope mountain,
and his whole life passed in these lands.

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:06.568
Mythologized because of his
supernatural abilities,

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:10.888
Orpheus stands in the beginning of an
entire system of religious beliefs.

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:14.466
The mysteries of Orpheus
were accessible only to devoted people

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:17.678
and were happening in closed
societies and in concealed places.

00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:21.647
The Phodope mountain is rich in monuments
belonging to various historical ages,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.853
preserved traditions and incredibly
beautiful and clean nature.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.027
Some of the most unique monuments
are Tatul and Perperikon.

00:01:31.238 --> 00:01:33.469
A unique megalithic monument was found
at a distance of two hundred meters

00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:35.559
from the Rhodopean village of Tatul.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:39.987
It consists of an ancient pagan
sanctuary and a medieval fortress.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:42.893
A grave is carved on the rock peak, in east-west direction,

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:46.997
in a massive cliff,
made in the shape of crossed pyramid.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.800
Another tomb is carved at the south side of the rock
in a hemispherical niche.

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:56.877
A solemn staircase carved in the rocks
leads to the two graves,

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:00.323
and cult platforms are shaped
on the nearby cliffs.

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:04.273
It is believed that the sanctuary dates
back to the 12th century BC

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:08.682
and the offerings had been performed
at dawn and dusk.

00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:14.141
Even larger is the scale of the megalithic
sanctuary in the East Rhodope mountain –

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:15.768
Perperikon.

00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:19.887
The mighty fortified wall,
the acropolis made of large stone blocks,

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:23.844
the palace carved in the rocks,
the system of streets,

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:28.240
the residential buildings and the temples
have been here since the late stone age.

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.938
The legend calls it an ancient
sanctuary of Dionysus

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:36.308
and claims that prophecies crucial
for humankind had been made here;

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:40.759
and naturally, the fact that the grave of Orpheus
is hidden among these rocks.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.729
Regardless of the rivalry,
Perperikon and Tatul

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:48.438
have been considered sacred lands
since antiquity.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:52.850
And the song of Orpheus belongs
to entire Rhodope mountain.
