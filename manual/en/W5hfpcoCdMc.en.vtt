00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now so far we've dealt only with games that take a single turn--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that is there are two players, they both simultaneously reveal their move,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the game is over.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But game theory can also deal with more complex games

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that have multiple rounds of turn taking.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here I'm describing a simple game of poker,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the simplest type of poker you've probably ever seen.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The deck only has four cards.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
One card is dealt to each player.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There are two rounds.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In the first, player one has a choice to either raise--to bet a dollar--or to check.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Then in the second round, the second player has the chance to call--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to say I want to see what's up--or to fold.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now this format begins to look very much like the game tree

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that we talked about in the previous unit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It starts out and there's a chance node.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This corresponds to dealing the cards with the 1/6 that the first player gets an Ace

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the second player gets an Ace.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
One-third that the first player gets and Ace and the second Player gets a Kind, and so on.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There there are maximizing nodes and minimizing nodes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What this format, which is known as the sequential game format,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is especially good at is keeping track of the belief states of the possibilities

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of what each agent knows and doesn't know.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The tree as a whole describes everything that's going on,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but each agent doesn't know at which point in the tree they are.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So if you're agent number one, you know that you have an Ace,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so you know you're in one of these two states denoted by the dotted lines.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're either in the state where you have an Ace and the other player has an Ace,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or in the state where you have an Ace and the other player has a King,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But you don't know which one you're at.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Similarly, over here there is confusion for the second player as to what state they're in.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, we can solve this game using this game tree approach,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and it's not quite the same as the max and the min approach,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because where you are in the states, what you know about the partial information,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
affects your strategy in a way that we haven't dealt with before.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
One possibility for how you can evaluate again like this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is just to convert it to the other form.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The form we've seen before is called the normal form or matrix form.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is the sequential game in extensive form.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If we convert the extensive form, we get something like this.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Here for each player, we've denoted by a two-letter strategy

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
what you should do when you have an Ace and what you should do when you have a King.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So we end up with an exponentially large search space,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but here the game was so simple, that it ends up being rather small,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the game is rather trivial, and you can solve it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It turns out that there are two equilibrium corresponding to the strategy for player two,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
which is he should check when he has an Ace, and he should fold when he has a King,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and strategy for player one is it doesn't matter if he raises or checks when has an Ace,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but he should check when he has a King.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That would give the game a value of zero.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now this works fine for the simple version of poker.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
For real poker, this table would have about 10^18 states,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and it would be impossible to deal with.

00:03:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So we need some strategies for getting back down to a reasonable number of states.
