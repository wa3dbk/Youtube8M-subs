Hey guys it's Tresh from Treshtoons and today,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.120
i'm bringing you another video, a week after i uploaded my last one

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.620
and for who didnt see the last video where i explain what is going on, please go watch it

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.400
but anyway, about this video,it's an idea Sugested by Luis Silva

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.180
one of the characters in this drawing, the idea came from a change of tweets

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.960
between me, Luis and Wuant some time ago

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.460
that it would be cool to make a game where the characters would be youtubers, fighting

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.500
and since i don't know how to make that, neither i want to, and nobody else did so far too

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.440
so Luis idea was to make a drawing on how that could look like, but, crossing it with super smash brothers

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.240
some time ago i did a super smash brothers speedart, which i am a fan of, in the meanwhile

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:23.380
i actually bought a wii-u so i actually know how things work in game!

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.640
The map is Yoshi's Island, it wasnt supose to be an exact copy

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:41.020
because the people to who i shown this told me that the cubes arn't in a exact number

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.320
but that was actually the idea :)!

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.740
but adding the youtubers whom which i talk to regularly, and the ones i follow....fighting!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.540
the drawing took me arround 4 hours and a half to finish, and there you go

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.880
this is one of the good things of doing less videos

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.280
i end up having way more time and i can take as much time as i want perfecting stuff, that i will enjoy more

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.540
it was 4 hours and a half divided by 2 or 3 days to finish this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.380
background was made in photoshop and characters were made in adobe illustrator

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.700
The characters you can see are: Luis Silva, Me, Wuant, D4rkframe, BP and Remedy

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.920
you will be able to find everyone's channel in the discription if you don't know them(all portuguese)

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.180

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.900
i promiss that i will keep bringing videos just as i promissed i would bring 1 a week at least

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.820
and this week, here you go, i've been having new ideas for videos

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.260
and i think you guys will enjoy them, and that's all for now
