00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.250
I'm so excited about this recipe. In the past,
I've only been able to get really flavorful

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.910
tofu when I marinate it overnight. And who
wants to wait that long? This braising technique

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.810
solves that problem. You get flavorful tofu
in a fraction of the time.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.239
I always press my tofu for at least an hour
with my handy dandy TofuXpress.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.029
Look at all of that water. You really can't
get that much water out, doing it the fashioned

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:35.860
way. It really makes a difference in the texture.
I like to cut my tofu in cute little triangles.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:47.710
I cut the block in half. Then I cut each half
into thirds, then I cut it in half again to

00:00:47.710 --> 00:01:01.040
make 2 squares. then I cut an X in each square.
Next, heat a nonstick pan without oil and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.060
you're gonna dry fry the tofu.
I cook it for at least 5 minutes on each side

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.039
in batches since I can't fit all of it in
my pan at one time. And if it's sticking when

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.210
you go to flip, let it cook a few minutes
longer. It should release pretty easily once

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.810
it's done.
While the tofu is cooking, make the braising

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.130
liquid. We're using ½ cup of vegetable broth,
¼ cup of soy sauce, ¼ cup of rice wine vinegar,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.979
2 tablespoons of agave nectar, 2 teaspoons
of ground ginger, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder,

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.889
1 teaspoon of onion powder, ¼ teaspoon of
black pepper and ⅛ teaspoon of crushed red

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:49.780
pepper flakes.
Mix it well.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.209
Once you've dry fried all of the tofu, add
it all back into the pan. Then pour in your

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.799
braising liquid.
Cover the pan, turn down the heat and let

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.569
it simmer for 10 minutes.
After 10 minutes, uncover the pan and turn

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.140
up the heat to medium-high and let the sauce
reduce for about 5 minutes.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.601
While it's reducing, we're gonna make a slurry
with ½ teaspoon of cornstarch and 1 teaspoon

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:25.640
of water. Mix it until the cornstarch dissolves.
After the sauce has reduced, remove the tofu

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.111
with a slotted spatula or spoon. You really
wanna keep all of that sauce in the pan. Add

00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:37.161
the cornstarch slurry and stir the sauce.
It should thicken in less than a minute. Pour

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:43.740
it over the tofu and enjoy. You'll probably
want to adjust the braising liquid to your

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.810
taste, just make sure you have a total of
one cup. You can leave out the soy sauce completely

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.800
if you're sensitive to salt.
And if you make this, you know I want to hear

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.330
about it in the comments.
