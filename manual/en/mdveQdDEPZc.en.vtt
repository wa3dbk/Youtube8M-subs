Hey there guys this is Shira for Internet Marketing Duru 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.900
and in this video we’re going to take a look at how to read Kindle books without actually owning a Kindle.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.230
So thanks to Ryan, who wrote me an email through my website  

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.330
www.InternetmarketingDuru.com and told me that he really wants to read my Kindle books 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.196
but doesn’t own a Kindle, So Ryan, this one’s for you!

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.130
Amazon is interested in people buying as many Kindle books as possible 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.860
and realizes that not everyone is going to own a Kindle. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.360
And that’s why Amazon came out with Free Reading Apps that you can download for free from Amazon, 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.500
the link is below this video and let me run through a few examples so that you can get set up fast. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.600
So let’s say that you are using a simple computer, a PC, and you would like to read a Kindle book. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.560
So you come to this page and you click on “Windows to PC” and click on that and then click on download. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:08.300
Now you can see that automatically this download is starting, 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.900
I’m going to download this file and it’s going to go to my downloads folder on my PC 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.800
and after that we’re going to actually go to the download and install it. 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.800
So I’m going to save the file, I’m going to wait until the download is complete. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.100
And there are step by step instructions here, 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.260
where I’m basically going to double click on this 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.600
and then I’m going to install the Kindle for PC, which is what I downloaded. 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.400
Now let me show you what that looks like. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.830
So as you can see in my downloads I have the Kindle to PC installer. 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.930
Now I already have this installed on my PC, 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.260
so I’m not actually going to run through, 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.030
but all you need to do is actually double click on this, 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.730
and click on “RUN” and then just go through the wizard. 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.660
Now once you have completed the installation, then it will open automatically, 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:12.160
but later on you can access it from your Start bar -&gt; go to Kindle for PC and the application is going to open. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.360
Now the first time that you install this you’re going to need to set it up. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.930
And it’s very simple, if you have any problems then simply contact Amazon and they’ll sort it out for you. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.660
Once you go to you Library, you’ll be able to see all your downloaded items, 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.660
you’ll be able to see basically any book, and you can buy a sample before you read it.  

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.960
So lets’ see,  I downloaded this is sample before I actually bought this book, 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.160
I downloaded the free sample from Amazon and I scrolled through, 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.960
and then I read some and then when I got to the end I simply bought it from inside the Kindle, 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.160
it took me to Amazon and I bought the book. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.860
So this is what books look like on the Kindle, 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.960
this is a sample, you can also buy the full books and go to your Library, 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:02.660
check something out and start reading it, OK?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.160
Inside the Kindle book you can choose where to go to, 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.800
Table of contents, beginning, location. This is my table of contents. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.200
And in the Kindle now if I click n this it will take me to the right place in the Kindle and I can scroll using the arrows, 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:23.400
I can highlight sections, I can add a note, I can copy a few sections,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.060
I can look things up and there’s lots and lots of things you can do with the Kindle for PC reader. 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.330
So just because you don’t own a Kindle, 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.430
does not mean that you cannot read Kindle books. 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.730
Go to Amazon and download the Kindle Reader to PC, 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.660
now if you’re not using a PC and you’re using a MAC, then you’re going to want to download the MAC reader, 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.160
and if you’re on an iPhone and you want to read books on you’re iPhone, 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.730
even though it might be a little small then you can download the iPhone App and so on. 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.730
So check out the Free Kindle for PC reading Apps and start reading Kindle books!

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.596
