00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.967
The President:
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:04.633
Please have a seat.

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:09.500
We are here today to celebrate
a great American sport.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.000
And obviously we've had this
event scheduled for some time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.166
and events have a
way of intervening.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.500
Obviously our minds right now
are very much with our fellow

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.600
Americans and fans and competent
competitors from all over the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.700
world who woke up yesterday
and went to run and cheer on at

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.300
another terrific sporting
event, the Boston Marathon.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.200
So I know the entire NASCAR
family shares with me just an

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.433
incredible sense of loss.

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.734
We mourn the victims, we
pray for their loved ones.

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:55.367
And rest assured, as I said
today and we'll continue to say

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.867
until it gets done, that we're
going to uncover whoever it is

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:02.567
that was responsible for
yesterday's cowardly act,

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.934
we're going to find out why they
did it and they will be brought

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.433
to justice.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.533
But one of the things that
I firmly believe in is that

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.500
America is strong and
that we are resilient,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.900
and we don't let such
cowardly acts get in the way

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.500
of our lives.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.900
And today we're here to
congratulate Brad Keselowski for

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.767
winning his first NASCAR
Sprint Cup Championship,

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.033
so give him a big
round of applause.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:35.066
(applause)

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.900
I don't think is single one of
Brad's fans has forgotten the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.800
post-race interview he gave on
Sports Center after taking the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.934
Cup in the Homestead last year,
it was memorable for a few

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:49.333
reasons, but mostly it was a
celebration with the fans that

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:52.033
helped to make his
victory possible.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.000
And Brad said on that date, life
is a team sport and I have the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.433
best team, my family, my
friends, my fans, my coworkers,

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.734
without them, I am nothing.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:05.900
That's what Brad said.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.400
And that's really what life
is all about, our family,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.567
our friends, our coworkers,
everybody who makes us who we

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.767
are, the people who are there
through triumph but also through

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:22.400
tragedy and hardship, the people
who cheer us on when we succeed

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.734
and who pick us up when we fall.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:28.767
That's who we remember, that's
what matters in life as well

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.500
as in sports.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.033
Now, Brad is a heck of a driver,
but he and every other driver

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:38.433
rely on a whole team of people
to keep everything running

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.734
right, because if one thing
goes wrong, a slow pit stop,

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:47.033
a missing lug nut, a flat tire,
if one person is not doing his

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.867
or her part, that can
cost you the race.

00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:53.200
And Brad will be first to tell
you that it was his crew's

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.500
consistency throughout the
season that put him in a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.333
position to take home the cup.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.967
The partnership between
Brad and his crew chief,

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.734
Paul Wolfe who is here today is
admired and well-known around

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:06.266
the NASCAR world, so give
Paul a big round of applause.

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:12.233
(applause)

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.066
Their friendship,
their teamwork,

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:17.367
their desire to win it all kept
the whole crew firing on all

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.667
cylinders, especially
in a final race.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.367
With the help of his crew, Brad
brought home the first ever

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:28.000
Sprint Cup Championship for
team owner Roger Penske who is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
something of a racing
legend himself,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.300
so congratulations to Brad
and Roger and Paul and all the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.867
Penske racing team.

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.000
Congratulations!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.834
Speaker:
Appreciate it.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:43.300
Thank you very much.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.233
The President:
Now, folks, I was just
talking to Brad on the way out.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.000
People who have known Brad a
long time aren't surprised I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.200
gather that he's up here because
he practically grew up on a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.500
racetrack with his dad and
his uncle tinkering on cars,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.100
working the crew for their
family-owned race team before he

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.633
got behind the wheel.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.300
He had it in his blood
from the beginning.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.934
His racer's mentality, his
commitment to the team,

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:10.967
and his belief that you've
always got to keep pushing to

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:12.400
be your best.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.533
That's why he started the Race
to Recovery Program through his

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.033
Checkered Flag Foundation.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:21.400
Race to Recovery recognizes
wounded warriors who've worked

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.233
hard through intense
rehabilitation to come back from

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:28.600
his or her injuries, and those
brave warriors get to head down

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.567
to the track for a VIP
experience and a chance to ride

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.133
shotgun with Brad.

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:36.834
Because for Brad, our veterans
are an important part

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:38.533
of his team.

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:39.867
Again, I'm going to quote him.

00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:42.233
"I couldn't do what I do on the
racetrack without these men and

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:45.633
"women making the sacrifices
that they do for me."

00:04:45.633 --> 00:04:48.367
So Brad, I want to thank you
for visiting with some of our

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:51.867
wounded warriors
later this afternoon,

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:56.100
and I want to thank you as
well as the chairman and CEO of

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.600
NASCAR, Brian France, who
is here for not only being

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.300
president of this celebration,
but your long tradition of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.500
honoring our troops
and our veterans,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.233
we very much appreciate it.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:13.700
(applause)

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.066
So none of us could do what we
do without the men and women who

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:20.300
sacrifice for us every single
day, our troops, our veterans,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.734
and as we were reminded
yesterday once again,

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:27.467
the First Responders and
National Guardsmen who run

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:31.066
towards trouble without regard
for their own safety so they can

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:32.533
look out for ours.

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:36.033
I want to thank all of them, all
our men and women in uniform who

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:37.600
keep us safe.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.400
But most of all, we're here
today to congratulate Brad and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.767
his whole team, best of
luck as you gear up for

00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:45.333
this year's chase.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.900
I was just telling them, I was
getting tired of seeing Johnson

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.867
all the time, and I understand
that now Brad and Jimmy are

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:58.734
going at it again, so I know
that this is going to be a

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:02.033
competitive race, a competitive
Sprint this year as well,

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:06.700
and I know that all the drivers
in NASCAR bring great joy to

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.467
their fans, great competitive
spirit to what they do every

00:06:10.467 --> 00:06:15.000
single day, it is a unique
American sport and we are so

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
proud to support it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.033
So Brad, congratulations,
great job!

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:19.333
Brad Keselowski:
Thank you very much,
appreciate it, sir.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:21.000
Thank you.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.033
The President:
Now I'm going to take a
look at this spiffy car.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.600
Brad offered to let me drive
it around the South Lawn,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.400
but Secret Service
once again said no.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.100
(laughter)
