00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.780
Purple is a weird colour.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.260
The formal name for purple is
magenta, and the weird thing

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.990
about magenta is that you won't

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.050
ever see it in a rainbow.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.320
And the rainbow is supposed
to be the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.930
full spectrum of colours.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.310
So why doesn't purple,
why doesn't magenta

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.660
appear in the rainbow?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.670
And the answer is to do
with colour mixing.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.390
I've always had a problem with
colour mixing, because I know

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.920
that you can't mix
photons together.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
So you can't take a blue photon
and a green photon and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.190
mix them together to get
some other photon.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.000
That just doesn't happen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
And yet, you can mix paints
together in art.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520
Color mixing is definitely
something you can do.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.420
So what's the answer?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.680
Well actually, you can't mix
colors together in physics,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.450
but you can do it in biology.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.950
It's to do with how
your eyes work.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.390
For example, if I shine red
light and green light into

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.810
your eyes at the same time, if
I cross these over, you will

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410
see yellow.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.040
So when you mix red and green
together, you get yellow.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.240
And if you look at the spectrum,
yellow is in between

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.020
red and green.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.140
So maybe that's the rule for
mixing colours together.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.420
You mix two colors together, you
get the colour in between

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.450
on the colour spectrum.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.850
And we can test that again,
so I'll look at

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.090
green and blue together.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.560
So if I mix green and blue
together, I get cyan.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.190
And cyan is in between blue
and green on the spectrum.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.830
So that's great, you mix two
colours together, you get the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.250
colour in between.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.240
But why, why is that?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.570
Well, your eyes can't
measure the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.150
wavelength of light directly.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.810
So it's not like a photon comes
in, and you know, it's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.670
200 nanometers or whatever,
and it detects that.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.860
Instead, you have these cone
cells at the back of your eyes

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.980
that are sensitive to different

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.400
parts of the spectrum.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.840
So when red light comes into
your eyes, there's a set of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.250
cones that fire and tell your
brain you're looking at

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.850
something red.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.130
So we'd call those
the red cones.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.110
There's another set of cones
that are more sensitive to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470
green, so when there's green
light going into your eyes,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.660
they fire and they send a
message to your brain.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.810
And there's blue
cones, as well.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.030
So you've got red cones, green
cones, and blue cones.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.120
So what about yellow?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.515
What about when you're looking
at yellow light, like that?

00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:30.110
Well in that situation, you
don't have a yellow cone.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.760
So what do you do?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.850
Well, yellow is quite close
to red, so your red

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.180
cone fires a bit.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.710
And yellow is quite close to
green as well, so your green

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.880
cone fires a bit.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.390
So your brain is getting a
message from your red cone and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.720
your green cone at the same
time, and it's deciding, OK

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.980
well, I must be looking at
something in between those two

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.530
colours, then.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.400
And that's brilliant, because
your brain is perceiving

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.160
something about the world
that it isn't

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.765
able to measure directly.

00:02:55.765 --> 00:03:00.360
It isn't directly sensitive
to yellow light.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.530
It does mean that you
can be tricked.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.430
And so if I make red light and
green light go into your eyes,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.930
but no yellow light, you
will see yellow.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.620
Anyway.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.440
So, go red torch and a green
torch, and there's no yellow

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.250
light, here.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.310
But when I combine them, you
will see yellow, anyway.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.360
And TVs do this all the time.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.100
So if you look up close
at TV, you'll see

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.660
the individual pixels.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.670
And there are red pixels, green
pixels, and blue pixels.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.430
Those are the only colours being
produced by your TV.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.540
And yet, they can produce all
the other colors with this

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.310
trick of colour mixing.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.746
So what about purple?

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.080
What about magenta?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.300
Well, what should your brain do
if your red cone fires at

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.990
one end of the spectrum and your
blue cone fires at the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.280
other end of the spectrum, but
your green cone doesn't fire?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.620
Does it do the same trick?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.420
Does is think I must be looking
at colour in between

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.540
red and blue?

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.630
When the colour between red and
blue is green, and you're

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.550
definitely not looking at
something green, because your

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.090
green cone isn't firing.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.210
So in that situation, your
brain invents a colour.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.830
It makes up a color, and that
colour, is magenta.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.730
And I can show you that with
my red and blue torches.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.530
So when they're combined
together

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.079
there, you see magenta--

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.519
absolutely beautiful.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.769
And that's why you don't see
magenta in the spectrum.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.790
You don't see magenta in the
rainbow, because it doesn't

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.690
have a wavelength.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.210
It's just the absence of
green, if you like.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.980
Just to show you the full
palette of colours that you

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.330
can see on a TV screen--

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.070
so you get red and blue mixed
together makes magenta.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.940
Green and red makes yellow.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.540
Green and blue make cyan.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.230
When you mix them all together,
you get white.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.015
So when your red cone, your
green cone, and your blue cone

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:51.620
are firing together, you
get white light.
