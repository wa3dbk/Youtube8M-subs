Hi welcome back to Hair with Hollie with me
Hollie.

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.819
Today we're going to be doing some Emma Watson
looks, so great for shorter hair.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:07.930
We're going to do two styles.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.820
One, which is a bit more relaxed, kind of
cool, boho, and the second one, which is really

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
red carpet.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.660
Great for the weekends.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.350
[Music]

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.819
Okay, so for the first look today we're going
to go quite a red carpet look with something

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.130
quite natural, easy, breezy.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.490
So, we're going to start with quite a deep
side parting.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.620
So use just about the arch of your brow as
a guide.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.840
There you go, and then just brush the hair
across the face.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.500
So, if you have kind of curlier hair, it might
be a better idea to straighten it before you

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.070
start, but this hair is quite straight so
we're okay.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.420
So, we're going to put a little bit of gel
in the hair just to give it a little bit of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.420
grip and to help it stay in place.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.060
So, just working with the gel on your comb,
which is handy, comb it through the lengths

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:09.340
of the hair and just help give a bit of definition
and a bit of grip.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.420
So, when you come to the front section, or
the section where you have your fringe, it's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.850
kind of important to spend a bit of time on
this because you want to get quite a textured

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.030
and quite a detailed look.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.240
[Music]

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.720
And all the products I have used today, you
will be able to find them in the description

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.180
box.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.790
When you are happy with your look and the
placement of the bangs are different, I am

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.010
just going to finish off the whole thing with
a bit of hairsray.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.240
Mind your eyes.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.270
There we go.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.119
And just smooth down any little flyaways that
happen to be at the top at all.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.119
[Music]

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.960
So, there you have it.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.080
There is our first Emma Watson look done.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.750
So, we're going to go straight into the second
one now and do kind of more of a red carpet

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.750
sleek look.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:13.400
So, again we're going to go with a deep side
parting just on the outer edge of the brow

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.440
and then pull the hair over to one side, combing
from the back just to make sure you get it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440
all over.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.480
So, product is key for this look.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.900
So, we're going to work a lot of gel into
the hair starting up at the roots and working

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.360
it down all the way to the tip.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.650
So, I just have some gel on my comb and I
am going to comb it through the hair, working

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.841
right from the roots down to the tips.

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:39.850
Your kind of, your kind of going for a wet
look here anyway so, you know, the more gel

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.850
the better.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.069
So, work the gel all the way through the hair
kind of combing towards the back of the head

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.380
so you get that nice slicked back look, and
then keep going until you have got all the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.450
hair in place and it is staying.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
[Music]

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.740
So, once your happy with your look and your
confident that everything has been slicked

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.930
back, you're going to want to finish it off
with a bit of hairspray.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.910
So, as I said this is quite a high shine look
so, you know, feel free to add a bit more

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.780
if you want that really glossy look.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.640
So, there you have it, two great Emma Watson
looks.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.780
It should take you from the weekday to the
weekend.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.240
So, thanks for watching guys.
