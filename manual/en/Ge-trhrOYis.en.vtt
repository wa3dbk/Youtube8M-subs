00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.029
In this tutorial we're going to learn how
to import PowerPoint slides into Articulate

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.490
Storyline. Right now we're looking at our
original PowerPoint slide. So we'll do a quick

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.889
review of what we have here and then we'll
compare it to Storyline when we import it.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.320
So when we look at this slide deck, we notice
we have four slides. And the first slide is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.619
actually set up kind of like a menu. Notice
I have an Our Team, Services and Technology

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.189
section. And then we actually have an Our
Team, Services and Technology slides. And

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.600
on these shapes here, if I hit Control K,
I actually have hyperlinks to those respective

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.570
slides. So this is kind of like a hyperlinked
menu that goes to these three different slides.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.320
If you look down here at the notes section,
you'll notice that I have some notes. So we

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.399
want to see what happens when I import those
from PowerPoint. And then let's look at the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.710
Slide Master. First I go to View, Slide Master
and we come into Slide Master you can see

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.879
that I've got a custom slide Master with three
distinct layouts. Let's see what happens when

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.000
I import that into Storyline. We're going
to open up a Storyline project. We just have

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.700
a blank project. What we want to do is insert
a slide, so let's go to Insert and select

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.420
New Slide. And you'll see that I have a few
options. I can do templates layouts, quiz

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.860
questions, screen recordings. We're going
to do import and select the PowerPoint logo.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.549
And the just go ahead and locate the Venturetech PowerPoint file in your assets folder. So

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.060
were' going to select that. Hit open. And
what you should see are the four PowerPoint

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.290
slides that you can insert into Storyline.
You have a choice. You can select them all.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.850
You can select none. And you can select individual
slides. We’re going to go ahead and select

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.320
all. And as you look down here you can see
you can insert a new scene, or title the scene.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.490
We're just going to keep the default. So let's
import. And the first thing you'll notice

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.380
with the imported slides is that Story View
actually drew out the flow and structure of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.039
the PowerPoint slides. If you remember, slide
number one actually had three hyperlinks that

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.289
went to the respective slides. So it was a
simple branching interaction. And we can see

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.350
that Story View actually shows the way that
branches. Let’s go ahead and double-click

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.110
on the first slide. SO if we look at the timeline
you'll notice that all these objects that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.960
you had on your slide are objects on the timeline.
Now that means you can edit your text boxes.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.590
You have pictures. You have shapes. All those
things are editable. In fact, this is no longer

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.840
a PowerPoint slide, it’s a Storyline slide
that happens to have all these objects on

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.950
it. So they're editable like any of the other
objects that you have in Storyline. And if

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.340
we look at the Notes panel, you’ll notice
that the notes from PowerPoint are now the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.360
notes in Storyline. Let’s go ahead and look
at the Slide Masters. So if you go to View,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.450
Slide Master you should have two Slide Masters.
You should have the original Slide Master

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.510
that came as the default when you opened up
the project. And then now you have your imported

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.310
Side Master. And you can see you still have
those custom layouts. Now let's look at what

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.590
happened to those hyperlinks. Remember on
the first slide we had hyperlinks that went

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.730
to these three different slides. So those
shapes here, like the Our Team shape, had

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.370
a hyperlink to the Our Team slide. Instead
of hyperlinks now you have triggers. So that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.300
a rectangle that has a trigger that goes to
slide 2.2. This rectangle has a trigger that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.710
goes to slide 2.3. So you can see that they
hyperlinks were converted to triggers. Now

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.710
when you import PowerPoint slides into Storyline,
you may have to do a little bit of tweaking.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.440
Here's a good example of that. If I click
on the blue slide you'll notice I have three

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
triggers. So I have my player trigger, so
I have my next button and my previous button.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.890
And those come from the Storyline player by
default. But you'll also notice I have this

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.180
slide trigger and that slide trigger is Jump
to next slide when the timeline ends. And

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.410
that came from PowerPoint. The reason PowerPoint
created that trigger is because it is linear.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.920
And it expects that I'm going to auto-advance
from one slide to the next. So when I bring

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.260
it into Storyline, it’s going to bring in
that trigger as well. So I need to get rid

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.240
of that trigger because I don't want it to
auto-advance. I only want it to advance when

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.720
the user clicks the Next button. So to get
rid of those triggers, we're going to Story

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.220
View. I can just select all my slides. I'm
going to hit the Control key to select those.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.910
I'm going to come over to Slide Properties
and where it says Slide Advances, instead

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.210
of automatically, we’re going to choose
By User. So what happens is these slides will

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.440
only advance if the user clicks the previous/next
button. Or in this case, clicks one of these

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.530
triggered objects. So if we look at the blue
slide, now we only have two triggers. We have

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.530
the next button and the previous button. And
we got rid of the trigger that came from PowerPoint.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.870
One other consideration when you import PowerPoint
slides is kind of the interactive feel of

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.680
the course. For example, when we click on
this first slide, these right here are buttons.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.980
So if we preview this scene. When we look
at the slide we see we have buttons so when

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.340
I click on this it goes to its respective
slides. But there's really no interactive

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.490
feedback. So one of the advantages that Storyline
has over PowerPoint is the interactive capabilities

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.760
in the features. So what we can do is make
these buttons a little bit more interactive.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.460
So I'll show you an easy way to do that. In
a future tutorial, we'll actually go into

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.460
interactivity more in depth. Let’s close
the preview. So if I select my Our Team button.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.020
I'm going to go to States. Any object that
you put on a slide in Storyline can have multiple

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.090
states. In this case, we just have a normal
state. And we want to add a simple hover effect.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.370
So when I'm rolling the mouse over that button
it moves. So were' going to go ahead and choose

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.500
Edit States. We're going to create a new state.
Now hover is one of those pre-built states

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.800
in Storyline. So if I just click the drop-down
you can see I've got a number of pre-built

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.310
states. We're just going to choose Hover.
And hit Add. And now I can edit this so it

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.660
looks a little different. So I'm going to
make sure I double click on that. So I'm in

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.370
my active state and I'm just going to change
the color. Right now it’s this blue were'

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.760
just going to make it a little bit darker.
And you can see now we've got our Normal state

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.180
and we've got our Hover state. I'm going to
close this. Preview this slide now. And as

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.200
you can see, now you've have a simple interactive
feedback. We'll cover interactivity in more

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.930
detail in an upcoming tutorial. But for right
now this is a simple way to convert the PowerPoint

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.200
buttons and make them a little bit more interactive.
And now to summarize the tutorial. What we

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:49.950
did is we took a PowerPoint file. We imported
it and we saw that the notes from PowerPoint

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.400
came into the notes panel in Storyline. We
saw that hyperlinks were converted to triggers.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.169
We saw that the Slide Masters in PowerPoint
became Slide Masters in Storyline. And we

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:07.090
saw that all the objects on the screen were
objects on your timeline that are editable.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.200
And we'll cover interactivity in more detail
in a future tutorial. In this case, we learned

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.110
how to convert simple buttons into a hover
button to add a little bit more interactive

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.020
feedback. Go ahead and practice importing
PowerPoint and working with your slides. And

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.870
then in the next tutorial we'll actually look
at how to build interactive e-learning in

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.340
Storyline.
