00:00:00.043 --> 00:00:01.593
- You got this, you
got this, you got this!

00:00:01.593 --> 00:00:02.787
- OK we're going up, we're
going up, we're going up.

00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:04.128
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!

00:00:09.112 --> 00:00:13.109
- It's like if Apple created a glue gun.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.957
- Kind of, but it's kind of clunky.

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:15.467
- You're right.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:16.145
- I don't wanna complain.

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:18.339
- It's like if Samsung created it.

00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:21.606
- Is this for children? It
seems a little dangerous.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.586
- So, what are we gonna draw?

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:24.847
We're gonna do glasses?

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:26.110
- Let's try glasses to start.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.442
- OK, so we just hit the
button and then it'll go?

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:30.986
- What is the-- there's different lines.

00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:31.903
What does that mean?

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:34.477
Alright, let's just do this.

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:37.822
- It's really loud and
nothing's happening yet.

00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:39.601
Anything happening?
- [Male in Gray] Not yet.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.469
Oh there you go, you just
gotta give it a little nudge.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.245
- I don't like the way this smells.

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:46.461
It smells pretty harmful for
children and elderly people.

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.702
- How do I make it turn?

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:50.363
- I think with your hand.

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:52.603
- I'm still not getting anything.

00:00:52.603 --> 00:00:54.227
- There we go. I'm getting
it. I'm getting it.

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.979
- [Man in Black] What? Oh
there we go, there we go.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.785
I think we should note
that both of us have

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.750
made our living as illustrators.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.841
Full-time illustrators.
- Yeah.

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.326
- And so far, this is
what I've come up with.

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.461
- And this is what I have.

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:10.666
- This seems like something
kids would do in camp

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.825
and the counselor would go
talk to their girlfriend

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:14.897
or boyfriend at this time.

00:01:14.897 --> 00:01:16.983
- I'm going to try the
higher speed setting.

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:17.958
- Oh, I've been doing the
high speed the whole time.

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.897
- Really? I've been doing the slower.

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.546
- I'm John McClane-ing this shit.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.763
- That changes everything.

00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:26.026
- I have the instinct to like,
"Oh, I need to draw on paper"

00:01:26.026 --> 00:01:29.649
but like I don't have to.
- [Woman in Gray] Yeah, no.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.966
- I could draw up here.
I'm drawing right now.

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.522
- Oh!

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:38.878
- Oh wait, yours is way better than mine!

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:44.926
- Gosh those are like unbreakable
glasses, glasses of steel.

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:47.886
They even have an already
nerdy bandaid patch.

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:49.662
- I know!

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:51.845
- Here are my glasses.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.157
- Okay.
- These are for you.

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:54.644
- There you go, they're very fragile.

00:01:54.644 --> 00:01:56.548
- So these are Quinta's glasses.

00:01:56.548 --> 00:01:58.452
They are hearts, obviously.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.356
- Here you go.
- OK, I put this--

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:02.841
- Oh, yours is so cool!

00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.502
- I put a fake nose on
it, like for disguises.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:06.403
- Right?

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:08.864
- So, I don't think it's a
question of if we look cool.

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:10.663
I think it's more like
how cool do we look?

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.059
- Yeah.
- [Man in Black] Pretty cool.

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.178
- Although I gotta tell you, design-wise,

00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:15.039
yours aren't really staying on my face.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.059
- See, I was afraid of that.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.065
- Oh no! Oh no!

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:19.177
- Yay!
- So gorgeous.

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:20.642
- Yay, you look gorgeous!

00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:21.605
- Thank you.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:26.605
- They're built for water sports,
dreaming, falling in love,

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:32.742
seeing, and also just being awesome.

00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:35.694
- I definitely see myself falling in love

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:37.064
while wearing these glasses.

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:41.466
- Now I'm going to draw a penis.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.241
- Cause you know that's the
first thing they drew with it.

00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:44.076
- Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:47.312
- They were like "Oh we're gonna
draw some dicks with this."

00:02:50.474 --> 00:02:52.594
- I'm kinda loving this thing.
