00:00:00.932 --> 00:00:02.791
- [Matt] GCN does science.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:07.336
- [Simon] #data.

00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:12.397
- A while ago, we tested the effects of a
bike weight on climbing speeds, but in a

00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:15.699
laboratory setting. And while this is
undeniably the most accurate way

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.973
to test it, there's a big part of us
that still wants to see what the

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:20.783
effect is out on the open road.

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.769
- And what better place to do than here
on the Colle del Sestriere? The scene

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.901
of many battles in the Tour de France
and the 2015 Giro d'Italia.

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.522
- Yeah. So what we're going to do,
Matt and I are going to do two runs

00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:34.995
of this climb, each. Now, it's about eight
kilometers long, an average gradient

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:39.882
of about 7%. I am going to use my Garmin
bike to power me to ride at consistent

00:00:39.882 --> 00:00:43.433
power both runs, and then I'm going to do
the second run with two kilograms

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:47.280
of ballast added to my bike and then
we can compare the times directly.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.893
- I'm going to do exactly the same but my
power meter is going to be in here,

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:55.571
old school, all on feel because I think
that perception is still really valuable

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:57.043
and very, very important.

00:00:57.043 --> 00:00:58.740
- Yeah, you calibrated this morning?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.875
- It took me a bit of time
because obviously we're at altitude,

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.994
but it's pretty much spot
on and I'm ready to go.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.233
- Let's do some pedaling.

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:12.376
- My bike weighs in at 6.920 kilograms
without weight, and then with a full water

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:19.792
bottle, 7.595. Then finally, with ballast
added, it comes in at 9.505.

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:23.967
So that's a differential of around two
kilograms taken into account the full

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:30.614
water bottle on both runs. So round one,
the ballast bike, let's give it a nudge.

- Just trying to keep a nice rhythm, keep
my breathing controlled which is actually

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.850
harder than you think at altitude. But I
think I found a good level which I can

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.633
sustain for the half an hour
effort, there abouts.

Well, round one done.
That was pretty tough.

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.380
- This is quite a hard climb, isn't it?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.211
Especially with the altitude,
but well, let's do it again.

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.695
- Indeed. Well, we've been doing
the comparisons until round two,

00:02:43.695 --> 00:02:45.574
but I think might need a quick lay down.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.531
- My bike weighs in at 7.3 kilos
and that's with a Garmin Virb

00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:54.348
on the handlebars, obviously.
With a bottle, it takes it up to 7.875,

00:02:54.348 --> 00:02:59.753
then with the ballast, it weighs
in at a pretty hefty 9.8 kilograms.

You can feel the weight of the bike.

I'm trying to keep the same effort,
perceived effort, so it's difficult

00:03:57.706 --> 00:04:02.878
and breathing's controlled, but the bike
does feel just that little bit lighter

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:06.706
and more spritely on the steep sections.

00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:11.877
And I think I'm going a little bit
quicker, only time will tell.

00:04:15.378 --> 00:04:17.290
Sorry, I can't speak.

00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.730
- All right.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.410
Now the results are in,
but before we give you them,

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.470
we must stress this is not a controlled
test. So this is purely for discussion

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.690
only. We can't account for things
like wind or anything like that,

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.040
but it is nevertheless very interesting.
On my bike, so I was riding to an average

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.770
power of 320 watts on both runs. I was 35
seconds slower with the heavier bike.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.180
So it doesn't actually sound like all that
much. It's only about 2% of my overall

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.450
time. But Matt on the other hand,
Matt was really interesting.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.120
- It was. Well, I went on the light bike.
I went one minute and three quarters

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.253
quicker. Now that was for exactly the same
perceived effort so in relation to that,

00:04:56.253 --> 00:05:00.660
it was the pain in my legs and also
my breathing, and that remained the same

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.050
for the whole of the each ride. And where
I noticed the difference was when the road

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.590
pitched up above 7%, 8% gradient and the
bike felt far more responsive and I could

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.560
use a bigger gear on the steeper parts.
I think that's where I made up the time.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.594
- Well, and even more interesting was that
it was your second run when you were

00:05:14.594 --> 00:05:17.144
on the lighter bike so one would have
thought that you had a bit of fatigue

00:05:17.144 --> 00:05:22.230
in your legs there. So, conclusions then.
Well, perhaps if we're after pure

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.337
performance, clearly we can see that a
lighter bike is going to be faster on a

00:05:26.337 --> 00:05:30.370
climb but the difference isn't necessarily
as big as you'd think. But when it's

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.100
out of pure enjoyment and perceived
effort, it made a huge difference.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.160
- It certainly did.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.960
- So, maybe there it is. A lighter bike
will make you go faster but it will feel

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.550
even faster than that. So that's our
experience, but we'd be really interested

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.324
to know what you guys think.
Have, for example, you recently

00:05:46.324 --> 00:05:49.327
got yourself a lighter bike
and did you notice a difference?

00:05:54.582 --> 00:05:57.888
What makes the bigger difference,
a lighter bike or a lighter body?

00:05:57.888 --> 00:06:00.739
- We know really though that your legs
make probably the biggest difference

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:02.177
of all, so don't abate your training.

Here we go, round two. Let's just hope
the legs hold up. See you.

00:06:35.376 --> 00:06:38.930
Awesome. Here, that actually just keeps
my hair in place. Can we do a dry run?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.710
- Did you get that?

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.000
- [Cameraman] Yeah.
