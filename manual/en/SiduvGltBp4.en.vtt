00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.458
Hey, what’s up guys

00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:05.079
Today I’ll be reviewing the Disney Planes
Flight Training Bag by Tomica

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:09.348
And as usual, I’ll start off by showing
you the box.

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:12.248
on the top, it says that this toy is almost
one meter long

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:19.229
And on the sides, there’s more cool pictures
to look at

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:22.879
On the bottom, you’ll find some detailed
instructions on how to setup the Flight Training

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.689
Center

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.729
So here I go with you on boxing.

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:31.299
And you can see on these inner flaps the whole
cast from Disney planes

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:35.299
So this is the main unit coming out of the
box

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.069
Followed an accessories package

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:43.049
An Inside this package we’ll find a bunch
of snap-together tracks

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:47.889
Now the main flight bag, which is more of
a container or kit, has this striking orange

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:48.889
colour

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:50.729
with sky blue sides.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.278
On the front, we have the Disney Planes logo,
with a couple of our favourite characters.

00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:58.268
The package is held together by buttons on
both sides

00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:04.389
And on top, there’s two more buttons, and
a handle for easy carrying

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:07.228
And finally, on the bottom, there are these
four white feet.

00:01:07.228 --> 00:01:12.559
So to unfold the flight training bag, you
unsnap the buttons, and two long flaps fall

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:15.548
down on each side

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:17.728
Inside you should find another bag of accessories

00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:21.369
So here are the parts that make up the twisting
track

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.539
We’ll assemble it in a minute

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.639
Also, there are some stickers that we’ll
use to decorate the flight school

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.349
I’ve already gotten started.

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.909
Here’s a big rocket sticker that goes on
the side

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:42.739
And now I’ll put on a bunch of smaller stickers
that go on the inside

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.768
You only get one chance to put these stickers
on right, so be very careful!

00:01:46.768 --> 00:01:51.139
And Finally, Dottie and Chug are extra stickers
that you can place where ever you want

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:55.328
When you’re finished, the Flight Training
Kit should look just like this

00:01:55.328 --> 00:01:57.559
So now I’ll setup the twisting slide

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.328
The snap-together track winds around the box
and goes thru a hole in the centre

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:07.399
There’s also two support beams, and some
other accessories that you’ll need to install

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.279
After you’ve set it up, it should look just
like this

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.479
As you can see, it’s a decent sized unit,
stretching about one meter or one yard in

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.459
length

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.729
In the back of the box, you can store your
Tomica Disney Planes for safekeeping

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:27.709
The kit will hold all nine models of Planes,
plus a few cars

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.679
So here’s Ripslinger on his maiden flight

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.709
And you can see him absolutely rocket down
the slide!

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.299
And that’s Bulldog...

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.389
Followed by El Chupacabra...

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.459
Dusty...

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.459
Racing Type Dusty...

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.329
Skipper, who ends up going backwards!

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.829
And Echo, jumping off a bit early

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.429
Then it’s Ishani, but she tumbles off of
that first turn

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.569
So we’ll try again... nope

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.049
And one more try.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.549
Well, it looks like she just can’t do it

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.579
Now here’s Rochelle, also known as Sakura
in Japan

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.779
And as you can see she falls off, too

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:10.219
We’ll try it again though… and the same
result

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.559
So the slide actually comes with guard rails,
although they’re only for the second turn

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.559
on the track

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.299
And even if you wanted to use them, they’re
only designed for cars

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.039
But when things are going well, you’re planes
will really fly down this track

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:31.659
It really is a high speed slide, so you never
know what’s going to happen

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.219
Good landings, bad landings — you’ll see
it all!

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.939
So let’s check things out in slow motion

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.599
And that’s Ripslinger taking a head dive

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.109
And that’s Dusty doing alright

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.359
And Skipper, who always seems to do a 180
further up on the track

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.309
And that’s racing type Dusty, who’s a
bit lighter and likes to spin around

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:59.379
And Bulldog, who always manages to stick the
landing

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.449
El Chupacabra also does a good job

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:06.159
And Echo, like to pick up a lot of speed

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.209
And now, two Dustys!

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.039
You can see the ramp snapping off, but they
land just fine

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.299
And now two Chupacabras.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.759
And you can see the last guy jump out the
back

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.299
And finally two Echos, showing how to do it
correctly

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.279
So what about Ishani?

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.199
Well, it appears that the first turn is just
too sharp for her to manage

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:40.049
But Sakura, better known as Rochelle, can
sometimes navigate it without issue

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:44.129
So a cool feature about the flight training
bag is that its track can be setup going the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:50.109
opposite direction

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:52.879
So now we have exit ramp going to the rear
landing pad

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:58.609
Although, it’s not guarantee that all your
Planes will arrive there...

00:04:58.609 --> 00:05:02.579
So fully laid out, the Flight Training Kit
is spacious and looks great

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:06.569
Especially if you have a bunch of Planes to
play with

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.609
All the die-cast models look great on the
runway and

00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:14.349
There’s even these raised holders for showcasing
your favourite Planes

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.529
And as I showed your earlier, in the back,
you can store a full set of Disney Tomica

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.939
Planes for safekeeping

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:27.289
And of course there’s this twisty track
that I found pretty wild and fun to play with

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.928
So that concludes my review of the Tomica
Flight Training Bag for Disney Planes

00:05:31.928 --> 00:05:33.988
Thanks for watching guys, and I’ll see you
next time!
