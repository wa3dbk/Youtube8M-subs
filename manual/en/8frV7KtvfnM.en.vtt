00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:02.158
- Well, hello everyone,
my name is Tyler Oakley,

00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:04.434
and I am ready to do another Q&amp;A.

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:08.242
So, I asked you guys on Twitter,
use the hashtag Ask Tyler,

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:11.237
and I will answer as many
questions as I can in a new video.

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:13.315
And y'all made a trend,
number one trending

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:16.403
topic in the world, so apparently
y'all have some questions.

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:19.306
So, let's get down to business.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:21.744
"Describe your trip to
Las Vegas in one word."

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:23.044
So, I recently went to Las Vegas

00:00:23.044 --> 00:00:24.994
for a birthday for a weekend.

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.382
And if I were to describe
it in one word...

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.050
Sleazy.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.862
"Are you gay?"

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.279
I get asked this question a lot.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:39.135
And I know it's really
hard for you to decipher

00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:43.007
whether or not I partake
in homosexual activity.

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:47.157
I enjoy a man on me.

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.666
(laughs)

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.702
Abby would like to know when
I am coming back to the UK.

00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:53.235
Very soon, stay tuned.

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.044
"If you could relive or
re-experience any memory,

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:57.321
"which one would it be?"

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.084
My birth, 'cause like I
know I was there for it,

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:01.640
but like I don't remember it.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.124
I kind of have like womb withdrawals.

00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:07.757
I wouldn't want to see
necessarily, maybe...

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:10.429
I just realized what I
would have to be looking at

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.354
in order to see my birth.

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:17.185
"Describe your style in three words."

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:21.293
Well, I would have to go
with elegant, (laughs)

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:26.055
glamorous, and delicious.

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:28.029
"What is the first thing
that pops into your head

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:29.700
"when you think of pickles?"

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.022
If you know me, you know
that I love Disneyland.

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:34.832
And if you know anything
about my love for Disneyland,

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:37.084
y'all know that I get a pickle

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:39.081
every single time that I go to Disneyland.

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.379
And not only do I get
a pickle at Disneyland,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:45.814
but when I do get a pickle,
I sing a very special song,

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.958
and I Vine it.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.676
So, if you know what I'm talking about,

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:51.695
that sets apart the
standard, normal viewer

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.576
and my besties, okay?

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.688
So if you know the lyrics
of the song, put 'em below.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:57.825
"What is your favorite place to visit?"

00:01:57.825 --> 00:01:59.891
Well, I would have to
go with The Food Court,

00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:04.278
'cause I love food, cheap
food, and food samples.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:07.066
I mean, if you didn't know who I was,

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.505
and you just saw this video,

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:10.920
you would think that I'm
some sort of a binge eating

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.776
creature, and the rumors
are true. (laughs)

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:16.609
"What is your ultimate
favorite tweet by a celebrity?"

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.907
Now, I have a few options for this.

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:21.624
Clearly a lot of Cher
tweets, not only to me,

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.203
because she has tweeted me in the past.

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:24.526
But also all of her tweets are

00:02:24.526 --> 00:02:27.313
perfectly gold platinum amazing.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:31.005
And of course, there's a
year ago, on this very day,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:32.833
Lindsey Lohan came to one of my live shows

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.319
and was tweeting along.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.270
And she even sassed me and asked me

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.079
have I learned nothing from her past

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.029
when I was chugging a bottle of wine.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.955
Clearly, iconic, but I think
my number one celebrity tweet

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.254
of all time has to be when Rihanna

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:48.622
got in a fight with Satan.

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:51.873
Because clearly, this was iconic.

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:54.334
What is the best piece of
advice that I've ever received?

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.749
Now, I'm gonna cheat for this,
because this piece of advice

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.326
I wasn't given directly,
but I saw it on my Tumblr

00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:02.066
dashboard, which means it
was fate that brought it

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.455
to my eyes, so I think it was given to me.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:07.566
But it is, "Nobody has
ever gone poor by giving."

00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.122
And I think it's something
that really applies

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.467
to everybody's lives and how
they should live their lives,

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:14.462
whether it's physically or
spiritually or emotionally.

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:17.457
Just be more giving, and do what you do

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:19.895
with the mindset of, "Does
this help other people?"

00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:21.521
I'm a big believer in karma.

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.332
So, that is the way I try to live my life.

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:25.839
I know I'm not the best at it, at times.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.279
But at least I'm trying.

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.158
If you could tell your 16 year
old self any piece of advice,

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.156
what would it be?

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:32.851
I would tell my 16 year old self,

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:34.477
"You think it's a big
deal how you audition

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:35.452
"for the school play.

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.936
"You think it's a big deal
how you dance at homecoming.

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.839
"You think it's a big deal how
you speak in front of people.

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:42.882
"None of these things matter, okay?

00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:45.831
"All of these things in the
big, grand scheme of things

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:48.153
"in life, none of these
things really matter.

00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:51.157
"And not only do they not
matter, but nobody really cares.

00:03:51.157 --> 00:03:53.571
"Like, Tyler, you are so
in your head about how

00:03:53.571 --> 00:03:55.917
"other people perceive you,
but in the grand scheme

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.163
"of things, care less about
what other people think,

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.462
"because at the end of the
day, everyone is so worried

00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:02.668
"about themselves and how
they're coming across,

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.734
"that nobody is actually judging as much

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:06.615
"as y'all think they are."

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:08.542
Amy would like to know if I prefer to do

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.283
drunk videos or sober videos.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.886
Drunk videos are great,
because I think they

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.163
always turn out hilarious.

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:15.415
But sober videos are great,
because the next morning,

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:16.529
I am functional.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.871
If you could date any Janoskian,
which would it be and why?

00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:22.590
I'mma have to go with Luke,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.679
because when we made our video together,

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:28.000
we, I mean, I'm just
gonna throw it out there,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.462
sparks were flying.

00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:30.948
"Do you have a phobia?"

00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:32.272
Yes, I have a phobia.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.360
I am terrified of insects.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.589
If it's like a spider, I can't go near it.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:39.330
If I knew that there was
a spider in my kitchen,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.490
I would literally have
to invite my friend over

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.556
to come and kill it,
because I'm terrified.

00:04:43.556 --> 00:04:46.435
Because I know, I know
that if I kill a spider,

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.804
all of it's friends, they walk among me.

00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:50.127
They know what I'm up to.

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:51.497
They know where I sleep,

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:53.610
and they know what they can do to me.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.212
"What book should I get for free on

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.954
"audible.com/tyleroakley?"

00:04:56.954 --> 00:04:58.695
That is a good question.

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:00.715
If you guys know me, you
know that I recommend

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:03.664
a new book every single
month on audible.com.

00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:06.311
They have millions to
pick from, but if you use

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.656
audible.com/tyleroakley, you
can get your first one free.

00:05:08.656 --> 00:05:10.746
This month, I am
recommending "Attack of the

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:11.605
"Theater People".

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:13.764
I have always been a theater person.

00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:15.970
Back in high school, I
was in every single play,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.131
every single musical.

00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:18.408
I was drama club president.

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:20.103
And so, I first read this
book back in college,

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:21.519
and I absolutely loved it.

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.864
And so I checked audible.com,
they have it on there.

00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:25.142
So again, you can get it for free with

00:05:25.142 --> 00:05:27.533
audible.com/tyleroakley, you
get your first book free.

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:29.997
But I highly recommend this
one, if you haven't read it.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:30.786
It is amazing.

00:05:30.786 --> 00:05:32.598
And if you have a book
recommendation for next month,

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.107
recommend me a book in the comments below,

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:35.802
because I really need
something good to listen to,

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.079
so, yeah!

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:38.182
Maple would like to know,

00:05:38.182 --> 00:05:40.643
"How did you come across @klainky?"

00:05:40.643 --> 00:05:43.894
She was first just a
regular view like you guys.

00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:45.821
And then I started to
notice that she was always

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:47.423
tweeting me and tumbling with me.

00:05:47.423 --> 00:05:49.350
And all of her tweets were
so funny, and so then,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.370
I always ended up going
to her Twitter page,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.576
just to see what she thought
about pop culture stuff.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:55.968
And then I just realized
that if I love this person

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.593
that much, I should just follow her.

00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:00.032
And that is how I started
to follow her on twitter.

00:06:00.032 --> 00:06:01.448
I mean, honestly, over the past few years,

00:06:01.448 --> 00:06:02.493
this is a very common thing.

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:05.581
I have found so many of you
guys that I absolutely adore,

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:08.530
who have turned from just
regular, casual viewers

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.248
into my good internet friends.

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:12.941
This happens especially a lot on Tumblr.

00:06:12.941 --> 00:06:16.030
All of you guys make
amazing gifs and fan edits

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.978
and fan fictions, and you
fill up the Tyler Oakley

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.534
tag with a whole bunch of love,

00:06:20.534 --> 00:06:21.858
and I love you for that.

00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:24.481
And I love to find you guys
and become friends with you

00:06:24.481 --> 00:06:26.664
and just be internet besties.

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:30.356
So, if you want to be my
bestie, just keep being you

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:32.120
and interacting with me
on Twitter and Tumblr

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.814
and Facebook and Instagram
and everywhere in between.

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:37.995
And who knows, you might
be my new internet bestie.

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:40.038
This person insists that
I don't ignore them.

00:06:40.038 --> 00:06:42.151
They want to know, do I pee in the shower?

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.332
And the answer is, it
depends on who is joining me

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:47.375
in the shower, and what they're into.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:48.652
But I think that is all
I have for you guys today

00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:50.347
for our special little Q&amp;A video.

00:06:50.347 --> 00:06:52.692
If you liked this Q&amp;A, be
sure to give it a thumbs up.

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:54.689
I think this is like my
second or my third Q&amp;A

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:55.804
video that I've ever done.

00:06:55.804 --> 00:06:58.451
I never do these, so if you
want me to do them more,

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.333
let me know.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.331
If this gets a lot of thumbs up,

00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:01.725
maybe I'll do these more often.

00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:03.484
And I am just going to warn you,

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:05.620
I have a very special
Halloween video coming up

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.476
in a few days, so prepare
your bodies for that.

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:10.681
It is the most epic thing
that I have ever edited.

00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:11.842
I am working on it right now.

00:07:11.842 --> 00:07:13.514
I've been editing it for
the past couple of days.
