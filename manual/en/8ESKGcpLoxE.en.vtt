there's a lot of here here we'll spanked

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.760
this is a home for the month joined the
race this is where we live the place we

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.660
work

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.900
and where we've got all our stuff

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.930
okay you can find everything by x
technical bits and pieces we use the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.170
compressor pressure poses the water tank
the generator we completely

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.020
self-contained ultimate there

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.790
since death frames that we use it as a
crash

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.670
spare tires various types of cassettes
for different types of stages depending

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.860
on the route and the needs of the race
this is the time trial area we normally

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.199
have time trial bikes here this tour is
really important we use it to measure

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.340
bikes so that they are the right size
for all the different riders here it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.340
seems we use in the times as solvent
mastic brushes wire brushes or does it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.860
in our hands as soon as we finish

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.230
as some headsets everything we need for
the ride is this is the oil grease uh...

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.370
the hardware sector

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.490
can we see what's inside the joys

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.670
okay

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.470
this is the anti-gay drawer and with a
little bit of everything in it the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.430
hardware draw its own tools and
hispanics are in equipment

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.610
simply does includes the time tunnel
sofa road stages

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.980
uh... brake pads bearings in various
sizes wheel covers greece for the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.470
barings taped ties and so on

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.200
and this one is the most important role
will you find everything you need all of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.060
these social price if you're looking for
something that you're short of time to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.229
end the messy drawer

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.100
let's talk about something that's with
scenic team wheels organized according

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.219
to the contents of a raise insignias on
both

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.110
which kinda we'll see the commonplace
yes choose for these you know for a flat

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.949
cgs reminds us one and ford and sales
tool

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.619
he's using the money we use the
deterrence ccc of the nineties perfect

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.750
for declines really midget

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.649
and he's very happy with them

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.679
the one that gives the best results

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.699
and then we have the one uh... which she
likes and even more the op ed a

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.969
particular kind of wheels that uh... we
only use in case of a flat stage and

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.049
perhaps in some time trials and the
route is really cut the and technical

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.890
during that time so i recently wrote is
not quality which kind of we see his

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.760
that we use them into cuba we have the
classic one for the time child the most

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.599
used

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.219
and the one that gives us uh... the
greatest satisfaction

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.219
and what are today which kind of weeds
are they gonna use for the last flat

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.099
stage

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.669
which a day women's opted for mc cdma
profile i really like wheel in order to

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.090
test the bike

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.280
headed for the two most important stages
for him was seen three committed we

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.110
cover

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.979
the situation

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.629
and did you ever go through some water
cooperman political filled

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.569
and the other riders incentive tours and
deep profile we'll the area would be in

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:18.980
cc

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.950
habit they cannot maintain until you
have that province

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.669
where anything is not an illness

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.019
headline via kami no of these

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.019
kalia me are really shocking exhuming it
point right now

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:11.179
president after that came with some
point and then write is in its heart

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:15.519
for sure they're writers who is the
great technically importance is destined

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.440
to a longer the connecticut the
differences in the tour

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.210
a powerful for the important
relationships he's built up with some of

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.680
the great chan

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.340
he's highly regarded indiantimes sunken
boat

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.039
these professionals

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.979
then we cast off to an important point
of reference national team

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.439
that policy battalion champion in the
ends twenty three category

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.250
all religious will be looking out

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.689

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.099
a great team with strong italian life is
too

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.169
we really have

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.889
that's because the sunken world is
getting more a more global

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.990
so it's fair that i like his game
experience it without the right is at

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.939
the same very high-level as the ones
we're talking about

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:01.419
biology the jungle

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.429
danielle on that but it was a lot

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:04.889
dissimilar than i did

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.110
today's real estate but we have to write
all the same

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.819
widsets untie the street in the finale

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.270
uh... i hope at least today that i just
want write too fast

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.270
and that they would use their brains

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.759
veronica bridal
