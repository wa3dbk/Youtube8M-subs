00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.360
Hi.

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.540
This is Carrie from Carrie and Toys.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.380
Today, we will be playing withthe toy set, Run, Larva.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.380
Let’s start.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.480
Firstly, the front box cover reads that this is for children 3 years old and above.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.200
You need 5 AA batteries.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.060
You can automatically stack the domino blocks.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.600
Let’s look at the back.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.360
To start, you can fly the domino blocks.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.120
If you move Larva, you can hear the Larva song and farting and burping sounds.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.540
Lastly, you can set the direction with a remote control.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.380
Now, let’s open up the box.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.140
In the box, there are stickers,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.680
3 domino blocks,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.220
domino starters,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.660
domino chips in blue, yellow, green, and red,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.780
domino chips case,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.980
a remote control that can move Larva,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420
and lastly,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.700
the automatic Domino Larva.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.680
Dominos equipped.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.320
(Where is the tongue? The tongue?)

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.840
Carrie will personally put on the dominos.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.980
Dominos fully equipped.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.360
Now, let’s use a remote control to stack the dominos.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.240
Go, go to the starting point.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.980
Three, two, one.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.520
Larva, go.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.900
Run, run, run. Right,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.240
Right, right, right.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.840
Around, around, around.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.700
Left, left.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.280
Good job.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.900
Right, right, right.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.000
Yay.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.440
Stop.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.000
Good job.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.380
Ta-da.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.600
Today, we’ve played with the toy set, Run, Larva.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.200
How was it? Did you have fun?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.560
Carrie will be back with more fun toys next week.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.480
Bye-bye.
