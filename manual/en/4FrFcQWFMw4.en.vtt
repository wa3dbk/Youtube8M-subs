00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:03.345
- Hey guys, this is
Jason with Revant Optics.

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.921
Today I'm gonna show you
some of these flak jacket,

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:10.497
they're the Oakley Flak
Jacket XLJ frames and lenses.

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:13.097
We're gonna show you how to
remove and install the lenses.

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:15.373
This particular frame is one of Oakely's

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:17.885
most popular, and for good reason.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:21.061
They're very lightweight,
they provide great coverage,

00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.128
it has a great wrap to the front,

00:00:23.128 --> 00:00:25.937
and then, they're a half frame,
so the bottom of the lens

00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:29.397
is exposed, it provides
a lot of visibility.

00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:31.046
So I use them when I go mountain biking

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:34.134
or hiking, really just any
sort of outdoor activity.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.895
And then they also have a lot of

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.872
this unobtainium rubber grip,

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:40.425
so they're great as far as like staying on

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:43.467
when you're doing more, I
guess, vigorous activities.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.150
They're not gonna fall off your face,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.257
or they shouldn't.

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:47.756
This is how they look when you wear 'em.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.108
Again, a really comfortable, lightweight,

00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:52.686
provides a lot of coverage here down low.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:54.427
So today what we're gonna do is

00:00:54.427 --> 00:00:57.399
show you how to customize
the look and functionality

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.439
of these sunglasses, and
we hope you enjoy it.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:14.351
Today I'm gonna show you
how to remove and install

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:18.432
lenses in your Oakley
Flak Jacket XLJ frames.

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:21.312
What you can do is take your frames here,

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:24.191
place your thumb in the nose bridge.

00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:25.817
And to remove the lens, you're gonna wanna

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:30.089
pull up on the outside and
pop out the inside edge here.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.827
Pop out easily like that,
and just pull out the outside

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.010
and do that to the other side as well.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.517
Place your finger in here, push up,

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:39.901
(glasses pop)

00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.813
pop out the inside nose bridge.

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:46.133
And then to install, you're
just gonna do the reverse.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.175
So you take your lens, and
slide it in the groove here.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.916
There's a little notch
here that matches up

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:53.726
with the notch in the frame,
so you slide it in there

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:57.116
and then line up the rest of the groove.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.996
And you're gonna push up
on the bottom of the lens

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:00.960
and push down here and you'll hear a pop.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.897
(glasses pop)

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:04.857
That means it's popping right
in, so it's nice and secure.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.332
Go ahead and show you
on this side as well.

00:02:07.332 --> 00:02:12.302
Just gonna line up the
outside edge in the groove,

00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:14.646
inside edge as well,
so you have to pull out

00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:17.409
a little bit there to get
it to seat in the groove.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.988
And then push up with your thumb and down

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.124
on the top of the frame.

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:22.327
You'll hear it pop in.

00:02:22.327 --> 00:02:23.188
Then you just pull down

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:25.489
and make sure they're nice and secure.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.579
That's how you remove and install lenses

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.499
in the Oakley Flak Jacket XLJ frame.

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:34.124
You might need lenses if your
current lenses are damaged

00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:35.866
or you're doing specific activities

00:02:35.866 --> 00:02:37.677
and need certain tints or colors,

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.279
you can find many of those tints

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.344
and colors at Revantoptics.com.

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:43.567
Once you've installed your lenses,

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.781
go ahead and post a picture of them

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.102
