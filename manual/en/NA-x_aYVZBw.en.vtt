00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.689
Sun, shade.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:16.150
Hey, if you wanna grow some of your own vegetables,
it's all about the light.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.019
Understanding the light in your garden is
critical if you wanna grow a lot of beautiful

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.019
vegetables.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.720
For instance, if you look on the tag of a
plant or a back of a seed pack, it'll say

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.499
full sun, partial sun, part shade, full shade.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.090
Let's just talk about what that means for
just a moment.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.910
Full sun means six continuous hours of sunlight.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.149
Now you can have afternoon sun, you know,
that range of time from 3, when it's really

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.559
hot, all the way till sunset in the summer.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.489
Or you can have morning sun, which, you know,
is from sunrise up until about 1 o'clock or

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.649
maybe 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.360
That morning sun is easier on vegetables -- particularly,
in really hot parts of the country.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.840
Now there are certain vegetables in high summer
that can really take a lot of hot sun.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.940
Plants like okra, sweet potatoes, green beans,
even peppers.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.790
And I found my tomatoes tend to like a little
break from the hot sun, so that morning sun

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.330
is really good for those.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.450
And then cool weather crops, if you're trying
to brings those into the hot summer -- things

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.550
like cabbage and kale and lettuce and arugula
-- a little protection from that hot afternoon

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.450
sun is really good for them.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.730
For instance, this squash -- this is zucchini
squash, one of my favorites -- loves full

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.730
sun.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.430
It'll thrive in that hot afternoon sun, but
it'll also do equally well in morning sun,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.520
the sun that we get in the east.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.480
Let me give you an example of what I'm talking
about: Over here on this side of the building,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.120
I've got some vegetables growing in containers.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.260
It's a great way to grow vegetables.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.090
But again, light is very important.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.690
I have chard, I have sorrel, and there's more
chard over there -- look at how beautifully

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.070
it's growing.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.270
These plants only get morning sun, from dawn
up until about noon.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.850
So they get six hours of that early morning
sun, and they're doing very well, even in

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.250
the hottest part of summer.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.599
Okay, now let's reverse things: We've talked
about sun, let's talk about shade.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.040
When you talk about partial shade, that is
an area that gets less than six hours, up

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.190
to about three hours of sun a day.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.470
If you're talking about full shade, that's
an area that only gets about three hours of

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.470
sun.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.020
Now if you're trying to grow vegetables in
partial shade, you've got more latitude.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.100
If you're trying to grow vegetables in shade,
where you only get three hours of light, you're

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.180
gonna be restricted to growing things like
Italian parsley, leafy lettuces and things

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.180
like that.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.950
And, of course, if you have containers, you
can move them around -- that's the great thing

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
about them.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.069
If you're planting under a tree, well, you
wanna make sure that you're planting way out

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.380
from the root zone if you can.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.050
And also, grow on trellises -- things that
can reach up and find the sun.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.450
Something to consider: Things like green beans
and cucumbers even.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.410
