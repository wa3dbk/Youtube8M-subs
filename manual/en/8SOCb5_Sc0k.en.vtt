This part of the Fitzmaurice is the upper
reaches. The fresh water region. And this

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.359
river system meanders right through these
gorges and ranges. Now this is the lifeblood

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.199
of this part of the country. Without this
river system, all the animals and all the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.310
wildlife, they just wouldn't be able to survive
in this region. It's this fresh water which

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.049
is permanent fresh water right through the
dry season. And that's what sustains all that

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.459
life. We've traveled about 35, nearly 40 nautical
miles from our basecamp there. Through the

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:32.990
salt water, and now into the fresh water system.
But it truly is a magnificent spot. You've

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:41.270
got all those pandanus plants, and you've
got these paperbarks. And this water is pure,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.270
fresh, crystal-clear water. It's this stuff
that I get excited about.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.039
We're joined on this leg of the trip by Ian,
a local ranger.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.590
JASE: This is a pretty cool little spot here,
Ian, isn't it?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.140
IAN: Oh, is it ever.
JASE: Do you reckon you could say only a handful

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.030
of people have been here mate?
IAN: I don't think there's been too many people

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.569
here at all.
JASE: Yeah?

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.459
IAN: Well as you've seen it's fairly hard
to get up here with all those rock bars and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.609
logs and things.
JASE: So you need a little boat hey?

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.870
IAN: Yeah. Well I haven't been this far up,
I've only been back near the gorge there.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.720
JASE: Yeah, so you haven't even been here?
IAN: No, I've never seen this before. When

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.040
we come around that corner and seen that log
across there, I thought oh no, no further,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.370
but we'll walk up, we'll find out what's around
that next corner.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.480
JASE: That's the one, it's always wanting
to know what's around the next corner.
