Czajnikowy.pl - a good cup of tea!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
Hello and welcome to another episode of our show Czajnikowy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.990
My name's Dreg and I have a question.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.990
I found an expression 'to grow a teapot' on the Internet.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.990
Is it possible to grow it like goats? What is it all about?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.990
Tips

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.990
Tests

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.990
Brewing tea

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.990
Hi guys, I'll try to answer this question.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.990
Growing a teapot has obviously nothing in common with growing animals or plants,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.990
It means only one particular type of tea is brewed in a teapot which is never cleaned.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.990
It doesn't get in touch with chemical detergents or foam, it's just rinsed with warm water.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.990
It's possible to do this only with teapots made of clay.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Of course it isn't the clay that's the most popular and expensive one, its grounds are actually running out,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it's simple red clay, it just mustn't be glazed since if it is, then we can only grow some tea residue.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.990
There's a story connected with it, it's Chinese story.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There was once a huge rich man, great tea lover. He was visited by a beggar 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
who wanted to ask him for tea as he was thirsty. The rich man said he will certainly share it with him

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.990
so he brewed good tea for him and served it to the beggar. The beggar said the tea is tasty but it doesn't have full aroma

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because the man used a new teapot. So the beggar took out his own teapot, gave it to the rich man.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.990
The rich man poured some boiling water into it and immediately smelled the waft of tea aroma.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
He was delighted with that teapot although it didn't look beautiful. It was very valuable for a tea connesouir, though.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.990
He offered he would buy the teapot from the beggar but the beggar didn't agree.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
He said he got the teapot from his father who got it from his grandfather, who in turn got it from his great-grandfather

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.990
the teapot was hundred years old and stil grown. That's why it would be hard to count the price or value

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.990
for some price unit but in gold he assessed it then for like 15 kg of gold.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.990
It's really plenty. He said he couldn't sell it whole as it as a family keepsake.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So it was sold partially, the rich man gave him enough money to the beggar to make him settle down in the area nearby,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.990
the teapot belonged to the rich man and the beggar visited him every day and they drank the tea together.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Thanks to it they enjoyed it together, they became friends and that's the story of growing the teapot.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I hope I encouraged you to grow your own teapot, you just need to find some red clay and you can grow it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.990
This teapot for example, I've been growing it for two years now. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So maybe one day my grandchildren will also enjoy such wonderful tea.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.990
That's all that we wanted to tell you about teapots and growing them,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.990
