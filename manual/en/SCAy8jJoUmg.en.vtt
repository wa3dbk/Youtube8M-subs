00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.509
I am glad you decided to view my video.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.290
You are probably looking for a quality cosmetic
and general dentist in the Cleveland area.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.180
You should know we are very experienced in
creating whiter and brighter smiles with the

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.290
use of teeth whitening and porcelain veneers.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.250
We also offer at home tooth bleaching kits
and laser tooth whitening services.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.829
We will do our best to combine your dental
needs with your budget requirements to make

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.599
the smile of your dreams as affordable as
possible.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.750
You should know that the cost of teeth whitening
is low compared to the cost of porcelain veneers.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.840
However, when there is more staining or there
has been a lot of dental bonding, tooth veneers

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.300
provide more strength and more control over
the final appearance especially in heavily

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.290
filled front teeth.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.470
We promise to give you the most thorough exam
in Cleveland to determine what is best for

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.510
your situation.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.740
We will then explain all your treatment and
payment options before starting any treatment

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.830
on your teeth.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.790
Perhaps your need for a dentist within the
city limits of Cleveland is more urgent.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.970
If you require the services of an emergency
dentist because you cracked a tooth or broke

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.280
a filling, just call me now.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.670
We will do all we can to treat your toothache
and give you relief from your tooth pain.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.479
If you have a tooth abscess, it is quite possible
that you need a root canal or you may need

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.600
the tooth pulled.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.050
Don’t worry, in this modern day of dentistry,
having a root canal or a tooth extracted is

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.210
a painless procedure.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.560
We take our time and provide an adequate level
of local anesthesia with Novocain and even

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.729
provide sedation services as needed.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.950
Patients tell us all the time that we didn’t
hurt them one bit.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.450
If the tooth is only partially destroyed by
a cavity, we can do root canal treatment or

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.409
a simple tooth filling to save the tooth and
provide you relief from the tooth that hurts

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.610
you.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.380
Unfortunately, there are times when too much
of the tooth has been destroyed and the tooth

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.060
requires removal.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.180
We offer emergency tooth extraction appointments
every day so call us now and we will evaluate

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.020
whether the tooth should be pulled or whether
a root canal should be done.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.040
If tooth extraction is needed then quite often
we suggest the replacement of that missing

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040
tooth.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.240
In this modern day of dentistry, there are
several ways to accomplish the replacement

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.010
of a single tooth or multiple teeth.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.420
Quite often, a dental implant will be used
to replace a single tooth.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.110
Many people think that a dental implant is
the actual replacement tooth.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.470
However, a tooth implant is made up of three
parts.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.680
The dental implant itself replaces the root
of the tooth.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.050
A special post which we call an abutment fits
into the dental implant.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.300
Finally, a crown or a cap is usually cemented
to this special post.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.740
Very often, a dental implant surgeon will
place the dental implant.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.890
Then an implant dentist places the special
post and the dental crown.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.110
At this point, you have the replacement tooth
you desire so your mouth has the right amount

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.640
of teeth and looks good again.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.290
So, give us a call if you were wondering where
to get implant teeth in Cleveland.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.269
We can start counseling you on how best to
replace one tooth or multiple teeth.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.080
Very often, we have to weigh the options of
a dental bridge vs a dental implant.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.890
A permanent bridge has the disadvantage of
filing down the teeth on either side of the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.420
missing space.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.940
This process can lead to premature aging of
these teeth so tooth implants can be a better

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.050
option.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.470
However, sometimes these adjacent teeth have
larger fillings and are better off with full

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.489
coverage protective crowns and caps.

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.790
Sometimes the price of teeth implants or the
cost of a permanent tooth bridge does not

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.060
suit the budget of some people.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.480
A removable dental bridge may be the most
affordable way to provide replacement teeth.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.349
Great strides in comfort level have been made
in the world of partial dentures with the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.620
introduction of flexible partial dentures.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.440
Unfortunately, there are times when people
do not have any of their own teeth that are

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440
useable.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.199
At this point, we only have two choices to
replace missing teeth.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.490
The first is to use multiple dental implants
to hold a permanent bridge.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.230
There are even times we can extract the remaining
teeth and place teeth implants and do the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.560
implant bridge in one day.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.050
The other choice for a person who does not
have any of their own teeth is to make a complete

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.360
denture.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.210
The cost for a complete removable denture
is much more affordable than a dental implant

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.210
bridge.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.570
Sometimes, one day complete dentures are possible.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.090
And lastly, if you are looking to have a denture
repaired by a dentist in Cleveland, give us

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.090
a call.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.840
