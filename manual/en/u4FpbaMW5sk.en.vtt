00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.374
The simplest electric circuit is a light bulb and a battery.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.091
The battery creates a force pushing the charged particles in the wire,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.800
causing them to flow in a loop around the circuit.

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:39.190
The number of charged particles that pass by each second

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.965
is what we refer to as the current.

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.604
The charged particles flow through the light bulb because the battery causes them

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:56.813
to have a higher potential energy on one side of the light bulb than the other.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:09.631
This is similar to how objects at higher elevations

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.534
have a higher gravitational potential energy.

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:23.804
This potential energy is what we refer to as voltage.

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.961 line:0%
If we visualize the potential energy as boxes that are attached to

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.277 line:0%
the charged particles, then we will see that

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:44.634 line:0%
this energy is converted into light as the particles pass through the bulb.

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:02.768
The charged particles regain their potential energy

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.579
as they move through the battery, which pushes

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.558
the charged particles to the higher potential.

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:21.268
When the energy inside the battery is depleted,

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:24.117
the battery will no longer be able to create

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.927
this potential energy which we call voltage.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:41.330
A battery that has not yet been depleted ensures that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.436
the voltage between its two terminals is always at a specific value.

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:11.836 line:0%
If we place several batteries with the same voltage together in parallel,

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:15.446 line:0%
then this will result in more energy that is stored,

00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:19.727 line:0%
and this will give us more time before the battery is depleted.

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:48.008
If we instead place these batteries in series,

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.557
this will cause their voltages to add,

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:55.108
resulting in a much higher potential energy for each charged particle.

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.477
A higher voltage across the light bulb means

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:28.488
that a higher current will pass through it.

00:04:54.947 --> 00:04:58.718 line:0%
This will cause far more light to be emitted by the light bulb, but

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:03.434 line:0%
it will also mean that the energy in the batteries will be depleted much faster.

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:32.810
Much more detailed information about

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.183
voltage, current, and electric circuits is
