Brain Boosting Foods : The #1 Worst Food that Harms Your Brain!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First, the BAD NEWS...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Certain foods you eat can indeed harm your brain, both in impaired learning ability as well as impaired memory.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Even worse, the wrong food and drink choices throughout your life can even lead to the terrible and deadly disease of Alzheimers.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Food #1 that HARMS your brain:  Fructose

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Beyond the harm to your brain, it's well known that a high fructose diet can also cause insulin resistance in your body over time.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One thing to note about fructose...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Fruits do contain fructose, but contain MUCH smaller quantities of fructose than you would consume in a sweetened drinks or junk foods.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Also, the phytonutrients, antioxidants, and fiber that's contained in most whole fruits counteracts any negative effects of fructose.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I personally try to keep fruit intake to no more than 1-2 pieces a day due to the sugar and fructose content of larger amounts of fruit.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Other Foods that HARM Your Brain:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You probably already know some of the harmful health effects of these foods, but long term effects on your brain are yet another...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Trans fats -- strongly inflammatory in your entire body including damage to cell membranes throughout your body.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Avoid hydrogenated oils in processed foods and deep fried foods.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Mercury

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mercury from pollution  and from fish that are high on the food chain can possibly cause long term negative effects on your brain.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Limit these types of fish to a couple times a month and focus more on fish such as salmon, trout to reduce your mercury load.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Wheat-based foods

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Wheat contains compounds termed "exorphins" that have an effect in your brain similar to opiate drugs.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This explains why people have such a hard time giving up their beloved pasta and muffins because these foods are mildly addictive.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The good news is...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There are plenty of superfoods, herbs, and spices that can protect your brain and your other organs too!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000
