Welcome to this tutorial devoted to the installation

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.645

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.511

Then we will show how to install the plugin SAT. 

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:23.072
Finally, we will explain how to configure 

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:25.498
your temporary folder for SAT.

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:29.365

SketchUp comes in two versions: 

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.798
a free version and a professional one.

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:04.047
The free version lets you use all the features 

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:07.844

The plugin SAT only works on PC 

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:22.480

When the download is complete, 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.691
you just have to install the received file.

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.028

00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:47.646
If you already had the software, 

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:51.651

For a proper functioning of SAT, 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.552
the SketchUp software must be executed 

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.371

This is a message that appears when installing any plugin.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.699
It warns you that a plugin 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.616
can create files on your hard drive.

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:26.246
In the case of SAT plugin, images, backups or web files

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:29.698
 can be created in a temporary directory.

00:03:29.698 --> 00:03:33.121
These files are totally safe for your computer.

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.851
Click yes and the installation will start.

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:45.227

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:49.883
Click OK.

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.593
To complete the installation, 

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:55.755
you now must close and reopen SketchUp.

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:57.715

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.201
you will see the toolbar of SAT.

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:09.027
This tool bar can be placed anywhere in the scene.

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.948
In the case the toolbar is not visible, 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.316

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:21.261
and make sure SimFonIA Animation Tools is checked.

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.293
Before using the plugin SAT, 

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.607
there is just one last thing to do.

00:04:27.607 --> 00:04:30.607
This is the setup of your temporary workspace.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:34.609
This is the folder where will be created images, web files, 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.277
and backup of your model.

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:39.644
To do this, simply click on the menu plugin, 

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:43.386
then SimFonIA, and edit temporary folder settings.

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:46.521
The next window tells you the current name and 

00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:49.590
location of your temporary space and asks you 

00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.259

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:58.159
For this, click on O.K. and you will be able to 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.406
choose a now location and a now folder name.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:05.223
In this example, we just create 

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:08.684
a new folder named TempData2.

00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:13.345
Click on "Save" and "OK" to confirm.

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:18.784

You are now ready to use 

00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:22.588
all the features of the plugin.

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.343

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.790

00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:34.738
