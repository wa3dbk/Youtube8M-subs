00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:13.070
So, part of what we want to do and what we
do for is we tell you what content you have,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.520
what do we have to take out.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.420
We're gonna look at cropping a few of these
to make them stronger.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.910
We may look at a bit of contrast issues - she's
got pretty good on her contrasts, actually.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.751
And we talk about how to present better so
we really understand the good stuff that she's

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.180
got here.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.629
So, she does have some 3D - this is an interesting
texture, so that's great.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.230
She's got some colored works with some interesting
ideations, and it won't take too much effort

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.670
to explain that a little bit.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.320
She's got a piece she can easily get a better
print of.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.320
That would be too hard to clean up.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.590
This one, we can probably make it look a little
better by how we crop it.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.590
This one as well.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.300
This is a good drawing.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.800
She's got a portrait - great.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.300
A little bit of editorial - kind of more interesting,
illustrative stuff - that's great.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.530
What would be good to include since you want
to go into the better schools and you want

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.850
to get into a program that's illustration,
they'd expect to see some life drawing.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.090
Usually, they ask for it - figure drawings.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.820
I would get yourself to class - you're at
a university, see what you can do because

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.240
there's a lot of life drawing going on.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.549
Maybe talk to the prof, "Can I audit a class
or two?"

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.479
Guelph School of Arts has an open life drawing
on Monday evenings.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.850
You could see what you can do to go to one.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.420
But you need life drawing for illustration.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.420
Okay?

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.299
And it has to be strong life drawingm all
right?

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.900
So, that's what missing, and maybe something
that's just a little more graphic if you could

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.990
pull that off.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.439
Because illustration is not just, "I can draw
really well."

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.390
It also branches into a graphic understanding,
right?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.490
The other thing I'd like to see, and It's
going to help if you can describe this better.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.510
But I'd like to see some really creative ideas
going on.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.420
Okay, so now we got that, so what order are
we gonna put this in?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.050
So, what's the most "WOW?"

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.530
This is good but I think that's more supporting
that I don't want to start with that.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.380
I'm thinking if it this is blown up, and it's
you, which is cool, because it's "Pick me!"

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.700
That's not bad of a place to start.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.090
I'm not sure about this grid.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.420
So we're gonna color does make more "WOW"
or really strong black and whites.
