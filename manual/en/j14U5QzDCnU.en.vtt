Hi Everyone! I have written in my previous blog, that before I start fishing

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:14.805
I boost my boilies with HCl Betain, Edge Xtract and Spod Juice to make them more attractive.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.550
Now I am going to show you, how to do it!

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:22.881
I have prepared everything already, so let's start it! I am going to put the boilies in a bucket.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.173
It is 1 kg of 20mm Frankfurter Sausage boilies of the EuroBase range.

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:34.860
The boiles are packed in a reseal plastic bag,

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:40.237
what I open now and put the boilies in the bucket.

00:00:42.207 --> 00:00:44.906
Don't forget to throw out the bag to the waste bin, that is important!

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.461
So the boilies are already in the bucket, now we are going to add the additives.

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.531
First of all I am going to start with the dry ingredients,

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:54.477
with Edge Xtract and HCl Betain.

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.419
Now I am going to add Betain first,

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.414
let's say ca. 10 g to 1 kg boilies.

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:10.091
Usually I am not measuring the weight precisely, I just add some according to my taste 

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:16.844
First I add a smaller amount,

00:01:17.748 --> 00:01:21.144
ca. 5 g and then I am adding some more to have about 10-11 g in the bucket.

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:28.498
The next one is the Edge Xtract, I just shake it up well before use.

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:37.700
I'm not taking breath for  few seconds! :)

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:45.340
This quantity will be fine!

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.310
Before I add the liquid,

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:52.940
I mix all of the dry ingredients with the boilies.

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:59.920
Now, it is time to add the Spod Juice.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:06.990
I have choosen the spicy M1, I have great experiences with this one at this venue.

00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:11.620
I just add a bit to coat the boilies.

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.370
Dip, liquid or whatever...

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.030
Now it is time to mix all of them!

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.940
As you can see,

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:43.200
not only the liquid, but also the Edge Xtract and the Betain stick to the surface of the boilies.

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:53.300
Finally I leave it for 10-15 minutes,

00:02:53.922 --> 00:02:59.360
so I have time to prepare the bivvy or the rods.

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:05.300
This is the end result, it looks awesome.

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:10.730
I can guarantee, that carp love it, I always had good results with this.

00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:15.240
Thanks to the extra boost, carp will find the baits quickly, so I can bet, that the first bite will come shortly

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.370
Thanks for watching, wish you tight lines out there!

00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:22.850
Take care, see you next time and have fun,
