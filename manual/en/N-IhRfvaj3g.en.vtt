00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey guys.

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:10.511
Well, i just wanted to make a little video.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.930
I started a collection last year..

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:17.284
And i just wanted to show what I've got so far.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.818
This is actually the last console I've got (in 2012).

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.923
It's the Sega Master System.

00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:31.093
It's actually in pretty good shape, not that much dents or scratches.

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:37.414
This is the Gamecube. I love the design 
 on this console, it's very nice. 

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.188
Pretty easy to put discs in here. Has lots of great games. 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.049
The Sega Genesis (Megadrive) model one.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.149
I decided to go with the model one 'cause 
 it just looks badass, look at that thing...

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.830
It says 16 BIT right in your face. That's really cool.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.029
Here's the Super Nintendo. 

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:07.422
I love that my model actually doesn't have any..

00:01:11.594 --> 00:01:13.594
..yellowing on the plastic. It's all with it's nice gray original color. 

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.411
I love this thing, with its huge, purple..

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.431
Weird knobs ans buttons, it's just great. 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.990
My Sega Dreamcast with the VMU... well, the controller with the VMU attachment.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.276
It's got a bit of yellowing because of time. I'd like to 
 acquire a model that doesn't have this kind of damage.. 

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.330
But, well, for now this'll have to do, 
 I love the front of this system

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.790
Look at that, it's just so badass...

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:58.110
...damnit this can't focus right, but you know it's awesome 'cause 
 it's SEGA, and SEGA always makes really good consoles.

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:05.680
This was actually a gift from a friend of mine. 

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:09.520
This is the Famicom, of Family Computer.

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:09.520
It's the Famicom, or Family Computer.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:14.240
It was only released in Japan and its..

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:17.290
..well, it's the equivalent to this big gray bastard here, 
 the Nintendo Entertainment System. This came out first..

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.740
...and since it was such a smash hit in Japan, they 
 decided to bring it over to the US. 

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.930
It looks just like a VCR. 

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:37.700
And uh...

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.330
..well people actually went on to call the cartridges tapes. Nintendo tapes that's...

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:47.610
This is my Sega Saturn, big black bastard right here. 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.440
I love it.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.990
Inside we have Ghen War..

00:02:54.787 --> 00:02:56.790
..which is actually a pretty mediocre game. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
This is the wii..

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.510
This actually's not mine.. this is from a cousin. 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.190
but... well it's the Wii. 

00:03:11.904 --> 00:03:13.900
And, uh, well, we have the Nintendo 64 here. 

00:03:17.253 --> 00:03:19.250
With its weird, red controller. 

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:23.940
It's a great system, pretty good games in it. 

00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:28.300
The Zeldas the Marios...

00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:30.360
..the Conker's Bad Fur Days'sss'ss..

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.490
..and all that good stuff. 

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:35.510
The Famicom is actually boxed.

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.840
As you can see here, this comes in this wonderful box. 

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:43.450
I love it. I love my Family Computer.

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:47.230
Famicom.

00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:48.800
This is what the front of the box looks like.

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.430
The side.

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:51.920
These are Famicom cartridges (ORLY?).

00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:01.300
And, well, there we go.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:06.980
My 2012 collection.

00:04:09.097 --> 00:04:11.100
And, oh well..

00:04:10.825 --> 00:04:12.820
Finally, I've been using this lately, so it's on the floor. 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.010
It's the Playstation, with the red memory card. 

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:23.360
..which is ssheuiwehefhuhh..(gibberish)

00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:26.570
Plugged into the POWER outlet..

00:04:27.283 --> 00:04:29.280
..and it's hooked up to this TV. 

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.900
..and i love it, it gives a really nice image. 

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.870
I prefer using CTRs over HDTVs.

00:04:41.273 --> 00:04:43.270
..because uh.. those just suck at displaying lower 
 resolutions, but these do quite nicely. 

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.090
And, uh, well.. yeah. 

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:53.070
There we go. I hope you enjoyed this video, and see you soon!
