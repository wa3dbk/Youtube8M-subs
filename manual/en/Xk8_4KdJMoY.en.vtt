Hello dear viewers, today I present to you a special notebook.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.120
It is built for extreme and takes a lot.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.260
perfect for the outdoor and military markets.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.640
Here i have the DELL Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.280
What the notebook can do and take. I will show you now in the video. Have fun

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.000
Before we go into the details, here are some general information.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.040
The extremely tough notebook with a 29.5 cm (11.6 '') display and flip-hinge design

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.520
dont leave you in the lurch in critical situations  and guarantees superior reliability.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.680
With the Latitutde 12 Rugged Extreme, DELL brings out the first rugged notebook with a flip-hinge display.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.720
You can quickly turn it into a Tablet PC.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.480
By the robust base made of magnesium alloy 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.860
and shock absorbent ultra polymer material the notebook is extremely tough.

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:06.294
The system is according to IP65 reliable protected against sand, dust and liquids (water jet) 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.220
and also certified according to some military standards.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.660
Even strong plus or minus temperatures are absolutely no problem for the device.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.420
All entry points are sealed by compression gaskets 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.700
the dual-knife-edge design provides additional sealing

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.740
By the latch the covers are locked and unlocked.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.820
The special cooling system (QuadCool) ensures that the notebook 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.100
does not plays out at high ambient temperatures.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.320
Even outdoors in bright sunlight, the Direct View display is easy to read. 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.800
Because it reduces reflections, preserve contrast and saves battery power.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.520
For unobtrusive visibility of the keyboard in the dark, provides the RGB backlighting.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.360
The colors red, blue, green and white can be changed using the function key

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.060
 and can be adjusted in 4 different brightness levels.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.040
With the resistive multi-touch display you can use the notebook with all kinds of objects.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.200
Whether with the integrated stylus, with or without gloves, a pen or a branch. 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.080
The display responds smoothly on any type of pressure.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.640
but very rough objects cause scratches .

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.520
By 12 inch format, this notebook is perfect for use in vehicles

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.740
or in situations where an ultra-portable device is required.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920
Let's take a closer look to the device.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.720
after unlook you will find on the right side, a USB 3.0 port, memory card reader and a smart card reader.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.760
Behind the next cover you will find the SSD hard drive which can be removed quickly.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.440
To the left you will find the integrated fingerprint scanner works very well with a bit of software.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.220
here the Power Button.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.680
At the front, only buttons for volume control and a button to lock the screen rotation is in tablet mode.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.560
Lets come to the left.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.400
Here you will find behind the cover the combo headphone jack, HDMI, USB 3.0 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.120
and an optional SIM card module. Also optionally it can be installed a GPS module.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.740
Right next to it, behind the covers

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.660
there is the ventilation and far right audio hardware.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.800
The stylus is also stored in the left side 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.380
and equipped with a spiral cable which is  fortunately removable. 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.140
It has more likely disturbed me.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.520
Rear you will find a network port and USB 2.0 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.740
which is appropriate for a mouse. In addition, the serial port and VGA output.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.200
The power connection gets its own cover 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.060
and plug is provided with a white LED. This improves the look.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.600
With the keyboard you can work quickly 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.820
and also the 3.5 x 2 inch touchpad is easy to operate, except for the two finger scroll function.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.900
The left and right mouse button feel like two small spacebars. I like it.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.180
However, the touchpad is set very slow by default but can simply be changed.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.820
right of the touchpad you can still find the contactless smart card reader

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.860
for example, it can be used for secure access .

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.160
Now we come to the display. It measures 11.6 inches 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.800
and works with a native resolution of 1,366 x 768 pixels.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.560
It is widly anti-glare and  with a good brightness level is suitable for outdoors.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.800
For video conferences threre is a webcam in the frame with a slide for privacy.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.160
Videos and pictures can be captured in 720p.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.680
However, with image noise and is therefore intended only for the most necessary.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.460
The display is held by a total of four spring-loaded teeth and is released by stronger pressure.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.660
Otherwise he display frame is very flexible, which makes it also very tough.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.240
Let's get to the bottom of the notebook.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.220
Here you will find another 720p camera with flash for photos and videos in tablet format.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.340
 With 3.7 kg, however, much heavier than a standard digital camera.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.020
 Also this camera is technically designed just for the most necessary.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.780
The small contact points are for the optional universal docking solutions from DELL and HAVIS. 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.780
So you can better use the device in a vehicle or on the desk.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.720
Below are 2 air outlet grilles and below there the 4 cell battery, which is well locked. 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.060
Against the penetration of water, the contact is also equipped with a compression gasket.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.700
The holes in the 4 Ultra polymer corners are for optional carrying handles or straps. What simplified the transport.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.440
due to Intel processors 4th generation you can work quickly 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.740
and with Intel HD Graphics easy graphics applications are no problem.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.300
More details on the technical data and the test report for the certificates can be found below in the description.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.500
A nice feature is the adjustable stealth mode. 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.900
With F7 depending on the setting all lighting and noise sources are immediately disabled, 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.120
which even goes up to the fan. 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.000
Also, the LEDs in the Forntpanel can be deactivated.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.440
Finally I can say that the notebook is ideal for applications

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.940
where a good weather protection is important 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.400
and you have to rely on the device.
We come to the conclusion.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.460
My conclusion on Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme is positive, if you let out the price.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.160
You can rely on the notebook to 100% if you know what it endures.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.060
It is very suitable for tougher activities of all kinds 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.260
and it is really nice to know that it does not go broken so quickly.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.840
I also liked the 12 inch format.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.980
 It seems relatively bulky at first glance, but it fits still good in normal backpacks.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.720
The larger 14 '' inch model without flip-hinge display of DELL would not fit in my small backpacks.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.580
The performance is also absolutely fine.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.800
A big plus to the keyboard, you can tap good and fast.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.960
The Stealth Mode I also liked very well and is also very useful.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.180
Negative points I have the scroll function of the touchpad. 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.840
This react not always immediately, which is a bit annoying.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.960
Otherwise, I can not grumble. It does what it should. Be stable.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.480
Test photos/videos to the cameras and the list of the Mil standards in the description below.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.955
Thats It!

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.541
I hope you like the video.
