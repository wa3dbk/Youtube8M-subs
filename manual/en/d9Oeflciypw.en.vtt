00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.710
- Hi everybody.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.580
I'm here in Ann Arbor,
Michigan at Camp Take Notice,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.470
and I'm with Caleb,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.360
who's the organizer that lives here

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.210
as one of the homeless residents,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.600
and helps model this tent city off of--

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.140
Many of you that have followed me

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.240
have gone with me into
several tent cities,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.670
but y'all know that I love Nicholsville.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.280
And right now, I don't even know

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.380
if there is a Nicholsville.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.510
But in that area, there was a movement,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.670
and this was modeled
after Tent City Three, so.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.650
Tell me about Camp Take Notice.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.483
- Sure.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.520
That's a, sorry,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.710
it always takes me a couple
stutters to get going on this.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.700
Tell you about Camp Take Notice.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.930
So the model that I fell
in love with is unusual.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.029
It's an itinerate model.

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:52.140
Most people are in favor
of a fixed location

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.360
community for the homeless,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930
and I don't disagree with people

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.970
who wanna move those goals forward.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.633
But I do get excited about housing,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.670
both inside and outside,
that moves around.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.580
There's a couple of reasons that those

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.780
work out really well.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.550
One of them is that fixed location

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.000
oftentimes the homeless become
habituated to that location.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.230
The jobs and the places to plug in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.380
within that area get filled up,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.750
and so as you move around
to different locations,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.240
the homeless get a chance to plug in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490
to different communities,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.460
different social groups
as they move around.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.770
- I never even thought of it that way.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.146
Has this tent city moved?

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.490
- It's moved, yep, at least six times.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.150
- Six times.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.360
Gosh, I hate moving.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.500
That's gotta be a real pain to pick up,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.940
how many people are living here?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.780
- Right now I would guess 20.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.613
- 20 people.

00:01:48.613 --> 00:01:49.520
- Yeah.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.870
- Probably all different walks of life.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.703
- Definitely.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.710
- So, I know we just interviewed for

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.930
invisiblepeople.tv,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.973
so part of this might be redundant,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.653
so apologies please,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.650
let me apologize.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.483
But um--

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.530
You guys screen for drug abuse,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.280
you screen for, I mean you don't screen,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.360
but you don't tolerate it.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.530
What other rules that
you have here going on?

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.540
- I think allowing folks to
get a good night's sleep.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.550
So if you do something that disturbs

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.710
the peace of people at night time,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.163
that's a pretty big issue.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.380
And anything that smacks of violence,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.950
or aggressive behavior,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.320
that doesn't support community atmosphere,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.570
those are pretty obvious.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.900
And then there's the cleanliness issues,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.000
so if you're,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.927
we encourage people to
pick up after themselves,

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:48.130
that sort of thing.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.480
- Tonight's clean up night.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.543
I know we talked to Mike,
and he's in college.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.501
I mean, it gives people
a chance to go out,

00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:58.950
and, when you're homeless,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.860
you need some kind of safety

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.830
of where to put your belongings.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.550
And one of the big issues

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.910
of the structured shelter system,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.420
is that there's so many rules,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.040
and people want freedom.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.820
And now this allows that.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.940
- Right.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.440
- I mean, the rules are, you don't drink,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.110
you don't use, and you're
kind to your neighbor,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.010
but otherwise, you can
come and go as you please.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.960
- You're right about that.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.360
- And you find that more liberating?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.469
You find that more healing, or?

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.740
- Yeah, that's a perfect question.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480
What I find particularly healing,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
is the ability to have
something to give laterally

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.450
to your friends next to you.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.363
So in a lot of traditional systems,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.360
help comes down to you from above,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.708
and then there is nothing to
give to those next to you.

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.541
- Huh.

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.450
- So one of people's really strong desires

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.740
is not just to receive,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.300
but also to be a provider,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.920
to be a problem solver.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200
So this kind of environment allows people

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400
to do that for each other.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.060
That restores a lot of agency and humanity

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.230
to those who are discouraged.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.990
- And you know, after you said that,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.690
and again, I've never
even thought about that.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.760
And you're totally right

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.380
because in a structured shelter system,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.730
support, case management
all comes from the top

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.830
down to the one person,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.220
and they're not even
able to help each other,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.503
and that's so big in building a community.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.690
And then people get out of here.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.240
Have people come in this tent city

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.890
and gotten back into housing?

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.133
- Oh yeah, all the time.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.840
I can't say that everyone
that comes through here

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.220
steps up to housing,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.970
but some of them do.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.560
And others continue in
similar circumstances.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.990
But I consider it a success

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.350
if they found peace for their time here.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.940
- Right, right, wow.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.150
Winter is coming.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.560
It's gonna be cold!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.570
This is Michigan.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.037
What do you do?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.823
- This'll, so,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.660
we recently had a donation of a wood stove

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.153
from a kind woman,

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:00.760
so that's exciting.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.170
We've done two winters without

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.450
a community area for warmth,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.863
and so now that we have that,

00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:08.480
it'll be pretty exciting.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.580
And then having done a
lot of winters outside,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.060
I just use a lot of blankets
underneath and above.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.893
- Wow.

00:05:16.893 --> 00:05:18.160
Wow.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.690
Now you've actually
created a non-profit here.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.810
This is a non-profit.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.770
How do people find you,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.570
how do people support you?

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.310
- Right, the non-profit is

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.310
Michigan Itinerate Shelter
System Interdependent Necessity.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.520
So it's, we just call it MISSION.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.383
And how do people find it?

00:05:37.383 --> 00:05:40.480
Tentcitymichigan.org is how they find it.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
- Well very cool.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.200
well, I do,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.023
I just love the Tent City model,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.900
just because I love community,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.893
and I love people helping each other.

00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:55.160
But it's really a slap in the face

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.520
of the homeless services,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.050
because if we were able
to take care of you guys,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.270
you wouldn't have to live in the woods.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.460
And in all reality,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.500
there's no showers or bathrooms here.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.710
So, when you're camping,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.336
it's for a few days.

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:13.800
You said a couple of winters.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.030
So that's homeless.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.290
- Yeah, and I used to
direct a lot of my anger

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.150
towards the homeless services.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.720
But I've become more appreciative
with the people there,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.440
doing what they can with the money

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.653
and time that they have.

00:06:30.653 --> 00:06:35.653
So it's often folks who
don't get their hands dirty

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.090
that I think the responsibility lies with.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.430
- Do you think other communities,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.570
instead of, you know,

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.630
I always say it this way:

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.830
Communities have one of two solutions.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.940
They can either bulldoze homelessness,

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.580
and some literally do that,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.730
they bulldoze tent cities away.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.930
But it never really goes away.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.240
Or they embrace solutions.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.640
Do you consider this as a viable solution?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.500
That when shelters are being overrun,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.640
and there's no money,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.700
that they allow homeless communities

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.340
to develop on a parcel someplace?

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.860
- You'll run into folks
with very strong opinions

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.922
on both sides of that issue.

00:07:13.922 --> 00:07:17.260
I believe that there's a
population of people that

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.470
even when you provide them

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.630
with an indoor location with services,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.880
that they eschew that for

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.670
the life that they've
become habituated to.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.000
So there's a small population
of people, I think,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.620
that will continue to
need services outdoors,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.550
so I believe that this serves
that population of people.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.120
I also believe that this is
a lowest rung on a ladder.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.680
It gives folks something to grab a hold of

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.090
so that they can take their next step up.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.790
Do I think it's a
long-term, viable solution?

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.260
I'm in love with what it
does for people's souls

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.820
and their broken psyches.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.000
So yes, I think it's a good thing.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.950
- Well cool.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.380
Well thank you very
much for talking to me.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.300
- Definitely.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.200
Thanks for coming.
