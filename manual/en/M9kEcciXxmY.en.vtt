Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and
today I want to show you how to really

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.999
easily finish a necklace with beading
chain

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.660
using these great little

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.580
crimps beads with loops

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.310
and here I have a necklace I finished
using them and you could I have these

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.640
really visually striking big lucite
beads and all they really needed was

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.509
to be put on some beading chain

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.009
and then I just needed a way of finishing
my beading chain

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.850
and that's what I've done here with
these crimp beads with loop

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.110
so I want to show you how to do it is so
easy it's a great technique to know so I

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.680
just have a length of beading chain
right here

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.489
i'm going to take one of these

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.100
which especially is just a crimp tube
with a loop soldered on

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.190
and easiest way I find to apply these is to
take your crimping pliers

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.450
capture that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.040
right there in the part of your
crimping pliers that has the little divot

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.510
that's going to allow it to be scrunched up

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.770
and you can see that I am not grasping
it near the loop

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.960
I'm actually as far from the loop as I
can possibly be

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.380
and then all you need to do is take your
beading chain

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.280
just drop it in there

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.150
so it's just right in there

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.470
and go ahead and crimp

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.180
and then just like any other crimp bead

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.340
go ahead and do the second step

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.390
just curve that over

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.770
and there you go and it is in there. It's
tight. Not going anywhere

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.980
it's a great way of just finishing your
beading chain and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.240
and all you need to do as you can see here

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.280
just take a jump ring

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.890
and attach it to that little loop and
then attach my clasp

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
So really quick and easy. A great way
to finish beading chain

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.509
A really easy way to make some
necklaces very quickly and that look

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.520
very polished and professional

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.760
and you can see this project here
called Mod Cubes Necklace - Project N693
