Hey guys, What's up.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.759
Tyler here and today I'm bringing you guys
my review of the Logitech G700s Mouse from

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.800
the Logitech G series.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.159
A huge thanks to Logitech for sending this
out for review.

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.260
Make sure you go to their site and check out
some of their products.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.210
And so The Logitech G700s is one of the many
mice Logitech offers from the Logitech G series,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.970
and this one comes with a bunch of features.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.160
It can be wired or wireless, has 13 different
programmable buttons and controls, and has

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.949
5 different profiles you can choose on the
mouse.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.950
With the mouse you get a usb cable, the wireless
receiver, and receiver extender.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.900
So let's talk about functionality and build
of the mouse.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.340
Like I said, there are 13 different buttons,
and 5 different profiles.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.760
There are 4 buttons on the left side of the
mouse.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.140
Three buttons on the top left
A button that locks the mouse wheel

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.360
Profile changing button
Traditional right and left click

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.560
Mouse wheel with left scroll click, center
click, and a right scroll click

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.820
Each of the buttons are numbered so you can
know which ones you are programming when you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.670
are in the Logitech Gaming Software on your
computer.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
As far as the design, it is fairly comfortable
and seems to mimic almost directly, the design

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.140
of the Logitech Performance Mouse MX, which
is the mouse I used prior to this one.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.440
It fits in the hand well, and all buttons
are relatively easy to access.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.290
The only one that is a bit awkward to hit
is the G11 button on the top.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.110
On the sides of the mouse there is a textured
plastic to add grip, but it feels a bit gritty.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.070
When I first put my hand on it, I thought
my hand was dirty until I realized that was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.110
the grip on the mouse.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.150
I'm not a big fan of it, but after using it
a few weeks, I've gotten used to it and don't

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.490
really notice it at all now.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.490
On the bottom.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.300
The mouse has 4 sliders that enable it to
glide on surfaces, an on/off switch on the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.610
bottom, and access to the rechargeable AA
battery.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.380
So how does it perform?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.920
All buttons are very clicky, aren't hard to
use at all, and don't get accidentally pressed.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.090
When I've used other mice, sometimes I would
accidentally press the right click with my

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.890
hand just resting on it, but I haven't had
this issues with this mouse.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.490
Everything physically and mechanically about
the mouse works great, and I have no real

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.030
issues besides the texture and awkward G11
button.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.830
Now let's talk software.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240
When you get the G700s you are prompted to
go to Logitech's website to download the Logitech

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
Gaming Software.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.170
From there, you can change a ton of settings
for the mouse.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.629
At first it can be a little overwhelming with
all of the options, but if you just go over

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.000
one thing at a time, starting with the different
profiles, it isn't too hard to figure out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.650
As you can see you have a lot of different
options for the different buttons and the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.779
only ones you really can't change are the
left and right mouse click.

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.689
You can unassign buttons as well to give them
no function at all.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.151
You also have the ability to import and export
profiles if you would like to.

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.151
So you could have a profile that is extremely
tuned to your gaming desires and then also

00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:37.151
have a profile where simply the left and right
click work and nothing else.

00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:38.151
A lot of possibilities, but I'm pretty simple,
so I only use one or two profiles since I'm

00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:39.151
the only one on this computer.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:40.151
Now I want to talk about one more thing before
we wrap up the review, and that's battery

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:41.151
life.

00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:44.299
The battery life for this mouse with the battery
that is shipped with it isn't great at all.

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.029
I get 3 days, MAYBE 4 at the max using it
all day with gaming every now and then throughout

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.029
the day.

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:55.469
I expect more from a mouse, because plugging
it in to recharge every 3 days gets old.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:00.359
I only had to charge my Performance mouse
once a week, if that.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.170
But I understand that it's a gaming mouse
and does a lot more functions, but still I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.659
expected better.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.079
Fortunately though, the battery is not sealed
in and you can replace it with a better rechargeable

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.709
AA battery if you choose to.

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.260
Overall, I think the Logitech G700s is a great
mouse.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.820
It worked as soon as I plugged it in as regular
mouse and as soon as I downloaded the Logitech

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.010
Gaming Software I had no problems adjusting
the settings for the different buttons.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.489
The price comes in at $80 on Amazon.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.430
The Performance Mouse MX is only 72, so really
in comparison you can't complain about the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.480
price.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.870
you are getting a comfortable mouse with a
lot of possible configurations with multiple

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.870
profiles.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.279
For only a couple more dollars you are getting
a lot more features.

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.670
Great for gaming, would definitely recommend
it.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.329
