00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
The first DLC for Star Wars Battlefront is
dated, and we’ve got the full details for

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.440
you.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.349
I’m Eian also known as CyberAce, and welcome
back to the Star Wars Battlefront 3 show,

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.950
the longest running source for all your Battlefront
news. Before I get started with this video

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
I’d just like to ask that if you support
the Battlefront community, you smash that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.470
“Like” button and consider subscribing
for future updates.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.390
EA finally revealed the new Star Wars Battlefront
game officially today at the Star Wars Celebration.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.620
With this, they also confirmed the games first
DLC. A completely free set of content known

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.480
as “Battle of Jakku”.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.730
This DLC, which will be available not long
after Battlefront release, launches on December

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.000
8th 2015, or December 1st if you pre-order
Battlefront, it will feature two new maps

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
set on Jakku.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.970
According to EA this DLC will allow players
to experience the Battle of Jakku, the pivotal

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.250
moment when the New Republic confronted key
Imperial holdouts on a remote desert planet

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.710
in the Outer Rim. Taking place in the aftermath
of the Rebel victory in the Battle of Endor,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.560
players will experience the events that created
the massive, battle-scarred landscape of Jakku

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880
shown in Star Wars™: The Force Awakens™.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.720
Something that’s very interesting about
this is that Battlefront is the only way to

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.909
experience the Battle of Jakku. It’s not
seen in any of the movies, and it’s not

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.960
going to be. This means not only does Battlefront
tie-in to The Force Awakens, but it helps

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.430
create a bridge between Return of the Jedi
and The Force Awakens. It’s awesome to see

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.250
that the game actually has the chance to play
a part in the Star Wars canon.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.810
What do you guys think? Are you surprised
the DLC is free? Are you excited to explore

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.210
the new planet? Let me know in the comments
down below.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.171
