00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.740
DUN DUN DUN!

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.800
Once upon a Mobius, Sonic was like running through a field. Sonic: Yeah! *grunts*

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.040
Huh?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.040
*cue Rouge and her boobs monta- oh wait, this came out before Sonic Zombies? Sorry.*

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.820
Like oh my God, hi SONIC

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.920
Uh

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.800
Hello?

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.740
My name is Pinky The Hedgehog! *oh gosh not another Akai Dalia..*

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.520
Yeah, nice to meet you, but I gotta run!

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.960
Not so fast, hedgehog!

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.440
I am doctor- AH!

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.620
Um

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.920
What the hell I?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.540
I saved your ASS, Sonic

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.700
*a gun ready to shoot? Ok* What the crap?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.400
AAH! *Oh shiz.. HE'S FLIPPING DEAD, YA'LL!*

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.720
I am Death The Hedgehog. I'm Shadow's long-lost brother from the space Colony ark.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.980
Y-Yeah, but I thought-

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.980
I'm now your best friend!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.720
What about Tails?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.340
F*CK TAILS! *kick*

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240
And you're my lover Sonic!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.400
But I'm not your your-

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
BUT I LOVE YOU.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.600
*oh hey Arnold Crea- OH NOT AGAIN* My name is Sorass! I come from the planet Earth. 2!

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.740
I've come to destroy the Chaos emerald to make rock candy! *giggles*

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.900
Here are your beautiful children, Sonic.  *OH GOD, NOT AKAI DALIA AGAIN!*

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.820
What the f*ck?!

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.600
Shut up! These are your kids! Conness, Winky and Cosby.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.640
But how?!

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.620
Remember Sonic six months ago when he had one too many and-?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.960
BUT I JUST MET YOU! I didn't even know you! I didn't even know you until like five minutes ago!

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.980
Don't you love your children Sonic?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.760
But Father, Dad, you are my father.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.660
And I inherited your speed!

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.460
Well you see-

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.560
Hey, what the f*ck happened to Sorass?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.680
I now have all the emeralds!! *giggles*

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.980
Sonic, we should team up and kick his sorry ass.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.100
Huh..

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.220
Go, Dad!

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.960
Would you quite calling me dad?!

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
We should turn super.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.180
Uhm, he has all the emeralds..

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.760
I don't need no emeralds! I can turn super by eating...

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180
A Graham Cracker!

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.000
*CHOMP CHOMP BOI*

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.980
Why does this remind me of a show about balls?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.300
Waha! He said 'balls'!

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.980
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.800
I'm not done yet..

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.760
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.780
Almost there.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.960
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.840

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.300
AAAAHHHHH!!

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.800
Great job Sonic; we kicked his ass.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.940
*Bow!*

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.540
Sonic, what have you-?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.040
*Bam!*

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180
Oh, my goodness, Dad!

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.940
*FLAME THOWED IN THE FACE, M8!!*

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320
I want to go home..

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.140
*Twonk! GET DUNKED ON, KIDDO- Wait, this isn't..? Oh..*

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.860
