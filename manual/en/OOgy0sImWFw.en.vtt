00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.700
Welcome to The Daily for Monday, October 31st.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.800
It is Halloween with Greg Lalas.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.849
I'm Jason Saghini.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.000
Sorry, no costumes here, but plenty of soccer
to talk about.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.519
Lets start with the New York, LA matchup from
Sunday.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.350
A lot to talk about coming out of this game.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.949
The storylines going into this one were all
about the hype and the dp's.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.090
Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Landon Donovan,
Rafa Marquez, and the match lived up to the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.090
billing.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.529
David Beckham with a beautiful ball over the
top that leads to Mike McGee's goal.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.160
It ended up being the winner.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.131
1-nil for LA at Red Bull Arena.

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:38.670
The talk coming out of this is really what
happened after the final whistle.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.080
There was a little scuffle at midfield after
Rafa Marquez threw the ball at Landon Donovan,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.250
then Adam Krismann gets involved, Adam Kiel,
Juninho throws an elbow.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.810
In the end, the fallout is Rafa Marquez and
Juninho both with red cards.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.130
They will not be in the 2nd leg this week
in Los Angeles.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.760
You really have to look at this and say New
York had several chances to get back into

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
this one.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
To get the equalizer.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.000
They weren't able to put it away.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.270
Josh Saunders was amazing in the Galaxy net.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.200
It was interesting, Bruce Serena had the choice
to keep either Donovan Ricketts or Josh Saunders.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.579
Apparently he made the right choice.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:20.170
The next leg of this series is Thursday at
11pm eastern time on ESPN2 or TSN2 if you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.170
are in Canada.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.609
We're going to move on to Philadelphia Union
yesterday were hosting the Houston Dynamo

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.439
in their first leg of the matchup.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.720
Houston gets a result on the road.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.229
I think coming into this one, there were a
lot of people that thought Philly were going

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.770
to come out and get the win at home.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.380
Obviously a big crowd at PPO Park.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.380
They were going to be rocking.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.960
It was the first playoff game in the Philadelphia
Union's history.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.100
Then it just didn't happen.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.409
Houston came out and played their game set
pieces.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.840
Big guys crashing the net.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.469
Then Kalin Carr, the speedy little guy was
still able to do some damage up top as well.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.560
They get a 2-1 victory at PPO Park.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.889
It sets them up beautifully to go back to
Robertson and finish off this series pretty

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:00.889
cleanly.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:07.520
The 2nd leg of this one, Thursday at 8:30pm
eastern time on ESPN2 and also TSN2 in Canada.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.910
Moving on, another road victory.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.240
Kansas City over the Colorado Rapids, 2-0.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.390
This was 3 for 3 for the road teams on Sunday.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.330
A complete performance from Sporting Kansas
City.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.560
Teal Bunbury with the goals.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.620
He gets a penalty.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.920
He also finishes one off very well.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.120
The story out of this one is actually what
happened to Colorado.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.980
For one, they didn't play well.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.400
They weren't able to keep posession.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.530
They looked a little bit tired maybe from
that midweek match.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.240
Number two, their backline is now decimated.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.480
Kosuke Komora came out with an injury.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.391
Drew Moore came out with an injury.

00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:44.830
Tyrone Marshall picked up a red card, so he
will be suspended for the 2nd leg.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.830
We're sitting here now thinking who is going
to start in the back for Colorado in that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.440
2nd leg at Sporting when they go back to Kansas
City.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
Of course, at LiveStrong, Kansas City very
difficult to get a result from.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.950
That game at LiveStrong will be Wednesday
night, 8pm eastern time on Fox Soccer Channel

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.780
and also TSN2 in Canada.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.070
The other game was saturday night.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.120
This might have been the most comprehensive
victory we have ever seen in a first round

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.430
playoff game.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.750
There was some question marks about Real Salt
Lake coming into the playoffs.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.530
Well you can erase those question marks now
because they looked phenominal.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.320
On the other side, the Seattle Sounders did
not look good at all.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.930
They were not able to get anything going.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.590
They were missing Mauro Rosales' ability to
unlock defenses.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.960
Even just to hold the ball, for some reason,
the Sounders looked nervous and they were

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.150
not able to hold the ball.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.720
RSL took advantage.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.460
Sobario with 2 goals, including that incredible
back heel flick that he finished off.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.420
A terrific result for Salt Lake going up to
Seattle.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.260
Many people believe it was that Ned Grabavoy
goal that third goal in that matchup that

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.350
wrapped up this series for Real Salt Lake.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.711
Some of the Seattle fans can take heart.

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:53.731
In 2003, the San Jose Earthquakes overcame
a 4 goal defecit against the LA Galaxy, so

00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:55.030
it has been done before.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.040
They only had 77 minutes to do that too, not
90 minutes.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.980
You can see the return leg of that series
Wednesday night at 10pm eastern time on ESPN2

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.940
and TSN2 in Canada.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.460
One more note, ExtraTime Radio with our friend
Alexei Lalas will be out later today.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.879
You can get it on iTunes or BuzzSprout.
