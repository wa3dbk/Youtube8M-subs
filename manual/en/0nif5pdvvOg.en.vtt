00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:23.515
Hm? Hey, this thing on?

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.774
This one? Oh, this one.

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:28.577
What's up?

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.499
Good day, everyone.

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.762
My name is Helena Douglas.

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.076
And I have the pleasure of speaking to you 
 today on behalf of the newly reformed DOATEC.

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:41.438
Oh. It's her!

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:44.287
That lady from the tournament... 

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.152
..and we lost many things that were simply irreplaceable.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.935
It was truly our darkest hour.

00:00:54.946 --> 00:01:01.417
And yet it was then that we resolved to rise from 
 the rubble that surrounded us and start again, anew.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:13.641
Today Iâ€™d like to inform you that DOATEC is stronger than ever, ready 
 to take a bold step forward and soar into the future.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:24.476
Very soon, we will hold the fifth Dead or Alive tournament.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:37.467
No more words. Face me.

00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.210
Hayate, you mustn't act on emotion.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.180
Come on, move!

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.680
I am most satisfied with the results of our test.

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:13.220
Are you one of the world's greatest fighters? 
 Then get your ass in the tourney!
