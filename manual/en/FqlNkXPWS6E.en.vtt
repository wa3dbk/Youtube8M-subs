00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.540
All right, check it out:

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.740
Today we're looking at the HP DV9927cl.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.780
This is a really, really nice 17" laptop.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.760
And it was ridiculously expensive
not too long ago.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.930
Less than a year ago, this was more than 
double the price that it currently has.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
Actually, it was way more than double.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.390
This was a really expensive laptop,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.630
and now, this is the refurbished model.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.200
So, this was sent back to the factory,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.760
they grabbed it,
they made sure that everything was ok,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.340
they cleared it out, wiped out the OS,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.200
put in a fresh copy of Windows Vista 64 bit,
and sent it back out.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.810
And now it is at a great deal and you can
get this awesome laptop.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.740
So, first of all I'll give you
just a general lookaround

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.850
so you can see what it looks like.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.490
The back is black but,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.620
I don't know if you can see it,
let's see if we can get it the light,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.520
there you go, there's that really cool design
that HP is pretty well known for.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.190
And those cool dots there, 
those are my fingerprints.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000
Those look pretty cool, too.
I apologize for that.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.390
But you do see the pattern
all around through here.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.840
It's pretty cool. It's a dark, dark grey
with a silver lining that makes up the lines.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.970
So it's very cool there.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.340
Again, it is a 17"
so you do have a full keypad over here

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.160
On the right hand side of your
regular keyboard.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.160
Really nice shortstroke keyboard.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.710
Works really well, kind of soft
and definitely not loud.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.350
The 17" display is 1440x900.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.290
So you're looking at 1440 across
and 900 lines of resolution across the top.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.870
Up here you do have a nice
1.3 Megapixel webcam,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.590
which is extremely cool to have for Skype,
for Instant Messenger,  web-conferencing,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.240
telecommunicating to work, 
great, great stuff.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.350
Now, let's talk a little about
the performance on here,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.870
because this is definitely not a slacker
in the performance department.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.350
You got a lot of good parts on here.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.610
It's got an AMD Turion X2, which is actually
a 2.1 GHz AMD dual core from the Turion line,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.510
which is actually benchmarked extremely well
as far as power is concerned.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.160
It actually benchmarked better 
than Intel Centrino line

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.590
at the same operating frequency,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.790
which is really nice.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.090
It's got 4 GB of DDR2, which is actually the
maximum that you can allocate

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.290
on this computer.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.170
It is a 64 bit operating system, but
it's physically limited to 4 GB of memory.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.270
It's got a 500 GB hard drive.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.530
Actually it's two 250 GB hard drives
in RAID

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.740
which is really nice - it gives you a lot
of storage options, really good stuff.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.680
You get a super multi DVD-RW
so that's over here on this side.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.220
You will see that it does have LightScribe,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.260
and it is 'super multi', so it will do Rs,
+Rs, -Rs, RAMs, ROMs,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.520
pretty much you name it - it'll do it.
CDs and DVDs as well.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.660
It's dual layers up to 4x
so it's fast as well,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.490
And there's still a lot more.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.130
As you noticed probably,
when I told you earlier about the Turion,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.700
you actually have NVIDIA graphics on here,
which is really nice.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.370
So, it's not super duper gaming graphics
that are awesome for video games,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.580
but it is good enough definitely to do
1080P videos, to stream stuff off iTunes,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.180
or if you buy movies or netflix, you're going
to have no problems running it off here.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.650
It's actually a 7150 mobile graphics card
by NVIDIA,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.790
and it's got shared memory,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.720
it's got a side port memory
that it shares with the system memory,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.660
up to 1 GB.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.790
It's actuallt 1,071 MB in total,
but pretty much 1 GB.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.560
If you want to share the memory
with the computer.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.130
256 of that is dedicated, so it's very nice.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.310
Now, also on here, you have N draft wireless
for connectivity, of course,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.340
and you do have Ethernet.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.550
So if you do want to go plug in,
you do have 10/100 right here,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.510
and right next to it you have 56 k.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080
So you have pretty much all the connectivity
you could ever want,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.720
especially if you live in the southeast U.S.,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.290
this right here will save your life
during a hurricane, man.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.230
This gets you on the web after your
internet's down.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.100
It's really nice to have.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.360
You do have an expansion port,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.500
so if you're using this for business
or as a desktop replacement,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.760
it's very useful for that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.570
You got your VGA as well, and your S video.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.540
So you got quite a few video outputs,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.020
and I still haven't gotten to the last one,
so we'll keep going.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.710
Moving on over here,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.640
USB 2.0 right there,
another USB 2.0 right there.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520
You got iLink Firewire which is 1394.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.910
You have a multimedia card,
it's a 5 in 1,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.720
does SD, MS, MS pearl, MMC, XD.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.330
You name it, pretty much it will do it,
which is really nice.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.960
Up here in the front, you've got a couple of
indicator lights.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.890
For power - there you go.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.330
This one's for power, for charging
and for your hard drive activity light.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.750
Also you have a wifi on/off button right here

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.200
so if you want to turn your wifi off
for a flight, or to use the Ethernet,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.440
you can right there.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.470
Another thing that's really cool about
all these HP laptops that I like a lot

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.150
is they give you dual headphones,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.110
so if you want to listen to music,
on a plane, let's say,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.050
and you have someone next to you,
and you have an extra set of headphones,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.670
you guys can watch a movie,
or you can listen to music.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.150
You have your microphone right there

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.300
and right there, that's a consumer IR port.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.960
So you will see a very cool accessory
that comes with this in a split second,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.470
when I rotate to the next side,
and you'll see what you use that IR port.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.000
Now let's come over here.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.640
And here's what I was talking about.
This is your Express card.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.510
It can be a 54 or a 34, or you can fill it
with this media center remote control,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.940
which is really cool.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.580
So pretty much you can pop this out anywhere,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.660
turn this little computer
into a desktop replacement,

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.550
surf the web, surf TV, look at pictures,
look at videos,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.780
all from your couch.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.490
Which is nice, if you're lazy. Like me.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.760
Now, also in the front, you're going to see
you have a USB 2.0 up here in the front,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.500
and then you have your CD/DVD-RW
as I mentioned earlier.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.770
Another USB 2.0 and then
back here at the bottom is your power.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.610
So take advantage of this great deal,
this HP DV9927cl.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.370
It was really expensive, 
it's really affordable now.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.250
It's in refurbished condition.
It still comes with a 3 month warranty.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.910
So you can make sure that it definitely works
just in case.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.820
But don't worry, because
refurbished computers, in my opinion,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.990
are actually better than the broken ones,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.220
'cause they're going to grab them,

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.730
they're going to take them, 
they're going to inspect them,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.300
and they're going to give you a fresh OS.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.000
And a lot of times they don't even 
load the bloat wear

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.060
that some of the computers come with.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.230
So this is a great deal, great buy.
Lots of great features.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.670
If you have any questions on it, e-mail me.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.240
And I'll see you guys next time.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.470
