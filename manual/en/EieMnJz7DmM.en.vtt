00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:09.640
Tips to speed up flipping to codes faster
in the manual to save time on the CPC exam?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.150
Well for the ICD Manual, I’ll start with
that.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.519
One of the frustrating things for me is I
don’t think there’s any version of a manual

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.449
out there that has the true Table of Contents.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.939
And most versions are volumes 1 and 2 and
one spiral bound book.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.930
And if you’re into Inpatient Hospital Coding,
you have 3 volumes in it and it’s very hard

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.430
when you’re brand new at using it to figure
out you know, where to even start.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.760
So what I recommend to my students is that
at the top of the manual, not on the sides,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.710
that they get those hard tabs and put them
where all the main sections of their manual

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.010
are.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.780
So obviously, where each volume starts when
you have volumes 1 through 3.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.790
For the Index to Diseases, there’s 3 main
sections.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.280
A lot of people don’t even know that.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.990
You’ve got the Index to Diseases.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.780
You’ve got the Index to External Causes,
the E Code at the end and in the middle, you’ve

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.910
got a table for like Poisoning Codes and drugs
and things like that.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.710
So I would tab those 3 things.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.240
Some people will tab the Neoplasm table and
the Hypertension table.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.930
You could do that but they’re in alphabetical
order.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.230
And then as far as the tabular part of ICD,
I wouldn’t bother doing too much tabbing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.380
there because you’re going to be looking
up the answers in the book.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.560
And what you have to get good at and this
is the same as CPT is just like a dictionary

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.880
is look in the upper corners and I did make
a copy of my CPT.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.799
But before I go on to that, don’t put tabs
in the sides.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:00.869
It’ll slow you down.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.400
The only thing that in the Tabular that I
would tab is where your V codes start and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.810
your E codes because sometimes, you want to
get to them you know, quicker.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.000
They are at the you know, end of the 17th
Chapter there.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.010
But I find that I like to get to the guidelines
to the V codes to read them and then that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.230
way it’s right there, V codes that I just
flipped there.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.470
One last thing that I like to tab and each
year when I get my ICD manual is I like the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.010
condensed view of the Tabular section.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.230
It’s this close to getting to the table
of contents in ICD that you can get and that

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.030
is Appendix E in your Volume 1 of the Tabular.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.070
And it does not go to 4th and 5th digits level.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.010
It’s down to the category level.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.510
That’s 3 digits.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.980
And because ICD is a classification system,
your codes have to sit in that category.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.879
So it gives you a nice overview.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.110
Alright, so as far as CPT and ICD you know,
when you’re flipping and you’re in the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.160
tabular… let me get to that point…

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.610
I just picked these sample surgery pages.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.420
Okay so you want to look up.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.019
So on this left facing page, if you see the
code range here, just like in the dictionary

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.140
and I am guilty of this.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.410
I tend to go up and down, up and down and
then it wastes your time.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.420
If you can really train yourself to look to
see if your code is within this range or not

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.200
and if it’s not, flip to the next page and
keep going.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.489
Use these upper corners to help speed up your
flipping to the book.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.270
Another tip that I do especially for those
taking the board exam, maybe not so much for

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.060
everyday coding, because you’re going to
the answers on the board exam, if you’re

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.069
using my suggestion for op reports and surgery
questions, don’t read the scenario until

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.060
you look up the answers.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.900
If you can train yourself to do that and you
take practice exams, you will see how much

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.930
time that will save you.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.430
So leg and ankle is this whole page.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.400
Now because I’ve just turned to this page
because maybe my answer is 27814, I don’t

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
know where I am.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
I have to start reading through it.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.580
If I look up, “Oh, leg and ankle.”

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.380
Because actually, this category started a
page or two before this one but I have to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.270
flip back to see what anatomical area I’m
even in.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.590
I mean, I know it’s musculoskeletal but
this tells me leg and ankle.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.920
And then on the facing page, it says foot
and toe.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.690
Now that, I grasp from here but I’m going
to also have it on the following page because

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.410
this red heading won’t be on the page.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.600
And I picked foot and toes because there are
bones in the hands and bones in the feet that

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.530
have the same name.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.919
And you can go to question where you have
you know, the answer looks exactly the same.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.060
You’re like, “Wait a minute.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.060
What’s going on?”

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.030
When you look up, it’s like, “Oh, this
one’s at the foot, the other one’s at

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.120
the hand.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.340
Now I know what to extract for in my blip
or scenario or op report when I read it.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.970
I need to see if I’m dealing with a hand
or a foot to begin with.”

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.950
So that’s my suggestion for speeding up
flipping to the codes faster.
