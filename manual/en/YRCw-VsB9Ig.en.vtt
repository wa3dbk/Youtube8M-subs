00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:07.160
Welcome to Expert Village I'm Steve Blank
here to demonstrate the many ways we can throw

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:17.490
and catch a frisbee we'll be using a 175 grand
ultimate sport disc. Learning the thumb throw

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.990
begins with the grip the thumb is on the bottom
against the rim squeeze tightly fingers on

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.260
the front of the rim. When you release the
outside edge the edge away from your hand

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.770
should be up this edge cuts into the air and
gives the disc it's lift. The arm and follow

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.630
through point towards the target this throw
will put left spin on the disc. For a lefty

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.900
all the left and right things are opposite
the legs make a line to the target when we

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:03.079
release our left foot is forward. If there
is a wind adjust your aim into the wind let

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:13.710
the wind push the disc, the thumb throw gives
great power and accuracy with or without foot

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.909
work. For me the thumb throw is the most powerful
and versatile throw there is, if I had to

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:29.800
protect myself and I had a frisbee handy,
I might use this throw. But more seriously

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.960
speaking you can get to the thumb throw from
anywhere the thumb can go to the rim and you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.320
turn your hand and you throw it. It's that
simple, so practicing this pass catch is very

00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:06.490
handy
and I can throw a thumb, with practice you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.110
can throw it softer it wants to go fast.
