00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.870
My name's Paul Nash; I am 64
years of age. Back in 2009, just before Christmas

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
I went to see my GP and was diagnosed with
prostate cancer. I then went for laparoscopic

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:19.120
surgery and had the prostate removed. It\'s
called keyhole surgery where they make three

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.189
incisions; one for the equipment that they
are putting in to do the cutting: very small.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.280
And then another two for tubes whereby they
control it. As part of the operation they

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.760
inserted a catheter. I had the surgery on
the Tuesday and they sent me out on the Friday.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.640
So I was recovering quite quickly. I was still
a little bit sore but I was okay. And obviously

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.670
I came out with my bag and the catheter. Approximately
a week later they took the catheter out and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.210
that's when you notice incontinence because
obviously they provided me, I had to put a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.800
pad on straightaway because literally my urine
was just coming out like a tap. It was just

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.560
like turning on a tap. And you don't realise
this. No matter what you are told about it

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.710
beforehand, you have no concept, you just
think it might be like a little child dribbling

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.240
occasionally but it's not. It just keeps
coming and keeps coming and within an hour

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.630
you've filled your pad and then you are
getting another one. Now that's quite inhibiting

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.560
on your life. I certainly found for the first
few weeks that that was a very inhibiting

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.399
thing because you can't do very much. Like
if I wanted to play a game of golf I was having

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.389
to find bins around the course to put a pad
in and put another one in. That's not, on

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:34.990
a golf course, that's not very easy to
do. I did it mind you, because I was determined

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.950
not to be beaten by it but it was quite difficult
that. When you have had the surgery, you're

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.020
very bruised down there. And I was and I think
you sort of live with that and then you think,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.039
'crumbs this is', and I was going up to the
district nurses at the local health centre

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.659
and they were providing me with additional
pads. And then by chance one of the district

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.399
nurses said to me, 'Do you know what? There's
now a service for providing external catheters.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.039
Would you like to try it?' I said straightaway,
'Yes please'. So, I'm lying on this bed, on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.689
this couch and she then proceeded to shave
me and she then proceeded to put almost like

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:20.390
a glue around my penis and then stick on this
external catheter and then fix the bag to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.409
my leg. And then she said, 'That's what
you will have to do every day, you'll have

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.680
to put it on in the morning, take it off at
night and then obviously you change your bags

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.040
whenever you want to.' It changed my life.
If we take the period up until then end of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.250
my incontinence, to be honest, it's almost
just like a very minor, it's a blip in

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.040
my life. It's not changed my life really,
in much of a way. I've just carried on.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.409
I've carried on working, I've just seen
this is something, just to move on. Whatever

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.610
happens next, that will be the same. If the
cancer recurs at some time in the future that

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.090
will be the same, because it's the belief
that, go beyond that one and then look at

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.819
the next step, look at the next things, look
at the next challenge. And so that would be

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.620
a strong message to anybody else. If you can,
and I'm not saying that you can because

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.840
it's just the way I am, it's just the
way I am made, but I've always just, adapt

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.540
to that new stage in your life and make the
best of it.
