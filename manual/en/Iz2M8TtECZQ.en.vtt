00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.430
-Everyone Welcome back.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.660
This is DHTV and today I'm going
to be going through some tricks

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.590
that you can use on your iPhone.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.460
Let's get started.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.310
The first trick we're going to
be looking at is a simple one.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.430
And it's going to involve
your iPhone's camera,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.950
as well as your headphones.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.860
Similar to using the
audio rocker on the iPhone

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.030
to take a picture, if you
press the plus audio rocker

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.680
on the headphones, it'll go
ahead and snap a picture.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.784
Next up, we have the built
in dictionary on the iPhone.

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.200
Now if you didn't
know, the iPhone

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.370
comes standard with this.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.840
And it's available to
you whenever you need it.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.750
So rather than going
on Google and searching

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.300
for the word you're
confused about,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.790
simply tap and hold on the word.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.580
When the boxes
appear, tap on define.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.239
And the dictionary will
pop up with the definition.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.030
The next trick we're
going to be looking at

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.700
involves the
iPhone's lock screen.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.730
Now most of us probably
know, if you swipe up

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.390
from the little
camera icon it'll

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.410
open the camera application.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.190
But a couple of lesser known
features from the lock screen

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.530
here are the double
tapping of the Home button

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.960
to access your
volume capabilities,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.610
as well as holding
the home button,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.489
then you can access Siri
straight from your lock screen.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.280
The next trick we're
going to be looking at

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.465
involves the iPhone's
keyboard and specifically

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:16.620
the hidden characters within it.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.110
To access them,
all you need to do

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.550
is tap and hold on a specific
letter, slide across.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.860
And when you've selected the
letter you want, release.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.350
And it'll appear on your page.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.310
Now, you can also do this within
the number section as well.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.000
For example, if I tap and
hold on the dollar sign,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.940
you'll see a box with different
characters appears again.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.660
The next trick involves
disabling native apps

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.640
from your iPhone.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.390
So as you can see on
my main page here,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.380
I've got iTunes and Safari.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.510
So we're going to go into
the Settings tab here.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.290
You want to go down to general.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.390
And then you want to
go to restrictions.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.640
You want to tap enable.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.694
And you're going to need to
enter in your password twice.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.110
Once you've done
that, you can see

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.190
you can disable
various native apps.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.390
You can't disable all of
them, but I do show you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.250
in another video
using a trick which

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.550
will allow you to delete other
apps like weather and news

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.200
stand.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.533
So if you want to do that,
check that out on my channel.

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.670
But for this case here,
we can delete iTunes.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.965
And we can delete
or disable Safari.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:11.800
And if we go back to
our main page here,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.500
you can see that both
of them are gone.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.310
The next trick I'm
going to show you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.150
how to change the
name of your iPhone.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.230
So you need to go into
the settings application.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.420
Go to general.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.087
And then go to
the about section.

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:22.295
Now at the top, it says name.

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:25.470
And mines called Dan
iPhone, for some reason.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.060
So we'll go ahead
and tap on that.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.140
And you can change it
to whatever you want.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.580
So we'll call it Dan's cell.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.750
Then hit done to save it.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.150
And you've changed the
name of your iPhone.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.160

found these tips helpful.
