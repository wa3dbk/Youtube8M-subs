00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.080
Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.500
and today I'm going to show you how to do a really fun Christmas tree

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.330
earring. It's a modern take on a Christmas tree made out of wire

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.349
I've actually have two here. One is using

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.020
24 gauge wire and it's pretty flimsy

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.609
the advantage is it's a lot easier to make
than using the 22 gauge

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.680
but the 22 gauge is more solid and

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.890
it's doable, it just is a little trickier so you might have to practice a little bit

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.610
more with it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.379
but this is the final project and I'm a
show you how to make it

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.949
in terms of ingredients you're gonna
need some artistic wire

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.830
I've chosen green for Christmas. This is 22
gauge

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.070
I have eight green head pin, a green earring

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.479
hook and a little bicone bead, this is six millimeters

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.430
this is actually all the supplies you need in terms of the ingredients. You can see

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.170
you can actually make quite a few of these earrings with not a lot of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.570
ingredients and in terms of tools you need a ruler

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.280
you need a pair round nose pliers, chain nose pliers

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.430
flush cutters and then you need a jig

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.520
and I have the Delphi wig jig here and different wig jigs have different

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.920
grid patterns on them

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.530
and this is the one that's going to work for our tree and then it's got these

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.469
little pegs

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.570
that just go into this holes wherever you want them

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.500
so I've wind it up in almost like an arrow formation

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.109
my pegs and you'll see that I have a total of

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.570
5 on each side coming to a 6th one in the
center

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.780
so there's 11 along the outside and one in the middle which is going help to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.999
anchor our wire where we begin with and also

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.619
to give us the little loop that we're going to
be able to attach a bicone onto

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.659
so to begin we're going to measure 12

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.359
inches of wire

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.130
Start

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.979
by making a little loop, We're going to grasp
the tip of

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.340
my wire with our round nose pliers and bend it

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.690
just into a nice little loop and then bend it back

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.940
that's what we've got to start. So we're gonna
place this loop

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.709
onto our first peg and this is gonna anchor our wires and give us a place to

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.330
start

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.060
now we're gonna hold it as best we can

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.790
and go to the first peg

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.890
you're going to press the wire down

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.390
as you work hold it in place and twist
it around the pegs

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.659
and one thing I found that works really well for me is I like to move

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.860
my wig jig as I work. I just find it a lot easier

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.560
so now I'm gonna hold where I just curved go around that peg

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.760
almost like in a figure eight pattern, back

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.010
under the peg, opposite and I'm going to hold this wire

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.159
and really press it down, go

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.980
up through the peg and I'm just gonna do
this figure 8 pattern

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.629
I'm going under the other peg opposite,
curving it around

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.720
holding it in place, to the other side

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.530
and you wanna pull pretty snug

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.349
because you don't want your wires to be loosened there

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.280
go back and forth

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.189
pressing it. If you reach in there do not
remove this

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.739
middle peg out because that is still anchoring your wire in place

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.739
and this does take a little of strength to get these straight that's why I mentioned

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.920
that

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.150
you can do it in 24 gauge

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.019
it's not going to be quite as solid and sturdy

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:05.019
it will work but it is a lot easier

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.060
we're just going to go back and forth

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.060
the same pattern and I'm pressing it down

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.139
I want to make sure nice and even and flat

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.310
coming up to my last peg. I'm just going to
go just as if there was another regular

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.870
one

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.470
and loop it around. Go all the way around the top

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.190
peg to make a loop and cross it over

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.460
and I'm going to trim that when I remove it. So this is what we've got for a tree

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.660
now to remove it, some people like to remove all the pegs

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.220
I actually like to just very carefully scoot my wire

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.639
up along the pegs, if they come out great

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.020
if they don't doesn't matter, do not force it

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.110
just go nice and slow scooting it up

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.229
along. Make sure it comes up all together

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.039
so that you not having one part of it completely

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.440
undone and one part still back down here

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.070
so I just popped it off. Now we're gonna trim the top

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.580
you notice we have some extra wire. You
want that extra wire

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.729
otherwise it can be too hard when you get up to the top to make that final loop

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.600
so now the beauty of this is that it is wire

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.840
go ahead and bend it

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.770
if it came out of shape at all bend it into
shape how you want it

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.770
you can try hammering this

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.680
I don't necessarily recommend it unless you have a nice

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.979
nylon mallet otherwise it will mar the finish on the green wire and will ding

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.500
If you do have a nylon hammer go ahead

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.789
and you can hammer it gently on a bench
block otherwise

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.320
just use your fingers. So now we just need to complete our earring

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.770
we have our shape. To do that we're going to take our head pin

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.650
put the little bicone on it and make

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.650
a simple wire loop

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.530
trim it

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.100
and open it up the same way I'd open up
a jump ring, connect it

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.650
onto that bottom loop. Close it

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.220
see if we need to close this loop too

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.580
now just the top part, open it the

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.350
loop at the base of the earring. My

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.400
loop is open at the back so I want my loop to be open at the back here

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.550
and

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.490
there we go. We have a really fun modern
Christmas tree earring

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.660
made out of wire.
