00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.731
Hey guys, impaKt here. In this video I'll
be talking about the upcoming summoner spells

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:15.500
changes in Season 4. I think Riot has done
a phenomenal job of balancing out summoner

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.840
spells, and everyone will have a lot more
options at their disposal from here on out.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.310
First I'll give you a rundown of the spell
changes and then I'll analyze what it may

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.150
mean for current and future support players
as well.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.949
Ghost's cooldown now decreases as time goes
on and instead of giving you a flat percentage

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.699
in movement speed increase, it now multiplies
your movement speed. So for instance, if you

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.800
have movement speed increasing items, runes
or masteries, your ghost will speed you up

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.449
even further. It will also give you 75% multiplicative
movement speed in the first second of it's

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.079
activation. This means that Ghost will now
scale better into the late game, especially

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.090
on champions with native movement speed buffs
like Udyr, Skarner, Evelyn, Singed and so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.010
on. Taking Ghost may indeed be the better
option if your intention is to chase down

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.150
your targets, while Flash will remain the
crowd favourite for clutch escapes and skill

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.570
shot dodging (like Malphite's or Jarvan's
ultimates).

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.510
Ignite's damage has been rescaled based on
game time. It also reveals the target for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.650
the duration of the spell. While it may not
sound like much, it'll completely change the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.140
way Ignite is used right now: it will no longer
be as powerful as it was in early-game situations,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.990
so going for early-game cheese or aggression
may not be as easy. However, since it now

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.800
grants sight of the target, there are a few
new ways you can actually use it for. For

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.490
example, you now know if the enemy who is
ignited will die or not or even how he's positioning

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.820
so you can try going for the killing blow.
It may also be really helpful against the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.220
sorts of evelyn: champions with stealth mechanisms
or that can escape easily.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.730
Gone are also the days when Exhaust was used
to nullify carries completely. The attack

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.970
speed reduction was reduced to 30% from 50%
and the movement speed reduction was also

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.450
rescaled, so it actually reduces the enemies'
movement speed even further as time goes on.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.190
While 30% is still a significant number and
it will still hurt the likes of Jax and Tryndamere

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.289
in the top lane, or any non-caster AD Carry,
it seems like it is now a more suitable tool

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.659
for kiting and peeling front lines.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.930
After Ghost, I think heal has changed the
most. First of all, it is now a targeted spell.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.379
If you cast it on yourself, you'll target
yourself and your closest ally. The cast range

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.299
was also increased by 300 points, the cooldown
was reduced to 180 seconds and it also grants

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.959
an extra 30% movement speed buff to both targets.
Since it is no longer AoE, I don't think it's

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.299
as good in team fights as it used to be. However,
it may prove to be even better during the

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.920
laning phase. I should also point out that
this will probably save both the ADCs and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.860
the Supports life in case of ganks, since
it also grants movement speed as well as heal

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.300
now. It may be one of the best options for
supports that lack sustain in their kits.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.370
It's also a great option for supports that
are looking to play the peeling or protector

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.220
role in team fights.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.769
Teleport's cooldown has been reduced when
targeting an allied building and it was increased

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.730
when cancelled or interrupted. Teleporting
to a tower may not be the best option because

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.219
you may take longer to reach the team fight,
but it'll allow you to have your teleport

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.930
available sooner than before. This is why
I think that it may become one of the best

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.700
options when playing against a split pusher
as well. However, since the cooldown will

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.450
be longer when you choose to teleport to a
ward for instance, joining fights for dragon

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.310
or baron or even ganking bottom lane may not
be as rewarding.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.629
Using the spell while laning may also end
up in it's cancellation, so laning against

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.739
an opponent with crowd control may be one
of it's main dangers.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.069
Cleanse was also slightly buffed. If you successfully
cleanse an effect that prevents you from moving,

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.510
you'll now create a shockwave that knocks
nearby enemies back. It now provides means

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.639
to not only remove a crowd control effect
from you, but it may also be used to cancel

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.760
or interrupt skills like Zac's elastic slingshot.
Have you ever noticed the amount of cancels

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.069
you can pull off with Thresh's Flay? Yep,
this can work as something similar. While

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.209
I'm huge fan of knock ups and knock backs,
I can't help but think what vayne players

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.059
will be able to pull off now that they have
an extra disengaging tool at their disposal.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:14.290
Boy is this list long. Surprise! Smite has
also been changed! It's cooldown was actually

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.049
reduced to 40 seconds and it now deals less
damage in early character levels, but it'll

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.850
deal the same damage at level 18. Why, you
may ask? I'm thinking the lower cooldown on

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.180
smite actually helps champions that need it
more often in order to maintain a good clear

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.140
speed thus resulting in a greater champion
pool available to every jungler. This may

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.490
also change the dynamics of Dragon and Baron
fights or even counter-jungling.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.740
Believe or not, back in Season 1 it was actually
quite normal to see jungle evelyns take Revive.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.010
However, it slowly died out and stopped being
used in Summoner's Rift from Season 2 onwards.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.830
This actually lead Riot to remove the summoner
spell from the Summoner's Rift entirely, making

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.660
it a Dominion-only option. Clarity was also
considered one of the most underwhelming spells

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.120
in Summoner's Rift, so it is now a Howling
Abyss-only option.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.820
As I was writing the script for this video,
I was thinking to myself: there are a lot

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.980
of decent options here! And I do think that
Riot has done a great job of making most summoner

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.420
spells viable. If their intention was to open
up options to every League of Legends player,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.100
I think they totally nailed it. Flash remains
untouched, and will probably still be one

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.880
of the top summoner spell picks. However,
Ghost is now a pretty decent alternative to

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.000
gap closing and escaping. It will, however,
depend on what enemies you're playing against.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.090
Time will tell if it's just not too good.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.780
Supports also have a lot of options here.
Flash remains one of the best summoner spells

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.530
to get, but Heal seems to have hit the sweet
spot as well. I do think that most supports

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.020
will still pick Flash over Ghost, but I can
see a few situations where Ghost may be the

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.150
better option.
Ignite will probably still be the best choice

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.110
for kill lanes, Heal will be providing a safer
laning phase and Exhaust can also be picked

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.000
up when facing slippery champions.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.060
With the introduction of Scrying Orb, I feel
like Clairvoyance is now somewhat redundant

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.310
as well. You can cast it where you please,
and it lasts for a longer period of time than

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.050
the Orb. It has a short cooldown, so if you're
looking for some extra vision over the enemy

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.051
team, you may want to consider taking it as
your second summoner spell. However, if you

00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:20.700
do so, remember that both your laning phase
and team fight utility will be lacking because

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.800
of it. Make sure to pick it up when you're
absolutely sure you're going to need it.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.310
If you like the changes, if you think you'll
be able to use them in a way that I didn't

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.380
mention, or if you have anything to say at
all, feel free to use the comment section

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.550
down below! I look forward to hear what you
guys have to say about these changes!

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.380
That is all for this episode of first impressions!
I know I usually mention my stream at the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.080
end of every video, but it'd mean a lot to
me if you guys could follow it and tune in

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.740
every once in a while! It would really help
me out. I'll leave a link in the description

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.040
as well. Maybe I'm even streaming right now!
As always, don't forget to thumbs up, to subscribe

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.970
to my channel and base desire's channel, and
to follow me on facebook and twitter! So good

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:23.910
luck, have fun and until next video!
