00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.680
Dr. Nate Storey: This is a special piece of
fabric called a wicking strip.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.310
It's a kind of felt and we use it inside of
our matrix media inserts.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.870
What this felt does is it goes between the
two pieces of the insert and it helps wick

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.730
water down through the tower and out to the
roots of the seedling.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.980
To place the wicking strip in the matrix media,
we will identify what will be the front of

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.900
the media and what will be the back.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.980
Then we take the sicking strip and we put
it down in the crotch of the media where the

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.870
media will be bending.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.930
You can see where that is with this piece
of media is.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.430
We have a full piece of media.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310
It's folded at the bottom.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.510
This is the crotch at the very bottom.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510
We're going to place the media about an inch
from the front.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.940
You can place it at one-half inch to one inch
from the very front of this media.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.470
There should be excess sticking out in the
back, back there.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.190
There should be extra wicking strip out the
back.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.189
What that's going to do is it's going to fold
over once it goes in and it's going to help

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.820
capture more water.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.860
We put the wicking strip in like this and
then we fold the media in half so that it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.200
looks like that basically.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.409
There will typically just be a little bit
of extra on the top here.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.290
It should match fairly evenly with the top
of the media.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.820
If there's a little extra on top, that's absolutely
fine.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.300
The front should be free and clear.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.510
That media should be back in there.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.470
Once the media is in there, when we plant
these, we're going to plant it so that the

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.580
very tip, only the tip of this plug is touching
the wicking strip.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.810
Usually these will go in at a slight angle,
these plus.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.880
If you look very closely, you'll see that
just the tip of that plug is touching the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.850
wicking strip.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.200
This is a special felt material.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.880
It's made from polyester and it basically
helps wick water down through the media to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.280
the plant roots.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.369
It helps make sure that those plants stay
nice and moist even on really low volume drippers.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
When we're using these in very low volume
applications, using this wicking strip, make

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.159
sure that the plant roots are getting enough
water at any given time.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.439
Wicking strip is an absolute must in hydroponic
systems because you're using lower water volumes

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.989
and just because of the application itself,
because there aren't a whole lot of solids

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.790
to accumulate in the media.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.299
You have to use wicking strip the first time
you plant your hydroponic crop.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.189
In aquaponic systems or systems with lots
of solids loading, that's not always necessary.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.919
In fact, in hydroponic systems, once you've
done two or three crops, you can actually

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.269
eliminate the wicking strip if you want to.

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.430
The solids that have accumulated, the plant
roots, the other debris in the media itself

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.869
will function as a wicking strip.
