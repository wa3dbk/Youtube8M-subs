00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.209
Today we're going to take a look at the ThL
W200S from PandaWill.

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.209
It comes in a standard white box, with the
specifications listed on the back.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.980
This phone is currently $199 on PandaWill's
website, a link will be in the video description.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.900
It's powered by the MTK6592 processor, octa-core, clocked at 1.7GHz,

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.580
which means this device should be super fast.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.329
So here is the device itself.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.500
As you can probably tell already, it looks
exactly like the ThL W200, which is exactly

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.500
what it is. It's just a refined version with
newer specs and slightly better.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.109
So we're going to power it up right away.
You can see ThL's logo.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:03.109
And it's already on, we'll unlock it and clear
the notification.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.460
You get a free screen protector with this
phone. Although you shouldn't need it because

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.350
the display does have Corning Gorilla Glass
3.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.740
You also get a PandaWill quick start guide,
if you buy the phone from PandaWill.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.970
It shows you how to get started quickly.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.460
You also get a quick start guide from ThL.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.119
As you can see, there is a lot of reading.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.479
Next up we have a case, snap on case. Looks
a little cheap but you know, it's included

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.630
with the phone and if you just want something
simple to protect the device it's great for that.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.390
And it doesn't really add to much thickness.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.729
BTW, this phone is 9.4mm thick.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.579
It really doesn't add that much thickness,
and it'll protect the device.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.049
So if you're interested in cases, keep in
mind that you do get one included.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:09.900
And next up we have a wall wart power adapter.
You also get a US adapter, if you're in the United States.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.360
Let me show you that real quick.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.360
You just plug this into your US adapter, and
then put it into the wall.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.410
Next up we have some ear buds. You can plug
these into the 3.5mm headphone jack.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.949
Finally we do have a USB sync cable. You can
plug this into the wall wart, or your computer,

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.889
if you want to transfer files.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.519
Now that we have fully unboxed this phone,
let's take a look at it.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.519
Okay, so as I mentioned before, this phone
is powered by the MTK6592 octa-core chip @1.7GHz.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:56.419
That's a huge bump up from the MKT6589 chip
that was found in the W200.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:02.600
That alone should make the phone nearly twice
as fast as what the ThL W200 was.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.000
So let's go into the settings and see what
this is running.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is nearly stock, however it does have
a few customize icons, and just a few UI tweaks,

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.459
not too bad.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.320
But there are some minor UI tweaks. So we
can see we have Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.699
You can also see that the phone has 1GB of
onboard RAM, this is not a bump up from the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.699
ThL W200.

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.199
But it should be noted that 1GB of RAM is
plenty for most people.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:40.199
The CPU is obviously octa-core, as mentioned
before. You also get 32GB onboard storage.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.900
That is up from the ThL W200.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.510
As you can see, we have 22.11GB available.
This phone is advertised to come with 32GB.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.010
However, if that is not enough for you, you
can easily expand it with the micro-SD card

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.880
expansion slot.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.800
The display is 1280 by 720, that's 5 inch
again, and we have buttons on the bottom bezel here,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.389
home, menu and back.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.300
On the right hand side we have a power button,
and on the left hand side we have a volume rocker.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.590
 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.199
And one the very top we have micro USB and
headphone jack.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.040
That's going to do it for the ThL W200S unboxing
&amp; first impressions.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.840
Hope you like this video. If you did, make
