hey everyone this is Mei Yu the creator
of fun2draw today it's going to be fun

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.599
to draw a nice cool smoothie and this
is part of my fun2draw summer

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.599
playlist the link to that is at the end of
this video

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
first I'll start off with

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.580
horizontal line like that and on this
side

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.720
I'll draw a small curve like that

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
I'm going to go up

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.820
curve the other way and now basically I
just want to draw a nice wavy line this

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.820
and this is going to be

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.170
this is going to be the top part of the
smoothing this is where some of that

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.480
yummy goodness dream

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.210
over the edge of the glass well made
some some of the drips larger than the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
others

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.140
yeah

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
there's a highlight

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.530
yeah

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.970
all right as for the actual cup or glass

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.740
I'll draw a straight line going down but
it's going down at an angle on to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.140
another line going down like this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.350
and for the bottom part of the glass

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.650
I'll keep it to a curved to make a look
ready

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.690
draw another curved line

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.040
and for the top part of the drawing

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.450
I'll make one big curve

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.630
so this is going to be scrumptious
strawberry and I'm drawing the seeds

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.630
kind of like little raindrop shapes

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.860
just a few

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.659
yeah

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.840
one more

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
strawberry

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.910
ok

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.910
yeah

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.840
and I'll draw a little bit of the green
top

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.620
yeah

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.440
yeah

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.800
for the straw i'm going to draw a really
long skinny rectangle with a curved in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.270
and for fun let's make the strong look
cool with strips you can see the stripes

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.480
are also curved to that makes the
stronger more three

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.060
ok for the actual face let's draw a nice
smile at the bottom like that and this

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.580
guy's gonna be running so i summarize
the teeth by drawing a small little line

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:11.720
inside big cheek curves and I draw one
Fun2draw eye on top of each curve the first

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.310
line

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.970
for the eye

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.690
the second one so that forms the leaf
shape internal one worker

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.080
so now we have the side of the eye and
make sure this part is all nice and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.210

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.200

curve in there

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.140
