00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.870
We'll focus on how to draw fruit.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.039
Of course, there are many different types
of fruit one can draw; I'm going to focus

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.670
on an apple.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.630
When I look at an
apple, what I'm seeing initially is an oval-type

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.630
form.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.060
I'm using vine charcoal, and I'm going to
first draw this basic form,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.250
again, just an oval, just to see that initial
shape in.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.809
I'm going to really
focus on 2 things: I'm going to put in a circle

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.910
right at the top where the
apple core will at some point go.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.219
Now I'm going to focus a little more on
the outside lines of the apple.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.810
It is oval-shaped, but there are more
specific shapes going on.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.719
I'm just going to look at each little area.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.430
I realize that this line here comes to a point
slightly, then it follows

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.200
the oval, then it comes in slightly.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.760
Then I'll look at the other side.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.610
Doesn't mean that both sides are the same,
exact.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.610
As long as I'm really,
really looking at the apple, I get all of

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.090
my information, what it should
look like.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.030
The bottom, as many apples do, has this little
curve.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.250
That's the shape of
my apple.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.430
I'm going to take my eraser, or my finger,
and just rub out that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.140
initial oval.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.640
Now I have the actual lines of the apple,
which are slightly

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.040
more detailed.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.720
If I want, I can take my eraser, just so that
what's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.280
leftover are these specific lines of the apple.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.680
Your apple that you're
looking at will most likely look different

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.210
than this apple.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.590
Although this
is a base, you really want to focus on the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.030
apple that's in front of you,
and to really follow those lines.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.140
We're going to look at the core now.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.390
I'm just going to shade out the circle
that I drew.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.250
I can allow some of the shading to still shine
through.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.951
A lot
of people will draw an apple like this, that's

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:21.700
not necessarily an apple.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.480
What we're going to really look at is the
exact shape of the apple core.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.530
There's this little curve, and then it comes
up, almost like a straight

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.880
line but there's a little curve to it.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.530
The other side comes in and out, and
then it meets at the top.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.150
I'm going to erase inside of this little core
just because we don't want to see any lines

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.590
coming through it.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.650
My last step is I'm going to just add a little
bit of shading.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.430
I'm going to
use the side of the charcoal.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.880
You can practice on the side of your paper.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.960
The side of the charcoal, rather than the
tip, covers more surface area and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.209
it's a very expressive way to move through
your drawing.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.569
I'm going to look
at my apple and find the areas that are darker.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.040
For me, the right side of
the apple has a lot of shadow.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.110
I'm going to move through my apple using the
side of my charcoal, and blocking in the shading

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.110
that I see.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.849
There are
different areas that could still be shaded,

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.340
maybe just a little lighter,
and then areas that are shaded darker.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.170
You can play with how hard you're
pressing with your charcoal.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.209
If you want it to be darker, you'll press
harder.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.710
If you want it to be shaded, but just lighter,
you'll press softer.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.870
I'm now going to use my fingers, and I'm really
just going to start to move

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.540
that charcoal around.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.500
I like to, when I'm shading, move my finger
in a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.849
circular motion, especially with something
like an apple which is round.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.260
My
circular motion, when I'm shading, will lend

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.280
itself well to that shape.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.989
I'm
just going to start to add a little more detail.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.199
There's a nice shadow cast
on the apple.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.280
I'm going to put just a little edge of the
table in so it

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.039
feels like the apple is sitting on something.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.130
I'm going to bring in a
really dark shadow, which for me, since the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.819
light is hitting the apple on
the left, there's a shadow on the right side.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.419
Just for the sake of that drawing feeling
a little more dramatic, I'm going

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.270
to shade behind parts of the apple.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.810
I'm going to find where the lighter
areas of the apple are, and behind it, I'm

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.590
going to allow it to be dark.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.219
My
last step is I'm going to take my eraser,

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:09.729
regular eraser from a pencil, and
I'm going to erase into my apple, to really

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.120
bring out those lighter areas.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.419
Anywhere where the light is hitting, if you
see a little bit of a highlight

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.900
on your apple, you can bring in and use your
eraser to just pull out some

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.080
of those lighter areas.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.030
Most importantly, you really want to enjoy
the process.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.699
A lot of people,
when drawing, feel like they want to create

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.849
a perfect drawing in about 2
minutes or less.

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.259
It's not so realistic, and then it's not enjoyable.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.300
You
really want to give yourself the time and

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.909
space to enjoy drawing whichever
fruit you're drawing, and set aside some time

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:54.560
so that the whole process can
be relaxing, so you can really express yourself.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.559
I'm just adding some
finishing touches, and soon, my apple is finished.
