00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:01.900
(squeaking)

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.967
(pop)

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.933
(♪♪♪)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Basket weaving is almost as
old as the history of man.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.600
Remnants of baskets have been
found in the Egyptian pyramids

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.467
and traces of baskets were
often found inside

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:20.800
fragments of ancient pottery.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.733
Baskets have been used
as containers

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.367
for everything imaginable,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:26.767
long before the invention
of Tupperware.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:29.833
Modern day basket makers
use exciting materials

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:33.300
for weaving,
from plastics, papers, wire,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.400
and even recycled materials

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
like strips from old jeans
or t-shirts, grocery bags,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.900
or wrapping paper.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.067
As long as you start
with a sturdy framework,

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:43.367
many materials can be
interwoven with

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:47.367
traditional materials,
such as flat and round reeds.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.767
Natural reeds need to be
soaked in water

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:52.000
in order for them
to become flexible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.333
I've cut five 12 inch long
spokes out of flat reed

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.667
to begin my basket.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.033
They've been soaking in water
so they're very flexible.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.000
After marking the centre,
I secured them,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.667
I just pushed a grip pin
right through the middle.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.933
One of the spokes needs to be
split in half so that we have

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:16.133
an odd number of spokes
for our basket.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.800
Scissors will split that spoke
very easily

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.067
because it's very flexible.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:25.900
So at this point
I'm going to pull these out

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.533
so that they look like the
spokes on a wagon wheel,

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.933
and I'm going to begin
my weaving by twining.

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.233
This is hemp cord.

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:40.167
I'm going to start by
just tying it onto a spoke.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:53.433
And we'll start by
weaving just under and over,

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.833
alternating each spoke.

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.633
The term twining comes from
the practice of using twine

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:04.467
to fill these small openings at
the centre of the basket base,

00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:07.133
and this just helps
to make it extra sturdy.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.933
I'm just going over and under.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:15.933
You're going to want to push
these in nice and tightly,

00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.967
as tightly as you can.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.333
Even though right now it looks
a little strange with that

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:24.433
spoke being cut in half,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:28.167
it won't by the time
the basket is done,

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.000
you're not going to
notice that at all.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.267
You want to do 2-3,
3-4 rows of this twining,

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:43.400
and you don't
have to use twine,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.233
you can use, this is suede
lace that was used

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.633
instead of the twine.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:58.033
You could use hemp cord, yarn,
any other smaller material.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.267
So as soon as you get to
the the point where

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:03.033
you feel like these are all
going to stay in place,

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:05.667
remove this grip pin.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.233
Pull that right out.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:08.667
And after the twining,

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.900
I have switched
to the round reed.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.100
Now this has
also been soaking,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.233
and to start the round reed,

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.433
we're just going to
push it in under a row

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:21.233
of the twine
to secure it,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.767
and do the exact same thing,
we're just going to

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:28.300
go over and under,
and over and under.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.767
As you're working
on your basket,

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.867
don't allow the reeds
to dry out too much.

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:34.567
You'll notice
a change in colour,

00:03:34.567 --> 00:03:36.067
it will lighten up.

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.467
And it's a great idea
to just soak it briefly

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:42.667
once in a while
as you're working.

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.567
Once you've done a few
rows of the round reed,

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:50.567
you can start adding
recycled materials.

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:53.967
You could use iridescent film,

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:55.033
this just comes on a roll

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.233
and we've just used it
to twist it up

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:58.533
and use it in baskets,

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:01.167
strips of paper,
plastic grocery bags,

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:03.133
recycled materials
and round reed

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:06.600
then can be alternated to create
the body of the basket.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800
Lastly we need to
finish the basket

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.033
by creating the rim.

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:16.967
All I've done here is to cut
pieces of the soaked flat reed

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:17.800
that are just long enough to

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.400
overlap the circumference of
the basket by about an inch.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
You want to use 2-3 of these,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.900
just so that you get
a nice sturdy rim.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.433
You could use a bundle of
round reeds also for this,

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:35.900
so I've placed one in front of
and one behind of each spoke,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.233
and secured them
with a binder clip.

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:39.700
You could also use
a clothes pin

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.433
to keep them in place.

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:43.633
So then we're just
going to sew this rim on.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:44.567
You could use twine,

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.833
you could use
wax linen cord

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:51.800
with a needle, but basically
it's just over under,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.667
and if you look at some of
these baskets here

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:55.367
we've added beads for interest

00:04:55.367 --> 00:05:00.900
as we were sewing
the rim together.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.433
Over under,
and it's all very flexible

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.400
because it's nice and soaked.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.167
Now when I come to a spoke
I'm just going to go

00:05:09.167 --> 00:05:12.333
right behind it
and pull this tight.

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:18.567
Once the whole rim is sewn,

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:22.367
you can just trim off the spokes

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:26.200
that I've left up
a little bit higher here,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.233
and you'll create
your finished rim.

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:32.900
