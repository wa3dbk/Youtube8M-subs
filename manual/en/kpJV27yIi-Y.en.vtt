00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.370
Hi, I'm John Popper, lead singer of the band
Blues Traveler.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.879
I also play harmonica, and am arguably one
of the best in the world.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:16.160
But thank God, there really never can be an
actual best, but I'm damn good.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.240
I'm gonna teach you a few things about the
harmonica.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.240
Soloing is really about confidence and taking
charge of a phrase.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.820
It's important to not see it as a harmonica
thing.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.750
It's important to see it as a musical thing.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.230
People always see the difference between a
harmonica and a saxophone.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.230
There isn't one.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.590
It's just different manipulations to make
the same kind of sound.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.460
You want to make a statement.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.860
And, in fact, a good exercise that a lot of
soloists do is sing your solo.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.660
If you can sing it, you can ultimately play
it.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.660
Might take a little work to get there, but
the important thing is to have the idea of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.940
the solo.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.579
You can learn all kinds of chops on this instrument,
or any other instrument.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
But if you aren't thinking it, you won't say
it.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.970
We had, again, that saxaphone teacher I was
talking about.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.410
He had a great exercise for it.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.540
He would make us play a joke.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.250
And I don't mean we would play a joke on someone.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.330
We would actually musically tell a joke.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.599
It was the joke of the plumber and the parrot.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.781
Where the plumber's knocking on the door,
and the lady was out.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.420
And the parrot goes, who is it?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.860
The guy goes, it's the plumber.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.369
And the parrot goes, who is it?

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.290
And the guy goes, it's the plumber.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.880
And the parrot goes, who is it?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.890
And the guy goes, it's the plumber!

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.750
And the parrot goes, who is it?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.770
And the guy goes, it's the plumber!

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.140
And eventually he has a heart attack, and
drops over dead right there.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.390
And the lady comes back from shopping, and
goes, my God, who's that?

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.390
And the parrot goes, it's the plumber.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.850
And that's, like an old joke.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.700
The trombone was the parrot, the saxophone
got to be the plumber.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.040
And I got to be the lady going, my God, who's
that?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.879
And, um, you would play the phrase of, iii.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.140
You play the frustration.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.310
You really try and look at the phrase of what
you're saying.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.690
I think that's more important than any rudiment
that you could learn.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.130
'Cause if you learn the phrase, just like
learning a language.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.130
That's really what music is.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.700
It's another language.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.010
If you learn to say what you're saying, you
will figure out all kinds of interesting and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.610
unique ways to say it.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.530
You'll be instantly original that way.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.070
Try and have an idea to say, and you will
always find a new way to say it.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.830
The way that I'm talking to the camera right
now is just like playing a solo.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.750
I'm soloing right now.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.980
I'm be-boppin' my butt off, baby.
