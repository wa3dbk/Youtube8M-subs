00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.860
While Rafa Nadal was busy pulling out of the
Australian Open, we were compiling the latest

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.049
and greatest stories from around the tennis
world.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.860
Hey Tennis Fans, I’m Blair Henley and welcome
to the Tennis Now News Update.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.440
Yes, it’s true.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640
Thanks to a lingering stomach virus, Nadal
says he is unfit to play in the Australian

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.270
Open which, we should note, doesn’t start
for another 18 days.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.070
He had this to say about the withdrawal:
"My knee is much better and the rehabilitation

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
process has gone well as predicted by the
doctors, but this virus didn't allow me to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.550
practice this past week and therefore I am
sorry to announce that I will not play in

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.760
Doha and the Australian Open, as we had initially
scheduled."

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.579
The illness also forced Nadal to pull out
of a lucrative exhibition tournament in Abu

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.100
Dhabi this week.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.290
Andy Murray was there, and though he seemed
to be the picture of health, his 6-3, 6-4

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.780
first round loss to Janko Tipsarevic didn’t
inspire much confidence in his play.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.329
Murray says he has “some things to work
on in the next few weeks.”

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.269
Serena Williams pulled out of an exhibition
match against Victoria Azarenka set for December

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.090
29th in Thailand because of a procedure on
both of her big toes.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.030
While we don’t know the severity of the
issue, or if it had anything to do with the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.580
toe injury that kept her out of competition
for nearly a year, we do know that it wasn’t

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.710
painful enough to prevent some snorkeling
action with her coach and boyfriend Patrick

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.710
Mouratoglou.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.030
The two seem to be getting along swimmingly.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.170
Apparently a little saltwater does a body
good, as Williams is reportedly ready to go

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.100
for the first WTA tournament of the year in
Brisbane.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.740
We hear she landed in Queensland, Australia
just before Caroline Wozniacki and her ubiquitous

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.530
other half, golfer Rory McIlroy.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.910
Their arrival sparked a media frenzy due to
the diamond sparkler spotted on Caro’s left

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.910
hand.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.079
As you might imagine, engagement rumors are
currently swirling around the young couple.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.420
Daniela Hantuchova arrived in Australia early
enough to get some private surfing lessons

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.369
from Australian pro Julian Wilson.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.560
While she didn’t manage to stand up on her
board, the photos indicate that the former

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.450
top five player enjoyed her little respite
from the world of tennis.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840
Play in Brisbane begins on December 30.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.039
And, because your day would not be complete
without one more picture of a WTA player frolicking

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.590
in the ocean, we give you some Jet Ski action
shots from Victoria Azarenka and, wait for

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.870
it, RedFoo!

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.920
The two were clearly soaking in their time
in Thailand ahead of Azarenka’s exhibition

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.470
match in Hua Hin.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.409
The 37-year-old Sexy and I Know It singer
reportedly played on the junior USTA and ITF

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.700
circuits before deciding to pursue a music
career.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.319
He and Azarenka have spent lots of time together
over the past several months, though no romantic

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.739
relationship has been confirmed.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.420
That’s all for today’s Tennis Now News
Update!

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.299
What do you think about Rafa’s Aussie Open
withdrawal?

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.970
Legitimate or not?

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.659
Let us know in the comment section below or
on Facebook and Twitter.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.659
