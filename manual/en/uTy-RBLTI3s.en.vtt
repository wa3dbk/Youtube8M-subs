00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.930
So this is a lovely garden in University Park,
it's between the library -- the Hallward Library

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.050
and the Sir Clive Grainger building.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.450
It's a very nice place to just come and relax
and just get out of the office for a while.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.820
First of all my dad is in the banking sector,
so maybe Dad led me to do Economics.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.980
But generally I think I was always interested
in what's happening in the world.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.739
I think a good way of understanding what's
going on is doing economics.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.920
Like the economics behind politics for example.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.370
What decision do you take, what -- why does
this country do A, why does this other country

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.020
do B. So that's the main underlying reason
I think.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.440
So previously I studied in Belgium and after
that, after a Masters in Belgium, I wanted

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.660
to broaden my knowledge in economics and also
together with an international experience.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.039
So I asked my professor there, my advisor
there, what I should do and he advised me

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:07.100
actually to come to the University of Nottingham.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.490
Because he already knew somebody who did economics
here and he had a good experience.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
Because Nottingham is quite a well-known University,
a lot of well-known academics come here to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.420
present their work

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.751
Every week during the semester there are a
lot of seminars, but also if you want to go

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:27.400
to other universities to go for a workshop
or a seminar or even a summer school, there's

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.799
a lot of opportunities to do that.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.840
Within the UK it's a very vibrant place to
be for a PhD.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.810
So sometimes the PhD could be a lonely thing
to do because writing up, doing research,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.790
data analysis is just you and the computer.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.829
So it's very nice that you get assigned an
office with other, fellow PhD students and

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.829
you can talk to them.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:49.829
You can ask advice.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.200
If you don't understand something, you can
discuss it with each other.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.479
So that's also something I really like as
a teaching part.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:03.090
So I'm also a GTA, a Graduate Teaching Assistant
and I already taught undergrads in the first

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.090
year and second year.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.140
So introductory course in micro-economics
and macro-economics.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.640
And also macro-economic theory.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.239
That's really nice because actually you get
contact with the students, you get to know

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.790
them.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.150
It really reminds you of how it was when you
were there.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.989
And also, while you are teaching, you really
learn the stuff still.

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.310
So, yeah, that's a great opportunity.
