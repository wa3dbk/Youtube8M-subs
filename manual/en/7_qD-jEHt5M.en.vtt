{textColor:65280,65280,65280}{width:960}{justify:center}

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.360
{plain}

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.310
[00:00:00.61]
Our Products section of the Web site

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640
has a series of somewhat static pages.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.449
[00:00:05.13]
There is a bunch of text on these pages

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.199
and there's an image associated

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.060
[00:00:09.25]
with that particular block of text.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.910
[00:00:11.29]
We can go and we can click through all

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.780
of these and you'll see there are just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.239
[00:00:15.61]
lots and lots of images, there are

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.820
little bits of text here and there.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.410
[00:00:19.11]
What I'd like to do is I'd like to

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.650
improve the look of these pages

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.570
[00:00:23.61]
by adding a little bit of style, a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.000
little pizzazz to the images themselves.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.770
[00:00:27.43]
This is new in Joomla!.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.960
Because this version of Joomla!

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.800
[00:00:32.00]
is built with Bootstrap and because

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.950
this template is integrating Bootstrap

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
[00:00:36.00]
as part of its design, we can leverage

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.380
any of Bootstrap's classes that are

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.580
[00:00:42.20]
contained, and provided that we apply

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.379
that class in the way the Bootstrap

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380
[00:00:46.40]
is expecting, we can apply

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.020
those styles to our Web pages.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.890
[00:00:49.87]
One of the most striking ways that we can

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.369
do this is where our images are concerned.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.579
[00:00:54.73]
So right now these images are just square

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.159
images that have come right down and out

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.159
[00:00:59.75]
of Photoshop and they are

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.030
appearing here in our Web page.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.930
[00:01:02.25]
But Bootstrap has three

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.310
different ways you can style images.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.180
[00:01:06.51]
And that is in the Bootstrap documentation,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.640
so if you go to getbootstrap.com,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.539
[00:01:12.31]
you'll wind up on this home page.

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.119
[00:01:14.56]
And if you go to the base CSS navigation

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.950
item and then click on images down here,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.679
[00:01:20.39]
you'll wind up seeing a little

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.829
demonstration of the way that Bootstrap

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.549
[00:01:25.84]
can style these images for you.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.270
[00:01:27.69]
So by applying a class of img-rounded

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.579
you will get rounded corners on the edges

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.640
[00:01:34.49]
of your image, and that class

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.450
you have to apply to the image tag.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.590
[00:01:38.64]
If you have img-circle applied to the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.600
image tag, you'll actually get your image

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.109
[00:01:43.60]
displayed in a circle.

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.400
[00:01:45.17]
And finally if you apply a class of img-

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.509
polaroid, you'll get your image with a

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.630
[00:01:50.65]
nice little border around it and this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.790
little space in between is a white fill.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.780
[00:01:55.09]
Not necessarily obvious here on a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.129
white background, but I have looked at this

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.330
[00:01:59.20]
effect on pages where the background was

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.709
not white and that will be a white wrap

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.540
[00:02:03.81]
around that picture followed by

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.689
the little gray border after that.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.930
[00:02:07.80]
So I want to show you how we can apply these

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.599
three classes to our images inside of Joomla!.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.129
[00:02:13.18]
So here in the back end of Joomla!

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.010
[00:02:16.33]
I'm going to go to Content&gt;Article Manager

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.010
and I am just going to work with

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.939
[00:02:22.46]
my Products, Articles right now so I am

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.939
going to Filter by category and go to

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.180
[00:02:26.21]
Products and here are my Products

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.879
pages for this particular Web site.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.860
[00:02:30.05]
So let's say I start here with the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.970
Energy Bulbs, if I click on that, I have

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.220
[00:02:35.05]
this picture of this woman here who is

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.510
looking at light bulbs at the store.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.940
[00:02:39.12]
What I really need to do is click on the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.550
image itself to select it and then here

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.659
[00:02:44.25]
using the little tree icon here in

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.000
TinyMCE if I click on that, this will allow

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.350
[00:02:50.08]
me to apply the class that I want to apply.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.549
[00:02:52.83]
I've not shown you how to use this for

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.370
inserting images because it doesn't have

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.219
[00:02:56.34]
an interface for uploading images into

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.480
the Media Manager and you have to know

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.049
[00:03:00.68]
the URL for the image in order to

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.300
include it in your Webpage,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.500
[00:03:04.43]
which is definitely less convenient than the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.650
Image button at the bottom of the screen

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.939
[00:03:07.86]
which is what we've been using

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.780
to work with images to this point.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.409
[00:03:11.20]
However, this tree icon has the interface

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.760
for putting a class inside of an image tag

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.120
[00:03:16.36]
and that is what

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.560
we're going to do right now.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.620
[00:03:19.79]
So if I switch over to the Appearance

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.620
tab here for our pictures, here is where

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.689
[00:03:24.66]
I can apply my Class, this is the CSS

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.810
Class and right now it's set to Not Set.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.170
[00:03:30.10]
So what I want to do is pick value from right

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.799
here which will allow me to type something
in.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.080
[00:03:36.13]
So if I type in img-rounded no dot in

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.890
front of it and say Update, absolutely

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.940
[00:03:42.81]
nothing is going to happen in TinyMCE.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.450
[00:03:45.51]
The reason why is TinyMCE is currently

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.760
not hooked up to any of our Bootstrap

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.819
[00:03:50.54]
styling, so it's not going to

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.640
show right here inside of TinyMCE.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.280
[00:03:55.19]
One of the advanced things you could

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.489
do with TinyMCE is have it pull

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.489
[00:03:59.46]
a stylesheet, may be that stylesheet

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.411
contains these three image classes in it,

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:23.490
[00:04:04.62]
so that you could just pick

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.490
them from the dropdown.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.821
[00:04:06.48]
That would be a great way to

00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:26.850
handle this for your client.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.530
[00:04:09.48]
But you're not going to see the styling

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.530
here inside of TinyMCE at the moment

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.100
[00:04:14.03]
because TinyMCE doesn't know what img-rounded

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.210
happens to do with this particular image.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.800
[00:04:20.32]
But once we hit Save and we go to the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.250
front end of the Web site and we go to the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.130
[00:04:26.49]
Energy Bulbs page, you'll see that we

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.250
now have an image with rounded corners.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.600
[00:04:30.73]
So that's quite nice.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.500
[00:04:32.82]
If we go to the Low-Flow Showerhead,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.280
I think this one might look good with a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.620
[00:04:36.23]
circle around it so let's hop

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.750
into the back end of Joomla!

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.080
[00:04:40.07]
now I am going to hit Save &amp; Close

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.870
and I am going to go to the Low-Flow

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.300
[00:04:44.32]
Showerhead article, once again click

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.590
on the Low-Flow Showerhead and click on

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.990
[00:04:48.49]
the tree icon here in TinyMCE,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.560
switch to the Appearance tab, in the Class

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.729
[00:04:53.47]
dropdown choose value and this time

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:14.930
for the value I am going to type in

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.570
[00:04:58.21]
img-circle and say Update.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.360
[00:05:00.71]
Again I won't see it here in TinyMCE,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.520
but if I say Save &amp; Close and I refresh

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.259
[00:05:06.71]
my Low-Flow Showerhead page, I now have

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.800
my image displayed in the circle style.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.420
[00:05:12.09]
Now this particular image was a little

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.030
bit wide in terms of a rectangle,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.990
[00:05:16.52]
so it's applied the rounded corners to the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.880
edges and it looks kind of a like a oval.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.139
[00:05:20.18]
But I have another page where this

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.669
particular circle works really well,

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.000
[00:05:23.88]
it's over on the About page, this

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.840
particular image is sized more like a square

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.639
[00:05:29.58]
and when you apply the circle

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.960
style to it, it looks really good.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.919
[00:05:33.05]
So if I do that now and I go to my

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.430
About Articles and I click on the About

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.879
[00:05:40.38]
article and I click on this image and

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.810
I click on the tree, click on Appearance,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.289
[00:05:46.14]
click on value here in the Class dropdown

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.740
and type in img-circle and say Update

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.730
[00:05:51.91]
and Save &amp; Close, here on the About page

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.990
you'll get a sense of a real circle for

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.220
[00:05:56.85]
this particular image.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.710
[00:05:57.85]
So let me show you what

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.161
the Polaroid effect does now.

00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.410
[00:06:01.29]
So let's go to the Products page and

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.240
you see here we have this picture of this

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.449
[00:06:06.14]
girl holding a light bulb, I am going

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.750
to go back to my back-end of Joomla!,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.600
[00:06:10.86]
go back to my Products and click on

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.740
the actual Products page itself.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.230
[00:06:17.35]
I'm going to select this image right

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.940
here inside of my editor, click on the

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.009
[00:06:22.15]
tree icon and under Appearance, under

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.949
Class, under value I'm going to type in

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:52.180
[00:06:28.35]
img-polaroid and say Update, and Save &amp; Close.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.470
[00:06:34.81]
And when I refresh the Products page

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.880
here you'll see that we have this lovely

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.409
[00:06:38.78]
Polaroid effect, so you have the

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.400
little bit of white space here with the nice

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.740
[00:06:43.14]
little border around it.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.729
[00:06:44.39]
Now I wouldn't necessarily advise you

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.630
to use all three effects all over every

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.630
[00:06:48.20]
page of your Web site.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.300
[00:06:50.00]
I would recommend that you would pick

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.130
one of these effects maybe, and use it

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.169
[00:06:53.60]
consistently or maybe two of these effects.

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.340
[00:06:56.43]
So like the circle effect is really

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.510
quite eye-popping, maybe you want to use

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.229
[00:07:00.71]
that sparingly on a handful of pages

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:22.120
and then every other image on your site

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.449
[00:07:04.46]
maybe you treat with the Polaroid or

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.879
the rounded corner effect, that would be a

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.270
[00:07:08.01]
nice treatment for your Web site, rather

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.870
than just sort of sprinkling these three

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.669
[00:07:11.78]
effects anywhere they happen to appear.

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.870
[00:07:13.90]
But I did want to show you how all of them

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.870
work.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.530
[00:07:15.87]
So if you remember from Bootstrap in

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.280
the documentation, img-rounded, img-circle

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.009
[00:07:19.83]
and img-polaroid, you can add those to

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.539
your image tags inside of your HTML and

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:52.880
[00:07:27.34]
get some great effects for your Web site.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.729
[00:07:31.40]
