"Gluten-Free Diets: 
Separating the Wheat from the Chat"

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.105
Until only a few years ago, almost 
the whole of the scientific world

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.004
maintained that the wheat protein gluten
would provoke negative effects

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.871
only in people with rare conditions such 
as celiac disease or wheat allergies,

00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.905
but by the early part of 2013, 
it was largely becoming accepted

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:29.970
that some nonceliac patients could suffer 
from gluten or wheat sensitivity.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.970
And indeed a consensus panel of 
experts now officially recognizes

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:39.239
three gluten-related conditions, wheat allergy, 
celiac disease, and gluten sensitivity.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.504
So what percent of the population 
should avoid wheat?

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:50.187
Although 1 in a thousand may have a wheat allergy, 
nearly 1 in a 100 may have celiac disease,

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:58.430
and it appears to be on the rise, though there’s 
still less than about 1 in 10,000 chance

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.740
Americans will get diagnosed 
with celiac in a given year.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.897
How common is wheat sensitivity?

00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:12.584
Our best estimate at this point is in that same 
kind of general range, slightly higher than 1%,

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:18.432
but still that’s potentially millions of 
people who may have been suffering for years

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.831
who could have been cured 
by simple dietary means,

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:27.260
yet went unrecognized and unhelped 
by the medical profession.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.594
Although gluten sensitivity continues 
to gain medical credibility,

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.827
we still don’t know how it works, or 
how much gluten can be tolerated,

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.325
if it’s reversible or not and what 
the long-term complications

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:40.160
might be of not sticking to the diet.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.820
Considering the lack of knowledge, 
maybe people with gluten sensitivity

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:47.090
should be trying to reintroduce gluten 
back into their diet every year

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:50.020
to see if it’s still causing problems.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:53.250
The reason health professionals don’t 
want to see people on gluten-free diets

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.510
unless absolutely necessary is 
that for the 98% of people

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.670
people that don’t have 
gluten issues, whole grains—

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.040
including the gluten grains - 
wheat, barley and rye—

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.100
are health promoting, linked 
to the reduced risk of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.500
coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, 
obesity and other chronic diseases.

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:14.680
Just like, because some
people have a peanut allergy,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.300
doesn’t mean that everyone 
should avoid peanuts.

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.730
There is no evidence to suggest 
that following a gluten-free diet

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:25.590
has any significant benefits 
in the general population.

00:02:25.596 --> 00:02:30.380
Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that 
a gluten-free diet may adversely affect

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:34.950
gut health in those without celiac disease 
or gluten sensitivity or allergy.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.420
They’re talking about this study that 
found that a month on a gluten-free diet

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780
may hurt our gut flora 
and immune function,

00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:45.710
potentially setting those on gluten-free 
diets up for an overgrowth

00:02:45.714 --> 00:02:49.380
of harmful bacteria in 
their intestines. Why?

00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:53.180
Because, ironically, of the beneficial 
effects of the very components

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:57.380
wheat sensitive people have problems 
with—like the FODMAP fructans

00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:59.500
that act as prebiotics and 
feed our good bacteria,

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.400
or the gluten itself, 
which may boost immune function.

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:09.280
Less than a week of added gluten protein significantly 
increases natural killer cell activity,

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:14.670
which could be expected to improve our body’s 
ability to fight cancer and viral infections.

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.540
High gluten bread improves 
triglyceride levels better

00:03:18.547 --> 00:03:22.860
than regular gluten bread, 
as another example.

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:30.300
Ironically, one of the greatest threats of 
gluten-free diets may be the gluten itself.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.730
Self-prescription of a gluten-free diet may 
undermine our ability to pick up celiac disease,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.690
the much more serious form 
of gluten intolerance.

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:41.110
The way we diagnose celiac is 
by looking for the inflammation

00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:43.620
caused by gluten in 
celiac sufferers,

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:47.430
but if they haven’t been eating a lot 
of gluten, we might miss the disease.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.190
Hence, rather than being on 
a gluten-free diet,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.130
we want celiac suspects to be 
on a gluten-loaded diet.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.360
We’re talkin’ 4-6 slices of gluten packed bread 
a day, every day for at least a month,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.529
so we can definitively 
diagnose the disease.

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:08.530
Why does it matter so much to get a formal 
diagnosis if you’re already on a gluten-free diet?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.560
Well, it’s a genetic disease so 
you’ll know to test the family,

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:19.760
but most importantly many people on gluten-free 
diets are not actually on gluten-free diets.

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:24.320
Even 20 parts per million can be 
toxic to someone with celiac.

00:04:24.324 --> 00:04:30.360
Many on so-called gluten-free diets 
inadvertently still eat gluten.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.010
Sometimes there’s contamination 
of gluten-free products,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:39.630
so even foods labeled "gluten-free" 
may still not be safe for celiac sufferers.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.000
That’s why we need to know.

00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:48.120
The irony, editorialized in 
a prominent medical journal,

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:51.350
of many celiac patients not 
knowing their diagnosis,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.790
while millions of non-sufferers 
banish gluten from their lives,

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:59.730
can be considered a 
public health farce.
