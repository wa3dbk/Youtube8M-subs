00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.570
 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.460
 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.180
Hello everyone.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.520
So today I'm taking a look at Max The Curse of Brotherhood

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.590
on Xbox One. Now this has just been released to the Xbox store

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.820
and in essence it's a fantastic puzzle
platform game.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.320
Now the characters as it were might be
familiar if you've ever played the Wii title

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.079
Max and the Magic Marker and it's very much
using the same characters and concept but now an

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.890
exclusive Xbox One title.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.420
It will be coming to Xbox 360 later in the Max The Curse of Brotherhood

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
year but as a launch title as it were on
Xbox One

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.610
following just around a month after the
console was released and it is an

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.010
absolute stunner.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.980
It really does scale wonderfully well
and it does show off

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.810
what the XboxOne is going to be
capable of. The basic principle is this.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.050
It's a puzzle platform game so you're going to  have to scale the environment using various

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.380
objects within the environment like
vines and stones and everything like that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.200
but you also have a magic marker pen and 
this magic marker

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.640
can be used to interact with key points
around the environment, for instance

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.359
building bridges, raising platforms up to
help you reach various areas and

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:18.499
get past certain monsters as well. Now

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:22.539
there was one slightly strange thing. In
the cut scenes we did see

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.899
a bit of a drop in the frame rate almost
like a stutter going on Max The Curse of Brotherhood

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.229
but at no point did we ever see that during actual gameplay.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.710
So there's nothing here that would make
me think this game requires more

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.999
time in the oven as it were. Some of the cut
scenes like I say

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.139
slight drops in frame rate but during the
actual gameplay itself the frame rate is

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.340
solid throughout.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.490
So here you can see the magic marker being used to raise some platforms. And

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.119
again here swinging on a vine and I've got to just time things just right to get past

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.929
that monster.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.759
Now the monsters in the game are really
nicely done

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.149
they tend to be quite aggressive with
you so they're trying to kill you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.880
basically Max The Curse of Brotherhood

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
to try to stop you from rescuing your
brother and so timing becomes quite

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.619
important.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789
For instance you'll have to set off monsters then get to the other end of a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.209
section, drop a trap on them and then
move on

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.340
and there's lots of little elements like
this throughout the game which are just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.879
really good fun and some of the puzzles are
fiendish.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.189
For instance this one where I had to effectively balance a branch on some stone to then

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.569
create a bridge for myself

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.590
and it's just wonderfully well done. The game's retailing for Â£11.99 on the Xbox store

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.659
and honestly this is a title to pick up
for Christmas

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.280
without a shadow of a doubt. Kid-friendly, wonderful graphics

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.280
and really fun gameplay in Max The Curse of Brotherhood.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.579
