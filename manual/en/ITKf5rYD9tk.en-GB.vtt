00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.960
Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.800
May I welcome President Joko Widodo to Singapore on the occasion of his state visit.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.180
We have already met several times already before this since he become President,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.480
and we have got along well and we always had fruitful discussions.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.940
So, we are very happy to have President Joko with us here for his introductory visit,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.740
and to have substantial discussions on how we can take our two countries forward.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.580
Our two countries enjoy good relations,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.060
our leaders regularly visit one another,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.700
we have close partnership in many areas,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.040
in economic cooperation, in defence, and in our people to people ties.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.140
And over the years, we have seen our ties grow, broaden and strengthen.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.940
So today, I am very happy that we witnessed

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.120
the signing of MOUs in E-Government and 
Youth and Sports,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.840
because these will add more dimensions to our ties and draw us closer together.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.320
I am also happy that there is a MOU on strategic cooperation between our Chambers of Commerce.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.820
The President and I had a very good meeting this morning.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.080
We reaffirmed our commitment to strengthen our ties.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.340
We discussed how we can increase our economic cooperation,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.480
we have always been a top trading partner and invester in Indonesia.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.320
And Indonesia has always been a major destination for Singapore companies.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.400
So we agreed to work together to make it even more attractive,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.000
so that Singapore companies can take advantage of opportunities in Indonesia.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.220
For example, in Bintan, Batam and Karimun, which is a special zone,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.960
which we have had a joint cooperation project with Indonesia for many years

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.780
and we would like to enhance and build on that in order to deepen the relationship.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.120
We also talked about tourism cooperation

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.500
and how as Indonesia develops more tourism destinations and resorts,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.060
Singapore can promote with Indonesia,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.780
ourselves - as a joint destination to the two countries,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.280
and work more closely together to bring in tourists

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.840
because in Asia,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.880
the tourism flows are strong with middle-class growing everywhere, and rising income levels.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.440
We also talked about security cooperation

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.420
and exchanging information and intelligence,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.320
between our securities agencies because we are concerned with the threat from extremist terrorism.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.700
We both worry about ISIS,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.800
we both had Nationals of our countries involved in the terrorist activities, including in the Middle East.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.260
And we need to work together to develop our cooperation

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.480
between the two Governments and the security agencies.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.640
Similarly, we talked about the possibility of developing cooperation between our armed forces,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.600
because here too, we have to work together

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.100
and armed forces cooperation needs to extend beyond the top level, down through the ranks,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.920
in order that we have mutual understanding, and we have to work together, we are able to do so.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.380
The President is meeting business people this afternoon

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.660
and I am sure that the companies are looking forward to hearing directly from the President

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.560
about the investment opportunities in Indonesia

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.700
and also about the Indonesian Government's policy and approach towards bringing in investments

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.720
and encouraging infrastructure, investment, and developments in Indonesia.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.860
There is one specific project which Singapore has in Indonesia

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.800
and that is the Kendal Industrial Park, which is in Semarang,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.440
which is a joint venture project between Sembcorp and PT Jababeka.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000
And it is the Singapore's first major industrial park investment in Indonesia

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.060
outside of the Batam, Bintan and Karimun area.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.760
We have discussed this with the President, and we agreed at the good opportunity.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.780
Both of us will visit the Kendal Industrial Park

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.120
because it is a sign of our friendship, of our cooperation,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.480
and the potential for us to work more closely together for mutual benefit.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.980
So I would like to thank the President for his leadership in strengthening our ties,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.960
also for his leadership in ASEAN,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.900
in helping ASEAN to become an effective regional organisation

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
contributing to the prosperity and the stability of the region.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.520
And I look forward to many further exchanges with him

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.380
and following up on our many areas of cooperation.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.340
Thank you.
