00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.970
Today we are going to be installing hitch
part number 60873 from Hidden Hitch on a 2008

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.970
Nissan Altima.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.820
OK, the first thing we want to do is to open
up the trunk and remove the carpeting from

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.110
the trunk floor as well as any fiberboard
bins that may be located in here, as well.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.450
The first thing we want to do is to remove
the ground wire off of the exhaust here.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.840
Then, after that, we are going to come over
and unbolt the exhaust from the flange here,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.410
and remove both bolts, which is going to allow
us to take the exhaust off of the rubber isolator

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.579
hanger, which is up in here.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340
And then we want to repeat that for the other
side, as well.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.629
As you can see, I have removed the exhaust
here.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.899
We are actually looking at the drivers side,
and you can see how much room we have got

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.899
now.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.100
The next step is we want to go ahead and gently
bend the heat shield out of the way toward

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.350
the frame rail, making sure not to break it.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.220
The hitch arms are actually going to up in
between the spare tire well and the frame,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.530
up in this crease up in here.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.500
So we want to bend it back enough to ensure
that the hitch can go up in there fairly easily.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.750
And next we are going to go ahead and put
the hitch up into position, and we are going

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.890
to mark the holes so that we know where to
drill them.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.340
OK, now that we have got our holes marked,
we can go ahead and drill out our holes.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.450
I am going to start by using a 1/4-inch pilot
hole, drill those out, check my alignment

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.780
with the hitch and make sure that everything
is still aligned OK.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:47.680
Once we have checked alignment, we are going
to go ahead and then enlarge this hole to

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:59.480
7/16.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:31.390
OK, the 1/4-inch hole is drilled out.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:03:01.269
I am going to 
put 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:25.400
the hitch 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:37.040
back up here and check to make sure that our
holes align.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:49.700
OK, now I can go ahead and take the hitch
back down and drill it out to 7/16.
