Sam Hyde: TTP creates new products and new technologies for our clients

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
across the healthcare, communications, consumer and industrial space

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.500
James McCrone: TTP had created this novel micropump and we were looking for new applications of this;

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
new products that we could take this into

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Looking at the medical space, where there is a demand for more portable products

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.500
perhaps products that you can clip on your belt rather than having to wear over your shoulder

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.500
or products that enable you to get out of hospital and to carry on your daily life rather than staying in a bed in hospital

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.500
We identified an American company that we took the technology to and very soon started work with

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to engineer Disc Pump into a portable medical therapy device

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Stuart Hatfield: Disc Pump is formed broadly of three main components

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.500
The valve is the one which requires the most assembly

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.500
It involves a stack of etched layers which are assembled and then aligned and then welded together

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.500
The second component is the actuator, so that's the piezo and steel disc which provides the drive force for the pump

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
And then the third component is a simple moulded base

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.500
The pump is then assembled by essentially gluing the valve into the base

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.500
and then gluing the actuator onto a membrane and welding it onto the cavity

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
Sam Hyde: Physics is a vital part of our business

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.500
We are pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve and that requires a deep understanding of the limitations of physics

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
but also what it can do, and it's important that we understand that so that we can deploy it in developing new products

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.500
James McCrone: You often see people with devices that they've developed, where they've made one or ten

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and they feel that they've done most of the work

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Actually, they may have had most of the inspiration but most of the work is still left to do

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.500
It's about converting from that one to ten level, to being able to produce the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And that's where I think TTP actually is quite unique

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500
because we have both the ability to have these creative ideas in the first place and to create genuinely new technology

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but also the ability to go through those later stages and turn it into a commercially realised, value generating product

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
To see it coming off the production line is fantastic

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.500
At TPP we're a company full of scientists and engineers and I think most scientists and engineers

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.500
are in it because they enjoy making things and seeing things happen

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.500
and I think there's nothing more satisfying, really, than taking a technology that you've helped to create and develop

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.500
and actually seeing it being manufactured in volume

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.500
and beyond that to seeing it being used in a product that affects people's lives in a positive way

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.500
Sam Hyde: Traditionally, manufacturing of high-volume products would translate to the Far East

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But with highly automated manufacturing, such as we use for Disc Pump

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.500
it's possible to retain manufacturing in the UK and retain the skills and the value inside the UK market

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And we're very keen to manufacture our own ideas in the UK

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.000
The UK has world class universities and world class graduates, particularly in physics, but across the range of scientists

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.000
and being able to harness their skills in a commercial environment, resulting in products like Disc Pump, is hugely valuable
