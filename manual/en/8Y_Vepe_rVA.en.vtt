00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.740
Grandpa, where'd you get
that ugly mask?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.800
This mask my father gave to me
on my Day of Names...

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.300
...and I will continue
this tradition with you.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.960
- The "Day of Names"?
- We've already got names, Grandpa.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.700
Ah, you may have family names,
but not ninja names.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.700
- All right, Samuel!
- Sir!

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.380
From this day forward, until forever...

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.460
...you shall be known as "Rocky",
because you are strong, solid...

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.700
...and cool as granite rock.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.260
Awesome, yeah!

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.560
Jeffrey, ah, you are fast and free...

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.200
...spirit of the young, wild horse.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.620
You shall be known as "Colt"!

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.580
Colt?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.380
That's cool.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.520
What about me?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.880
Can I be "Monster Destroyer"?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.180
Or how about "Super Killer"?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
- How about "Super Dork"?
- Shut up, spaz.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.760
A little one...

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.160
...since your energy begins
 and ends with your tummy...

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.220
...you shall be known as "Tum Tum"!

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.720
Tum Tum?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.940
- I can't wait to show these to Dad.
- He'll hate 'em.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.540
Grandpa, will our dad be home
tomorrow when we get back?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.640
Well... he's a busy man...

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.740
...in a very troublesome job, Tum Tum.
