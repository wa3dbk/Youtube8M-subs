00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.890
An open world winter sports MMO, the latest
SMITE God, the worlds' first ZOMBA and why

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.370
i don't really care for zombie games.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.940
All that and more on today's episode of the
Daily XP.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.649
The developer Poppermost today revealed an
exciting new open world winter sports MMO

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.180
called SNOW.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.830
Well it's exciting if you're into sports and
going outside I guess.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.239
SNOW will give players complete freedom while
exploring a massive mountain environment on

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.350
either your ski or snowboard.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.269
There will be content for both casual and
competitive players as well as group and solo

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.540
events and competitions.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.760
The Alpha for SNOW will hit later this year.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.670
Hi-Rez Studios got into a lot of shit earlier
this week when they shut down their official

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.769
forums in lieu of social media outlets.

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.179
Which is whatever.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.989
All I care about is that they release a new
god who's giant sword overcompensates for

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.339
his small .. ego.

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.379
The latest god, Tyr The Lawgiver is an interesting
god who is granted different abilities based

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.999
on his specific stance.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.440
The God Reveal Video will go over all the
details so I don't' have to.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.200
Video linked below.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.740
In a surprising move today, Deep Silver made
an announcement about the next installment

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.530
in the Dead Island franchise, with Dead Island:
Epidemic, which is a zombie themed MOBA Game,

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.640
or what they are calling, a ZOMBA.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.250
Very few details have been released except
for the fact that they will have 3 teams.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.479
Three teams, this is the biggest innovation
to hits MOBAs since creep waves!

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.660
Players will thousands of dollars to spend
can hear more about the game at Gamescom later

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660
this month.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.359
Speaking of MOBAs and Zombies, I was hoping
that game developers would think out of the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.920
box this year, but I guess that would have
been too much to ask.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.440
We've announced umpteen new MOBAs in the past
few months, and Zombie games?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.670
Come on, how many more zombie games do we
need before we are actually turned into one

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.770
because of the lack of crea-fuckin-tivity.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.799
