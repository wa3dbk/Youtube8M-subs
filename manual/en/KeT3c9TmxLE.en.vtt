My wife and I have three kids

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.299
Two biological and one adopted, and these
are actual things that people have said to

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.030
either us or adoptive families that we know.
We have to assume that people aren't

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.640
meaning to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.600
actually be mean, they just don't know what kind of language to use when they're

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.100
talking to adoptive families.  So we came up

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.700
with this rule of thumb. Before you say it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.100
ask yourself this question: would I say it about a boob job?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.870
if you wouldn't say it about a boob job, don't say it about an adoptive family.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.560
 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.800
"Are those real?"
"Is that your real daughter?"

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.940
Yep, she's real. She's not a unicorn. The word that you're looking for is not

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.200
"is she your real daughter?" it's "Is she your biological daughter?"

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.500
 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.920
"Whew!  Where'd you get those?"
"Oh, where'd you get her from?"

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.479
As adorable as she is my daughter
actually

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.870
isn't a trendy accessory that you just pick
up at a boutique.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.050
The question you're probably wanting to ask here is

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.680
"Where is your daughter from?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.770
"Did you pick those out yourself?"

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
"Did you get to pick the kid out that you wanted?"

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.300
Nope.  We didn't actually go in and haggle
with Miss Hannigan

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.500
and try to find the cutest little
singing red headed orphan.  That only happens in musicals.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.390
The question you're probably wanting to ask
her is, "How does the adoption process actually work?"

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.409
 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.130
"Awww... Did you get those because you couldn't have boobs of your own?"

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.040
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490
This is a question you'll probably just want to avoid altogether.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.100
Because adoption isn't always the result
infertility

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.200
and honestly even if it was, it's none of your business.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.240
"Do you mind if I touch those?"

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.729
"Do you love your boobs even though they're not real?"

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.920
"Weren't you worried they weren't going to look right?"

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.900
"Wow, how much did those cost?"
"Just don't..."

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.959
It's not polite to stare.

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.900
Unless it's at my butt...

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.900
Remember, if you wouldn't say it about a boob job, don't say it about an adoptive family.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:32.769
