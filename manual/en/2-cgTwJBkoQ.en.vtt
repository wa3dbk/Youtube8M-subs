&gt;&gt; Margaret Craig: I was here for the
beginning of the print shop in 1999,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.110
and organized the shop so it would be
a comfortable, inviting place to work -

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.260
- a place where my students and I
would want to be.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.180
This included making it less toxic, because
I knew I would be here for a long time,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.010
and I wanted to maintain a safe
and healthy environment.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.150
A piece may start from many different places.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.180
Either I have a clear concept of 
what I want to make, or I can just

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.160
start creating components without a clear
idea of how I am going to use them.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.410
And that looks really good.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.270
[music]

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.000
I acquired a number of mediums to experiment with
from an art supply catalog, including Tar Gel.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.180
I had never worked with it before, but it’s
my nature to play with things and to figure out

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
what they can be used for.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.000
For some reason I decided to put it on an
inked plate to see what would happen.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.190
It flowed into all the grooves, picking up the ink
and making the most fabulous impressions.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.770
Suddenly I had a stretchy, translucent etching
that I could form and use to make 3D prints.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
[music]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
Generally, a piece evolves over a period of
months. I work on a number of pieces, adding

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.290
to them over time till they reach completion.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:12.110
[music]

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.150
Studying science was encouraged by my parents,
and it wasn’t until I completed my degree in biology

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.010
that I went back to school to study art.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.849
Both artists and biologists are taught to
observe nature.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.020
Biologists are taught to study the functioning
of the organic physical world, and artists

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.150
are taught to make social observations
of the physical world.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.220
You have to understand connections and how
things work, and you have to know

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.260
what it looks like and really see it.
In that way biology was a good preparation

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.379
to be an artist.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.909
[music]

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.550
What fascinates me are 
the things we can’t see:

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.140
microorganisms and microscopic landscapes
that are around us all the time,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.220
but we are unaware of.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.000
I want to attract the viewer to look at my
work for a long time, to contemplate,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.350
to discover their own relationship
to their environment.
