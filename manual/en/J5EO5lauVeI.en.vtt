00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.400
Hey this is Ivan. I'm here in my garden,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.400
and I'll be showing you how to make 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.400
a Premaculture garden. 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.720
What I've got here is a small patch of ground

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.280
that I've taken  and dug up.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.120
Taken all the grass out and I'm now gonna turn this

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.200
into an amazing fully  functional garden.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.680
Now as you can see, I've dug up this whole little section here,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.640
and this is what  we are going to be using.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.800
On of the most important factors of Premaculture gardening is

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.600
the fact that we need to keep moisture in the soil.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.960
So how we do that is, I've cut up a whole lot of grass over here.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.720
This is what it looks like. Dry grass.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.560
If it's wet, it's gonna grow roots, and we don't want that.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.800
So take this dry grass, and you sprinkle it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.520
over this entire patch. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.440
So as you can see, I've covered this entire spot

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.360
with dry grass. And this is gonna keep 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520
all the moisture into the soil. Which is the main thing we need

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.440
for growing plants. So over here we are gonna grow

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.200
a couple of vegetables, and a couple of other

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.440
important herbs and things that we need for our kitchen

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.320
and for our every day living. And over the next 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.840
couple of blogs, I'm gonna explain, all about

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.440
how to get this garden going like a super jungle ground cover.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.440
The reason why we use a lot of grass to cover the top,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.920
is to keep a lot of moisture in. And as you can see

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.560
the place that I live in is very dry and barren kind of area.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
So we need to try to keep as much moisture in the soil

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.820
as possible. And that mulching  of the soil is what

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.880
feeds the soil over time. And will eventually become

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.920
the next layer of composting. Now this little Premaculture project

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.840
I'm doing forms part of a bigger concept that I'm working on.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.960
And that is to show you how to take what

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.720
you are passionate about and turn it into 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.760
a money making profitable project online.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.320
