Let's go

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.140
Hey you're Napoleon!

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.440
I'm playing and look at my boulder!

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.470

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.930
"Okay I don't know what this is Maddogs"

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.500
Basically, you can build anywhere it isn't greyed out,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.950
And err, your idea is to place down the money towers to earn money

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.830
"yeah but what it what is the money
things?"

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.050
uh... you see at the top let's there's like the selection of things you can build

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.110
"Oh, okay yeah"

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.930
Place down alot of money things and then build obstacles to stop your opponent!

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.770
The money things will earn you money over time.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.179
You then use the money to stop your opponent

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.290
"Okay I put down a money thing... And then another money thing.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.190
And then after a while your boulder will become available, you use that boulder to try

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.110
And smash through your opponent's defences.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.600
My boulder is ready!

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.750
Chaaaarge!

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.460
And then you use WASD, click it then use a boulder

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.659
Use WASD to bowl

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.200

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.269
Then tap it and select a boulder

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.919
And then you can bowl.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.619

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.849
"Oh, is that, my city?"

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.849
"Or is that your city?"

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.589
