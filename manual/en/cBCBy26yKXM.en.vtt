- Dog Training Seattle WA - 10 Reasons to

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.840
Adopt an Older Dog

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.840
1.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.840
What You See Is What You Get

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.770
Older dogs are open books - from the start,
you'll know important things like their full-grown

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.060
size, personality and grooming requirements.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:51.010
All this information makes it easier to pick
the right dog and forge that instant love

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.500
connection that will last a lifetime.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:06.640
If you're not so into surprises, an older
dog is for you!

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.680
2.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Easy to Train

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.680
Think you can't teach an old dog new tricks?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
Hogwash!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
Older dogs are great at focusing on you - and
on the task at hand - because they're calmer

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.680
than youngsters.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
Plus, all those years of experience reading
humans can help them quickly figure out how

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.680
to do what you're asking.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.680
3.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
Seniors are Super-Loving

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.680
One of the cool parts of the SPCA staff job
is reading stories from people just like you

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
who have opted to adopt.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
The emails they get from pet parents with
senior dogs seem to all contain beautiful,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
heartfelt descriptions of the love these dogs
give you - and those of you who adopted dogs

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
already in their golden years told them how
devoted and grateful they are.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
It's an instant bond that cannot be topped!

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
4.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
They're Not a 24-7 Job

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
Grownup dogs don't require the constant monitoring
puppies do, leaving you with more freedom

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
to do your own thing.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680
If you have young children, or just value
your "me time," this is definitely a bonus.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.680
5.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.680
They Settle in Quickly

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.680
Older dogs have been around the block and
already learned what it takes to get along

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.569
with others and become part of a pack.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.619
They'll be part of the family in no time!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
6.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.040
Fewer Messes

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Your floors, shoes and furniture will thank
you for adopting a senior pooch!

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Older dogs are likely to already be housetrained
- and even if they're not, they have the physical

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040
and mental abilities to pick it up really
fast (unlike puppies).

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.040
With their teething years far behind them,
seniors also are much less likely to be destructive

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.040
chewers.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.040
7.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.040
You Won't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.420
There are those who yearn for a doggie friend
of their own, but hold back because they worry

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.970
what might happen in their lives in the years
to come.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.770
And they are wise to do so - a puppy or young
dog can be anywhere from an 8- to 20-year

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:06.590
responsibility, which is not appropriate for
the very elderly or those with certain long-term

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.850
future plans.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.000
Providing a loving home for a dog in her golden
years is not a less serious commitment, but

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it can be a shorter one.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
8.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They Enjoy Easy Livin'

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Couch potato, know thyself!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Please consider a canine retiree rather than
a high-energy young dog who will run you ragged.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Not that older dogs don't require any exercise
- they do - but they're not going to need,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.459
or want, to run a marathon every day.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.709
9.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:40.040
Save a Life, Be a Hero

00:02:40.040 --> 00:03:29.269
At shelters, older dogs are often the last
to be adopted and the first to be euthanized.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.269
Saving an animal's life offers an unparalleled
emotional return on your investment, and you'll

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.269
feel the rewards every day you spend together.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.269
10.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.269
They're CUTE!
