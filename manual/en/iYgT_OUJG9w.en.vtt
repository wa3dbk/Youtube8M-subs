00:00:05.514 --> 00:00:07.660
welcome to the first episode of Will It Twinkie

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.694
this is a series where I'm going to take Twinkies and combine them with other foods

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.680
and guns

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.693
and scientifically and objectively observe the results by eating it and telling you my opinion

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm going to take twinkies and combine them with onion rings

00:00:27.854 --> 00:00:28.654
and eat them

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.340
then shove it in my AK and see what happens

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.760
check this out

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.829
I forgot my ka bar so I don't know how I'm going to open these but

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.980
first off this is my Arsenal AK

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.280
and what's special about the arsenal this time is I have a new bakelite grip

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.360
it was supplied by Tactigirl Lola

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.400
who has a cool youtube channel

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.560
I'm going to put a link below you should go check it out and tell her I sent you

00:00:53.192 --> 00:00:54.632
I really need my ka bar

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.260
I don't like opening packaging with my teeth. I've got good teeth

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.300
we have onion rings

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:09.784
we are going to combine these

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.036
I want to see if it makes a good food

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.420
see if it's edible

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.660
look at this. isn't that awesome?

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.287
has anybody ever done this before?

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:26.260
I didn't do any youtube searches so if anybody has a will it twinkie series... sorry

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.609
there we go. lets will it twinkie this

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.608
I've got the twinkie onion ring

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:38.879
and lets do this. lets eat this

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:52.635
it's not bad

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.020
didn't taste like much

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.450
like a sweet onion ring

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.960
the onion ring over powered the twinkie

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.221
and the onion ring was a bland onion ring 

00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:03.332
not a lot of spices

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.400
it's kind of bland with a hint of sugar

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100
I give it a six out of ten

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.660
we are going to shove this straight into the action of the rifle

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.086
don't worry. I'm an operator

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.091
don't try this at home

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.580
oh my goodness

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:34.304
ok that's pretty cool

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.302
we are making a  twinkie action AK47 here

00:02:50.492 --> 00:02:52.332
which i've done once before

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.869
I guess this is part two

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:00.276
Will it twinkie?

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.771
alright dudes

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:07.334
load it scientifically

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.133
charge it

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:19.686
round chambered

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.020
lets test. will it twinkie?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.599
oh it didn't fire

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:37.805
of course it didn't load the next round

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.620
shooting at my target down there that I set up

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.700
major trigger slap it actually hurts to pull the trigger

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:19.036
one more

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.287
let's take this thing apart

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.760
that's the twinkie action ak

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.580
look at that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.840
that's what makes the ak special

00:04:33.312 --> 00:04:36.912
first episode of will it twinkie was totally a success

00:04:36.912 --> 00:04:40.620
that stuff was yummy but only a 6 out of 10 because the flavors cancelled each other out

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.920
