00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Hi everybody me name is JamÃ© Elis, and I'm coming to you from evolve dance studios 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.410
and I'm here to show some men some poll tricks. 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.960
I've seen pole dancing before... I won't say how.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.240
I'm certain I'm not strong enough.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.510
I'm two hundred and fifty pounds and I have to move that up and down a pole and that's bad news for everybody...

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.790
do you guys have any experience on the pole.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.930
*laughing* no...

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.470
Roll down partition. 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.470
holding yourself up. Hold that for 5 seconds. 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.180
Don't slide. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.030
Oh my god. Wait this is like from Mulan. 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.450
Be a man! 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.590
Use those muscles!

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.300
*screaming*

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.860
Elbow in. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.850
So you're jumping. I want you to be like a sail even glide.  

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.560
That's what I... That's what I'm missing technique. 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.270
you better work. 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.690
I need a second... I need a second.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.540
Bend it just a little bit. Boom!

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.680
Get up, pick up that leg!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680
I'm flying!

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.100
Oh that was it! 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.380
This is where that good upper body strength comes in. 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
What if we have zero of that.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.800
You know we're going to work on that. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.220
No strength. 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.220
Keith you look like you're about to poo. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.650
I feel similarly. 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.350
I can't do that. Take her down! Take her down! OH YEAH! 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.240
Nothing says come over ladies like a bruise on your arm. 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.470
The most important part is getting your butt over your head... Here, Like that. 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.180
That's where I'll die. 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.320
*screaming*

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.430
So keep your legs straight.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.710
Press over your legs. 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.420
*laughing* Great job! Woooo! 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.270
*hooahh ooooh*

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.400
Roll up, yeah that was good. That was good, but extend your legs for both of you guys. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
That rainbow yeah. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.820
It looks so wrong but it feels so right. 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820
I would good bank on you. 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.240
Thank you. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.650
*screams* oh my god! YES! 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.930
That was awesome you guys! How do you feel? 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.070
Oh, sexy. 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.070
You guys are hardcore. 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.200
I had a long history of climbing trees as a child and I think that helped a little bit today. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.760
Uh today I learned that I am fat and weak. 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.610
No it was really fun. It's almost impossible. 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.610
I didn't break my neck... I thought that was going to happen. 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.030
So much credit given to people that do this for a living. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.150
You're like the Albus Dumbledore of pole dancing, thank you.
