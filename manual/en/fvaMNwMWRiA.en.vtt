00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.600
The talent behind blockbuster N64 shooters
GoldenEye and Perfect Dark left Rare in the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.970
late 90s, and went on to form development
studio Free Radical.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.580
This company was responsible for my favourite
FPS series of last generation, TimeSplitters.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.340
Those weren't the only games they made, however.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:47.739
There was also the much less known hidden
gem, Second Sight.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.739
This game takes 44th place on the list of
Definitive 50 GameCube games.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.120
Second Sight is a third person shooter which
follows the bizarre, twisting, and cerebral

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.010
journey of parapsychology research John Vattic.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.590
The game begins with Vattic confined to a
hospital room, heavily bandaged, and without

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.590
memory.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.270
As he works his way toward escape, Vattic
slowly remembers how he got to this bizarre

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.450
state, and relearns some powerful psychic
abilities along the way.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.349
It turns out Vattic began this journey as
an advisor on a military mission to Siberia

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:24.179
investigating the work of Russian scientist
Victor Grienko.

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.270
John finds that he's able to change the details
of this mission as he remembers it, and the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.369
twisting plot slowly unravels in one of the
smartest written games to date.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.709
As strong as the plot may be in this game,
it doesn't entirely cover for some awkward

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.709
gameplay.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.350
Switching between different weapons and psychic
powers becomes tedious quickly.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.189
The game's mechanics work well for its heavy
stealth emphasis, but falter when action boils

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.189
over.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.909
The perpetual streams of re-spawning enemies
are especially annoying.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.369
Still, Second Sight is a beautifully constructed
game.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.380
It's a refreshingly intelligent and subdued
experience next to other first and third person

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.319
shooters that doesn't bother with unnecessary
or tacked-on extras like multiplayer.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.650

and the Definitive 50 in the comments section

Huge thanks go out to sulci and Amanda T for
our intro.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.319
sulci did the animation and Amanda T did the
music.
