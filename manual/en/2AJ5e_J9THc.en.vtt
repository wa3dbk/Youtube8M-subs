-[Snaps fingers] I read a thing
that you had written

00:02:16.363 --> 00:02:19.066

or being well-known

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.066
for being an actor
may not make you happy,

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.396
but it should make you
much kinder.

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:28.726
-Mm.
-So, explain that.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:31.495
-Well, I was asked
to write this essay by

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:32.627
the Los Angeles Times magazine.

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:34.396
It was called "Hollywood Rules."

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:36.132
Like, "What are your rules
for making it in Hollywood?"

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:38.396
And the only thing
that came to me was, "Be kind."

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:41.198
Like, that was it, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

00:02:41.198 --> 00:02:42.561
-And it just seems to me that

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:44.165
it's not just a Hollywood rule
but a life rule.

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.000
That said,
I always find it weird

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.132
when I hear stories about people
who are super-successful

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:54.198
in whatever capacity who are
just horribly cruel people.

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:56.627
I feel like the world is hurting
for more kindness.

00:02:56.627 --> 00:02:58.429
The culture feels
a little coarse and cruel.

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:02.033
-Yeah, certainly in politics
and the way our whole country is

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:04.429
being governed -- kindness
just simply is seen

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.264
as a sign of weakness.
-Yeah, and I feel like that's,

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:09.462
like, a really old story
we have to retire

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:11.198
because if we're going
to do anything,

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:13.759
like, move anything forward,
it's gonna have to come

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.396
from compassion and kindness.

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.231
And so I wrote about
just being kind generally,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.528
like, no matter what.

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:21.396
But also, it kind of spun off

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:23.627
into this bigger
metaphysical idea

00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:27.594

of our words as being,

some charge or heft,

and they actually
trigger things, you know?

-So, the actual air
that comes out.

00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:36.429
-Yeah, it's like, it's like --
-The mean thing you might say --

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.462
-Is like air pollution, right?
-The gossiper, the backbiting.

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:42.033
-Exactly, it's like eating
through the ozone layer.

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:44.033
Like, it's actually like
a kind of weird fusion

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.660
of environmentalism
and spirituality

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660

into someone's house

and it's like
there's kindness in the air,

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:55.165
and then you walk into
another house and there's not?

these things, you know?

-I think you can.
-You're not allowed to talk

00:03:58.594 --> 00:04:00.462
about this in polite company,
but I think you can.

-Yeah, you could talk about it
on "Metaphysical Milkshake."

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.396
-That's why I'm talking
about it.

00:04:03.396 --> 00:04:05.099

-Content.
-Why?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.330
-'Cause I think happiness
sometimes has, like,

to kind of transcend our egos

It's not super-sexy.

It's just being quiet
for a little bit of time

and then trying to hold on
to some of that inner awareness

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:55.297
as you go out in your day.

-During your day.
-Yeah.

00:05:56.594 --> 00:05:58.429

Like, you never feel
like doing it.

00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:01.561
-Right.
-But if you get up

for a little bit of time,

that -- Yeah.

-Just constantly.
-I also think you can almost,

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.528
like, have a conversation
with the resistance

00:06:16.528 --> 00:06:19.264
and be like, "Why are you trying
to get me to not do something

00:06:19.264 --> 00:06:21.297
I know is good for me,"
you know?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.561
And instead of thinking of it
as, like, you,

00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:26.726
it's like looking at it
and going, "Knock it off."

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:29.396
-I like that -- "a conversation
with your resistance."
