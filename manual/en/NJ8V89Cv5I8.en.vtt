00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.640
For a while I really didn't like it

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.279
I didn't want to be Indian

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:14.709
I felt like I was being punished for something I didn't do.  

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.070
All I could think of was I just wanted to be away from it.  

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.089
When it's fishing time honey;

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.289
There's no

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.420
Messing around.  

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.010
My great Grandmother usted to be able to cut it just once

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.030
It'd all be done.  

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.350
Nobody can step on you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.300
Once you learn

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.060
What you're house is, 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.550
who you are, 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.530
and where you come from.  

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.310
and how you got where you're at.  

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.530
My aunt Cookie came and got me in San Diego and brought me back to Alaska.  

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.010
I was raised by all these women.  

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.960
I want to say there was seven.  

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.150
Hellen? You wan't some help cutting them?  

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.570
Uhhhhhh?  
Do you know how?  

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.580
I'm not always Indian, I'm half white too.  

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.580
So, I gotta have half white days.  

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.630
The Love Bird Designe I was telling you about.  The Eagle, The Raven.  

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.850
You know I try to keep it traditional as posable.  

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.170
The Vietnamese 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.660
knocked off the persian rug design, 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.330
and we had the Chilkat Blanket designe woven i that.  

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.720
So it's kind of like a knock off of a knock off.  

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.850
Finely got my feather!
