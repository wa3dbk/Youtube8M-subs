00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.890
hello youtube

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.701
this is just a quick video of me cutting in
with the airless spray

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:09.080
one way you can speed things up when painting

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.509
this is an empty unit so there is no furniture
to worry about

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.929
its a three story unit and quite awkward

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.480
scaffolding the stair case is a little tricky
if you have not done it before

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.539
you have to get up into the corner over there

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:34.320
that is the correct way to set up a scaffold
in the stairwell

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.000
really the only practical way to do it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.880
there is the airless spray unit downstairs

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.670
i have a double length line 50 feet on it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.660
i have the join in the line taped up with
duct tape

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:11.500
so it wont damage walls

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.420
This is the gun which has a tip extension
on it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.170
it also has a graco cleanshot valve which
stops the paint from spitting

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:39.080
im using a Fine Finish 211FF tip on the airless
spray unit

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.719
I am using a medium filter

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.289
im just spraying all these edges two times

00:01:48.289 --> 00:02:38.250
because im using a fine finish spray tip there
will be no picture framing on the walls

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.310
The only spot i have to cut in is the lights,
and the fan

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.280
After a couple of hours i will spray these
edges a second time

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:58.240
Then you will roll the walls and ceiling into
those edges

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:13.520
in this house the ceiling on the top level
is the same paint as the walls

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.430
Its very important to use a fine finish airless
spray tip

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150
it reduces overspray, which means you breathe
less in

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.740
and it also has soft edges on the spray

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.590
rather than the hard edges of a normal airless
spray tip

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.330
under certain light condition a normal airless
spray tip

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.620
will leave lines across the finished job

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.280
Once you are finished using this method

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.050
you will not be able to see where the roller
meets the edge of the wall

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.770
it will be a perfect finish

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.290
you are always better to spray edges where
you can to achieve the perfect finish

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.981
this is more for professional painters, home
handymen are best not to use the airless spray

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:04.981
unit

00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:06.540
Thanks for watching

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.500
I will be closed captioning all my videos
and translating to different languages so

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:29.719
please SUBSCRIBE to my channel and LIKEthis
video :)

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:30.909
one last thing i forgot

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.740
the clean shot valve from graco

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.949
if you are using a tip extension this is important
to have

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.379
when you release the trigger on the spray
gun

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.690
it releases paint in a messy fashion without
the valve

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.090
The cleanshot valve knows when you release
the trigger

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.599
and stops the paint at the end of the tip.
