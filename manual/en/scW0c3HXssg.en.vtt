00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.240
What's going down everybody!

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.750
Welcome back to FairgroundsTV, I'm your host
Peter Moeller!

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.400
Today we have 90+ Cellars Monster Red Blend.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
Now I'm gonna have to read off what the blend
is because there's a bunch of grapes in here,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.240
but it's 14.9 percent alcohol, 2009 and I'm
gonna give you the blend.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.949
I'll give you what the blend is: we have 30%
Merlot, 25% Cab Franc, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.550
15% Petit Verdot, 10% Malbec.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.590
So let's give it a sniff.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.609
Getting like that Cassis dark cherry kind
of nose to it.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.879
Getting quite a bit of oak to it.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:05.379
Let's give it a sip.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:13.660
It's slightly tannic but very juicy, like
that Cassis-ish, you know, dark cherries really

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.110
sitting on the tongue.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.420
Mildly sweet and you're getting, I feel like
you're getting more of that Cab Franc than,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.490
I mean, the Merlot the Cab, they're big and
earthy.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.640
I'm not getting too much earth, I'm getting
more of like that juiciness of the wine.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.229
This is phenomenal, I'm thinking.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.540
I'm think some like nice, strong flavored
cheese.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.210
A nice big piece of steak, you know, grill
up something, even if you want to maybe some

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.930
barbeque, like some pulled pork, or ribs,
or something like that.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.900
You know, something big, full-bodied that'll,
that'll keep up to this wine.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.110
Beautiful bottle of wine this is fantastic,
give it a try it'll be in our tasting machine.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.450
So you can taste it, it's actually right below
the video, and have a sip and see what you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.729
think!

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.019
Cheers!
