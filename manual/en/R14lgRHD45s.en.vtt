Hi, this is Linda Lewis on behalf of Expert
Village.com. Check out my website at www.keytime.com.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.539
Why isn’t everyone using a DVORAK Keyboard
since it has so many advantages? With the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:34.530
adoption of a new idea including when DVORAK
developed it, you would have groups of people

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.370
with an idea and the innovators are only 3
percent of the people that include something

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.339
that enjoy an idea. DVORAK was one of the
innovators when he developed the keyboard

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:52.700
lay out with the most frequently used keys
in our language on home row. The people who

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.199
would be changing over to the DVORAK or any
idea with the early adaptors are only 10 percent

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.390
and that is because they see the value in
changing, they are able to accomplish the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.659
goal and there may be a need for someone to
change, so that would be a 10 percent part.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.620
I am sorry I don’t have the additional percentages
on all of them but the next groups are the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.740
early majority and usually where an idea that
is not accepted conventionally from their

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.140
mass of people would be right between here,
between the early adaptors and the early majority.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.840
Because the DVORAK Keyboard is now easy to
get to, this is where people are in adopting

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.450
the DVORAK. It is easy because it is right
available on any computer that uses windows.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.259
Available also on the McIntosh and the Unix.
You can just do it with the click of a button.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.999
The late majority are those that see the value
are able to accomplish it or have a need and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:07.799
it is easy but the difference there for the
late majority to be combined would be the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.370
fact that they see that others are successful
in doing it for them. The last scoop would

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.940
be the lagers and those are people who would
never change because they don’t see the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.460
value or the need to change. So with the DVORAK
Keyboard, the lagers are not a concern. If

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.510
somebody does not change over, it doesn’t
matter to the computer if you are typing in

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.709
the DVORAK or Qwerty. Its change in the language
part on the control panel so you can type

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.069
on your computer in French, Spanish or English,
DVORAK or Qwerty, it doesn’t matter. So

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.489
you can change your computer if you like to
or not. You can change it completely and always

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.879
have it in DVORAK or you can just toggle to
it.
