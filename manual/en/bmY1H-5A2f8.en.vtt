00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.980
Using Comet ISON orbital parameters made available
from JPL on November 8, 2013 as well as recent

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.950
observations of Comet ISON as it crossed Earth's
orbital plane, I've updated my cometary debris

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.760
field predictions.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.779
In my earlier videos about Comet ISON I illustrated
the debris field path and that Earth will

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.179
pass through it in mid-January.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.650
I've also shown how Comet ISON's path happens
to coincide to the peak of the delta Cancrid

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.780
meteor shower, meaning ISON may not have been
the first comet to come this way into the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.530
inner solar system.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.510
More importantly, other comets may be following
ISON down this path.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.730
Trailing behind Comet ISON is a debris field
comprised of the gases and dust stripped from

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.480
the nucleus by the solar wind.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.690
ISON passed North of Earth's orbit on November
1, and crossed the orbital plane of the Earth

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.609
a few days later.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.570
The debris field has now been laid down by
ISON, and the debris is that of a quickly

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.750
brightening comet undergoing changes in the
composition of its emissions.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.540
A comet's debris field widens over time as
can be seen in the nominally conical shape

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.200
of a comet's tail.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.140
The models still show that Earth will encounter
the densest area of Comet ISON's debris field

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.430
on January 15th.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.810
This Stellarium model shows ISON from the
perspective of the sun.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.490
ISON crossed North of Earth's orbit in the
evening of October 31st pacific daylight time.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:51.000
It also shows where ISON crosses the Earth's
orbital plane.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.040
Next is where Earth will be in mid-January.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.270
The radiant point of ISON's debris will be
East of delta Cancri, the radiant of the delta

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.340
Cancrid meteor shower that peaks on January
17.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.229
The delta Cancrids were discovered in 1872,
but the source of the shower is unknown.
