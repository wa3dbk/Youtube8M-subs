00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:06.051
'Evening, ladies.

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:09.554
You know my husband has a gun?

00:00:09.637 --> 00:00:10.847
Not this gun?

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:13.515
-Is it this gun?
-Where is he?

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.227
Resting up. He had a long difficult day.

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:21.483
Danielle, I told you, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:23.734
I didn't.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:27.113
-My parents brought me here.
-Of course.

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:29.323
Where's Sexus?

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:32.702
-Back at the house.
-Shame.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.039
I had hoped we could
read aloud from it together.

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:40.543
Well, I...

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:43.547
-...memorized some for you.
-Did you?

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.339
-Yeah.
-Did you?

00:00:48.802 --> 00:00:50.344
Well, I'm impressed.

00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:52.764
Which part?

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.684
The part...

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.104
...you know what part, you know.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.691
-I don't think you did your homework.
-I did.

00:01:05.693 --> 00:01:07.194
What parts were they?

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:10.740
The good parts?

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.700
Yeah. They were...

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:15.035
-Were you a good girl?
-I was.

00:01:15.203 --> 00:01:17.163
I knew you'd follow me here and...

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.165
You know me pretty well, don't you?

00:01:19.248 --> 00:01:21.416
Yeah. I do.

00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:24.461
You're going to know me a lot better, too.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.219
Are you offering me something hot?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.973
Let's get something straight here.

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.938
I spent fourteen years
in an eight-by-nine cell...

00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.899
...surrounded by people
who were less than human.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.320
My mission in that time was
to become more than human.

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:52.031
You see?

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:56.244
Granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church.

00:01:56.577 --> 00:01:57.954
Granny drank strychnine.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:01.040
You could say I had a leg-up,
genetically speaking.

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:12.510
I'm going to forgive you, Danielle, honey.

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:15.637
I know that wasn't the real you,
the true you.

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.265
But I would like you to wait in the hold.

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:23.729
Danielle, get in the hold.

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:28.817
-Stop!
-No!
