00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.620
I've killed God!

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.300
Ron?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.720
Fred? George?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.660
What are you all doing here?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.080
Petunia, he's gay!

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.860
AHHH!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.480
I've got you, Harry!

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.440
COME HERE

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.740
Let go of me!

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.020
Oh no, boy!

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.680
AHHHH!!!

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.340
*lips smacking*

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.460
Sounds like a dirty, rotten bitch to me.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
Hello, Harry.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.880
What do you want?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.300
To ask you how-

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.640
GO AWAY

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.860
*goes back to moaning*

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.160
I'm Rita Skeeter.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.060
I write for the daily Skeeter.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.440
You're the juicy dick!

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.520
Shall we start with the youngest?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.240
l o v e l y

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.620
Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous ass?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.800
I didn't put my cock in Ron.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600
Ah. Of course you didn't.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.820
Perhaps we should...

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.200
let them f***

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.740
but-

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.900
Potter is a piece of meat. Not a Boy.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.840
B-b-b-b-boy-oy-oy-oy

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.380
This can't go on, Albus.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.020
What do you suggest, Minerva?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520
Put an end to it

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.400
Don't let Potter cum

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.660
Then again, we all

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.280
FART

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.780
Minerva.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.020
*fart*

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.980
Harry, meet me in the Gryffindor common room Saturday night.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.720
And make sure your cock bites.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.760
Sirius

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260
I don't have much time, Harry, so let me get straight to it.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.580
Did you or did you not put your

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.080
C O C K

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.980
inside your friend's

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.480
ASS?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.980
No!

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.000
I was giving him a blow job.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080
Yes.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.000
*fart*

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.900
I had to fart.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.360
I'm not ready for this, Sirius.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.800
*leaves*

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.560
Shush!

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.320
*kiss*

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.220
Go on, Harry.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.720
*kiss*

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.540
What's the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.040
*kiss*

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.600
the clue?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.900
*kiss* *kiss* *kiss*

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.000
Want me to open it?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.800
Yeah!

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.220
AAAAAHHHH

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.180
What the bloody hell was that?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.300
*Joe plays*

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.940
Alright, everyone. Go back to your knitting. Uh.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.600
This is going to be uncomfortable enough without all you nosy sods listening in.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.540
&lt;3

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.880
Parcel for you, Ms. Weasley.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.660
Weas-Weas-Weas

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.020
F*** you, Nigel.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.540
She looks beautiful.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.360
Yeah.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.500
*jealous look*

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.120
*squirt*

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.060
They get scary when they get older.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.780
Ron, you fuck up everything!

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.540
What's this about?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.280
*Joe plays*

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.320
Are you cumming?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.540
*squirt*

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.360
Hey, Potter!

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.140
*ignoring Cedric* You are trying to figure this out ("Potter!") aren't you?

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.000
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.100
*ignoring Cedric again* It just means these tasks ("Potter!") are trying to test you.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.300
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.140
*still ignoring Cedric* In the most ("Hey, Potter!") brutal way, they're almost cruel.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.840
*ignoring Cedric once again* I'm ("Potter!") scared for you.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.360
*ignored* You know the Prefects' Bathroom on the fifth-

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.640
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.820
It's not a bad place for a bath.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.600
Potter!

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.920
You're alright.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.480
Dad. How far up are we?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.640
Well, put it this way:

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.520
RAIN

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.240
Father and I are in the Minister's box.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.440
By personal invitation from Father himself!

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.940
Don't BOAST, Draco.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.620
There's no need with these-

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.200
BOAST

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.700
-people.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.200
BOAST

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.640
Do enjoy RAIN.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.440
Professor! We have some information for you.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.620
Are you going somewhere?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.600
Uh, well yes, um, urgent call. Unavoidable. Uh, Gotta go.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.880
What about my sister?!

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.860
Uh, well yes, um, urgent call. Unavoid-

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.480
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can't go now!

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.840
Yes, um, unvavoidable.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.920
Is there anything you can do?

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.240
Yes, now that you mention it.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.080
I'm rather gifted with farts.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.900
I'm going to have to do the same to you.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.400
*FART*

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.700
Don't even think about it.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.240
*fart*

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.140
*kiss*

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.640
*kiss* *kiss* *kiss*

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.140
farts
