00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:08.223
What are the signs my Mac has a virus?

00:00:08.223 --> 00:00:12.083
You get pop-up ads advertising Microsoft products.

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.863
Should I go to one of those computer scanning
sites to see if it has a virus?

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:20.743
Those sites are just as likely to infect it
as they are to fix it.

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:26.032
In fact, most of them will give you fake warnings
to get you to download their software to spam

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.282
you all the time.

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:30.672
I’m not really familiar with all of this.

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:33.833
They did not used to make viruses for the
Mac.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.723
Not enough people had Macs to make it worth
the effort.

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:41.743
It’s all the fault of Apple’s popularity,
plus browsers that can infect your machine

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:45.223
via JavaScript regardless of your operating
system.

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:49.423
I do not think I’ve clicked on any suspicious
links.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:54.232
It could have been from a JavaScript or Java
applet that infected the machine from a website

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:56.933
you visited that was simply infected.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.843
They found church websites now host more viruses
than adult sites these days.

00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:05.422
What are some more signs my Mac could have
a virus?

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:10.173
If it is sending emails to your friends without
your action, if it is instant messaging people

00:01:10.173 --> 00:01:14.923
in your IM contacts list, that’s a sign
your computer has been hacked.

00:01:14.923 --> 00:01:17.013
Why would someone do that?

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:21.843
Hackers often take over computers to send
out junk email, paid per million messages

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:23.053
sent.

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:28.043
Others use the machines to send out links
to infect computers, then use the zombies

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:30.713
for coordinated denial of service attacks.

00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:34.273
That’ll slow down my connection and system
operations.

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:40.273
It’ll shut down almost anyone else’s servers,
though denial of service attacks on Google

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:42.783
and Amazon have mostly failed.

00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:44.603
What else should I know?

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:49.083
If you think your Mac has a virus, know that
one of the prime targets is stealing your

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.433
credentials from Facebook login to credit
card numbers.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:56.723
I know they want the credit card numbers to
charge stuff to.

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:57.843
Why Facebook?

00:01:57.843 --> 00:02:03.053
Log in as you with pictures and history info
and beg for money because you are trapped

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:05.793
in a foreign land on vacation.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:09.573
Steal your identity and open new credit cards
in your name.

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:11.883
So do not change my passwords on the computer.
