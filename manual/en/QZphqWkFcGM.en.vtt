00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
Hey Guys

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.139
This is Aaron Lawson here and we are

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.000
heading to the first day of summer
league practice

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm actually coming off the golf course
because today I had a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.859
golf tournament so I've got about an hour to
get to practice

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm if you are just tuning in for the
first time what's gonna happen is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.109
I'm going to documents as I go through my
summer league season so hopefully

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.970
as I see things that my
kids are doing wrong then I'm going to offer some

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.770
advice to you

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.600
The episodes are gonna go quick and
fast, they're just got a touch on the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.280
points that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.739
I feel are important for swimmers to do
as 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.239
they progress through the season
so hopefully

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.910
you guys can be on the same
page and everything works out and I hope

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.550
you guys

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.170
enjoy the show.  Alright guys
today

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.980
at practice, the main thing that we worked
on

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.920
making sure that we're comfortable
in the water, making sure that everybody

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.750
is OK going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.780
under the water, letting all of the air out of their lungs

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.270
That's a skill that takes a little bit of
practice with the younger kids

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.270
also we worked on our kicking, our
flutter kick which

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.409
is used without freestyle and backstroke

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.360
It's the common kick and
the big thing that we worked on is

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.189
making sure that we have long legs, make
sure we have floppy feet

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:40.189
and that our kick was short and fast.
One of the big things that developing

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.939
swimmers struggle with is bending
their knees too much

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.939
while they're kicking and that's actually 
BAD NEWS!

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.979
You want to lengthen those legs out.
Make sure your feet are flopping on

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:01.659
the end

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.810
and when you're in the water you want to
make sure that your kick is just barely

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.399
underneath the surface of the water.  You
really don't want it to be

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.489
above the water to where your foot is
breaking the water

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.750
and don't want it to be so deep that it's
actually slowing you down.  Alright so

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.280
those are the main skills for today. 
Alright I'm here with my assistant coach John

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.100
JOHN: How's it going?
Yeah, I'm going to ask him a joke--it's really not that funny but we're going to see what 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.770
he thinks

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.849
What you cats eat for breakfast?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.430
JOHN: What?
Mice Krispies

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.080
Day one and all of them are going under the water

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.970
We've got some important skills to talk
about when I get to the house.  So I'm going to 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.769
review a few things but a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.840
you guys will see that all of this stuff

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.720
pays off throughout the season--
when you get the basics

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.599
inline early. This is actually going to 
be pretty fun. I'm kind of excited about

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.209
tomorrow

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.760
Whooo man it was hot out there today you
guys can probably see

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.470
got a little of a burn going on. I guess that's
what happens on day one

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.349
my voice is a little bit raspy because I'm
kinda out of coaching mode right now--been

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.300
talkin extra loud at the pool

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.090
the skills that we learned today were very
very important.  Number one

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.129
was to make sure that you're able to
release the

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.549
air inside your lungs, very important
skill, a lot of kids

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.150
they struggle with this because it's not
something that's natural

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.799
When you're at the pool, you're
out of your environment.    You need

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.150
air

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.140
you know that you need air, you need oxygen.  So when you go under the water your body

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.250
goes into survival mode

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.400
and a you want to hold onto that air the
best you can

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.709
When you go underwater it
makes it a little bit difficult to let that

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.890
air out.  So very important skill is to be
able to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.580
let the air out of your lungs while
you're under water because this leads into

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.330
breathing

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.110
Deep breaths in and you have to be
able to take deep breaths out.  So that's

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.709
a very important skill.  So

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.790
make sure you practice that.  Also with
flutter kicking

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.709
we went over a couple of skills today with
flutter kicking.   Make sure your legs are

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.400
long

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.439
Make sure you have floppy feet on the
end

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.410
and make sure your kick is short and fast.
A skill that I always tell my kids is to put

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.470
your hands on your hips

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.560
raise them forward, turn it this way

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.940
then your kick should be able to stay
within that width

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.180
the width of your hips.  Alright so make
sure you've got long legs

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.150
floppy feet and that your flutter kick is
short and fast.  You guys know that the

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.000
flutter kick

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.229
is the kick that is used with freestyle
and backstroke

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.910
So I hope you guys learned a little bit.
Don't forget to practice hard

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.490
and check back in tomorrow
Take Care
