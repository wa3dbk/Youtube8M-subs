WIL WHEATON: Greetings, puny
earthbound humans.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:13.620
I am Wilacti- corni- cus-
ton Guy Man Face.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.110
I am your Supreme Evil Galactic
Planetary Ruling

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.737
Overlord King, as you can see
by my kingly fez, which I am

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:31.290
wearing, thereby proving the
incontestability of my supreme

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.910
leadership.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.760
I'm here to tell you that I've
have seized this week's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.920
episode of TableTop.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.200
It will be delayed and
released next week.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.120
This week, you will
view a gag reel.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.070
And you will enjoy it.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.400
Next week, you will enjoy
Eldersign, a dice game set in

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.960
the Arkham Horror universe,
featuring Bill Prady, Felicia

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
Day, and Mike Morhaime--

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.370
and of course the human form I
previously inhabited before I

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.930
was seized by our Benevolent
Alien Galactial Over-Kings

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.180
Lords Faces.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.870
Cower before me, humans!

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.010
Now enjoy.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300
When I was a kid, I--

00:01:30.164 --> 00:01:31.130
MALE SPEAKER: Mark.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.010
And with sound, action.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.590
WIL WHEATON: [CRACKS UP]

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840
The basic of--

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.580
The basic--

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.290
really?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.320
My ability to [BLEEP]

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.980
up right before an airplane
comes over that would ruin the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.595
take is uncanny.

00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:47.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're
born with it.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.560
WIL WHEATON: It's almost
a super power.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.010
Using the incredibly scien--

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.760
[BLEEP]

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.480
aaahhh.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.730
Who will that winner be?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.810
MATT MIRA: Let's say
Pauly Shore.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.690
What does he do?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.390
Nothing.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.360
But chicks.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.450
WIL WHEATON: I'm sorry,
actually, actually, you missed

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.890
a word here.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.970
Famous.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.440
MATT MIRA: Oh.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.760
WIL WHEATON: All right.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.770
The correct answer was me.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.725
JONAH RAY: Once again, I thought
you said famous.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:11.817
FEMALE SPEAKER: And how
are you doing on

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:13.540
your strategy so far?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.440
JONAH RAY: Very well, I think.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
think so far I'm

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.720
doing great on my strategy.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.290
JONAH RAY: Oh, sorry.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.000
Sorry.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.340
It's hard to be that much of an
asshole two times in a row.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.190
WIL WHEATON: Actually, if you
can imagine, someone who says

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.810
all these things in
an interview.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.280
Sorry I'm late.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220
I was having sex with
your spouse.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.020
Don't be upset with me.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.713
Your tits are splendid.

00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:33.230
Is that a picture of
your daughter?

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.590
How old is she?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.560
Dear people watching
this in Japan.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.360
I'm not saying you should
send me bloo--

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.240
I'm not saying you should send
me a bloo-- boo-- why can't I

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.200
even say it?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.418
Oh, well, is it just, is
it just, it's so--

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:54.840
it's so hot in here.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.890
It's got to be the
flannel shirt.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.140
Josh, you get not a point.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.290
JOSH CAGAN: This is
not going great.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.830
JONAH RAY: This is a comeback.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.580
I'm coming back.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.345
I started off slow.

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:03.880
Hey, I was just like you, an
idiot, but now I'm, now I'm

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.300
coming back.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.370
WIL WHEATON: This
card, this card?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.800
[BLEEP]

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.110
you.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.373
You're out of the game.

00:03:08.373 --> 00:03:08.826
MATT MIRA: Whoa!

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:09.280
JONAH RAY: Hey!

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.725
Man, this guy just don't
give a [BLEEP].

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.320
JOSH CAGAN: What--

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.110
ss--

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.531
the most confusing--

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.690
WIL WHEATON: I think
the confusingest

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.520
thing ever, the confu--

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.670
What's the most effective
way to shoot that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.300
airplane out of the sky?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.600
JONAH RAY: Since you guys are
all tied, we'll do one more.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.780
I'll be the judge, since I'm
already the Supreme Winner.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.750
And we can see who's going
to be the tiebreaker.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.550
WIL WHEATON: Producer says no.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.930
JONAH RAY: OK.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.060
WIL WHEATON: Producer says
we're out of time.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.980
JONAH RAY: We're-- this is not
about the show anymore.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.166
This is much bigger than you.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.000
JOSH CAGAN: Come here, you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.480
MATT MIRA: Is it OK?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.990
I don't know.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.240
I don't know.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.170
I don't know anything anymore.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.930
He's dumb.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.580
His hair's messy.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.830
OK.
