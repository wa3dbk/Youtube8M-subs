00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.500
 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.540
 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.810
and welcome so what are we working on
today we're working on

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.160
EPS files for Boris graffiti 6.1

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.650
so let's do that, so I'm using
Adobe Illustrator and i have created

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.550
something simple

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.310
see I was in lying

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
before I import this, did have a few issues with this, I contacted boris

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.370
himself

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.829
and John and his team were really great
help me a what my problem was I need to

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:39.260
create

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.340
at lines before boris can identify this

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.079
can't see this because its a flat image, so I
need to create

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.329
outlined so I'm going to type and then
create outlines

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.640
now the object has outlines

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
isn't that crazy. Right now and what we need
to do is we go to File

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.370
save as make sure it's EPS

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.119
because it by default it will be Adobe
Illustrator give your project a name.

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.330
in my case called TTT

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.700
Why? because I'm lazy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.780
and then here where it says version
chose

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.460
illustrator 8 EPS and click ok

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.950
all right let's launch Boris graffiti

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.060
here you see a little tab called
EPS and click on that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
let's look for the TTT file and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.640
BAM, there is how simple as that and how
simple as that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.530
and you say yeah but what can I do is
use to text editor with

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
boris? well you can I'm not asking you
not to but let's say for instance you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.299
have a Logo on some product you can
and trace that like  in Adobe

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:46.979
Illustrator

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.930
and importer straight into boris, you don't
have to try and guess it it's there

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.270
perfect now its a this is an object
after all

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.369
so you can you can create anything in

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.630
Adobe Illustrator an important as an EPS
file, round objects

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.700
spheres, whatever you can think of you can
create you can imports so long its an

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.940
EPS format. now once I have this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.110
I can turn this into extruded  text

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.260
let's do that 3d extrusions so there you
go

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.920
this is why a I didn't really care about
the color cuz

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.230
I was gonna change it into that plastic
by default anyway

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.870
as soon as I went into the extrusion

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.180
that's kinda cool. and if you want you
can also that play around with each letter

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.780
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.160
we do that, go to silhouette where it  says EPS

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.050
turn it into a spline object show you
how to do that in what previous videos

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.129
yep it up you'll see them or now in
there are separate

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.970
track lines so you can have some fun
changing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.440
each letter independently if you want to
really get in on it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.200
go to pen tool and you'll see all the
nodes come up

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.730
lets zoom in on that all the nights come up
and then you can then

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.250
change these nodes if you hold them

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.459
ALT key anyone along the lawn Press once

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.879
in with the left mouse button it adds a
new nod

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.800
so that's pretty cool let's go back to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.239
the way look but I first imported there you go.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.310
easy this really is. then you could have a ton of
fun with that

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.349
so well im here lot of  you ask me...Lights

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.569
I see the lights tab what does it do

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.190
all right let's go make sure you high lite is
I'll close all this

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.659
onto the actual spline track and click
the lights

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.489
tad and you can see any difference at
the moment because

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.209
this here lets zoom in on that is the light
track

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.720
position but it's also the pivot point
position so their overlapping each other

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.860
5 move this slightly you can see it

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.340
gonna zoom back out

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.629
and move left and right, you can see that on physically moving a light

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.459
over my text and I'm here have options
of adding

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.739
three more lights and I can position
anyway that I want to create an effect I

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.120
can

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.489
animate the lightest at if I want to be
like if or

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.970
doing some form of Text, I want a light to
be animated, I can do that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.930
just by moving this little cursor around
a little or

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.660
Target around and that is how the lights
work and that is how simple

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.069
everything really is once you know how

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.580
right now but those who using

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.589
Corel, if you were to import this the
way it is now

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:41.229
lets make this look a little bit
little bit nicer so

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.519
when we import it looks kinda cool ............yeaahhh thats looks alright

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:51.379
I'm gonna import this into my Corel VideoStudio I press Apply

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.019
and drop down this at the overlay track
and pick

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:58.869
little clip from somewhere and there it is

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:02.559
look what happened sooo I can see my clip any more.

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.669
my clip is hidden ... double click

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.069
I got to mask and chroma key yes it's
ticked... so why the f#@k

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.809
in the black not disappearing well I'll
show you are let's close thats

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:18.459
let's go back into customs filter what's
happening is your importing

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.779
the black background from Boris
background here

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.050
unchecked the eyeballl press Apply

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.329
