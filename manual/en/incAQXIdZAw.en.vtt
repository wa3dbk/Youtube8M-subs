00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.269
My name is Yasser

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.104
I live in Bonn and

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:05.538
I would like to know why...

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.540
the food made at home...

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.309
is much better than the food...

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.077
made in the restaurants

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.280
Hi Yasser

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.248
My name is Elisa

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.182
I come from Puglia

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.751
I wait for you in Italy...

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.420
to try the best ingredients, ok?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.421
Bye

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.783
Yasser

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.117
Ehi, Elisa

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.119
Come here!

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.630
Yaz, welcome to Salento

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.065
It is my pleasure to be here

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.833
 I just made it all the way...

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.368
from Bonn till here...

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.869
to see what you're going to show me

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.839
I think I'll surprise you here

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.507
I will teach you what...

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.876
real food at home means 

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.511
Especially here, in Salento...

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.813
we have flavors that...

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.482
you can't in find in a restaurant

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.383
After I've learned...

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.684
there's only one thing I want to do:

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.886
I want to cook a very nice...

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.355
special, well prepared italian food for my wife! 

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.190
Are you ready?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.358
I'm definitely ready, this is so exciting!

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.598
We are in Gallipoli that is a place...

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.534
with a strong fishing tradition

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.537
Cicci will be our fisherman master

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.515
I think we have plenty of fish

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.584
3 Kg of fish

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.925
Now we'll see how to produce oil

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.761
Angelino is a master of this practice

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.098
We would like to show to Yasser how it works

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.506
There must be a love connection...

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.107
between him and olives

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:22.242
We speak with trees

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.077
He speaks with trees

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.311
There's a magical connection

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.049
This is our gold

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.584
I cannot stop eating it

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.385
It's so good

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:39.659
Ok

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.627
So elegant

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.096
Now we are going to prepare pasta...

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.597
that we call "orecchiette"

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.299
We need a special master...

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.434
so, let me introduce you...

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.603
my aunt Zittina

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:51.738
Look, that's the way

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.739
Look look

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.941
Do like this...

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.409
This is an "orecchietta"

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:57.410
Here it is

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.312
This is an "orecchietta"

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.680
 Now we should try

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.915
What are you doing?

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.116
No...

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.517
What are you doing?

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:05.351
Does it seem like mine?

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:06.252
Ok

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.054
Good, that's right, ok

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:08.955
Yes...

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.256
My first "orecchietta"!

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.825
Yeah! Well done!

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.266
We need some minced meat

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.302
This is for us

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:23.469
Thanks

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.349
Ok, Yasser

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.784
She is my sister Alice...

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:38.985
Cristina...

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.053
Fiorella...

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.655
And these are few, not all of the friends of mine...

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:44.390
that we're awaiting tonight

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:48.394
It's very easy:

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.162
parsley

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:50.330
and tomatoes

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.165
and... olive oil

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:52.732
Ok?

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.241
Now we are going to prepare our meatballs...

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:03.343
 for the "orecchiette"

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.011
I'm sure it will be very tasty

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.357
 "Ricchie cullu sugu"...
(Orecchiette with sauce)

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.426
and meatballs

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:24.731
Oh... the cheese

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:25.999
Cheese

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.203
Great Yasser!

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.038
Cheers!

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:39.679
The fish

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.521
It has been a perfect experience for me

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.390
I learned a lot for cooking

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.091
We made the people happy but...

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.060
they didn't now that it was the first time...

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.295
for me to cook italian food

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.796
You will be my guest in Bonn...

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.198
and we will make a surprise to my wife

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:00.767
I'm very curious to know...

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:02.435
how you will apply...

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.404
the things I taught you 

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:05.038
So...

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:06.039
Let's go to Bonn!

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.613
Bonn has a very important thing:

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.114
Beethoven

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:29.896
Hello

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.264
 Hi, I'm  Shirin

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.099
Hi Yasser

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.934
 I will cook for you "orecchiette"

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.135
I learned how to cook it in Italy...

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:38.504
 it is the best gift that I got from there

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.172
Come in

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.148
That's amazing

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.351
Yasser, we made a good job!

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.253
You did a really good job

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.988
Very nice

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.256
This is something that...

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.458
I will always remember...

00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.859
and I will always tell to everyone

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.628
This country has some special feeling...

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:03.296
that I didn't know...

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.630
because i've never visited it...

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.833
but now I know how it feels to be in Italy.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.001
Shirin, a gift for you!

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:09.869
Thank you!

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:10.837
You're welcome

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.172
It has been an 100% successful experience...

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.441
and successful answer to my question!

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:18.378
Come and give me a kiss and a hug

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.011
Thank you

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.612
Thank you
