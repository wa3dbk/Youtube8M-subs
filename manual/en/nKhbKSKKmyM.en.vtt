00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:04.346
(dramatic techno music)

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:16.338
- The Sampras serve.

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:18.993
How to use your hand,
how to use your forearm,

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:20.210
and how to use your wrist.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.783
This is not what it seems.

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.506
I got this from one of my college coaches,

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:27.090
Chet Murphy, at Cal. Berkeley.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.082
And he would often have
players come to the net

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:32.582
and put their forearm parallel to the net.

00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.770
And put the racket in
line with the forearm.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.141
Then he'd say, now hit the
net by twisting your arm.

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:44.237
And the leverage is such,

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:46.613
just because the racket
is in line with the arm,

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.142
I have a certain amount of leverage.

00:00:49.142 --> 00:00:50.444
Then he said, now get the racket

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:53.184
at right angles to the arm.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:55.639
And I'm turning my arm just as fast

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.959
but this lever at right
angles to the forearm

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:59.626
increases the power.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.789
Now you are going to
have to do this enough

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.182
so you can feel it.

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:06.419
And all I'm doing is
turning my hand from here

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:08.669
to there as quick as I can.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:13.281
Now, what does this
have to do with Sampras?

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.836
There were always these
pictures in the old days

00:01:14.836 --> 00:01:16.532
when he would win a tournament

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:18.146
and you'd see the racket like that.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:19.676
And this was really Sanpras.

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:21.362
Federer has a version of this.

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:22.586
Roddick definitely does

00:01:22.586 --> 00:01:25.709
and now this new guy,
Milos Raonic from Canada

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.660
definitely does.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.844
I don't think that's wrist.

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:31.067
I think that's a forearm roll.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:33.179
So that this action here,

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.332
I could even hit one over,

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:39.082
is the same as this
action here on the serve.

00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.754
And I think if you want
to try to unlock this,

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.288
first off you have to come to the net

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.864
and start to feel this.

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:51.065
And take some time.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.848
Now, point number two.

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:54.122
I'm moving the racket forward

00:01:54.122 --> 00:01:57.283
without really advancing my arm.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:59.522
And the trick on this serve

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:03.152
is not to have the arm following through,

00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:07.169
but have the arm go up
such that it's the racket

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:08.382
that comes through.

00:02:08.382 --> 00:02:10.279
Sampras knew something about this serve.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.741
Way before him there was
a guy, Aaron Krickstein

00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.158
that served that way.

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:16.613
I know for a fact that
McEnroe did it that way.

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:20.770
I know for a fact that
Laver did it that way.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.747
But I also know for a
fact that many coaches

00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:25.211
and many players assume
they're having their hand

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.084
move through the ball

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:30.584
which doesn't resemble at all that action.

00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.192
I've done a lot of writing on our blog

00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:35.177
about Poncho Gonzales.

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.169
This is something I really believe in.

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.555
This is something I teach.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.243
This is something you could learn.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.938
But the heart and soul
of it is right here.

00:02:42.938 --> 00:02:45.801
And I'm hitting the net pretty hard.

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:50.010
And I've got that same
amount of leverage there.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.083
This stuff works.

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:51.987
Keep me posted.

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:52.825
Keep playing tennis.

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:54.961
And let's stay in touch.

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.378
