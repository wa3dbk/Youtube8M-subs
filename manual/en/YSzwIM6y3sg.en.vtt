00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.140
theme I'm

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.410
for decades HP Labs has been delivering
innovations that transform business

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.590
life and society we're tackling some of
the greatest technology challenges

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.219
on the 21st century on data is exploding
today

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.640
to the point where it's impossible for
current computing architectures to keep

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.939
up

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.119
the for example think about a flight
data recorder

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.900
what if it can record everything that
happens in flight instead of just a few

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.050
hours at a time

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
and what if we have the computing power
to make sense of all that data

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.870
from the flight path to the movies the
passengers to use to watch

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.850
for that matter what if we could count
on any computer to tell us what we need

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.980
to learn from data without us even
having to ask

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.340
and what if there were new ways to
visualize the information

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.850
so that instead of trying to learn using
flat two-dimensional graphs and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.579
spreadsheets

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.430
we could see the information as an
object and interact with it intuitively

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.500
what if we could share data securely
with all the people who need it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.090
no matter where it is at HP Labs been
creating a completely new computing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.770
paradigm

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.260
the changes the way we manage and
interact with information and build on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.260
new capabilities that make it possible
to manage millions of computing nodes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.420
perform exabytes calculations and
deliver a fully dimensional dating

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.210
experience

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.430
that is intuitive glabrata cool

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.780
think back to the flight data recorder
what if every piece of data from one

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.250
airplane can be securely

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.960
indexed and shared with an entire fleet
of planes second instantaneously adapter

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.579
based on that information

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.920
what if we extend that linking to all
the things we do every day

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.850
a pill bottle for example what if it
came with all the information you need

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.689
to track

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.100
traces and verify the quality of the
contents the ability to extract data

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.430
from the environment and things around
us

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.759
will help us make better sense of the
world we can clearly see the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.240
opportunities for improvement

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.520
and I just waiting to be unlocked we see
potential for impact on society and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.290
business

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.930
everywhere we look HP Labs concentrated
efforts in the five key areas that we

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.969
believe are necessary to make this
vision

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.850
a reality little systems research

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.000
little networking and mobility

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.290
the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.510

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.580
%uh and printing can contact little

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.690
but we're not just doing research in the
lab we're passionate about turning our

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.450
discoveries

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.959
into reality we work with our businesses
and customers to commercialize

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.379
technology through a variety of avenues

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.540
to put the power of our innovations into
the hands of millions of customers

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.709
we're not just looking forward to the
future we're creating it

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.060
be a part of it.
