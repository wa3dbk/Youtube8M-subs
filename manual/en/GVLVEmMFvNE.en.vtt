00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.500
Dr. Joe Neely and I practice with the Barton
Oaks Dental Group. I'm going to discuss dental

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.880
procedures which is a very broad category.
A dental procedure can be anything as simple

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.890
as a cleaning, which is removing the hard
deposits that you can't get off yourself off

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.770
your teeth. Or removing soft deposits that
are in areas that are so far up into the gum

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:36.040
you physically can't get to them. To scaling
root planing, which is somewhat similar in

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.790
nature to cleaning. Except it requires anesthesia,
because you have to go through the attachment

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.620
of the gum to the tooth in order to get below
the level of the hard tartar to remove it.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.570
You have a dental procedure of a sealant,
which is simply cleaning out the grooves of

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.860
the tooth. The undecayed grooves of the tooth.
Assuring yourself that there is no decay and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.420
then etching the tooth creating some kind
of acid edge to the tooth, then applying a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.340
plastic coating that fits in the grooves of
the teeth to protect it against decay. You

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.479
have a filling, which is simply going in and
physically removing any infected part of the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.920
tooth enamel. The bacteria live off of plaque
which is a combination of bacteria and food

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.420
source and the gelatinous mass that sticks
to the tooth. Once the by product is acid,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.229
once the acid eats through the hard outer
shell of the tooth, it can the bacteria can

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.189
now live off of the internal portion of the
tooth. And in order to keep it from destroying

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.460
the tooth, you have to go in and physically
cut that part out. And then that part of the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.810
tooth that's been removed, is restored with
a filling. And there are numerous types of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.170
filling materials. When the defect becomes
large enough that structurally you can't,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.110
the tooth can't support a filling any longer.
Then the opposite is done. More of the perimeter

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.110
of the tooth is removed and then a crown is
done over the tooth. A crown brings structural

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.220
support from the outside to the tooth, whereas
a filling requires a tooth to provide the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.190
structural support for the filling. Now crowns
can be a combination of metal and porcelain

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.290
to gain the combination of strength from the
metal and the aesthetics of porcelain. It

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:48.120
can be all porcelain for greater aesthetics
or it can be all metal in areas where nothing

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.100
else is saved. You also have the ability procedure
would be a veneer, which is nothing more than

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.330
just part, a thing part of a crown. It's exactly
like a porcelain crown, in fact in today's

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.900
world, where veneer stops and a crown starts
is a very, very gray area. Because it's all

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.380
a matter of percentages. Other procedures
would be root canals which is the removal

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.950
of the contents of a tooth. Extraction which
would be the removal of a tooth. Biopsy which

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.460
would be the removal of tissue to be studied
under a microscope. And the list goes on and

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
on.
