00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:05.186
My name is Beulah Morgan

00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:05.686
I’m Gordon

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.280
And we’ve been on the ferry 72 times.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.100
We’ve been in 37 states, all the provinces of Canada, 9 countries in Europe.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.754
We’ve travelled together in a car and a truck 177,000 miles

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.909
We’re still married, and still in love.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.960
Our first trip was 1966

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.860
I said I’d like to go up to Nova Scotia somewhere for a trip, get on the CN ferry and go to Nova Scotia.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.666
She said well if we’re going to Nova Scotia we’re going to Ontario to see your sister.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.160
So that’s what we did.

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.097
That was the first of many.

00:00:43.097 --> 00:00:46.451
There’s a book here for every trip, the very first year I haven’t got.

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:51.751
Ah we left home May the 16th, 95 we were gone until June 13th, 95.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.040
We saw a hitchhiker east of Roche’s Line – he was on crutches.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.980
Strange isn’t it?

00:00:56.216 --> 00:01:02.536
We crossed on the Leif Ericson. We had two dormitory bunks $12 each, we used them for a few years.

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:04.778
The ferry’s are really really nice.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.760
Oh they’re nice, yup. Very beautiful.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.580
And I tell you what I like too… The day I make reservations.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.820
That’s a big day. Knowing it’s done now and we got so many days until before the trip comes you know?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.058
That’s excitement!

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.300
Counting the days then.

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:20.196
We flew to BC once and we flew to Florida but we drove back.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:20.855
We’d rather drive.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.120
You see more and you can stop whenever you want to.

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:25.502
She can drive but I does most of it.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:26.794
Well what happens to me?

00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:27.799
She gets sleepy. I get sleepy.

00:01:27.915 --> 00:01:29.835
We don’t use a GPS we use maps.

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:34.844
They’re all good now aren’t they. I tell ya. Well I guess when we drove to BC would be

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.940
I think our eldest daughter next door she gets kind of worried about us now when we’re driving

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.920
because we’re getting old and she says something is going to happen to you one of those days.

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.929
Paris.
Yes, yes.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.120
We were under the bridges of Paris on the tour boat.
Yes that’s right.

00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:58.368
Money.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.900
We use money we don’t use plastic stuff.

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:06.798
I wouldn’t leave home without her!

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.500
A trunk full.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.960
Almost! 
Almost but not quite.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.800
We drove on the fumes about a year ago from Grand Falls to Gander.

00:02:24.837 --> 00:02:27.717
On the Wales trip we met these nice people.

00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:30.957
So we sat with them in the lounge in the hotel.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.310
And I said I should call our daughter.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.094
I went downstairs to use the payphone and I couldn’t get through

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:39.876
Because you got to ring a big string of numbers you know.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.160
And this man said I can get through to Canada for you.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.860
And I said ok.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.420
So I went downstairs with this strange man.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.740
And he dialed a few numbers and he got through to Renee

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.300
And he said “Hello Renee, this is Jack.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.500
I’ve got your mother here.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.205
And she’s up on the table and 
she won’t keep her clothes on!”

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:01.635
That’s the funny part!

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.320
Every now and then I uses the windshield wash.

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:09.566
A couple of times she was getting in and out of the car

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:11.960
And it went over her face!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.689
I got out of the car to get something out of the cooler.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.169
So I turned on the windshield wash,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.459
She said- well you did it again!

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:21.378
You could here me all over the parking lot!

00:03:21.378 --> 00:03:24.256
That’s four times now she said you done that!
