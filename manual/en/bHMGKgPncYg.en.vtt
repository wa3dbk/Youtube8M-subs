00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.469
Try these tips to take your act out of your
living room and in front of a live audience.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:22.290
You will need Original material Act Stage
time Ability to read an audience Demo DVD

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.820
Respectful attitude Mentor and funny friends
(optional).

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.080
Step 1.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.570
Write original material for your routine.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.579
Whenever inspiration strikes, write it down
immediately.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.070
Then, take time to polish your jokes into
a linear, comedic narrative.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.820
If you have funny friends, enlist them to
help with jokes or give you an opinion on

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.039
your material.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.039
Step 2.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.440
Develop your act by rehearsing your material
and finding an original voice.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.679
Study successful comedians for tips on delivery,
timing, and attitude.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:04.250
Angry, zany, laid-back, deadpan -- however
you deliver your act, be true to yourself.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.290
Have plenty of backup material ready in case
your act bombs.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.350
Step 3.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.890
Get on stage often.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.130
It's critical for a stand-up to practice before
an audience as much as possible.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.530
Sign up for open-mic nights at comedy clubs,
nightclubs, and coffeehouses.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.300
Travel to other areas to see how different
audiences react.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.649
Step 4.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:25.649
Read the audience.

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.869
If you're not getting laughs, shift gears.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.259
Be prepared to stray from your material and
improvise to mine comedy from spontaneous

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.109
situations, and defuse hecklers.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.210
Step 5.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.200
Record your set when you have it down, and
make a DVD.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.900
Professional comics send these to comedy clubs
around the country as a way to audition for

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.109
a booking.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.219
Step 6.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.369
Show respect to fellow comedians and club
owners.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.729
Comedy is a small world and many clubs are
family-owned.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.899
Staying in good graces is crucial if you want
to continue to work.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.899
Step 7.

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.060
Have one or more seasoned comics as a mentor.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.179
Most professional comics learned a lot about
the business from hanging out with older comics,

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.450
and listening to their words of wisdom.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.240
Did you know Film comedy impresario Judd Apatow
spent eight years as a stand-up comedian before

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.730
becoming a television comedy writer.
