00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.504
Welcome to Part 3 of MuseScore in 10 Easy steps: note entry basics

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the first tutorial we set up the basic elements 
 of our score using the New Score Wizard

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.771
Today we’ll look at a couple of different ways 
 you can enter notes into your score.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.904
Before we do anything, we need to tell MuseScore 
 where we want to start entering notes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.836
I’ll select bar one and press the letter N 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.771
this tells MuseScore to go into Note Entry mode and a cursor appears,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.869
just like the cursor in a word processing document.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.869
just like the cursor in a word processing document.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.369
You can confirm that you’re in note entry mode 

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.784
by taking a look at the bottom right-hand corner of screen.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.905
Next, we need to select the rhythm using the buttons across the top here

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.869
My first note is a dotted crotchet (or quarter note) 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.771
so I’ll select crotchet and then the dot.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.605
To create the note I’ll click with the mouse on 
 the correct line or space on the stave.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.302
You can probably tell that this method is going to be very slow 

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.918
so let’s look at the better way to enter notes:

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.824
Each rhythmic note value up here is represented by the numbers 1-9

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:35.763
If I was to press number 4 on 
 my computer keyboard the quaver is selected.

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:38.433
Number 5 selects the crotchet

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:41.770
Number 6 selects the minim and so on.

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:48.180
You can either use the numbers that appear above 
 the letters on your computer keyboard 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.770
or better still, you can use the numeric 
 keypad to the right of your keyboard.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.460
The next note I want in my piece is a crotchet 
 (or quarter note), so I’ll press the number 5, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.370
and now all I need to do is type the 
 letter name of the note I want 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.100
using the letters on my computer keyboard. 

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.570
I need an F sharp, 

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:18.670
but I only need to type the letter F, 
 because the sharp is in the key signature.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:23.410
Next I’ll change to a quaver by pressing 
 number 4 and type the letter E

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.640
and then back to crotchet F sharp, and quaver G. 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.340
I can continue to enter notes using the touch-typing method 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.570
which is much quicker than picking up the mouse.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.370
The rhythmic value you choose remains selected until you alter it, 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.240
so to enter this passage of quavers here, I only need 
 to select quaver once at the beginning of the phrase.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.040
If I make a mistake there are a few things I can do:

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.270
First of all, I could simply undo my last action 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.800
by using the universal shortcut Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on a Mac) 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.270
and then I can re-enter the note

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.800
Alternatively, if I just entered the wrong pitch, 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.400
I can move the note up or down using 
 the arrow keys on my computer keyboard

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070
until I get to the correct note.  

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:26.940
In the next bar, I want to enter 
 an A above middle C.  

00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.540
You’ll notice that MuseScore automatically places the A below the staff, 

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.750
because that is the A that is closest to the previous note I typed.

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:37.920
Rather than use my arrow key to move 
 the A up an octave step-by-step, 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.470
I can jump up the octave all in one go 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.490
by pressing Ctrl and the Up arrow (or Cmd 
 and the up arrow on a Mac).

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.730
Then I can finish off the phrase as before.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.240
So let’s recap the steps to enter notes:

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.400
Step 1: click on the bar (or rest) 
 where you’d like to start inputting notes

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.640
Step 2: Press the letter N to enter “note entry” mode

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.810
Step 3: Select the rhythmic value of the note you 
 need using the numbers on your computer keyboard

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.870
and lastly, Step 4: Type the letter name of the 
 note using the letters on your computer keyboard
