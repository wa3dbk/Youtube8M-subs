00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Divorced eggs

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening. 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.200
Today...

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.800
...we will...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.300
...touch on a topic...

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.200
...that...

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.300
...tortures...

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.000
...many couples...

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
...and which often is...

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600
...the cause...

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.500
...of...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
...serious break-ups...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Alcoholism. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.300
What happens...

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.300
...when...

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
...one of the members of the couple...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800
...falls in this...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
...terrible vice,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.200
leading the other to desperation, 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.800
to anger...

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.000
...and many times...

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000
...to humiliation?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
I've had it up to here...

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
...with your damned vice...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.200
...of alcohol!

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000
You don't have the minimum 
respect to your organism,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
much less to me, 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.000
who everyday has to see how you make a
fool of yourself in front of the damn...

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.700
...damn television!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.200
While you see your soap operas and cry for a 
fictitious character that doesn't even exist!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.700
You damn drunk!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700
You're a good for nothing!

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
You're usless!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.400
How long since you don't touch me?!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.200
This...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.500
...desperate behavior, 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.000
showed by the spouse...

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.100
...who doesn't have the vice,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.300
is...very...

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.400
...frequent...

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
Generally, 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.000
the response obtained...

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.300
...from...his...

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.000
...alcoholic counterpart,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
is...

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.300
...indifference...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.700
...like...

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
...I don't care...

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.000
...what you think...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.400
...causing an...

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.800
...absolute...

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
...and tremendous...

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.500
...frustration...

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.000
This...

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.500
...simply...

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.300
...provokes...that...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
...the couple...

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.300
...falls in an...

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500
...evolutionary...

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.700
...spiral...

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.500
And absolutely...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.800
...nothing...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
...gets ever...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.800
...solved...

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.000
What would be then, the...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.300
...way...of...

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.300
...turning...

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.800
...over...

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.000
...this situation?

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.600
Let's see...

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000
I've had it up to here...

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.400
...with your damned vice...

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.000
...of alcohol!

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.600
You don't have the minimum 
respect to your organism,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.800
much less to me, 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.300
who everyday has to see how you make a
fool of yourself in front of the damn...

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.400
...damn television!

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.700
While you see your soap operas and cry for a 
fictitious character that doesn't even exist!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200
You damn drunk!

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.200
You're a good for nothing!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.700
You're usless!

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.000
How long since you don't touch me?!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
And who's that?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You don't care...

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000
Why having an alocholic at home...

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.800
...when you can have two?
