00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.580
Disappointing live-action adaptations...?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.700
I do not like live-action adaptations of anime except Death Note, which was awesome.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.139
I always expect the live-action adaptations to be faithful to the anime but it is rarely the case...

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.400
The main character was handsome, THAT was the only good thing! (laughs)

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380
Live action adaptation?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.500
Most of live-action movies based on anime were disappointing.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.880
I do not like live-action adaptations of anime except Death Note, which was awesome!

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.920
Disappointing ones? Maybe the future Attack on Titan? Still not released but...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.640
When the movie poster was unveiled, it looked so different from anime...

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.140
How about Dragonball?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.240
It sucked!

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.380
Live-action adaptations differ a lot from what I expected them to be, like the Dragonball movie by Hollywood.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.340
As for Rurouni Kenshin, I prefer the comic book story rather than the movie one.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.500
The movie was also interesting. But, the comic books have their own way (that cannot be made into a movie).

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.320
Rurouni Kenshin was not bad...

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.240
No, the second part was especially poor (Kyoto Inferno).

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.060
Rurouni kenshin 1 was good but 2 was a fail.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.780
Sazae-san (was iffy)?

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.940
Oh! Live action film right?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.980
There is a live-action movie based on an anime called CASSHERN.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.600
It was intended for a grown-up audience...

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.840
So it came out very different of what the fans of the anime expected... It was a bit disappointing.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.080
Black Bulter.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.100
The anime was good but the live-action movie hasn't many fans.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.360
The live-action adaptation of dragonball was not really good.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.660
But, the main character was handsome, that was a good point though.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.200
Basically, I want the anime to stay an anime.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.740
But Nodame Cantabile was one of the few good live-action adaptations.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.120
Oh!! That's right!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.580
It was reproduced wonderfully.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.140
The casting was also perfect.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.040
I do not like movies requiring CG to be produced.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.920
Such as Kaibutsu Kun, The Genie Family and so on..

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.520
It's okay If CG production is great but most of the time it is strange, it doesn't look appropriate.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.560
For me, Jigoku Sensei Nube's drama adaptation was not acceptable.

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:39.564
Yes! certainly!

00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:48.380
It's an old manga. So, when I heard it was adapted into a drama, I was surprised.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.600
I think it was dramatized too much.
