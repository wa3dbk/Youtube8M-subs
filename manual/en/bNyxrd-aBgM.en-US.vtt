Well! To make the handling of [deidara ultimate jutsu] we need some things to look not so much leave most in the description of the video, makes your mouth first, using Free Transform [Ctrl + T] and [Filter / Liquify] makes as follows.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:00.000
makes the skin tone match the color of the shark's mouth, so clonare layer [Ctrl + J] and will put in OVERLAY mode and saturare with Hue / Saturation, Curves will use [Ctrl + M] and we will move the angle the line can combine 4 layers made, after that and use [smudge tool] to blur parts marked out as well as in the example

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.000
with [smudge tool] gray out, this helps me not look so cut the shark's mouth

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:05.000
later! apply the symbol of deidara, this is a file I made from photoshop and not illustrator, is the gift for avoidance of work, we will import what we lack in the image, that on the right hides the piece

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
delete your nipples if you want

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:43.000
create the holes of the stitches, but on the same layer, can use small dots, and the thread, use the [pen tool] and [Brush Tool] with a size of 2 px, after marking the path of the pen we the brush and press ENTER to clear the path of the pen as we press ENTER

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to the stitching on the arms I will use a picture of a tattoo, can use any form of design and stitches brushes etc can be found on google, for now I will use these, and will put in the following way, look with care
