Weber's chimney starter makes starting your charcoal a snap. It also cuts down the amount of time it takes for the coals to get ready. Just load up our extra large cannister full of coals, light up a fire starter or crinkled up newspaper, and set the cannister over the flame. In a matter of minutes the coals will be red hot. Who ever thought it could be so easy? 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.080
ok much more five dollars well we're

alright so that is that we're gonna let
that bad boy go for about

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.870
How t

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.960

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.870
bit alright so we're back it's been
about

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.740
This is the absolute best way to get your grill going. Unlike the little chimneys sold at Lowe's, this holds a lot of charcoal, enough to fill an entire kettle grill, and the airflow through it is very efficient. Two sheets of newspaper and a match, and your briquettes will be ready to go in 10-15 minutes.
The aluminized finish on this resists heat and rust quite well. Other reviewers have commented on the helper handle, but the really key feature of this chiminey starter is the conical wire grid inside that holds up the charcoal. Unlike perforated metal plate inside the no-name chimeny starters, this wire grid lets all of the flame from the newspaper through to the charcoal, resulting in the charcoal lighting in half the time.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.170
how to start charcoal

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.570
gonna take a look in there you think
will be earlier I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.670
coming got a little Roger Clemens on you
guys I think I misspoke a little bit

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.260
earlier

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.240
when I was seeing was when my other good
Chile went out I was issues in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.110
lighter fluid think your letter gonna
from iron makes in

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.530
good enough for me to so I was your nap
Minister realize how much money on

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.720
spinnin lighter fluid

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.490
in a probably wasting our money and
lighter fluid in this three-way

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.430
this should be good to go the handle
actually pretty cool a brown glove just

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.950
to be

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.600
safe but I'm not gonna need their are
that over there

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.209
no hippie bbq

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.989
I really don't see any what I guess if
you wanted to you could do it like this

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.989
little we're not gonna do that we just
couldn't bring it over here

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.429
dumped and

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:38.080
I don't then on top of summer and which
are cool and their

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.119
so you invest I use it and the

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:45.339
as far as mine review on this girl

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.519
I definitely think is work next four
dollars you could spin

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:52.300
or five dollars hidden because been a
little less getting the smaller weather

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.149
howtobbqright

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:57.119
fine if you're just use in like can
agree on something like that

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:00.919
for smoker think you need something a
little bit bigger in terms of the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.089
cheaper models with just the flat metal

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:06.649
ballistic bbq

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.429
To answer the question, Kingsford works very well with a chimney. Fill it up, loosely wad up 3 sheets of newspaper and cram underneath, light it and set it down (take the cooking grill off your bbq and set the chimney on the charcoal rack, it will scorch whatever it sits on). Kingsford easily lights and is very uniform for heat management, it's a good product to cut your teeth on.
Mesquite lump charcoal is excellent for the bbq. Problem is there are often large chunks in the bag that need to be broken down before they go in the chimney. I pay about $14 for a 40# bag of mesquite lump and the local Smart and Final. 
2-3 times per year all the big boxes have a tremendous sale on Kingsford. Wal mart had the best deal for memorial day, 30# for about $5. They all should have it again for the fourth of July, stock up - keep it dry.
I use brickettes, lump, as well as propane, central California grilling season goes from 

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:15.610
and again their little bit smaller so my
rating on this fine a faster than I give

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.050
this

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.360
5 stars are in way

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.179
Turn the Chimney Starter over on put in 3 full sheets of newspaper crumbled up in the bottom area where there are vertical slits.
Then turn it right side up (as shown in the photo) on your grill (I remove my cooking grate and place it inside the grill) and add Charcoal. Light the newspaper with a match or long lighter and wait until the coals turn GREY. (20-30 minutes) Do not try to cook with them before they all turn grey. Another tip is make sure when you are grilling you open the bottom vents on your grill to allow the air to pass through. This will keep the briquets burning. Also I made the mistake last time of putting in the charcoal first and then I couldn't turn over the Chimney starter (or the charcoal would dump out), but I was able to tilt it enough to add the 3 pieces of crumpled paper. 
Warning: There is quite a bit of smoke when it first starts burning so make sure you're not down wind

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:27.379
use it in the future thinking about
buying a chimney starter Homer
