00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:14.070
A New Look at an Old Friend

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.560
Narrator (April Hobart, CXC): Just weeks after
NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory began operations

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.460
in 1999, the telescope pointed at Centaurus
A (Cen A, for short).

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.219
This galaxy, at a distance of about 12 million
light years from Earth, contains a gargantuan

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.390
jet blasting away from a central supermassive
black hole.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.680
Since then, Chandra has returned its attention
to this galaxy, each time gathering more data.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.460
And, like an old family photo that has been
digitally restored, new processing techniques

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.170
are providing astronomers with a new look
at this old galactic friend.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.309
This new image of Cen A contains data from
observations, equivalent to over nine and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.090
a half days worth of observing time, taken
between 1999 and 2012.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.409
In this image, the lowest-energy X-rays Chandra
detects are in red, while the medium-energy

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.070
X-rays are green, and the highest-energy ones
are blue.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.350
As in all of Chandra's images of Cen A, this
one shows the spectacular jet of outflowing

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.670
material that is generated by the giant black
hole at the galaxy's center.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.719
The new image also highlights a dust lane
that wraps around the waist of the galaxy.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.729
Astronomers think this feature is a remnant
of a collision that Cen A experienced with

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.609
a smaller galaxy millions of years ago.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:55.009
In addition to allowing for the creation of
new images, the data housed in Chandra's extensive

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.329
archive on Cen A provide a rich resource for
a wide range of scientific investigations.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.319
For example, just last year researchers published
new findings on the point-like X-ray sources

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.000
in Cen A. They found that these sources had
masses that fell into two categories.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.260
These separate groups correspond to systems
where either a neutron star or a black hole

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.250
is pulling material from a companion star.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.100
Information like this may tell us important
details about the way the massive stars explode,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:55.320
and gives us even more reason to appreciate
this new view of a familiar object.
