How to Dress For the Apocalypse

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.129
Welcome, to the world's best guide on how
to dress for the apocalypse

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.799
*regular dirty clothes = UNACCEPTABLE*

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.039
Some of you may know, several years ago scientists
fired up the Large Hadron Collider, which

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.099
may be creating miniature black holes on a
daily basis and dropping them into the Earth.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.339
"Science" said these black holes disperse,
and that loss of containment is "Extraordinarily

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.339
Unlikely".

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.339
A week later, their computers were hacked.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.760
If a bunch of 13 year olds could hack a delicate
black-hole making device, I think it's safe

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.660
to say the Mayans were onto something.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.900
In the coming apocalypse, governments will
fall, economies will shatter, and anarchy

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.600
and chaos will rule the day.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.530
Luckily we have been prepared for this eventuality
by years of relevant cinema, video games and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.530
novels.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.930
Perhaps you're familiar with titles such as:
Mad Max, Waterworld, Escape from New York,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:04.070
Phantasm, the Postman, the Matrix, Neuromancer,
Fallout, Resident Evil, Il Nuovo Barbari...

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.409
and many more.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.729
With my extensive research on the essential
fashion elements of the genre, I feel confident

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.060
in instructing you how to dress appropriately.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.659
Clean out your closet, and let's get started.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.679
1 - First, you will need at least one broken
and ill-fitting piece of sporting equipment

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.549
improvising as body armor.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.719
Do you have muscles?

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.009
Better add some, or you'll find yourself taken
advantage of in all the worst ways.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.930
2 - Second, you'll need scraps of chainmaille.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.289
While modern testing places them as ineffective
against both firearms and melee weaponry,

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.549
it will draw attention to your most vital
areas and remind others to please avoid striking

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.549
them.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.200
3 - Third, you'll need some weapons yourself.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.470
Even if you can't fight, no one wants to hang
out with a loser who can't accessorize.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.030
How embarrassed will you be, when the first
people you meet take turns violating your

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.030
corpse?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.320
I recommend at least one hand to hand weapon
as well as a ranged weapon to cover the most

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.600
broad combat circumstances.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.479
Remember it, doesn't have to technically work,
it just has to look cool.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.310
This double barreled machete shotgun will
ensure you're appreciated in every social

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.550
situation.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.220
4 - Don't forget to display all your ammunition.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.630
It lets others know you're not bluffing and
informs them just how large your equipment

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.980
is.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.310
5 - An often neglected part of a post-apocalypse
wardrobe is the unpaired item that belongs

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.310
in pairs.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.390
Gloves, shoes, sunglasses, bra cups.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.820
If your rummaging finds matched items, pick
the one that looks in best shape, and throw

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.820
it away.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.610
6 - The apocalypse has likely killed a large
quantity of livestock, so, leather will remain

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.560
popular among the last vestiges of mankind.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.620
One can almost not have too much leather,
but remember that symmetry is still your enemy.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.150
7 - Unlike in per-apocalypse culture, the
new world will respect creativity and recycling.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.030
Stop by your abandoned office and take part
of it with you to remind yourself of the person

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.480
you once were.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.480
8 - Never let yourself be identified.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.940
There are no situations in which it could
be helpful.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.610
"But how will my friends recognize me?" you
ask.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.190
Huh, not to worry, everyone you knew is already
dead.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.150
9 - Finally, and most importantly, is headgear.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.480
Put some time into this, when you appear over
the horizon on someone's rifle scope, it's

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.100
the first part of you that will come into
their view.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.730
You never get a second chance to make a first
impression.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090
And there you have it, you're ready for the
apocalypse.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.650
If you feel embarrassed going out dressed
like this, remember that by Christmas (which

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.290
will surely be cancelled), everyone will be
dressing this way by necessity.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.170
This is your opportunity to be ahead of the
curve.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.570
Go be a trendsetter.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.100
Show people what is cool before it's cool.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.760
One final note, keep a box in your closet
in which to place your new wardrobe.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.500
If this Apocalypse doesn't turn out the way
its forecasters planned, fret not.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140
This happens at least once a year.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.780
In such cases, keep your chin up, and better
luck next time.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.280
Merry Apocalypse Everyone, and Happy Strange
New World
