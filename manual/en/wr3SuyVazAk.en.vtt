00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.160
Today on this 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan we're
going to install part number 118534 from Tow

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.160
Ready.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.110
First thing we need to do is open up the back
hatch and remove the two tail lights.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.920
To remove our tail light we have these two
fasteners to remove.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.950
To remove our wire harness there's a little
red lock we have to remove, then there's a

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.320
tab at the bottom you squeeze, then it comes
apart.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.750
And I'll repeat the same process for the passenger's
side.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.160
Alright, now we can start installing the wire
harness.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.149
We'll take the 4-pole end of the wire and
drop it down through behind the bumper and

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.449
eventually out the bottom.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.239
We'll do the same thing with the green wire
with the T connector.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.739
Alright, we'll take one end of the T harness
with the yellow wire, connect it to our factory

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:08.940
harness in the driver's side and we'll leave
the other side loose for now.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:48.350
Now, we'll 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:00.790
take our white 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:15.120
wire and ground it to the body.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:03:09.870
Now we do 
have our black wire coming 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:21.949
out of the module.
