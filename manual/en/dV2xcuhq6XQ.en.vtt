00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
- Two of America's biggest,
most exciting events

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.900
are coming up next week:

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.400
my birthday
and the Super Bowl.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.833
[cheers and applause]

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.533
Yeah.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.466
Those two things.

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.233
Who's excited
for the Super Bowl?

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.066
[cheers and applause]

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.433
Me too.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.766
The two teams
that are playing

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.933
are the New England Patriots
and Seattle Seahawks.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.833
[cheers and applause]

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.000
Or as my producer,
Matt Wright, puts it,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.100
they'll be opening
for Katy Perry.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.433
[cheers and applause]

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.933
He doesn't know.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.266
He knows nothing
about football, so...

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.933
This is a big deal
for the football players,

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.066
because the winners get
a Super Bowl ring

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.233
and, more importantly,
they get to go to Disneyland,

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.533
where they're probably
gonna catch measles, so...

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.966
The game is over
a week away,

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.333
but already
there's a controversy.

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.166
Turns out that during
their last game

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:54.066
the Patriots used
underinflated balls,

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.266
which is sad
because the NFL

00:00:56.266 --> 00:01:00.133
had gone almost 30 days
without a controversy.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.933
It's really bad news
for the Patriots,

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.233
because now they could face
up to a $25,000 fine

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.400
and over 50,000 ball jokes.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.600
[laughter and applause]

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.766
That's true.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.300
[cheers and applause]

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.033
So...

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:19.266
'Cause here's how it works.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.300
Each team gets 12 balls
of their own

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.433
during the game to use,
and the Patriots--

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:27.433
See, you're just laughing
at the word "ball."

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:28.933
It's just fun to say it.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.733
So they each get 12 balls,

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.066
and the Patriots didn't just
underinflate one or two balls.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.566
They underinflated
11 of them.

00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.900
So what they did
took a lot of balls.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.200
So that--
50,001 jokes about balls.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.900
[cheers and applause]

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
So now the NFL has launched
an investigation

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.966
to try to figure out
how it happened.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.266
My theory,
and this is just my opinion,

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.300
is that it happened by letting
the air out of the balls.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.033
[cheers and applause]

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:03.700
I'm no expert, but that's
what I think happened.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.033
And it's against the rules,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.766
'cause it makes the balls
easier to catch.

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:07.966
Some people call it cheating.

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.566
Some people call it
a competitive edge.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.100
Those people
are called cheaters.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.233
I wanna see if it
really is an advantage,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.033
so I'm gonna do
a test right now.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.833
My balls, please.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.733
[cheers and applause]

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.133
Thank you.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.233
All right.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.366
Okay, this one right here is--

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:28.133
Really? Okay.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.566
This one right here
is extra-inflated, all right?

00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:33.033
So it's gonna be
hard to catch.

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.166
All right.

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.166
[grunts]

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:37.500
[audience cheering]

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.833
All right.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:41.333
Okay.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.500
All right, this one--

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.900
[cheers and applause]

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.033
This--this one
is regulation, all right?

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:54.166
[grunts]

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.733
All right.
- I caught it!

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:57.066
- All right.

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.933
You didn't really catch it.
You--

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:00.833
It was on the ground
and you picked it up.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:04.466
All right, this one is
slightly underinflated, okay?

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.266
[cheers and applause]

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.500
[grunts]
- [screams]

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.966
[laughter]

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:10.966
- All right.

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.200
All right.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.566
And this is one of
the Patriots' official balls.

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.900
All right.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.600
[cheers and applause]

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.066
All right.

00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:26.966
All right, I've handled
enough balls for one day.

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.466
It's time to dance.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.166
Uh-oh, did you wanna
see more videos?

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.200
Hold on.

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:40.300
Now the skirt
that Lauren is wearing

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.633
looks like a regular
mini skirt, but it's not.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:43.966
It's called
The Mini Freeze.

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.400
Watch what happens
when you hit this button.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.566
[cheers and applause]
