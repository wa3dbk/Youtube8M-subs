00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.767
(wind blowing, water flowing)

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:05.333
&gt;&gt; DON'T EVER UNDERESTIMATE

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.100
RED RIVER.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.934
YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:08.767
GONNA DO.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:09.900
YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHAT

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.767
RED RIVER'S GONNA DO.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.166
WHATEVER THE LORD DECIDES TO DO

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.433
WITH IT IS WHAT IT'S GONNA DO.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.734
(music)

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:23.633
&gt;&gt; ALONG THE NORTHERN EDGE OF

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.567
TEXAS, THERE IS A FORCE WHICH

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.033
CONSTANTLY REDEFINES THE

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.633
STATE'S BOUNDARY.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.300
WE'LL TRAVEL DOWN THIS RIVER TO

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
SEE HOW IT HAS SHAPED THE LAND,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.033
THE TOWNS, AND PEOPLE'S LIVES

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.066
ALONG THE WAY.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.266
THE RED RIVER DEVELOPS FROM A

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.934
COLLECTION OF SMALL CREEKS AT

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:42.200
THE EASTERN EDGE OF NEW MEXICO.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.166
THE CREEKS GATHER IN THE

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.433
CANYONLANDS OF THE TEXAS

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.700
PANHANDLE.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.934
IT IS HERE THAT THE PRAIRIE DOG

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:48.367
TOWN FORK OF THE RED RIVER

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.266
BEGINS.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.166
(sound of raindrops)

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.633
&gt;&gt; IN PALO DURO CANYON,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.533
MELTING SNOW AND RAINFALL CARRY

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.867
SEDIMENT TO THE RIVER ADDING

00:00:57.867 --> 00:00:59.700
NATURAL SALTS AND RED CLAY

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.533
PARTICLES TO THE WATER.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.667
TRIBUTARIES LIKE THE LITTLE

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.266
RED, WHICH RUNS OUT OF CAPROCK

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.000
CANYONS, ALSO SUPPORT THE

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.834
PRAIRIE DOG TOWN FORK.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.767
BUT HERE, DRY SPELLS CAN TURN

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.033
THE RIVER BED WHITE FROM GYPSUM

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.300
AND OTHER MINERAL DEPOSITS

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.467
FOUND IN THE WATER.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:18.967
AT THE HARDEMAN COUNTY LINE,

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:20.567
THE PRAIRIE DOG TOWN FORK TAKES

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:22.333
THE SOLE NAME OF RED RIVER AND

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.700
SEPARATES TEXAS FROM OKLAHOMA.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.934
OUR JOURNEY DOWN THE RED

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:27.800
BEGINS IN QUANAH.

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.633
(sound of passing cars,
horn honks)

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:31.667
&gt;&gt; AS THE SEAT OF HARDEMAN

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.266
COUNTY, THE TOWN WAS NAMED

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.166
AFTER QUANAH PARKER, THE LAST

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.967
GREAT COMANCHE CHIEF.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.133
AN AREA ONCE ROAMED BY THE

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.166
KIOWA AND COMANCHE INDIANS,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.567
ROLLING PLAINS AND SANDY LOAM

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.533
SOILS MADE FARMING AND RANCHING

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.467
BIG BUSINESS HERE.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.400
&gt;&gt; AT ONE TIME THERE WERE LIKE

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.900
10 DIFFERENT OIL COMPANIES IN

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.233
HERE THAT HAD OFFICES.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.600
EVERYTHING WAS ON A BOOM,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.200
WHEN THE BOTTOM FELL OUT ON

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.533
THE OIL PRICE AND EVERYTHING

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.433
WELL THEY JUST MOVED OUT.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:01:59.533
AND THEN IT REALLY DID,

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.734
IT HURT EVERYTHING DOWNTOWN

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.734
AND IT HURT OUR COMMUNITY WHEN

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.934
THE OIL INDUSTRY WENT DOWN,

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.467
BUT IT'S PICKED BACK.

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:07.900
&gt;&gt; TRAVELING DOWNSTREAM PAST

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900
THE CITY OF WICHITA FALLS,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.567
WE ENTER MONTAGUE COUNTY,

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.367
AT THE SITE OF RED RIVER STATION

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:16.333
AND THE TOWN OF SPANISH FORT.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.233
(music)

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.600
&gt;&gt; IT WAS NEAR THIS MARKER THAT

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.066
COWBOYS HERDED THOUSANDS OF

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.767
CATTLE ACROSS THE RED RIVER

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:26.100
ON THE HISTORIC CHISOLM TRAIL.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.433
FOR DRIVES HEADING NORTH,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:28.667
RED RIVER STATION WAS THEIR

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:30.600
LAST CHANCE FOR SUPPLIES BEFORE

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.467
REACHING ABILENE, KANSAS.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:36.600
WHEN THE RIVER WAS UP,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.266
SOME CATTLE DRIVES WOULD CAMP

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:39.433
HERE FOR SEVERAL DAYS, WAITING

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.333
FOR THE WATER TO SUBSIDE.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.867
LESS PATIENT DRIVERS USUALLY

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.867
LOST CATTLE, AND SOMETIMES

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:45.834
THEIR OWN LIVES TO THE

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:49.033
SWIFT CURRENT.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:49.967
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I LIKE THE RED

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.066
RIVER CAUSE I FISH IN IT

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.000
ALL THE TIME.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.200
BUT THE RED RIVER HAS, IT'S HAD

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.000
A GREAT IMPACT, IT'S SOME OF

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.934
THE MOST FERTILE LAND IN TEXAS

00:02:59.934 --> 00:03:04.400
IS ALONG THE RED RIVER.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.767
&gt;&gt; THE TOWN OF SPANISH FORT WAS

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.333
SO NAMED IN 1854 WHEN PIONEERS

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:09.500
THOUGHT THEY FOUND RUINS OF A

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.333
SPANISH PRESIDIO HERE.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.700
BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE SITE

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.033
OF A TAOVAYAN INDIAN VILLAGE.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:16.400
THE TAOVAYAS WERE INDUSTRIOUS

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400
PEOPLE.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.800
LIVING IN GRASS HUTS,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.467
THEY FARMED IN FENCED AREAS

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.033
AND STORED THEIR CROPS.

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:23.133
BUT THEIR VILLAGE ON THE RED

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:26.100
RIVER MADE HISTORY IN 1759.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.467
WITH THE AID OF FRENCH GUNS

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:28.934
AND AMMUNITION, THE TAOVAYAS

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:30.667
DEFEATED A SPANISH ARMY COLUMN

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:32.166
SENT TO SEEK REVENGE FOR AN

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.500
INDIAN RAID ON THE SAN SABA

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.633
MISSION.

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:36.233
SOME SAY THIS VERY BATTLE

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:37.433
STOPPED THE SPANIARDS

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.967
NORTHERN MIGRATION.

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:41.533
&gt;&gt; CONTINUING DOWN THE RED,

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:42.934
OUR JOURNEY BRINGS US TO LAKE

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:45.867
TEXOMA AND DENISON DAM.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.500
&gt;&gt; THE LAKE HAD TWO MAJOR

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.266
PROJECT PURPOSES.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.033
FLOOD CONTROL AND HYDRO-POWER

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.500
PRODUCTION, AND TO THOSE ENDS

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.300
THEY'VE MET THEIR OBJECTIVES,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.166
THEY HAVE INDEED CONTROLLED

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:03.433
FLOODING AND PRODUCES A LOT OF

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.133
HYDROPOWER, SO, IT'S DOING

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:05.934
THAT.

00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:08.400
AND RECREATION, MY GOSH, JUST

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.700
FISHING ALONE HERE ON TEXOMA,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.700
THE DIRECT INCOME IS ABOUT 25

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.066
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.467
THAT'S JUST FROM FISHING.

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:17.734
SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:19.066
RIGHT HERE.

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.934
(crow calling)

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.567
&gt;&gt; ELEVEN MILES DOWNSTREAM

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.400
FROM DENISON DAM, THE RED RIVER

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.266
FLOWS UNDER A ONE LANE BRIDGE

00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:37.867
AT CARPENTER'S BLUFF.

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:39.000
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.667
CONTROVERSY AS TO WHETHER THE

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.266
RIVER RUNS EAST OR WEST, AS FAR

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.800
AS I'M CONCERNED, AND I'M 67

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.200
YEARS OLD AND STILL DON'T KNOW

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.200
WHETHER IT RUNS EAST OR WEST

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.667
AND I WAS BORN DOWN THERE.

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:50.867
BUT I HAVE SEEN THE WATER COME

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:53.700
UP TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIDGE.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.300
MANY TIMES, MANY TIMES I'VE

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.667
SEEN THAT.

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:58.200
&gt;&gt; CONSTRUCTED IN 1908 AS A

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.767
RAILROAD BRIDGE, IT ALSO

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.133
ALLOWED HORSE-DRAWN VEHICLES

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:02.433
TO CROSS.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:03.600
THE BRIDGE GAVE COMMUNITIES

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.333
EASIER ACCESS TO MARKETS WHEN

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:06.667
FERRY BOATS WERE THE ONLY OTHER

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.734
CROSSINGS NEARBY.

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.600
(car sounds)

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.367
&gt;&gt; IF IT WASN'T FOR THE BRIDGE,

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:15.700
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.367
DENISON DAM, THIS PART OF EAST

00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:19.633
GRAYSON COUNTY WOULD JUST BE

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:22.200
ISOLATED FROM EVERYTHING OVER

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.333
IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.633
OKLAHOMA.

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.567
(truck passes)

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.467
&gt;&gt; OUR LAST STOP ALONG THE RED

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:33.600
LIES 35 MILES NORTHEAST OF

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.600
PARIS.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.000
JOINED BY THE KIAMICHI RIVER

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.667
FROM OKLAHOMA, THE RED MAKES A

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.033
BEND, AT HISTORIC JONESBORO.

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:43.066
THE ORIGINAL "GATEWAY TO TEXAS."

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.333
&gt;&gt; OH THERE'S A LOT OF HISTORY

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:45.700
HERE.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.033
THEY SAY DAVY CROCKETT

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.700
AND SAM HOUSTON CROSSED THE

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.700
RIVER IN THIS AREA.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.000
&gt;&gt; ELIZABETH POOL NOW LIVES

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.133
ON THE SITE ONCE KNOWN

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:00.700
AS JONESBORO.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.500
A TOWN THAT BEGAN ITS

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.600
DEVELOPMENT IN 1814 AND WAS ONE

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.900
OF THE FIRST ANGLO-AMERICAN

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.900
SETTLEMENTS IN TEXAS.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.433
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A COURTHOUSE,

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:16.967
A HOTEL, A JAIL, AND THREE

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:19.233
STORES, GENERAL STORES

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:22.567
UP THERE AT THAT TIME.

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:26.367
WELL THAT RIVER IS UP ISN'T IT?

00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:27.734
AND LOOK AT THOSE CRACKS.

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:29.233
THAT'S GONNA GO.

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:30.333
&gt;&gt; THE RED'S CHANGING COURSE

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.133
AND THE ECONOMY MADE JONESBORO

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:34.900
A GHOST TOWN BY THE MID 1800'S.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.266
TODAY THE RIVER CONTINUES TO

00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:38.133
REDEFINE ITS PATH.

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:39.667
OVER THE YEARS MS. POOL HAS

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.166
SEEN HER PROPERTY GRADUALLY

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.667
DISAPPEAR.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.066
&gt;&gt; I GUESS THE LORD TAKETH,

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:45.867
THE LORD GIVETH.

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:48.200
(music)

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.367
&gt;&gt; THE RED RIVER STILL SHAPES

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:50.867
THE LAND AND LIFE ALONG ITS

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:53.633
BANKS, AS IT HAS FOR CENTURIES.

00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:54.967
ITS COURSE HAS BEEN ALTERED BY

00:06:54.967 --> 00:06:56.767
MAN, BUT IT LARGELY REMAINS

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.967
UNCONTROLLED.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:00.767
AND SO IT IS THAT THIS RIVER

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:03.100
ON THE BORDER ROLLS ON.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.667
(sound of lapping water)
