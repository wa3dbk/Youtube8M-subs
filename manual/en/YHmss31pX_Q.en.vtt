00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.620
In this video we'll look at three ways to
help you easily get the footage off of your

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.470
GoPro camera and onto your computer. You can
use GoPro Studio, a card reader, or another

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.170
app on your computer. GoPro's free desktop
software, GoPro Studio, makes the import process

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.350
automatic. To start, download the software
from gopro.com and open it on your computer.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.940
Next, power on your GoPro and connect it to
your computer with the included USB cable.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.340
Enter a name for the camera, and select where
you'd like your files to be saved. If you

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.699
like, you can set up Studio Importer to automatically
delete the media files off the memory card

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.149
after they're imported. GoPro Importer then
imports the photos and videos from your memory

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.269
card. If you choose not to automatically delete
the files from the card after importing, you'll

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.530
have the option to keep or delete them when
importing is finished. GoPro Studio organizes

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.190
them by date, camera, and mode used. Your
imported files are now on GoPro Studio and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.430
on your computer. If you want to manually
transfer your files but don't see your camera's

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.500
SD card on your desktop or in the Finder on
a Mac, don't worry. This is completely normal.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.960
Your camera was designed to be a smart device
that automatically transfers your footage

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.630
to your computer. If you prefer to manually
transfer your files, it's not a problem. Just

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:54.300
turn off the auto importer in GoPro Studio,
then insert your memory card into a card reader

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.830
or adapter. Your camera's memory card appears
as a removable drive on your computer. You

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.850
can then manually view and copy your files
to your computer. The last option for importing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.780
uses applications such as Image Capture, iPhoto,
or Autoplay. With these applications, importing

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.280
your footage to your computer can still be
automatic. For Mac users, connect your camera

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.960
to your computer and turn it on. Open Image
Capture, iPhoto, or your preferred application.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.080
Typically in the lower left corner, you can
set your selected application as the default

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.270
application for opening GoPro content. Now,
every time you connect your camera to the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.810
computer, the default application opens so
you can easily import your GoPro camera files.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.640
If you're a Windows user, just connect your
camera to your computer, then select how you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.860
want to handle the files on your GoPro camera.
Using GoPro Studio, a card reader, or another

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.700
application on your computer, your transferred
files are now on your computer, ready for

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.530
you to create your next great edit.
