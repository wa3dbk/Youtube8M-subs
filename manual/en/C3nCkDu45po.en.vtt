00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.049
Ok I got the cylinder back
it's all honed up, ready to go

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:10.739
power valve

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.739
OK, lifting bolt

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Just oiling up these control rollers
sticking them in here

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:54.870
and the, uh, eccentric roller too.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.870
Ok I got that all put together

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.870
action works pretty nice
You'll be able to see that power valve moving

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630
there
So that's ready to get the cover thrown on

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.450
got the cover bolted on there
now it's just time to take off this old piston

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.600
and put on the new one.
I got the piston off there, now I just need

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.600
to put the new one on
Bam! Piston installed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.660
Now, I just got to slide this guy on there.
I have the cylinder on, put some nuts on,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.060
check my 'X' dimension
make sure the gasket thickness is right, and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.060
then put the head on
Ok, I got the cylinder clamped down, I checked

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.210
the 'X' dimension
and when the piston is at top dead center,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.460
I'll just get it going the other way here
anyways I'm not going to do it right now,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.930
but it lines up flush with this edge
which is the proper dimension for my bike

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.930
now I just got to torque down the head nuts,
so I got this crow foot adapter on my torque

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.709
wrench
And I know the torque is supposed to be 22

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.890
foot pounds
so with the added extra inch in length, it

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.240
works out to 20.3
I had to set it at to get the proper torque

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.880
on those hard to get at nuts
