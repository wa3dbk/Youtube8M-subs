00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.260
Hello everybody. We are SCANDAL.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.160
Welcome to In Depth Channel.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.520
We are glad to come back Hong Kong for a concert again

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.460
Plus, this is the last stop of our world tour

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.503
We are now very excited

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
We hope you all enjoy the show.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.900
We have been longing for a world tour for a long time

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.440
It comes true this year

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.080
And it is titled as “HELLO WORLD”, in which we are full of confidence

00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:47.013
Consists of our effort and mind

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.080
We are really happy that the album can be the main part of the world tour

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.600
Arena Tour is actually an extension of the “HELLO WORLD” Tour

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.140
Although they are not the same tour

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.880
We are very proud to have 2 tours with the same album

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.180
We will perform in a different way in Arena Tour

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.040
It can be said as the second generation of HELLO WORLD

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.600
(Is it possible to disclose some of the surprises?)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360
We are working hard on composing songs. And we have quite a number.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.520
We believe that there will be surprises with the songs

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.580
The first time or the second time visiting Hong Kong

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.000
We enjoyed the million-dollar night view

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520
It recalls our memories much

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.440
We haven’t been there for a long time. We would like to visit there again.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.952
But oh…

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.137
It’s just next to us

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.720
Before the live

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.540
There was a ceremony of praying for victory

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.640
There was a roasted whole suckling pig

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.440
We used a huge knife to cut it

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.530
And then we ate the slices of it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.980
This was our first experience after we came to Hong Kong

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.293
It surprised us

00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:19.712
But we all get used to it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.820
It was so delicious!

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.120
Disneyland

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.340
On the way to here, we saw the sign of Disneyland

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.120
True

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.980
We did not realize that there is Disneyland in Hong Kong

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.600
We found that out on the highway. We really want to go

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.180
(Will you dress up with Disney character costumes?)

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.160
(In Disneyland)

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.020
Disneyland?

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.520
But when we went to the one in Japan

00:02:54.668 --> 00:02:56.668
We put on ear-shaped accessories on our head

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.380
We bought and shared a giant bucket of popcorn

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.060
We enjoyed very much

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.215
We really haven’t tried the costumes

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.060
(Looking forward to your try)

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.220
(If there is a chance, is it possible to view it on Twitter?)

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.140
Will be in our Newsletter, for our Fanclub

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
The range is so wide. It’s hard to choose.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.060
This year is the 9th year from the formation of SCANDAL

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.300
We experienced so many things

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.000
If we only mention the world tour, there are plenty of topics to share

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.480
Our Japan Tour started January this year

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.060
Then it extended to the World Tour

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.880
We held our concerts in our hometowns as well

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.320
And we love Mexico so much for our first visit ever

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.740
Houses are built on the mountains

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.560
The roofs are very colourful and cute

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.180
The audience was very passionate

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.400
They came to the airport waiting for our arrival making us so happy.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.500
(You’ve been so many places)

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.620
(If you have the next world tour, where do you want to hold your concert?)

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.200
Australia, Europe…. Like Spain

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.740
HARUNA: Brazil as well... RINA: And We hope there will be more stops in South America

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.940
Either bass or drum…

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.200
Already playing the guitar

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.040
Their skills in guitar are relatively better

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.740
I don’t think I can manage drum well

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.693
Possibly not

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320
But I want to see it!

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.300
Really not possible

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.640
Normally, drummer is the one to lead the rhythm

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.040
Then in this case, we try to match the drum tempo

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.520
Should be such a style

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:08.683
Then not in a form of band will be better

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.120
Would like to take a look

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.840
MAMI is capable with all positions

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.420
If I try harder, I think I may make it at some point

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.135
Then what is your choice?

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.260
If HARU becomes drummer, I will be the bassist

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.640
I have a picture in my mind

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.701
Oh really?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.113
Oh my god! Our rhythm…

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.700
Feel uneasy

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.460
We should practice every night! Otherwise, we cannot catch up.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.520
Really uneasy

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.520
(Who will be the vocalist?)

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.900
She

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760
No other choice!

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.714
Another pressure

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.380
Normally, she will act as main vocal as well

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.480
So the vocal will be for her!

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.940
Oh My God!

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.540
Such a band will never have world tour

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.040
(But it will only be once)

00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:01.341
Should be a pity

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.303
(But it should be fun)

00:06:03.303 --> 00:06:04.403
Yes

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.940
If we say this as a goal, then it will be a kind of decision

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.120
But we don’t have such a thought

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.860
This world tour makes us want to travel more countries

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.980
We discovered that we have many things that we want to do and we want to continue our activity

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.820
Everybody from Hong Kong. We are so happy to see you again

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.740
Before our debut, there were people supporting us greatly

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.140
We really hope to see you all again

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.332
We promise we will meet again!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.140
Thank you for watching In Depth Channel.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.120
We are SCANDAL.
