00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.520
Of course we call ourselves the "friends of science"

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.000
 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.860
Even if oil companies in Alberta

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.000
 Pay us to help make ignorance triumph  

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.280
And deny humanity's role in climate change

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:36.960
So we blame the sun, yes we blame the sun 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.560
We recommend forgetting about greenhouse gases

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.880
Of course we are climate change skeptics

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.040
We'd like to see Big Oil make more money

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.920
Our statements are far from being scientific

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.920
The pipelines (Energy East and Line 9) must obtain your consent 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:21.600
So we blame the sun, yes we blame the sun

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.160
We recommend forgetting about greenhouse gases

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.120
Of course we kill the culture of science

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.720
The federal government is there to help us with that

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.840
Their researchers don't have the right to respond to our claims

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.475
They risk getting fired or museled
