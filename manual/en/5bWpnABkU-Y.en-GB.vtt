Hi there! You’re watching Rules of Blackjack,
by Crazy Vegas Casino. In this video, we’re

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.001
going to look at the rules of Blackjack.
The object of the game is for the player is

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:29.180
to draw cards totaling closer to 21 than the
dealer's cards, all without going over 21.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.620
Blackjack is played with one or more standard
52-card decks. These days, most games use

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.670
four, six, or eight decks. These decks are
then shuffled and placed in a card holder

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.000
called a shoe, from which the dealer can slide
out one card at a time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.040
Each card denomination is assigned a point
value. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.570
face value, face cards (kings, queens, and
jacks) are each worth 10, and aces may be

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.649
used as either 1 or 11.
The best total of all is a two-card 21, or

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.359
a ‘Blackjack’!
Blackjack pays 3-2: that means that a two-card

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:17.099
21 on a $5 bet will win $7.50. However, if
the dealer also has a two-card 21, the hand

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.479
pushes, or ties, and you get your original
bet back.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.709
On the other hand, if the dealer goes on to
draw 21 in three or more cards, your Blackjack

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.539
is still a winner with its 3-2 payoff!
How do you play the game?

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.290
Play begins when you place a bet in the betting
square on the table directly in front of you.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.570
After all bets have been placed, each player
and the dealer are given two cards.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.020
A player’s cards are both dealt face up.
In the dealer’s case, only one of their

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.029
cards is dealt face up, and the other face
down.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:55.029
When the dealer’s up card is an ace, players
generally have the option to take Insurance,

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:00.860
which is a side bet restricted to half of
the original bet. Insurance pays at 2:1 if

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.579
the dealer does hit Blackjack.
If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing,

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.430
then he will peek at his face down card to
see if he has a Blackjack. If he does, then

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.970
he will turn it over immediately.
If the dealer does have a Blackjack, then

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.370
all hands will lose, unless a player also
has a Blackjack, which will result in a push.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.329
Then, each player in turn decides how to play
out their hands, usually one of five options

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:37.970
– hit, stand, split, double or surrender.
Hit: Take another card from the dealer.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.700
Stand: Take no more cards, also known as "stand
pat", "stick", or "stay".

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.400
Double down: Players are allowed to double
their initial bet, but then receive only one

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
more card. Hitting a double down is not permitted.
The double down bet is placed in the betting

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.660
box next to the original bet.
Split (only available as the first decision

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.930
of a hand): If the first two cards have the
same value, the player can split them into

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.110
two hands, by moving a second bet equal to
the first into an area outside the betting

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.770
box. The dealer separates the two cards and
draws a card to each. The player then plays

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.390
out the two hands.
Doubling and further splitting may be restricted

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.720
depending on the game, and Blackjacks after
a split are seen as non-blackjack 21. Hitting

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:36.470
split aces is usually not allowed.
Surrender (only available as first decision

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.299
of a hand): Some games offer the option to
"surrender", directly after the dealer has

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.390
checked for Blackjack. When the player surrenders,
the house takes half the player's bet and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.920
returns the other half to the player, which
ends the players hand.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.390
Once all players have finished, the dealer
plays according to set rules: in Blackjack,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.359
the play is more restrictive for the dealer.
The dealer must draw more cards to any total

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:08.090
of 16 or less and must stand on any total
of 17 or more. In some casinos, the dealer

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.640
will also draw to "soft" 17: this means that
the total includes an ace or aces that add

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.470
up to 17.
And those are the rules of Blackjack.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.789
Pretty straight-forward, right? Keep in mind
that some of these rules will have variations

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.020
depending on the game that you are playing
– and don’t forget to practice playing

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.139
the rules through for yourself, to get a good
feel for the game.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.280
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time, when we’ll be looking at Blackjack

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:52.110
Strategy.
