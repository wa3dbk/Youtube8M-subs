00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.910
While they may not physically be the most
dangerous creatures in the wild, insects certainly

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.110
hold their ground when it comes to danger
to us vulnerable humans. Today, we count 10

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.710
of the deadliest insects out in the wild.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.640
10. Kissing Bug

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.960
The kissing bug received it’s appropriate
name, because they’re known to kiss people

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.460
near or in the mouth during the night while
you sleep – and by kiss, I mean they suck

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.660
your blood. These little blood suckers are
responsible for spreading the deadly Chagas

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.690
disease, which results in over 14,000 deaths
every year.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.690
9. Giant Japanese/Asian Hornet
These giant hornets can achieve lengths of

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.120
up to 3 inches full grown, and fly in small
numbers compared to their bee relatives. A

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.039
group as little as 20 hornets can destroy
an entire hive of honeybees. They have a very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.779
painful string which in some cases can be
lethal, and can trigger allergic reactions,

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:16.350
it even has an enzyme in its venom that can
dissolve human tissue.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.600
8. Siafu, also known as Safari Ants
Imagine a colony of ants, so large, it can

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:32.130
tear through the African countryside and obliterate
everything in it’s path. Sounds crazy right?

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.130
But it’s real, these ants have up to 20
million ants in a singly colony. When there’s

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.579
a food shortage, the colony as a group will
march through the lands to find food. While

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.779
they’re not technically difficult to avoid,
the very young or elderly can quickly find

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:56.069
themselves victims of asphyxiation and it’s
estimated that between 15-60 people die each

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.689
year.
7. Black Spitting Thick Tail Scorpion

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.719
Try saying that 3 times quickly..While they’re
not technically insects, I’ve included them

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.040
in this list because they’re among the most
dangerous species of scorpions. Most of them

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.890
live in South Africa, specifically in the
deserts. They’re most known for their massive

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.719
tails which can end up as much as the rest
of the scorpion. They can spit venom from

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:30.129
their tails, and their stings can cause severe
pain, paralysis and even death. You do NOT

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.500
want to find one of these guys in your shoe.
6. Locusts

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.100
This may seem a strange pick for number 6,
as Locusts do not directly harm humans at all.. However,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.189
they’re relentless when it comes to consuming
plants. Every year, swarms of locusts decimate

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:57.879
thousands of acres of crops in a short period
of time which causes starvation and this indirectly

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.879
results in many deaths each year.
5. Fire Ants

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.469
These pesky little bugs tend to build large
mounds in sand or soil. They feed on plant

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:19.469
life, and occasionally crickets and smaller
insects. Sounds innocent you say? Wrong. When

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.340
fire ants are bothered, they sting with a
venomous prick that feels like it’s burning

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.340
with fire, hence the name, and the skin swells
up into a painful pustule. A couple of stings

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.409
can be treated quickly but when the ant’s
swarm, you’re in trouble.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.769
 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.909
4. TseTse Fly
These insects are large biting flies that

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.760
inhabit much of mid-continental Africa, between
the Sahara and the Kalahari deserts. They

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.760
feed on the blood animals and they carry a
deadly disease called the sleeping sickness.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:03.579
This disease starts out with fevers, headaches,
itchiness and joint pains. Eventually this

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.219
moves on to confusion, poor coordination,
numbeness and trouble sleeping, and if left

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:17.219
untreated it can eventually lead to death.
As of 2010 it caused around 9,000 deaths per

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:24.970
year, down from 34,000 in 1990.
3. African Honey Bee

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.870
The Afrizanized Honey Bee, also known as the
Killer Bee, are a hybrid species created by

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.130
cross-breeding the African honey bees with
various European honey bees such as the Italian

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.130
bee. They were first introduced to Brazil
in the 1950s to increase honey production.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.180
However, in 1957, 26 swarms accidentally escaped
quarantine and since then have spread throughout

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.530
South and Central America. They arrived in
North America in 1985. They will attack with

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.780
the slightest provocation in large numbers
and will chase the victim much further than

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.650
other types of honey bees and cause thousands
of deaths every year.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.229
2. Fleas
Fleas may look like pesky, harmless critters.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.699
But they are actually directly responsible
for the spread of the Bubonic Plague from

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.900
their rat hosts to humans. Without treatment,
the bubonic plague kills about two thirds

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.190
of infected humans within four days. The Bubonic
plague, among a couple of other plagues, Is

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.310
believed to be the cause of the Black Death
that swept through Europe in the 14th century

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.310
and killed an estimated 25 million people,
or between 30-60% of the European population

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.000
at that time.
1. Anopheles Mosquito

00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:00.289
The Anopheles mosquito is a sub-species of mosquito most known for the transmission
of malaria. The female mosquito carries a

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.449
parasite, which doesn’t harm the mosquito.
When the mosquito bits a human to feed on

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.020
blood, it injects this parasite into the human’s
blood stream. The parasites then travel to

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.389
the liver where they mature and reproduce.
Symptoms of Malaria begin 10 to 15 days after

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:24.389
being bitten, and can cause fever, fatigue,
vomiting, headaches, yellow skin, seizures,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:32.110
coma or even death. In 2012, it’s estimated
that there were over 200 million cases of

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:39.539
malaria, killing over half a million of those
who were infected, many of them children.
