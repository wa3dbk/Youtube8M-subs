00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.900
In one moment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.900
in one small instant in The Walking Dead,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.100
they reach back and quote a 17th century poem by John Donne,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000
A poem called &lt;i&gt;Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions: Meditation XVII.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.900
This moment to me was incredible

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
because in one short phrase, in one utterance

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.500
they captured for me what The Walking Dead was really about.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.750
Chuck, the transient, the old man they find living in a boxcar,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.650
only says a snippet of the full phrase,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000
the part most of us know from Metallica or Hemmingway,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.750
but it's worth repeating in full to understand what's really being referenced.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.000
The sentence Chuck quotes from reads thus:

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.650
&lt;i&gt;"No man is an island, entire of itself;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
&lt;i&gt;every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
&lt;i&gt;If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.200
&lt;i&gt;as well as if a promontory were,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.000
&lt;i&gt;as well as if a manner of thy friend's or of thine own were;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.200
&lt;i&gt;any man's death diminishes me,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
&lt;i&gt;because I am involved in mankind,&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.800
&lt;i&gt;and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.200
&lt;i&gt;it tolls for thee."&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.600
It's important first to note that it's Chuck that says this.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.000
It tells us a great deal about him,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
it illuminates the choices he's about to make.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.900
It shows us that he's much more than simply a "guitar playing hobo”.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
I won't spoil anything here, but for those of you who have played the game,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900
this statement gives us the context we need to understand what he chooses to do shortly thereafter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.300
It also rounds out his character,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.300
it shows him not as a drunk or vagrant,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.500
it shows that for all the problems he may have in his life,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
it's not those that define him.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.900
It shows that of all of the members of your group, he has the greatest sense of the past,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.700
he is perhaps the most literate and of all of the characters in the game,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.600
he may be the only one who, without being self-righteous, is unswervingly moral.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.300
But the quote does more than this:

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.900
it forces us to think about the meaning of the game as whole.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.400
Its very “out of place” nature in a sea of otherwise very well-written but very modern dialog

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.300
calls it out to us and demands that we consider it as more than simply a haphazard reference.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.900
To me, in this moment, we were reminded of what the whole work is saying:

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.500
that each one of us is an incredibly valuable thing.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.900
That even the least of us makes the whole more,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.200
and if we give up on that we give up on being human.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.500
The entire Walking Dead universe is about the loss that occurs for all of us

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
due to a million individual tragedies.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.200
It's not just the post-apocalyptic setting with its lack of conveniences

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.900
that we take for granted in our everyday lives that hammers this home.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.900
It's not the terror inherent in living a life under constant threat.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.400
Rather it's the demonstration of how that loss erodes all of us.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.900
How even the survivors don't survive unscathed

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.200
but in many ways lose parts of their humanity due to losing so much of humanity as a whole.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.400
The entire game series is about how every individual loss is a loss for us;

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.800
not only for Lee or for Clementine but for us personally as players.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.500
Each sacrifice chips away at us and makes us all the more single minded,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.300
focused on the one goal we think we might be able to achieve,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.700
the one remaining act we &lt;b&gt;might&lt;/b&gt; be able to do to retain our humanity,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200
the one redemptive act of saving a child.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.500
And here too is that focus on the larger whole.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.000
While Clementine is clever and at times helpful,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.400
in a strictly pragmatic sense,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200
Lee would simply be better off without her,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.700
but the entire game is focused on this relationship,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.100
on how this tiny human being allows Lee to be more than he is.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400
But the game also makes this point in harsher ways.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.700
One of the most remarkable things about the game to me was that it got me to give up on one of the characters.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.500
It showed me that dehumanization,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.500
that degradation,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.500
by getting me to, in the end, to let one of the characters die.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.300
Any of you who have played the game could probably guess who I'm talking about,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.600
but for those of you who haven't:

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.600
I opted to let a high school kid die.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.900
See how inhumane that sounds? How morally destitute?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.900
If you heard it on the evening news you'd be repulsed,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.400
but in the context of the game it seems justifiable

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500
And yet, in the end, with the way the game closes,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600
I realized he was just some scared kid.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.000
And then you have to face the fact that, within that universe,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.300
given how precious every single life is,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.800
how humanity itself is barely holding on,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.200
you've let another go.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.500
And then you're back, asking for whom the bell tolls.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.000
Because this life, even with all of its bumbling and cowardly acts, is part of a larger whole.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.400
And in its ending it's not only him who has lost something but you.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.100
It's rare that a game can point out to us how precious our own humanity is,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.100
and how quickly life overwhelms us and,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.900
without thinking, we trade it away.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.200
And yet, in one line,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.400
one single moment

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.700
or perhaps that's not fair, perhaps it would be better to say

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.600
'and yet with every aspect of the game'

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.400
the Walking Dead provides just that.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.500
Again, I'm not gonna say this game is perfect,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.500
and we're especially not saying that this analysis is at all required

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.400
to have that experience of understanding your place as part of a larger whole,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.100
but I think it goes to show very clearly that without sacrificing any of the engagement,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
any of what we traditionally think of as a 'game',

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.700
we can wrestle with issues essential to who we are.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.600
And I like that.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.000
See next week for some more Walking Dead!
