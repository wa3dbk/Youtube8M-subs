Hi, Iím Kristen and today Iím going to tell
you how to assemble our very popular, very

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.540
contemporary Pocket Fold invitations. Now
Pocket Folds are great because in one organized,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.770
stylish wrap you can fit your invitation card
and inside of the pocket, your response items,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.580
direction card, reception card, whatever you
happen to have. Now this is an example of

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.609
our rectangular Pocket Fold and we also have
several square Pocket Folds. So Iím going

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.180
to walk you through the process of making
this.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.011
Now Iím going to walk you through the color
combination that I chose for my Pocket Fold

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.790
design and show you the correctly sized components
that fit inside of our square Pocket Folds.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.031
Now Iím choosing to use a 6 º square Stardream
Onyx Pocket Fold and I will be placing it

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:54.989
inside of a 6 Ω inch square Onyx envelope.
Now inside, Iím using a Stardream Opal invitation

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.960
card and this measures 6 by 6 to fit inside
the Pocket Foldís 6 º frame. And inside

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.649
of the pocket, Iíve placed the Stardream
Opal response card and a Onyx response envelope.

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.539
Now of course, I just happen to like this
combination but we have many different color

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.319
combinations that you can choose from for
your own design.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.749
Now Iíve already printed my invitation and
response cards and because this paper has

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.679
a metallic finish, I used a laser printer.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.270
Now my first step will be to adhere my invitation
card to the empty space of the Pocket Fold

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.409
here. Iím going to adhere my invitation card
using Dots which are these round pieces of

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.869
Double Sided Tape. Of course you could also
use a glue stick or Glue Marker which we also

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.929
carry. Now to use these, all you have to do
is peel them off the sheet using the little

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:07.279
tab, place them in the empty space where your
card will be placed, and to reveal the sticky

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:15.510
part of the tape, simply peel the tab. Iíll
peel this one. There we go. Now you only have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.680
to use two of these because theyíre quite
strong, and after theyíre on there, just

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:36.569
line up your invitation card and when you
have it where you want it, simply press down.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:44.250
Next, I will take my pre-printed response
card and place it inside of the envelope,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:56.280
place the whole thing inside of the pocket,
fold it up, and then place it inside of my

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.050
mailing envelope. And thatís all!

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.829

Fold design or designing your own Pocket Fold,
