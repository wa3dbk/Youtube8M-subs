00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.447
- Well hello everyone.

00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:08.102
I hope you're doing well.

00:00:08.102 --> 00:00:10.510
I am proud to be a newly paid member

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.200
of the Indiana Alumni Association.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.105
So even though I'm not
there with you right now,

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:15.939
I feel like I am.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.457
I feel like I'm a part of it.

00:00:17.457 --> 00:00:19.493
I want to say welcome to all volunteers

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:22.040
of Indiana University Alumni Association.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.157
To have a chance to speak to you this way,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.142
to stand in Assembly Hall, is a great,

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:28.021
great feeling.

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:29.042
Its a great honor.

00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:31.818
Its a great honor because
the Hoosier Nation

00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:32.879
has been something.

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.189
I've been here, at the
time of this taping,

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.287
just a little over 50 days.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:38.952
And to be a part of the Hoosier Nation

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:40.304
has been incredible.

00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:41.863
I don't care if you're a Jaguar,

00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:43.586
I don't care if you're a Red Wolf,

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.052
I don't care if you're a Mastodon,

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:46.631
it doesn't make any difference.

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:48.522
We're all part of the Hoosier family,

00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:50.086
and to me that means a lot.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:51.409
It means an awful lot.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.313
With so many living alumni
living in this state,

00:00:54.313 --> 00:00:56.957
that are a part of these
great, great campuses,

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:00.448
and everybody knows on
the outside what it means.

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:02.435
It means that you have class, it means

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:04.954
that you have integrity,
it means that you have

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:07.227
enthusiasm and energy, and it means

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:10.011
that you have a passion for your school.

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:11.762
And that's what's incredible to me.

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:14.445
Because I have seen that in
this short period of time

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:17.138
that I've been the Head
Basketball Coach at IU.

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:19.053
I've seen it in a lot of different ways.

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:20.513
Its been an eventful time for all of us

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.827
in the basketball offices

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.149
as we build the team,
as we try to get a team,

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.078
I should say, as we try to recruit,

00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:27.713
and we try to put ourselves in position

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:29.327
to make all of you proud.

00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.141
But more importantly than
any of that right now,

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:32.791
is to feel that we're a part of this.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.567
That we're part of the great tradition.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.556
Not only the Indiana basketball tradition,

00:01:36.556 --> 00:01:38.465
and you look at all the great players

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.704
that have been a part of this, we have

00:01:39.704 --> 00:01:43.308
56 all Americans that have
come through this program.

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:47.329
Okay, third largest amount of
national championships won,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.342
behind UCLA and Kentucky,
and as you can see

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.135
from behind me, there's five.

00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:52.533
There's room for more, and we'd like

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.336
to do that in our time here.

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:57.223
But to have five, that says a lot.

00:01:57.223 --> 00:01:59.468
The Indiana basketball tradition is good

00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:00.932
as any in the country.

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:03.214
With the Indiana University tradition,

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.941
and all the campuses
that make up this state,

00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:08.293
and all the different
entities that bring us

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:09.978
all to be a part of the Hoosier family

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.508
and the Hoosier Nation,
that says a lot too.

00:02:12.508 --> 00:02:14.852
Even though we don't know
each other individually,

00:02:14.852 --> 00:02:17.585
I do know that I have great
respect for what you do

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:19.682
and I do know that as we move forward,

00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:22.013
everybody on the outside,
that as we continue

00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:25.086
to build the funds and
build the recognition,

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.316
and build the prestige of what it means

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:30.198
to go to one of these
campuses in this great state.

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:31.346
Its important that every one of us

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:32.790
is on the same page.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.255
There's so much that we're tying to

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.795
get accomplished in our program,

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.169
but it starts with three basic premises.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:39.826
Number one is character.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.431
You have got to have
character to be at IU,

00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:43.903
to be at any of these campuses,

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:46.681
and certainly to play inside
of this basketball program.

00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:49.602
It is easily said, not as easily done.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.307
And to have character, alright,

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:53.272
everybody knows that you have it.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.886
And that's exactly what
we're trying to find

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.311
inside of this program.

00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:58.119
We also want to have accountability.

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.944
Accountability for doing the right things.

00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:02.063
Accountability for being
where we're supposed to be.

00:03:02.063 --> 00:03:04.292
With the accountability to one another,

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:06.399
to make sure that everybody understands

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.515
we're a part of something
bigger than ourselves.

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:10.420
And that's exactly what we want the people

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.048
that represent us in this program to feel.

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:15.558
And last and certainly
not least is respect.

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.248
The respect has gotta be enormous.

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:19.743
The respect for one
another, the respect for

00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:22.382
the university, the
respect for the alumni,

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:24.571
all those things are crucial to us.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.808
Well I think I just summed up

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:27.448
what it means in your position.

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:29.375
If you do your job, and you do everything

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.795
that you can do to make
everything better here

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.172
in the sense of character, in the sense of

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.950
accountability, and in
the sense of respect,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.409
things are gonna be great.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.494
They will be great.

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.585
When we got our job here,
I arrived on April first,

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:44.181
and with my family, the next day,

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:46.926
we were introduced to the press
conference on April second,

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.026
and to have former players
be in that building,

00:03:49.026 --> 00:03:51.757
to see our coaches, and to see all the

00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:54.772
alums that had made it in, the faculty

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.421
that had made it in,
the administration that

00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:57.612
made it in.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.885
But all the media that was there,

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:00.443
on a national level and certainly on local

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:03.935
and a statewide level,
it was our first chance

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:06.891
to let everybody know
what this means to us.

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:08.800
And you've heard me say
it, you've seen it on

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.233
shirts, and you're gonna see
it a lot of other places.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.694
It's very easy to sum up
what this is all about.

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:15.651
It's Indiana, it really is.

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:17.134
It's Indiana.

00:04:17.134 --> 00:04:19.073
And it does not matter
if you're on this campus,

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:21.348
it does not matter if
you're on any other campus

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:23.741
in this state, if you are in this state,

00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:26.074
you know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:28.230
And that's exactly what
we're trying to build.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.226
And I am honored to be a
part of your association.

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.085
I am honorer to be a member of it,

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.620
but I'm even more honored
to have an opportunity

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.749
to speak to you.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.468
I hope that everything
else goes great for you,

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:38.988
I hope you have a great year.

00:04:38.988 --> 00:04:41.266
I look forward to all of
us supporting one another.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:43.099
Thanks for your time.
