Hi, this is Rob with VentanaMedia. Camera+
has just expanded to the iPad with new features

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:14.530
that are only available thru the iPad. Let´s
take a look.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.050
The popular iPhone app, Camera+ has arrived
to the iPad. The iPad version has new features

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.970
that are not available to the iPhone version.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.331
This new feature, iCloud syncing, is available
to both, the iPhone and iPad version. This

00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:35.280
will allow you to take photos with your iPhone
or iPod Touch and edit them on your iPad.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.840
This is a huge and nice feature.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.670
Let´s open a photo with Camera+ for iPad.
Go to the upper left. You can either take

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.889
a photo with your iPad or add a photo from
your iPad Photo Library. Now you can also

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.489
add a photo from your Flickr account or your
Facebook account. I´m going to add a photo

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.499
from my iPad Photo Library.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:01.369
I´m going to choose this photo. Then press
import on the bottom right.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:05.000
Touch the photo you want to edit. Then this
drop down menu appears.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You can instantly share this photo on Facebook,
flickr, twitter or email.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.180
Click the edit button to begin editing the
photo.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.360
On the bottom of the app, you still have the
same five main groups that are on the iPhone

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360
app.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.100
Scenes, for applying automatic touch ups.
Adjust, Crops, FX Effects, and Borders.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.530
In scenes, nothing has changed from the iPhone
app. The big changes are in the adjustment

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990
group. In the iPhone app, in the adjust, you
can only rotate or flip the photo.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.030
Now in the iPad app, not only can you rotate
a photo, you can straighten, apply white balance,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.150
add tone. In tone, you have control over exposure,
brightness, contrast and saturation.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.280
Let´s add some saturation.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.740
Remove red eye. Detail, which is sharpening
or blurring. And add a vignette.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.879
Let´s take a look at two other big changes.
Brush effects and layer effects.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:18.849
With brush effects, you can brush on FX effects
exactly where you want that effect to be applied.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.900
Layer effects. You can add two or more FX
Effects in layers and adjust the intensity

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.260
of each layer.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.750
Let´s look at the brush effects. Go to the
FX Effects group. In the FX Effects you still

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:46.329
have the same effects as the iPhone app. Color,
Retro, Special and Analog.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.719
I´ll choose vibrant.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.189
Here´s the brush panel.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:03:04.560
You have a brush, eraser, quick brush settings,
and a mask.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.880
You can set the size of the brush, the softness,
and the intensity.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.109
When using the brush, I like to erase all
and then paint in that effect.

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:31.749
You can use the eraser to erase part of the
effect that you just applied.

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:46.970
OK, that´s it! That´s a basic overview of
the new features from the Camera+ for iPad.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.449
When you purchase this app, make sure you
are downloading Camera+ for iPad. That´s

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:57.290
the name of the app, Camera+ for iPad. It
looks like this. If you download Camera+,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.849
you´re just getting the iPhone version on
your iPad.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.620
