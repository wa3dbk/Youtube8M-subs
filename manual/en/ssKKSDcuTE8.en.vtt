00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.520
We’re still looking at two and a half to
three and a half percent and that is because

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.940
most of the impact of the drought, which is
the big story right now for food prices, is

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.290
expected to be felt in 2013.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:40.800
We’re looking at grocery store prices to
go up three to four percent, which is a range

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.050
that does not include historically normal
food price inflation, which is about two point

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.519
eight, two point nine percent.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.780
So most mostly owing to this drought, how
we have seen it affect crop prices, how we

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.211
expect to see it filtered into retail food
prices, we are looking at 2013 as being the

00:00:55.211 --> 00:01:00.930
year of higher than normal food price inflation
for American consumers.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:12.380
Four to five percent in 2013, but I need to
note that is not entirely because of the drought.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.460
The beef and veal….the whole sector has
been subjected to structural inflation for

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.720
a long time now, since the start of 2011,
because inventories are so low.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.520
The drought is expected to exacerbate this
into heightened inflation throughout 2012

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.920
and into 2013, but when people look at these
forecasts and they see high numbers for beef

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.210
and veal, they shouldn’t think that’s
because the price of corn is going up.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.299
There are bigger, more longer term issues
with those foods.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:49.890
Probably the most importantly in the minds
of most consumers…fruits and vegetables.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.670
They’re having a great year for prices so
far in 2012 and 2013 we do expect normal,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.609
year over year food price inflation on the
order of two to three percent for those foods.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:15.090
The most important mechanism by which this
drought is affecting food prices is we see

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.650
the price of corn go up, that drives up the
price of feed, and in turn the price of animals

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.720
that go to slaughter or animal products.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.760
However, more longer term down the road into
2013 possibly into 2014, we’re going to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:40.840
see these higher corn and soybean prices built
into packaged, processed, more shelf stable

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.760
foods.
