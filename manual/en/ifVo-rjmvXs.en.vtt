00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
I believe we have the original Stig
at the helm of this car.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
This is gonna be fun

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600
this is the Ford Focus ST ..

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.400
.. with a difference. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
We're gonna go on board in this car

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.600
he's basically racing against
somebody on a computer game.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.500
There is our computer game player.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
On the Ford stand

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200
with an on-board view and ...

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 live inside the car.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.759
It's a race to the top of the hill.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.800
In practice I understand that the virtual driver

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
had the edge. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.100
But let's see ....

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
if the real car, which
is ahead at the moment.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.520
Coming through the first
double apex right hander

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.210
into the second part of that 
in the car and the game

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.700
just touching the apex there now ..

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.300
and who will get under the bridge first?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.900
It's the car

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.400
ahead of game at the moment. 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.100
There's the on-board shot 
I was telling you about ..

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.800
as you approach Molecomb over the
blind-brow and into the kink

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.600
Big set of lock-ups there
from our NASCARs from earlier.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.500
Car is ahead coming out of Molecomb
as it heads towards the flint wall.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.670
Which is a very quick and narrow

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.600
right-left flick, keeping out of the wall,
minding the bails on the other side.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200
You have to be inch perfect.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.860
And it's still the car that is
ahead at the moment.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.000
Though long right-hander pop out 
into the sunshine once more.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.200
Round the long left-hander

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.100
to finish the ...

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.000
and the car takes it by a
whisker from the game.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.000
New Focus ST 1.05:13

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.300
GT6 Focus 1.05:23

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.300
That was close.
