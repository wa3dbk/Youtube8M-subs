Hi, Jason here, from Corsair

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Today, I'm going to be demonstrating on how to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
do a wave effect on the brand new RGB mechanical keyboard

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So I've got the software installed.  I'm on the lighting tab

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now I've gone ahead and deleted all my preset groups that I had in here

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because they were doing additional or different effects.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So it's going to be very simple, all you need to do is highlight all the keys

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that you want to set for the wave effect, right click and then you want to create a new group

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So I'm going to name this group "wave 1".  

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And why you're naming this is because all these settings are going to be stored

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to be able to use later or you can share these settings with friends.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So once I have "wave 1" saved, and this is where I want to install the wave,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I go ahead and right click and I do "Assign new lighting"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now you're going to see four groups, but for this demonstration, I'm going to do "Wave"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I'm also going to name it again, because this is going to store in the Lighting database which is located right here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So, once I've created a name, I'm going to go ahead and right click, and add lighting effects for the wave.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So right now, by default, I'm going to hit OK after I've added the lighting

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and now when I hit a key on the keyboard it's going to do one single wave, only once from left to right on the keyboard.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now, if I go back into it and "Edit light", you'll see that there's a number of

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
settings down here where you can do "Start the wave" so it's going to do the wave continuously,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you can do "End" after a certain number of times, you can do it on "Key press" or "Key release"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
One of the more popular things that people will be doing is just on mode Start

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I go ahead on OK and you'll see that the lighting now starts automatically on the keyboard.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now it takes a little bit, a little while to do the wave again, that's because I need to set my velocity and duration settings

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So I'm going to go back in and edit the Light, and I going to increase the velocity decrease my duration,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so that I get a more fluid wave pattern across the keyboard.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So right now, you'll see that it is going fairly fast.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, to get into some of the advanced settings, you're able to make the wave two-sided, so it goes from the middle to the outside.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You're able to use this dial knob to really dial in the direction of the wave that you want to do.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So I encourage you guys to play around with it, find what setting looks the coolest, or is the most functional for you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now in addition to doing only a single color wave, you have the full flexibility to add any color that you want in the wave.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And this is where a lot of people are going to be doing rainbow wave effects on their keyboard.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So for this demonstration I'm just going to select  a few colors for this and just kind of give you an idea of what the wave looks with multiple colors

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, very easy, very fast, to be able to set a wave pattern on your keyboard

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Thank you for watching this tutorial, and we'll be posting many more on some of the more advanced lighting features that you can do with the wave.  Thank You
