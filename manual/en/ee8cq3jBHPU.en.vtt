00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:27.080
In 1992, my mom bought me a Ren &amp; Stimpy postcard
book.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.400
I was only eight years old, so it’s not
like I was doing a lot of traveling…but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.690
still, I had to have that postcard book.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.219
Every card was a little still from the show,
and I spent weeks pouring over each one, trying

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.289
to draw every single pose…it was like my
favorite book.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.359
And 90 percent of the words were “eediot.”

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.899
So before I review Veediots, I feel like you
should know the kind of person that you’re

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:50.899
dealing with.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.030
I saved that postcard book my entire life.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.781
And I promised myself, at the age of eight…that
one day, when I had my own place, I would

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:04.949
frame every one of those stills and hang them
on the walls.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.140
And two decades later, that’s exactly what
I did.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.090
And in fact, they’re hanging around the
caricature that the show’s creator, John

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.310
Kricfalusi, drew personally for me.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.280
Which, by the way, hangs next to the personalized
drawings I’ve got from Jim Smith and Bob

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.620
Camp, the show’s co-creators.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.939
And speaking of whom, Bob and I once sang
the entire Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen song.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.939
Together.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.990
So to say I’m a fan of this show wouldn’t
even be accurate.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719
I’m a product of it.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.530
Most of my understanding of the world around
me was shaped by Ren and Stimpy.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.610
So when I tell you this game sucks?

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.930
That’s honesty.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.750
I want you to know, it makes me feel dirty.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:55.570
And the dirt…the dirt won’t come off.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.899
Veediots! sort of reminds me of a game called
Mickey Mania.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.159
This is like the Ren and Stimpy equivalent.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.640
Every level is based on a different episode
of the show, and you get to play through classic

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640
scenes.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.270
It was a great idea for Mickey, it’s a great
idea for Ren and Stimpy.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.580
But here’s the thing, uh…this game’s
not as good as Mickey Mania.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.220
That game was based on seven cartoons, this
one only has three.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.510
That game’s levels were packed with references,
and characters, and all kinds of crap from

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.720
those cartoons…and this one’s got the
title cards.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.080
And listen, as much as I love Ren and Stimpy
title cards…

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.040
I mean, I could’ve used more Ren and Stimpy.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.569
So you start off in The Boy Who Cried Rat,
which is a great episode, and even though

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.010
the gameplay isn’t great…I mean, it’s
the Boy Who Cried Rat, I’m on board.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.590
But then you beat the level, it only takes
a few minutes…and you’re already moving

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.780
on to a new episode.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.659
This time, it’s Stimpy’s Invention, which
is one of the best episodes.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.760
In a heartbreaking twist, it’s also where
you realize this game can go suck eggs, ‘cause

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.870
this level sucks eggs.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.200
In fact, it’s actually five levels.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.280
So where you at least had the promise of changing
episodes every couple of minutes…now you’re

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.599
stuck in the same terrible levels, with the
same terrible gameplay, for what seems like

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.080
forever before you finally move on to In The
Army.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.760
Then the game ends, and it actually makes
you happy.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760
Like a helmet.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.700
You sick little monkey.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.930
I actually don’t know what’s more disappointing.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.180
The fact that the levels are designed so poorly,
or the fact that they’re are only kind of

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.910
similar to the episodes they’re based on.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.510
Like, there are a million things you could
do with the Stimpy’s Invention level, but

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.540
instead, all five of those levels have the
same look.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.739
Which means the gameplay becomes the focus.

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.590
Which means the repetition and boredom become
the focus.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.920
I mean, if the strength of your game is the
license, use the license.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.790
References, characters, scenery…I mean,
I’d be fine with a bad Ren and Stimpy game

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.030
that feels like Ren and Stimpy.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.160
Aside from the music and a few nice sprites,
this doesn’t feel much like Ren and Stimpy.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.069
Not enough vitamin F.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.310
But I guess there are a few nice sprites.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.860
Some of them actually maintain the Spumco
style, which is awesome.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.080
But at the same time, it only makes you wish
the game did, as a whole.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.350
Like, I could write this game in five minutes.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.730
You’d start by escaping the pound from Big
House Blues, then Stimpy has to run from Muddy

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.020
Mudskipper, like in Stimpy’s Big Day, then
you have to subdue Ren during his breakdown

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.020
in Space Madness…

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.390
I mean, the game writes itself.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:46.480
Instead, you get three cartoons, and five
levels about Bunsen burners.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.800
Ren and Stimpy was a groundbreaking show that
changed cartoons and set the tone for the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.000
next decade of animation.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.880
Ren and Stimpy video games didn’t have the
same effect.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.290
And this one’s probably one of the worst.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.380
Now, the main version of Veediots! was released
for home consoles, and that one’s at least

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.710
better…but this one, you want to stay away
from.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.450
And believe me, I take no pleasure in saying
that.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.260
I have Ren and Stimpy VHS tapes for no other
reason than they’re Ren and Stimpy VHS tapes,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.550
and even I wouldn't want Veediots! for the
original Game Boy.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.000
A huge thanks to our pal Casey from Wenatchee,
Washington, for sending this in, though.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.210
He sent it specifically for me, too.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.210
Thanks, Casey!

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.050
I hope you get a fridge with a padlock for
Christmas.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.340
And huge pectoral muscles.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.630
Hopefully, you don’t just get another copy
of this.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.100
No, sir, I don’t like it.
