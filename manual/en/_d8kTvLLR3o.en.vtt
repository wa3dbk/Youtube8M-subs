00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.670
Hi, today I'm showing you our Color Splash
Speedway.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.040
It's a Cars 2 edition of the Color Changers
set.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.699
And this you can purchase only at Toys R Us.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.920
I got it on sale for $29.99.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.770
I think it's normally between $35 and 40 dollars.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.280
Here's the box, it comes with this track that
we have

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.070
set up here.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.570
And it also come with this Finn McMissile.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.840
He changes from a gray blue to more of a royal
blue

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
color.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.190
And I will show that to you.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.560
This set, just as an overview, has 2 tracks.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.940
This lower track leads to hot water.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.920
And you can put hot water just in this orange
cup.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.250
I'll add that now.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.600
It also comes with a brush, that I'll show
you.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.840
And it comes with an upper track here.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.780
Where you can put cold water above or even
below in this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.780
cup.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.740
And I'll show you both of those as well.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.799
I always add some ice to the water just to
make sure

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.420
it's super cold.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.259
It also has a little drying section right
here.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.590
So I'll start with the Finn that comes with
the set.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.229
And here's my collection of Color Changers
Cars.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.380
I have Tow Truck Tom, two different Darrell
Cartrips.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.369
One that goes from white to purple.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.140
And one that goes from white to blue.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.369
Ramone and he's the one that comes with the
House of

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.959
Body Art Set.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.770
Flo, Boost, Snotrod, Wingo, Sheriff.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.919
Two Different Lightning Mcqueen.

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.209
This is the Cars 2 Lightning.

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.110
This is the original Cars Lightning.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.039
And a Finn McMissile that was sold separately.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.250
Ok, let's show you how this works.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.560
I'll use the Finn that comes with the set.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.772
Just push this lever back, it works like a
lot of the

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:04.130
other Mattel toys.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.389
With levers.

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.679
You press this button to shoot them up.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.910
To cold water, first you have to press this
orange

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.910
button.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.560
I will do that now.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.210
And see how he got splashed, he is not fully
dark blue

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.280
because he went through the spray so fast.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.460
But you can use this, just pull the orange
lever to dry

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.460
him off.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.190
Kind of a cool feature.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.480
And then he can drive down and join the other
cars.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.150
Or he can if we want to change him back to
the light

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.150
blue he can do that now.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.580
So now that this Finn McMissile Color Changer
is blue,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.230
we can put him in warm water.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.350
To do that, we reload this lever, push it
back just half

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.230
way.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.420
And then you hold down this red button.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.110
For him to go on the lower track.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.390
So now he is here.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.090
There is 2 ways to play with this.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:24.430
You can either dip
him in the warm water or you can paint him

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.510
with the
brush.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.190
Or you can pour the hot water on him.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:40.569
I will put him back and now let's do some
more Color

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.569
Changers Cars.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.569
Let's change Sherriff.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.630
Just pull the lever back.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.510
Also you will need to refill the cold water.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.880
All the
water goes from the red bucket to the blue.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:05.870
Just use the
handle and pour it back easily.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.870
Here we go.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.870
We are all set up again.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.670
I will press the orange button again, start
the shower.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.000
There we go, now Sheriff is mostly black with
some of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.250
the teal green.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.930
Lets dry him off again.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.099
And then have him go down and we can do the
warm water.

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.300
Just load the lever half way.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.770
Push the button.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.470
This time I will just dip him.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.110
Here you go.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.400
Now let's do Color Changers Boost.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.819
He changes from light purple to dark purple.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.159
Load up Boost.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.860
This is a lot more complicated than Ramone's
House of

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.069
Body Art but I think it's more fun as well.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:11.080
Definitely more of an older kid toy.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.889
I'll press the orange button.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.939
Ahh!!!

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.809
Not enough power on that.

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:26.689
You can even have him fall down and turn a
nice dark

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:27.699
purple.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:37.029
Let's push Boost down the rest of the way
and dry him

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.029
off.

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:43.070
We'll put him in the hot water too, just press
this red

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.849
button.

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:58.169
And I'll just push the hot water on Boost.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.499
There you have it.

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:02.279
Please comment if you have any questions.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.370
And subscribe as well.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.219
Thank you.
