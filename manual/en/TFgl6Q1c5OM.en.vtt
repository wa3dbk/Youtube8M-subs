00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.100
Hello, I'm...

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.700
...Huictor Huevillo...

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.900
...and today...

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.000
   ...we are here, 
in this living-in unit, 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.200
almost familiar, unit. 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.900
 And I feel honored 
and privileged to be me, 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600
the herald of the news, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 of the two eggs who 
will be expelled today. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800
However, 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.900
   my heart is prey 
of a terrible, terrible, 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
terrible pain that corrodes...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.000
Hurry up!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Bless you!

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
I'm ready, in case 
  I'm expelled.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.600
       I've designed a
sonic-multidimensional teleporter, 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.600
  which will transport me, 
through space-temporal worms, 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.700
to anywhere I want. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100
The first expelled, 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.300
the first egg...

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.500
...that...

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.600
...unfortunately has to 
   leave the fridge...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.700
...this week, 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
is...

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.900
When my grandma used to
  put me in her tub, 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.400
   when I was barely 
thirty five years old...

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Come on! Don't #$%&amp;!

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.800
All right.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.300
You, Huasta, due to...

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400
...the plot...

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.100
...against you...

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.400
...well you have nothing 
    to worry about.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.100
Let me put it like this...
     "You're out". 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.000
You're out!

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.400
Egg Brother destroys 
 masses' intelect...

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.500
Sons of a hen!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.500
The second expelled...

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.200
...is a Pisces...

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.000
Oh, no!

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.900
My Huetlacua!

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.000
No, no, no, I'm sorry! 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.400
Huevardo, no.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.900
It's not you. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.500
I'm Aquarius, excuse me...

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.000
Huernoldo, get Huevardo 
   off the spoon... 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll do it myself. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.500
What about the second expelled?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.200
Who is it, brother?
