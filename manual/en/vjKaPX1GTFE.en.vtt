Hey it’s JJ Virgin, author of the New York
Times bestseller, the virgin diet, the new

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.740
virgin diet cookbook and creator of the virgin
diet tool kit.&nbsp;

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.820
You know there’s an urgan legend rolling
around that makes me a bit crazy and I am

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.190
determined to prove that it is not true..and
that is that it costs more to eat healthy.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.890
&nbsp; So I sacrificed a Saturday night and roamed
the supermarket aisles so that I could lay

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.480
this myth to rest once of for all.&nbsp;

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.370
First I filled up a cart with a week’s worth
of “healthy food” – what most people

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.510
buy in an effort to be healthy and at this
point we both know really isn’t.&nbsp;

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.820
I gotta tell you, this was really hard…I
actually walked around and cart stalked people

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.160
to see what they were buying!&nbsp;

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.579
Then I bought a week’s worth of the stuff
I normally get.&nbsp;

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.250
I think you are going to be surprised at the
results, I know I was.&nbsp;

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.110
But before I share them I want to address
what you might be tempted to think…oh I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.049
could get this stuff cheaper at a warehouse
store or if I clipped coupons or the prices

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.759
are different in my community, and that’s
true but I wanted to give you an example close

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.420
to home and do my best to compare apples to
apples…sorry I just couldn’t resist that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.420
pun!

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.719
Okay are you ready….so for a week’s worth
of a cart of someone trying to make reasonably

00:01:22.719 --> 00:02:04.859
healthy choices the grand total was $172.15.&nbsp;

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.429
For my cart of healthy food that also included
a week’s worth of Virgin Diet shakes and

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.069
a few Virgin Diet bars the grand total is
$132.88.&nbsp;

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:27.329
And by the way I’ve included grass fed beef
and lots of organic choices here.&nbsp;

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.329
&nbsp;

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.329
Crazy difference huh?&nbsp;

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:45.150
Let’s do that math, that’s a 
savings of&nbsp; $39.27 a week or 157.08 a month

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:54.140
or 1884.96 a year – heck that’s a vacation!&nbsp;

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.650
So clearly it doesn’t cost more to eat healthy,
it actually costs less!&nbsp;

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.810
And this is without some of my favorite budget
saving techniques like shopping at farmers

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.300
markets and joining a collective.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.709
I have a guide with more of these tips in
the tool kit.&nbsp;

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.359
So I hope that we can lay that urban legend
of it costing more to eat healthy to rest,

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.359
deal?&nbsp;
