[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.460
- Hello.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.301
I'm John White.

00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:08.550
Today we're going to be
talking about some garden pest

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.090
problems, and looking at some
of the damage that pests do.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.060
And one of the things that's
real common in summer gardens

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.530
is squash.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.190
And unfortunately, one of the
major insect problems on squash

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.110
is the squash bug.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.360
Matter of fact, it's so
prevalent that a lot of people

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.660
think the seed comes
with the squash bug eggs.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.230
But the first thing we want
to do is inspect the plant.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.840
So we want to check the
foliage, both the underside

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.000
and upper side of the leaves.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.730
If we see any signs of
little hard, brown eggs

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.105
on either the underside or
the above part of the leaf--

00:00:45.105 --> 00:00:48.090
it can be on the
stalks, maybe even

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.920
find it down close
to the ground,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.530
so you want to do a real
thorough inspection.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
If you can find where
those eggs are being laid,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.130
and either get that
piece of leaf torn off,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.420
or be able to remove that
stem that the eggs are on,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.280
you're way ahead of the
game, because that's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.430
taking care of the squash before
it even shows up, so we're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.230
getting rid of it that way.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.890
If you don't catch
them early enough,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.450
then they will go into the
nymph stage, where they're just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.280
the young, as
newly hatched, they

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.530
will crawl out and be
crawling all over the plant.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.770
If you are going to use an
insecticide, whether it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.590
organic or inorganic,
that is a good time

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.970
to use the insecticide,
because the young

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.330
are much easier to kill
off than the older adults.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.700
And then of course, the
adults are a brownish color.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.329
They avoid sunlight,
so a lot of times

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.870
you will not see
them because they'll

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.600
be hiding on the
underside of leaves,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.640
or they'll be on the
back side of the stem

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.380
when you're trying to find them.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
So one of the ways to keep
squash bug off, of course,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.610
is to get a lot of
sunlight reflected.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.980
People have used
aluminum foil mulch

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.239
to get the light to
bounce back and catch some

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.780
of the undersides
of leaves, and that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.880
does help as the
plant's young, but as it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.580
gets older and
overgrows the foil,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.850
then the squash bug
does move back in.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.830
So you want to be
careful with that.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.370
But there are some
insecticides that are labeled.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.270
You want to be careful because
the squash plant is insect

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.570
pollinated.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.200
So if you're using a
lot of insecticide that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.960
are dangerous to bees
and pollinating insects,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.750
you will kill off
your insects that are

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.220
helping you produce your crop.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.160
So you want to be
careful on that.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.640
Other problems that we have
in this particular garden,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.250
we've had a lot of
striped cucumber beetle--

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.370
or excuse me-- spotted
cucumber beetle.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.430
And it's been hitting the
squash over here on the beans.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.190
We can see that there's
a lot of damage that's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.420
been done to the foliage.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.390
We can see all the
holes in the foliage,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.800
and you see the cucumber beetles
just flying all over the place.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.930
And that is a spotted
cucumber beetle.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.440
It is a foliage-eating
insect, so it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.380
will do quite a bit of damage
to the foliage on your plants.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.290
And again, there are several
different insecticides,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.890
both organic and inorganic,
that you can use.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.320
Make sure they are labeled
on that particular crop

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.720
that you're using, and that
you make sure that you follow

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.320
the directions on the
container before you put it

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.540
on the product.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.210
We also have an insect
called a flea beetle,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.560
and this is a little tiny
metallic, blue, black beetle.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.260
It's also foliage
eater, and it likes

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.430
to hit eggplant,
sometimes your peppers,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.540
and you'll, a lot of times,
find it on some of your weeds.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.350
And it chews little tiny
holes into the leaves.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.560
And again, that insect
needs to be controlled.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.650
It will do quite a bit
of damage to the foliage

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.410
on your vegetable plant.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.040
So we want to get
those taken care of.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.066
And last but not least,
with the dry weather

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.440
that we've been having in the
southern part of the state,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.210
is grasshoppers.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.340
And as a lot of our foliage
on the range land and maces

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.310
has began to dry
off with the heat,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.140
those insects have
moved in to where

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.780
they can find greener
pastures, and a lot of times,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.079
it's your yard that that's
the green part on it.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.120
So we want to identify
these insects.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.480
Be sure you know what is
harmful insect and what is not,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.060
and be able to get
those controlled

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.640
and get them taken care
of before you have damage

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.100
done to your particular crop.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.830
So it's important to
identify the pest,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.980
and you can contact your
county extension office,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.190
get that sample taken in, get
it identified so that you're not

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.290
killing off beneficial insects.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.550
Determine what kind of control
strategy you're going to use.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.740
If it's a chemical
strategy, you want

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.420
to make sure that
you read the label,

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.720
read the directions carefully
and thoroughly, and make sure

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.210
that it can be used on
that particular crop

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.560
and you wait the recommended
amount of time before harvest.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.150
So that is real important.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.600
So again, just get
the insect identified,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.520
and then you can match
up the control method

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.900
once you've got it identified.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.200
So again, bring those samples
into your county extension

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.870
office, and we can
get those identified

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.120
so that you can get
some control and get

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.180
a good bountiful
harvest off your garden.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.330
