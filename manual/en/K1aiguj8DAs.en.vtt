00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:13.030
Hello, dear viewers.

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.634
This is another episode of "Let's sum up".

00:00:17.768 --> 00:00:22.339
Now I'll briefly describe you the match between Evil Geniuses and EHOME.

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:25.275
Winner Bracket semifinal.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:30.147
It was quite interesting, but what's important - it proved that

00:00:30.147 --> 00:00:35.952
in modern dota, if you gain early advantage - you will win.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.958
In before, we had three maps, EHOME took the first one.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.265
In's hard to highlight something from mid game or late,

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:52.502
as the game ended with EG scored only 3 kills.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:01:00.744
Except from some slight mistakes during the laning stage, EHOME made no mistakes later.

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:03.713
Plus, their heroes were more efficient.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:08.351
The main advantage was gained by Dark See, who was was successfully jungling.

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:15.859
EG's offlaner, Earthshaker, on the opposite, couldn't jungle at all.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:21.164
He was looking for the gold in teamfights, but the were no kills for EG.

00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:24.501
Of course, Cty performed at high level.

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:28.438
This match was a duel of Cty and Sumail,

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.540
two talented players.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.811
One from China, another - from Pakistan, but in American team.

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.948
Cty and his Storm Spirit were incredible.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:42.119
By the way, the final score was 3:22, which symbolizes.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.589
And the time was 32:22. Point taken.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.726
That's basically all that I can tell.

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:53.530
Let's move to the second map, which also ended fast,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.768
with the deciding moment somewhere around minute 10.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:04.007
But I, a lot of analysts and players

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.776
were forced to rethink the balance of the game.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.150
EG demonstrated their prepared strategy and laspicked Techies.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.686
But they didn't pick Tusk,

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:20.290
they prefered Bloodseeker, who also makes a nice combo with a Techies.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.562
They also picked Ember Spirit, who won his lane confidently.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.067
Everything was decided in first 5-6 minutes.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:35.572
EG took control of the map, Seeker was running with a crazy movespeed,

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.241
Techies was planting mines.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:43.246
EHOME suffered a lot as they lacked control and fixation.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:44.915
Sumail did what he wanted.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:50.420
That victory was easy for EG, though, EHOME struggled.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.959
I'd also point out the early stage, where Sumail did a great job against Razor.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.497
Despite he lacked creeps, he used every gank opportunity.

00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:05.135
And Aui, the guy who created the petition about removing Techies from Dota,

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:08.004
performed brilliantly on Techies.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.640
And the third map.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.177
Again, interesting pick.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:18.248
Windranger by EG fitted the draft perfectly.

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:22.852
She was hard to deal with, even though EHOME had control, as Winter's Curse

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:26.923
and Storm with Vortex.

00:03:27.157 --> 00:03:31.761
But team had granted Sumail comfortable start, after which

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:33.863
it was impossible to catch him.

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:37.701
In whole bo3 and in this game particularly, we saw only few kills.

00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:42.405
And the most important were in the beginning of games.

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:47.410
Step by step, gaining advantage, killing Phoenix and Storm,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.914
kinng WD, taking full control,

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:52.983
with a Blink on BH and WR,

00:03:52.983 --> 00:03:59.189
EG just outfarmed their opponent and won due to that advantage.

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:01.324
We saw three great macro games.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:06.663
In some way, EG's macro was built on Sumail's micro.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.633
But nevertheless, their strategies were smart.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.736
So, EHOME fall to lower bracket,

00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:18.808
tomorrow they will play against the winner of

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:20.977
VG vs MVP.

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:25.282
