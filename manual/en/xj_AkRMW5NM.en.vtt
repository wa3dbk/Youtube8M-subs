Hello, this is Simple Everyday Wear to Work
Styles – Just Set It and Forget It.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.360
It’s hard enough dragging yourself out of
bed on Monday; it’s even harder when you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.610
realize that you have to clothe yourself to
get there… that is, of course, unless you

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.900
want to have a very cold and uncomfortable
conversation with Human Resources while you’re

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.659
wearing your birthday suit.

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:25.980
There has to be simple, everyday, wear to
work styles that will make your life easier.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.099
I mean, how is it possible that we can put
a Rover on Mars and still have no solution

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.969
to this most basic everyday problem?

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.190
I mean, can’t you just wake up in the morning
and there’s a piece of paper taped to your

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.720
closet door that shows you what you’re supposed
to wear?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.410
Well, today is your lucky day.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.230
Pull out a pen and paper and take some notes,
and you can tape it to your closet door.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:01.059
Here is your simple everyday wear to work
style schedule:

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.909
On Monday, wear a black pencil skirt with
a denim blouse worn untucked.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.760
Put a black belt around the denim shirt.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.070
Complete the outfit with a black handbag and
black high heels or black ankle boots, as

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.070
shown here.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.580
For colder weather, you can wear this outfit
with a pair of thick black tights.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.000
On Tuesday, dress in a black or dark gray
pantsuit, worn with a stylish t-shirt.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Complete the outfit with a pair of black high
heels.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500
On Wednesday, get a black or brown leather
knee-length skirt.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.460
It could be a faux leather skirt for the more
budget-conscious or the more animal conscious;

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.850
nothing wrong with faux leather.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.570
You’re going to wear this with a tucked
in white button-up blouse and black or brown

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.210
knee-high boots, whichever match the skirt.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.840
The boots can either be the flat riding boots,
or you can be extra chic and add a little

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.750
bit of heel height like the one shown here.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.610
On Thursday, you’re going to wear those
same black or gray pants that you wore on

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.610
Tuesday.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.070
You’re going to top off the outfit with
a colored blouse that has a tie at the neck

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.790
that can be tied into a bow, as shown here.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.140
Tuck the blouse into the pants and accessorize
the outfit with a black belt and a pair of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.750
black high heels.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.310
On Friday, which is casual Friday in many
workplaces, you can actually put on a pair

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.670
of dark denim jeans, a white top, an embellished
cardigan that has some beading or sequins.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.470
Complete the outfit with a pair of black ballet
flats.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.470
And there you go.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.280
Those are 5 outfits that you can wear to work.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.440
So I’m going to give you a little bit more
variety, because can we make more variety

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440
out of these outfits?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.600
Of course we can.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.710
Let’s say it’s the next week.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.790
What can you do to mix things up?

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.290
All you’re going to do is take the bottoms
and move them forward one day.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.319
So you can see, now the black pencil skirt
is paired with the gray blazer and t-shirt

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.860
and the pair of black high heels.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.350
Still a very chic outfit.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.570
And as you can see, you now have 10 outfits
that you can wear to work.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.209
Can we do even more mixing and matching?

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.100
Can we make even more variety from these different
outfits?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.160
Of course we can.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.350
Why else would I be making this video?

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.540
So let’s say it is the third week.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.540
What can you do?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
Well, you’re actually going to take the
tops and move them back a day.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.330
What does that look like?

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.330
Here’s what it looks like.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.270
Now that same black pencil skirt is paired
with a white button-up blouse and black heels,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.060
still very classic, very chic, and there you
go; you have 15 outfits to wear to work.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.100
I told you, you should’ve been taking notes.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.020
Hopefully you got the pen and paper out now.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.590
You can always go back and write this down.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.560
