00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.540
property and model releases is a grey
area for most of us

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.919
there are a few things you need to avoid
when photographing for pocketstock

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:22.919
such as logos and trademarks brand
names and profanities

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.179
even if you have a model release for
superbad girl you still can't show her like

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.179
this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.460
drinking her favorite branded refreshment

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.680
let's take a look at model releases and property 
releases in more detail

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.650
the rule for model releases is really
quite simple

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.410
you need to have a signed model release
for every recognizable person in every

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.880
shot you take

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.360
as well as models this also includes
self-portraits shots of your friends and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.930
also family members

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.210
anyone recognizable in fact

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.500
for example

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.070
here's john and his friend lucy

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.110
out and about taking pictures around
london

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.950
john is taking some great shots of lucy
and when he gets home he decides to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.440
upload them to his pocketstock account

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.250
oh dear john can't upload his
edited images because he needs a model

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850
release

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.590
let's start again

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.920
this time before he starts taking
pictures of lucy

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.060
john gets her to sign a model release

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.830
he downloaded this one from the pocketstock
site before he came out

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.119
you don't have to use our releases however

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.350
once the release is signed john knows that any
good shots of lucy from today can be

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.860
uploaded to pocketstock

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.570
back to john and lucy who are still out and
about seeing the sights of london

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.040
john decides he wants to shoot the
london eye

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.110
but hold on a minute

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.990
that's just pause here because his is where
john needs to know about property

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.469
releases

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.669
the rules of property releases are quite
simple

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:23.029
you usually need a property release for any
indoor shots where the interior is

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:27.730
recognizable even if it's your grans
house

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.619
for outdoors most public buildings will
not require a property release

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:38.079
if it's a privately owned building and it's the
main subject to your shot

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.359
the chances are you will need a property
release

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.619
as a rule if you have to pay an entrance
fee to get in somewhere

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.050
you will need a release for your images

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.849
or if it's owned by an individual or corporation

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.159
you may also need one

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.109
so back to john and lucy at the london eye

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.459
john knows that the london eye is a
privately owned commercial tourist

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.209
attraction

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.869
if he shoots the london eye on its own

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.349
we wouldn't accept it

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.499
if it's part of the skyline that's fine

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.249
if he takes a picture of lucy in front
of it

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.109
that's fine too

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.369
john knows what he's doing though and as
you can see in these examples he takes

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.369
lots of different shots using lucy in
the foreground

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.080
that can all be used without a

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.439
property release

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.939
for the wheel
