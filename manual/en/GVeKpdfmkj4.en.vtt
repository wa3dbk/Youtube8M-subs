00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.179
Okay.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.720
So how do you place your fingers and hands
on this instrument?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.520
Well, the tone bar you should be holding in
your left hand.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.750
Something along these lines.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.520
Sort of nestled between your first two fingers
with your thumb supporting it.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.700
I bend my finger a little bit here and sort
of press down a little bit.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.320
You don't want to be pushing down but you
definitely need to keep good contact with

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
the strings.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.020
You don't want to be just sort of rattling
around.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.100
And a little, you know, thrown in a just a
little bravado as the string as the note or

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.850
chord is decaying.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.310
Just a little bit.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.610
You also want these fingers to be at least
partly laying against the strings so that

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.049
you mute any rattling sound that's coming
from the other side of the bar.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.650
So it's sort of... this is the main sweet
spot here.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.110
This is the action.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.950
Speaking of sweet spots you want to try to
slide the bar along so that maybe around here

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
is really where the, where you're focusing
on.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.070
So, don't just keep it locked in one position
like this.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.060
Try to follow a little bit as you're going
along so that this part is of the tone bar

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.070
is where you're really working.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.390
As far as this hand goes, well the further,
the closer to the bridge you get the more,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.000
the more treble-y and sharp sound you're going
to get.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.180
Where a more mellow sound happens when you
play more in the middle.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.229
You want your hand to be slightly curved so
that the fingers are not and you want the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.700
thumb and the fingers to sort of get out of
each others way.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.810
The thumb is sort of.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.850
The thumb forefront or closer to the left
and the fingers behind it like that.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.850
The thumb goes forward.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:14.450
The fingers come back.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.159
You want the picks, again, to be bent slightly
so that you are striking the strings as much

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.859
straight on as you possibly can.

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:28.310
I keep my finger a little hooked over here
and straightened out so that you block a little

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.310
bit.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.559
You have no unwanted clutter from the strings.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:35.559
That's pretty much it.

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:40.569
Again, you know, a brighter a janglier sound
as you get near the bridge.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:48.939
A mellower, more sort of a chesty more crooning
sound as you get in the middle of the neck.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.840
That's pretty much it as far as the position
of the hands.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.840
Don't hit hard.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.029
You know, it's a light kind of feel.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.469
You don't have to dig in too much and that's
pretty much it for what your hands do.
