As we’ve seen, fast food can be very very
high in sodium and also fat. Normally the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.780
unhealthy fat like trans fat. So today I’m
going to show you how to make some fries at

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.004
home. These are oven sweet potato fries that
are a great source of healthy nutrients as

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:36.240
well as fiber and also a fun thing to have
at home instead of fast food. A lot healthier.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.200
So we have this sweet potato cut into strips
like fries. We’re going to add the olive

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.670
oil and the salt and pepper. And that’s
our oven being ready, its pre-heated as our

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:56.250
recipe says preheated to 450. And then you’re
going to mix that olive oil, salt and pepper

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.080
around so you make sure that every fry is
covered in some olive oil. Ok, and then we

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.950
have out prepared baking sheet. I sprayed
that with cooking spray. You’re going to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.590
spread these out. Try to make them even. You
don’t want any fry covering another one.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.070
So you want them all even on the pan. And
then you’re going to have a little olive

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:28.510
oil left over in the bowl and you’re going
to sprinkle the remaining olive oil over some

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.709
of the fries like so. And we’re going to
put them in the oven for about 20 minutes.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.810
But you really need to watch them depending
on your oven. You want to kind of flip them

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.330
occasionally if they look like they’re getting
too dark. So we’re going to put this in

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:53.439
the oven and we’re going to cook these up.
And here are out finished oven sweet potato

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.729
fries. This is one serving, that whole potato
was two servings but each serving is 130 calories

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.240
and 5 grams of fat. It’s got the healthy
fat from the olive oil. So here’s a way

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.200
you can have fast food at home.
