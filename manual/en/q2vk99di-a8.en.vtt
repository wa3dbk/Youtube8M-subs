NIKA: Rated T for Teen.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.400
Summoners, I am Nika, and before we go any further, we're gonna talk about some tattoos.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.100
Yep, that's a thing we're doin',

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.500
because more and more we're seeing fabulous League references displayed on the bodies of our players.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.200
It's fascinating to see what means the most to them... let's check it out.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.200
It's one thing to have an ace up your sleeve, but this is an entire Heartbreaking crossbow.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.600
Ah, a lament for the broken Hearts of Gold... right under that awesome cursive tattoo.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.100
Ever needed some pep in your step? This'll take care of it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Never let anyone sneak up on you... EVER... again.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Beware about showing this tattoo in public, or you might be dragging people behind you.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.000
There's no reason to hide your eccentric side, embrace your inner mad scientist!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.500
And strike fear into anyone you meet, provided you're wearing a tank top.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.600
Those are pretty intense.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.200
It's a permanent mark on your body... to be honest, I'm waiting to see someone get tatted up like Brand.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.200
There's something about fire and ice that Skyefire finds irresistible.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
Perhaps they're the only ones who can handle one another?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.300
Either way, I'll admit it's gettin' a little hot in here. Phew!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.700
Oh look at me, all breathy over a little romance! It's like you think I'd been charmed or something.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.900
Oh that is exactly the case!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.100
Kima merged her style with one of her favorite pinup artists to make Ahri bubbly as can be.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.300
In her signature style, as soon as you lay eyes on this foxy lady, how can you turn away?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
Are you guys out of breath? Because, you know... balloons?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.000
This Baaalloon Blitz was done in a few hours by three different people headed up by Quondem, and he thinks he's the passionate one.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.100
Standing over 9 feet tall, that's... that's about right for the Golem.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.600
So what's the occasion anyway? Is it a dress up affair, or... oh, can I bring my axe?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.600
Darius takes his axe with him everywhere and Shadow Fergo made one little enough that you can take one with you too!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900
This tiny replica makes me all jealous. I want one.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.400
Why let Darius have all the fun? We are well accustomed to this show stealer taking center stage,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
and Draven certainly stole the attention of Teknoman Omega's photography.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.500
Shinrajunkie cuts a cool figure in the crowd of this anime convention, his rockstar persona shining through just right.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.100
It takes more than a great costume to make a character perfect, but this Draven has it all.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.500
That wraps up this week with wicked style, so it's time for you to rock that lane like it's your own center stage.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
Go on, it's game time. We will see you next episode!
