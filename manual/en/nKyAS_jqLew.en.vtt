00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.000
I know I'm gonna revive
When I am...on the road

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500
I've got nowhere to hide
When I am...on the road

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.800
And there's no use in wondering what
Made you feel like parting from me then, girl

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.700
How many more tears must I shed
So as to melt the frigid wall of time?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I'm gonna break it
Have no fear...on the road

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You know I'm sure to make it
No matter what's...on the road

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.500
I know too well it's very hard
It's just barking for the silver moon.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.500
But I don't care how long it takes,
As long as she lights up my way in the gloom

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.500
Until the very moment
When I see you again

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.500
I'll keep speeding along the road to the sun
The burning sun!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.800
Hear the roars of my car

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm nearly round the bend

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
Searching for the love that we did share

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
There's no one who can stop me now
