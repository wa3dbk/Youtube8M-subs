00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.860
Welcome to AdoramaTV. My name is Marcin Lewandowski and I'm a professional photographer.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:21.500
The lens we will have a look at this time is Nikon's latest 70-200mm F2.8, or to call it by its full name,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:33.949
Nikon 70-200 F2.8 G AFS VR2 NIKKOR EDIF. This is the workhorse of any

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.989
professional working photographer and
latest installment in Nikon's long tradition of making

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.880
the fast telephoto zooms. It is simply a superb lens. So let's have a look at it.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.839
As expected from a lens that is geared towards professional

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.879
and advanced amateur photographers, its built quality is just stunning.

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.390
All-metal body and the rubber seals
protecting it from moisture and dust

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.199
allows you to shoot all day long in
pouring rain or extreme conditions

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.220
without any problems.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.119
The zoom and focus rings are intuitively
positioned and covered with corrugated

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.800
rubber for optimal grip. The lens is
nicely balanced which helps when you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.300
work with it for hours at a time. Just
looking at the construction of this telephoto

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.820
zoom, it has seven extra low
dispersion glass elements which helps

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.960
obtain optimum correction of chromatic
aberrations. This, alongside the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.140
nanocrystal coating, guarantees a superior image quality.There is excellent

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.780
resolution and good contrast from the
mid-range 70mm up

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.280
to the compressed view of the long 200mm end. The bokeh on the out

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.400
of focus background elements has a very
organic feel to it and so far I have

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.690
never been disappointed with the results. The switches on the lens barrel give

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.850
quick access to activate different
settings for auto focus and vibration-reduction systems.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.619
With auto-focus we have three settings.
AM, which provides manual focus

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.940
override kicking in only after
decisively turning the focusing ring to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.200
avoid override of AF with the slightest
move. That option is available in any setting

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.090
where manual override is instantaneous. The third position is M, which turns on manual

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.690
control, disabling auto focus. As we are
on the auto focusing this lens is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.700
incredibly quick to focus and does it
with great accuracy. The addition of the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.459
silent wave motor and internal focusing
mechanism makes it an even better

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.950
performer throughout the whole range
of its focal length. The vibrant

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.570
reduction tool give four stops of advantage when compared to lenses without it.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.910
There are two settings in addition to the
usual on/off switch. Normal and active.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.400
The normal setting is designed to use with shooting handheld and automatically and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
accurately detects panic. The active
settings is for use when photographing

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.600
from a moving vehicle or other unstable
positions and does an amazing job saving

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.670
us from unwanted blur. If on top of all
that you will get into a habit of taking a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.330
few extra frames at very low shutter
speeds, you will be practically blur-proof.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.200
One additional thing on the lens barrel is
the tripod ring with foot which you can

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.140
easily turn into any position or even
remove and you'd still be able to use the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.480
lens with tripod if you need. If you
think seriously about your professional

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.970
kit and equipment, this lens is a must
as it will work for you in a vast variety

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.239
of setups and situations, always reliably
delivering with its impeccable performance.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.980
It's used by a variety of professional
photographers and proves to be a great

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.350
tool for stage and sports, portrait and
wedding as well as photojournalistic and

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.120
low light work, even in hard conditions.
This lens is an impressive performer

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.299
on all levels from its built quality,
zoom range and fast aperture to focusing

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.130
speed accuracy and sharpness, it proves
to be an outstanding tool which will serve

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.410
you for many years, outlasting many camera bodies you will use along the way.
