Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.040
My name is Sahar Golestani.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.310
I've been working with our
publishers and developers

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.180
at Google for three years
trying to understand

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.380
what are your needs, what
makes you happy, where

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.340
can we as Google, help, and
how to improve our products

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.060
to better meet your needs.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.155
In this video, I will dive
into what is Google AdMob

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:25.470
and what does ad
monetizations mean to you.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.840
AdMob is a mobile advertising
company founded back in 2006.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.910
Google saw the
potential of AdMob.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.720
And in November 2010,
we welcomed it happily

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.280
to our Google family.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.370
From there, Google has invested
heavily into the product.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.920
In 2012, we added more buyers.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150
In 2013, we gave
AdMob a facelift

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.550
with the new
app-centric interface.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.140
And through continued
investment and development,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.210
AdMob has become a
powerful platform

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.360
to monetize, promote, and
analyze app performance.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.220

and maximize your ad revenue.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.560

rely on a combination of tools

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950
