00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.320
The Red Dwarf Star

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.689
A red dwarf star, according to the
H-R diagram is a relatively small star and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.040
cold main sequence. The dwarf-red
constitute the vast majority of stars and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.100
its mass is less than half the mass of the
Sun. The surface temperature is lowest

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.620
to 3500 k. Red dwarfs are stars
very low mass, less than 40% by weight

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.850
of the sun. Its surface temperature is
relatively low energy is generated and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.420
at a slow pace by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen
helium through the proton-proton chain reaction.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.800
Consequently, these stars emit little
light with a brightness that in some cases

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.500
only reaches 1/10 000 solar luminosity.
Even larger red dwarf is only

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.540
about 10% of the luminosity of the sun.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:31.931
In general, the red dwarf, transport
energy from the interior to the surface

00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:38.390
It is by convection. This is because the radiation
It is very difficult due to the opacity of

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.750
interior, which has a relative density
high compared with the temperature and is more

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.439
difficult for the photons travel to the surface,
so that convection becomes more efficient

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.520
for the transmission of energy. By being the
fully convective red dwarfs, the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.330
Helium does not agglomerate in the core and compared
with the biggest stars, like the sun can burn

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.630
a higher proportion of its hydrogen before
leaving the main sequence. The result

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.790
is the estimated life of red dwarfs
exceeds the estimated age of the universe, possibly

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.350
200 000. million to several billion
years at which stars under

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.570
8 solar masses have not had time to leave
the main sequence. Red dwarfs

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.260
lower mass have even longer lives,
This implies that their development has to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:51.199
by studying mathematical models to
not having sufficient data for observation.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:56.470
These models suggest that the minimum mass
the stars that can become Giant

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.500
Red is 0.25 solar masses; of the
lower mass increase its temperature

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.370
surface, and therefore its brightness,
without increasing their size, becoming

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.220
blue dwarfs, and then finally into white dwarfs.
This process is very slow and much more

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.621
the smaller the mass of the star, it is estimated
which, for example, a solar masses 0.25

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:32.060
It remains billion years following
major, minor and existing today,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.530
0.08 solar masses, 12 billion
years. For a star of 0.16 solar masses,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.510
for example, it is believed that the phase bantam
blue come after something more than 2.5 billion

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.630
years on the main sequence, and would last
about 5 billion years, during

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.490
where the star light will 1/3
the sun and a surface temperature that will come

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.450
to about 8500 Kelvin at the end of this phase,
whereby if there are planets in orbit

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.239
around this and that until then had temperatures
low, could thaw and give again

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.639
an opportunity that life flourished.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:36.940
The fact that the red dwarfs and other stars
Low mass remaining in sequence

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.000
Main as the most massive stars
abandoned, it allows us to estimate the age of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.970
star clusters, finding mass
from which the stars left sequence

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.900
main. This provides a lower limit
for the age of the universe, and allows

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.680
place training time scales in
existing structures within the Milky Way,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.530
such as the galactic halo and the galactic disk.
A mystery not yet solved since

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.970
2007 is the absence of red dwarfs without
metals, metal understood by any element

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.480
heavier than hydrogen or helium.
The model of the big bang predicts that the first

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.340
star generation should have only
hydrogen, helium and lithium moths. if

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.660
among these stars there were red dwarfs,
It should still be observable today,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:06:00.640
but none has yet been identified.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.510
Red dwarfs are the star class
more common in the galaxy, at least in the neighborhood

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.220
the solar system. Proxima Centauri, the star
closest to the sun is a red dwarf

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.710
spectral type and apparent magnitude; of
thirty nearest stars, twenty are

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.480
red dwarfs. However, due to its low
light, red dwarfs can not

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.930
be observed easily at interstellar distances
in which observed but other classes of

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.040
stars; in fact, no red dwarf
It is visible to the naked eye. However, due

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.050
to their small mass and low surface temperature,
this class of stars are the objectives

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.191
the most promising time to seek planets
potentially habitable land. To

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:58.700
be the least massive stars, experience
the greatest acceleration in response to

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.780
presence of a planet orbiting around
from them. This led to the discovery of the first

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:12.780
exoplanet with a mass comparable to that of
Neptune, Gliese 436 b as well as the first

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.280
"Super-Earth" around Gliese 876.
