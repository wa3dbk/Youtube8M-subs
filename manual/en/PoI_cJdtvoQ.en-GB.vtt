00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.670
Hi, I'm Gretel Fortmann. I'm a second year
nursing student here at UTS and

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:23.180
I'll be running through some role play scenarios
with a patient here in the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.650
nursing labs, just to show you some of the
situations that you might

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:43.410
encounter as you go out on clinical practice.
In the scenario I'm about to undertake, I'll

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.050
be meeting a patient for the first
time and just going through and taking her

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.600
blood pressure.
Hello, I'm Sue Felix. I'm Gretel's patient

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.489
today. I've had surgery on my spine,
and this is a couple of days after the operation.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:07.690
Good morning Ms Felix, good morning!
Good morning.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:20.350
Good morning, how are you?
I'm not too bad thank you.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.020
Good, that's fantastic. My name's Gretel Fortmann;
I'm a second year nursing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.480
student just doing my clinical placement here
in the hospital. The Registered

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:41.510
Nurse I'm not sure if you've met her yet Mary
Jones, she'll be supervising

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.790
me today.
I don't think I've met her so far, no, no.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.310
Well, I'm sure she'll be coming in and out
today; she's on the ward, so... Now, is there

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.270
a name you'd prefer me to call you, or is
Ms Felix fine?

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
Oh, you can call me Sue.
Oh, Sue, fantastic, well I'll do that then.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.750
Now Sue, I need to take your blood pressure
-- is that OK?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.750
Yes, of course.
Fantastic have you had it taken before?

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:08.750
Yes, yes.
Good, so you know what to expect with the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.070
cuff then... right... I'll just get this out...
How did you sleep last night, Sue?

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.260
Not too badly still pretty uncomfortable.
Ah, that's a shame well, let me know if things

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.390
change, and if you'd like me
to speak to Mary, the Registered Nurse.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.099
So you're here on practice in the hospital?

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.280
I am, yes, that's right

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.530
I'm here on my clinical placement. With my
university, um

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:43.260
throughout the year we come to the hospital,
just to practice some of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:55.469
our skills that we're learning
skills such as these. How long have you been

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.319
on the ward for?
Oh, a couple of days now.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.319
Have you had any people come to visit you
yet?

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.400
Yes, yes, my son and his family came to see
me.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.040
Oh fantastic! Does he have a big family?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
Um just one child, that's my granddaughter,
yes.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040
Oh lovely

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040
and does he have a nice partner?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
Oh she's
lovely

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040
she's...

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.040
Oh, aren't you lucky!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040
She's like having another daughter, although
she prefers to think of me as a big sister,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
she says!

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
Oh, I'm sure that's much better, in any case!
There we go

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040
is that comfortable for you?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040
It is, yes, yes

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040
it's alright.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040
Good. There we go, that's all done there

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.129
thank you.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.769
Is it normal?

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:28.980
Your blood pressure's well within the normal
range, so nothing to worry about there. There

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.069
we go

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.349
now Sue, is there anything else I can get
for you?

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:53.809
I don't suppose there'd be a magazine or something
like that, that I could have a look at, would

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:54.909
there?

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.680
I can definitely check on the ward for you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680
Thank you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.439
sometimes patients leave them behind, or people
bring them in, so I'll see what I can find

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.853
for you. Have you got your button with you?

00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:10.853
Yes, yes, it's under the bedclothes here.

00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:13.060
Oh fantastic. Well, if you've got any questions
or if your pain changes, then just let me

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.060
know

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.060
you just buzz there

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.150
Thank you.
