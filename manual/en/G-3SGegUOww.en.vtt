00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.090
This is the final training video that we want
to go over which is the probably most advanced

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.900
way of training which is when you're hitting
live ball to live ball in a second.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.000
What I'm going to do is all we're going to
do is work on hitting cross courts.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.849
I'm going to continue to work on hitting the
ball in my strike zone and because we're going

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.099
to be hitting cross courts, you have a lot
more things to deal with.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.300
We went from the volleying to me being on
the baseline.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.440
Baseline to baseline, we both have to control
it and put it in a certain location.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.530
This is a great practice to get out and hit
a lot of cross courts and also you can make

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.190
this drill as advanced as you want, meaning
that we can go, let's say, a combination of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.120
three cross courts, one down the line.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.219
We can go three cross courts, one down the
line, and then she can take the ball cross

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.670
court and we're back into doing the same thing
on the backend side as well.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.239
You can make this drill and come up with an
infinite number of possibility and combinations

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.449
you could use to get better.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
The biggest thing you want to do when you're
trying to hit live ball with somebody is first

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.050
of all, find a pace that you can both work
at.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.890
This isn't a competition, we're not trying
to play a match or win point, we're trying

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.130
to get better here.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.229
To get better, you have to find a common ground
where we can both work at a speed that helps

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.300
you to get better.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.479
I know we talked about hitting bigger forehands
and more power, but the thing about tennis

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.520
is making more balls.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.149
You have to go and hit maybe a bigger forehand
within the speed you can make, but in this

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.579
drill in particular, we're talking about keeping
the ball in play.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.189
If you really want to take it to another level,
keeping the ball in play past the service

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.640
line and if you can take it to that highest
level is keeping the ball in play between

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.200
the service line and the base line.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.890
We want to add depth and to do that we might
lift the ball, but right now we're just working

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.430
on keeping the ball in play back and forth.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.579
All we're going to do is keep moving, adjusting
to each ball based on what we need to do,

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:14.650
work on my technique, work on my contact,
and when we make a mistake, just go back and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.670
do it again.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.090
I made a mistake of hitting the ball in the
net, so I'm just going to go a little higher

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.239
next time.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:34.099
Each time you do make a mistake, learn from
it and adjust.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:49.010
Remember, tennis is a game of mistakes, but
it doesn't mean you're not going to make any

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.010
mistakes.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.060
The whole point is we're working on reducing
mistakes.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.700
If you have the mindset that you're never
going to make a mistake and that you're never

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.980
going to lose points, you're in the wrong
sport, because I guarantee you are.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.480
The best way of dealing with that is learning
how to manage your mistakes, meaning that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.980
every time we make one, figure out a way to
reduce the error.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.780
If you continue to work hard and work on your
stroke, what will happen is you'll get more

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.780
consistent.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.060
Remember, the name of the game is to not make
mistakes and be consistent.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.629
Keep working on your game and you'll find
yourself getting a lot better.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.459
