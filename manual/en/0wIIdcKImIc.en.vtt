00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:03.930
Hey Youtube, today we are going to learn ..

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.649
how to remove the Evo X original / standard stereo

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:11.149
uh...

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.980
the stereo is also identical with the lancer ...

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.160
from 2008 and forwards ..

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.160
and the ralliart version as well.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.419
So, follow me and I'll teach you how to remove it in less then 2 minutes.

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.860
Alright, so once you're in the car
it's ...

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.860
pretty much just straight on.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.120
So let's open up a glove box here ..

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.720
and squeeze the glove box togheter ..

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.770
so its loosens.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.380
This will give us more space so we can
unscrew this phillips screw ..

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.520
over here.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.729
So just take a phillips screw driver

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.790
and ..

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.790
remove the screw ...

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.780
and keep it in a safe place.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.840
like the mugholder,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.250
and ..

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.630
let's remove this trim panel ..

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.560
over here.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.200
It can be tricky sometimes,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.340
But just take a hold of it ..

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.670
at the bottom and drag ..

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.670
and it will loosen.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.000
Two clips.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.100
Right so, unscrew this ..

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.450
phillips screw,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.150
that holds the trim panel.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.820
And keep it in a safe place,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.350
mugholder = safe place.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.530
Alright so here comes the tricky part,
we will now remove this ...

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.410
trim panel.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.899
You have to be careful because it can bend easily
and crack so be ..

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.909
careful.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.859
Place one hand here ..

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.129
so it won't bend.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.009
And take ..

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.239
the other hand and pull.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.239
Start from the passenger side and
move your way over to the drivers side.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.739
and remember to be careful so you don't crack anything.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.989
This part is very expensive.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.889
Keep it in a safe place (Wont fit in mugholder = place in backseat)

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.919
Alright, So now we will remove this ..

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.099
dash.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.029
Over the stereo and the warning triangle, passanger seat belt and airbags warnings.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.979
So put two fingers here at the ...

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.680
one at the left side bottom ..

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.609
and one at the the right side bottom.

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.599
And do a gentle push

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.819
*Sound of success*

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.739
or pull.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.979
And then the clips on the backside will loosen up.

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.539
And then we can grab it ..

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.529
in the middle ..

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:31.399
and loose those clips. And we are off!

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.249
Okay!

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.259
Remove this harness wire,

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:43.259
To the warning triangle and passenger airbags and seats.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:51.469
Can be tricky sometimes.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.129
There we go.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.669
And ..

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.659
Stash away the dash.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.969
Alright

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:16.489
Now we got four phillips screws,

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.979
One here, one here, one in here and one here.

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.430
So ..

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.059
Let's remove them as well.

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:32.059
And release the head unit.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.860
For some reason I'm missing one screw. *Swedish giggle*

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.069
.. And pull up the head unit.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.860
remove the antenna plug.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.699
And the two ...

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.660
wire harnesses

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.659
And your all done!

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.880
That's how you remove a evo x/ lancer / ralliart ..

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.490
stereo in ..

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.889
just under two minutes.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.740
