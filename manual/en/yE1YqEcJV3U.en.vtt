00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:07.470
&gt;&gt;VOICEOVER: Dear Diary: My new classroom
building contains no vending machines.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.750
We are more than 50 yards from the nearest
coffee shop and I fear the journey will kill

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.750
me.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.810
I have petitioned school administration, but
to no avail.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.390
Is this the end?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.560
&gt;&gt; Dear Diary: I wandered the halls of the
Maverick Center for nearly 20 minutes, searching

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.680
for my health class, but I became hopelessly,
irrevocably lost.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.760
The room numbers are out of order and the
stairs do not lead where they should.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.870
There is no logic in this place.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.070
It is clear I shall have to drop the class.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.670
&gt;&gt; Dear Diary: Pasta for dinner again?

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.370
This is the third night in a month that the
cafeteria has served it.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.510
It appears that I am forced to get a sandwich
instead.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.629
Or pizza.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.319
Or a salad.

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.010
Or the gluten-free option.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.010
Or soup.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.470
Or the other entree.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:14.520
&gt;&gt; Dear Diary: Once again, I have tuned in
to KMSA and there is nothing but “the alternative”.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.509
What is “the alternative”?

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.430
I long for the sweet sounds of Katy Perry
and Ke$ha.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.260
It is unlikely that I will last one more day
without Top 40 radio.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.200
&gt;&gt; Dear Diary: I arrived at the Outdoor Program
to make my weekend plans, but the task proved

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
impossible.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:48.880
I cannot choose between mountain biking, rafting,
rock climbing, backpacking and camping.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.359
These hellacious options vex me.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:05.930
&gt;&gt; Dear Diary: Another office hour ticks by
and no one has come.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.299
Abandoned.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.670
Desolate.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.600
There is no word strong enough to convey the
utter loneliness I am feeling today.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
