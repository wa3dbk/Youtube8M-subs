00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.682
For me it started with gospel music.

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:16.839
A group of African-American
women were singing

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.468
for their children who had asthma

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:23.541
and for neighbours who had cancer.

00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:25.597
It was a strange picture:
these women

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:29.490
standing in front of these huge smokestacks

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.959
that were emitting a poisonous gas.

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:38.905
It was deceiving, because the thin line 
of white smoke looked very innocent

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.601
but at night,
in the cover of dark,

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:46.401
they'd really let it go 
and it was black and thick.

00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:48.376
These women did something interesting,

00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:50.709
interesting to me as a conservationist:

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:55.833
they launched this conservation campaing 
through their church.

00:00:55.833 --> 00:01:02.284
They went to traditions that they knew:
gospel music, God and passion,

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.839
and they went up against 
this refinery in Southern Lousiana

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:11.167
that did not have monitors on their stacks,
and they won.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:15.818
The stack emissions
were finally regulated.

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:20.052
This idea of putting religion
in conservation

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:23.326
had never really occured to me before.

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:27.283
I'd been working in conservation
for a number of years

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.994
and this was a new idea.

00:01:29.994 --> 00:01:33.221
Six years after this occurred

00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:37.603
I was going down
to Southern Louisiana again

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:42.197
and priests were handing out
at that time food vouchers

00:01:42.197 --> 00:01:46.248
and they were overseeing 
some suicide watchers

00:01:46.248 --> 00:01:50.553
of these fishing families
that had been wiped out

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:53.743
during the Deepwater Horizon explosion.

00:01:53.743 --> 00:01:58.745
It really impacted their industry 
and these families were desperate.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.169
What they did in a time of crisis,

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:04.965
was that they returned 
to their traditions, to their faith,

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:08.030
and to their religious leaders.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.205
Now --

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:18.474
conservation cannot be done
by radiocolouring and by tagging alone,

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:23.427
it cannot be done
through surveys and data sets.

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:26.314
If conservation is going to be successful,

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.615
there has to be a community

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:33.120
that's living in and around 
the issue, wildlife, habitat

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.124
that cares about the wildlife 
as a sacred value.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.573
So, it occurred to me that I needed to go
to the religious leaders

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:43.431
and begin to talk to them,

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:50.673
it was when I met the many Gods
of planet Earth.

00:02:50.673 --> 00:02:56.353
I went to Mongolia in 2002 as part of a team
going over to work

00:02:56.353 --> 00:03:00.448
on a fisheries conservation project.

00:03:00.448 --> 00:03:03.049
This was an area on the Siberian border

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.482
and it was inhabited by nomadic people

00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:09.546
who lived on the banks of the Üür river.

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:12.629
The Üür river was also
home to the taimen,

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.760
which is a fish that gets up to
180 pounds and six foot in length

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.723
making it a huge draw for anglers

00:03:19.723 --> 00:03:22.592
who come over to catch 
and release fly fish.

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:25.284
There were a number of pressures
being put on this fish at the time

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:31.378
and we were really tempted
to launch into a full-on

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.313
sort of community-outreach effort,

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.852
we had fisheries biologists over there,

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:39.977
who were tagging the fish 
and tracking their movements.

00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:42.923
But the first thing
I wanted to do with this team,

00:03:42.923 --> 00:03:47.559
is go and visit families 
and listen to their stories:

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:51.268
what was it about this culture that --
What did they respect?

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:53.319
What did they value?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.249
I learned a few things.

00:03:55.249 --> 00:04:02.410
Number one: Mongolians come from 
a long ago coupling of a wolf and a roe deer.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.934
Number two: in this valley, 
a long time ago,

00:04:05.934 --> 00:04:08.914
a wicked shaman 
had really terrorised the people,

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:13.834
but later, converted to Buddhism 
as did the inhabitants of this valley.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:17.767
And number three: 
the death of one taimen

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:21.930
equals the souls
of 999 people suffering.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.034
So that's what we'd build 
the campaign around.

00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:27.622
It was a circuitous route actually:

00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:30.325
we re-built a Buddhist monastery,

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:35.144
that became a site for Buddhism
and conservation dialogue,

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:39.188
we started a summer camp for kids --
a free one --

00:04:39.188 --> 00:04:41.185
where they would learn
about conservation issues,

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:44.149
they'd learn about 
conservation policy, nature,

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.410
and they also were learning about
water quality and fisheries.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.364
We went and we were able to,
excuse me --

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.011
we were able to create these festivals

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:58.542
that incorporated local traditions
and what not.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:01.822
And I want to say that, right now,

00:05:01.822 --> 00:05:04.009
the taimen population is stable in this area --

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.232
that was -- we started
the project in 2004,

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:11.377
and that's one of the only places
in the world that can make that claim.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:14.897
When I began to look at religions,
and look at cultures

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:20.585
I discovered that every faith,
every culture has a message about ecology

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:23.106
and nature and its importance.

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.586
For example in the Bhagavad Gita,
which is a sacred text in Hinduism,

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:29.849
they have a quote that says,

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.877
"He is dear who practices non-violence
against all living beings."

00:05:36.877 --> 00:05:42.637
And then, on a more rather -- 
condemning note,

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:46.216
in Revelation,
in the Christian Bible it says,

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:50.152
"God destroyeth,
he who destroyeth the world."

00:05:50.152 --> 00:05:51.900
So, I thought these were so interesting

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.187
and it was really adding another dimension
to the work,

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:59.573
and it was also this wonderful
new experience for me

00:05:59.573 --> 00:06:01.641
to be working with religious leaders.

00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.248
So I started the organization
"The Tributary Fund"

00:06:04.248 --> 00:06:07.596
and together we go and
unearth traditions,

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:09.997
or rather discover traditions,

00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:14.110
encourage the traditions
that put value in wildlife

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.866
and really try to bring these traditions
either back,

00:06:19.866 --> 00:06:25.447
or to make them a part of community practice
and replicating or whatnot.

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:30.651
And I want to give an example of one of the things
that we do, which is the next step:

00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.748
we find these traditions,
Buddhism is a good example

00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:38.562
of people who believe
that all sentient beings need to be protected.

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:41.092
So we brought a group of Buddhist monks
over to the United States

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.373
and this is,
we've done it now for four years,

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:48.383
and they went and saw a researcher
who was working on Pallas's cats.

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:51.845
Pallas's cats are cats
indigenous to Mongolia.

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:55.484
In the work that they were doing:
they were [tranquilizing] the cat,

00:06:55.484 --> 00:06:59.085
colouring the cat
and they were harvesting eggs.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.548
After the monks saw this,
there was a lot of discussion and --

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:07.702
obviously it had touched a nerve
and they turned around and said,

00:07:07.702 --> 00:07:12.473
"You know, we do understand that there is harm
being made towards these beings,

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.568
we understand 
that this cannot be comfortable,

00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:16.640
the harvesting of eggs in particular."

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.001
But the scientists said that these eggs
are our insurance policy, essentially.

00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:26.752
"If this animal faces extinction
we have this genetic material," and they said,

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:29.221
"We think this research is OK

00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:34.784
because there is nothing more profane
than the idea of extinction."

00:07:34.784 --> 00:07:37.360
This is something that really drives us,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.415
these beliefs, these -- traditions,

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:45.198
we're really finding them
more and more in Bhutan, Mongolia,

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:49.377
we're working in the United States
with a variety of different religions.

00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:53.369
Science is important for understanding
conservation boundaries,

00:07:53.369 --> 00:08:00.490
but beliefs and story-telling is important
for local communities involvement.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.547
Both are essential 
in protecting the Earth.

00:08:04.547 --> 00:08:07.632
Luckily, 
we have many Gods on our side.

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:08.908
Thank you.

00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:10.855
(Applause)
