00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.860
Today I will be making cauliflower pickle.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.700
This is a great condiment with any meal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.820
Very easy to make, there is no cooking involved.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.720
This recipe will serve 10.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.420
For this recipe we need:

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.120
1 large cauliflower

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.980
which I have already cut them in small florets.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.400
And after cutting them this should be about 4 cups.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.440
3 tablespoons of olive oil

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.620
or you can use mustard oil.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.100
3 green chillies which I have already sliced.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.200
If you don't like very hot you can remove some of the seeds.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.380
1.5 teaspoons of salt

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.440
1.5 teaspoons of black mustard seeds, coarsely ground.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.300
1 teaspoon of coarsely ground fennel seeds

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.740
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.880
1/2 teaspoon of red chilli powder

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.120
1/8 teaspoon of asafoetida

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.780
And 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.040
So to make the cauliflower pickle,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
first we wash the cauliflower

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.460
we cut them in small florets and pat dried.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.700
After that spread it over kitchen towel or paper towel

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.940
for at least 1 hour.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.800
So most of the moisture is out.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.320
This is a very important part for making pickle.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.660
Cauliflower shouldn't be wet.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.700
After that we just going to mix all the spices.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.560
Like I said this is a easy recipe to make.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.760
After cauliflower is dried,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.320
we are just going to mix all the ingredients.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.540
Oil

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.840
Salt

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.640
Mustard seeds

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.820
Fennel seeds

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.600
Turmeric

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.020
Red pepper

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.660
Asafoetida

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.360
And lemon juice.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.860
And mix it well.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.020
This is the another easy way to mix it.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.020
It's looking very good and you can

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.840
already smell it all the spices.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.480
We need to keep this for at least 2 hours to marinate

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680
before pickle is ready to serve.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.680
Pickle is ready to serve.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.800
It has been marinated for about 2 hours.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.680
This is a fresh cauliflower pickle.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.620
You can store this in refrigerator for 1 week in glass jar.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.080
You can serve this with roti, paratha or with sandwiches.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.700
Thank you.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.920
And I will see you again with new recipe.
