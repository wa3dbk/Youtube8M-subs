Okay, welcome back. Now that I have my piece
of paper and I have my subject for the still

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:15.010
life. I'm going to set this up here in front
of me. This is a wooden seal from, I believe

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.599
it's either Ecuador or Belize that my uncle
got. Anyway this baby blue pencil you can

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:28.619
use. If you draw your outline really lightly
when you go back in with the darker color,

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.012
you wont be able to see this. And this allows
for room to adjust your composition and so

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:39.230
forth. So I'm just going to loosely outline
what I'm drawing here. Actually I'm looking

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:49.750
at maybe doing it vertical but for this one
I think I will. Actually I'm going to add,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.250
I like odd numbers, for a better composition.
So I'm going to start over here with this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.080
wooden bottle. I'm just going to really lightly
kind of trace this here. Not trace. I'm drawing

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:19.890
but kind of just loosely get my outline. Kind
of lay this piece out. Then I'll come in and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:40.960
get the seal. And his head's a little bit
bigger. But that's the good thing about this.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.310
If you make a mistake, when you get back into
it with the darker pencil you wont see the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:02.820
baby blue pencil through that. There's a little
milk container in the back there. Now I'm

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.500
just trying to indicate where it's at. I don't
need to get real detailed because we're going

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.940
to do that later in the program. This is drawing
with the baby blue pencil. Get your outline

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:26.890
and get your composition down and once we
do this we wont really need this pencil anymore.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.390
And that's it.
