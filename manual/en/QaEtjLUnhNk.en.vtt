00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
The blockers,if you'll notice,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.840
the woman who has a stripe

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
on her helmet.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.840
She's the pivot.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
She's kinda like the quarterback.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.840
She's the last line of defense.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.840
She calls the plays.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.840
She controls the speed of the pack.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
The rest of them are blockers.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
Inside blockers hold the line.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.840
Outside blockers watch for the jammer.
Make sure she doesn't take the outside.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.840
And then of course the jammer.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.840
The jammer's an offense position.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840
So in order to score points
you need to be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.840
a sprint skater. You need to 
be able to go really fast.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.840
Maneuver your way around 
other skaters,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
and look for opportunities
to pass those skaters so you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840
can score the points.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.840
(Games Noises, crowd cheers,
Referee whistles blow, music)

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840
Roller Derby for most of us
is not a profession.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.840
We're all amateurs. We

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840
pay dues to participate
in the sport.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840
We do it for the love of 
the sport.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.840
and most of us,in fact,
if not all of us, have day time jobs.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
I actually do home loans in Northern California.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
I'm actually a law student and
a mother of four.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Right, and I'm a mom as well.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840
Most of us are moms. I'm 
stuck to you.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.140
Most of us are moms. There's 
alot of moms. And it's a great

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
way to get out there and
do something for yourself,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
get some exercise, meet
cool women. It's like this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.140
anti-sorority sorority.
It's pretty awesome.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140
If you are thinking about 
doing roller derby.  

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
Do it. You should totally do it!

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.140
The fans like female sports.
They're always so much more exciting.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
I think they actually like the fact
that it's authentic hits now.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140
I mean when somebody hits the floor.
There's nothing better than that.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.140
They like it when we hit girls into their lap I think...

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.140
...and beer.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.140
Fans: A-C-D-G, A-C-D-G...

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.540
I think it's just like seeing
women in a full contact sport

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.540
is exciting. I think the spectacle
is what's appealing to most people

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.540
originally. But once they understand
the sport. I think they really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.540
kind of like grasp onto the strategies.
You know just like any sports figures,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.540
they gravitate towards certain player's
personalities maybe, their flare, their

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.540
way of playing. I think it's different
for everyone. I think some people like it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.540
just because it's fun and agressive, and
some people like the strategy and the sport itself.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.540
It's kinda awesome to watch chicks
kick the crap outta each other.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.540
I got into Roller Derby from a 
waitress. I was at a restaurant and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.540
she pretty much saw my tattoos and
came up to me and said,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.540
'You wanna do something cool?'
and that's how I got into Roller Derby.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.540
The president and the head coach or our
league have been friends of mine for years.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.540
And they kept trying to talk me into it.
I saw a practice and I was hooked.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.540
And I've been here ever since.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.540
I'd always wanted to do it. But I'm from
kinda like the middle of Massachusettes,

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.540
and there's no league out there. So when
I came out here there was like 9,000 leagues,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.540
and I found Angel City, and they're like
my second family.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.540
Actually I was living in San Diego
and I saw an ad on Craig's list

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.540
or something for roller derby. And I 
remember it vaguely when I was a kid.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.540
It was basically like, get on 
skates and knock people around

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.540
and sounded really interesting
and appealed to my aggressive side.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.540
I learn things every time I play.
It's like you evolve as a player

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.540
all the time. It's never boring.
And I love all the friends that I've made.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.540
Mostly (I love)the game itself though.
It's so fun.
