00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.700
Hello Food Tube it's me Jemma and I'm at home and I'm gonna bake something really delicious.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.500
I'm gonna do banana, maple and pecan cupcakes.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.440
I really like these cupcakes because I really like the combination of banana and pecans.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:28.480
All you're gonna need first of all is 280g of self raising flour, 200g of caster sugar, 50g of dark, soft brown sugar

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.220
three quarters of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.940
because of this soft, sticky sugar you're gonna have to poke it around a little bit with a spoon.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.380
You could leave it there but I like to have a little bit of extra nutty crunchiness in my cakes,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.380
so I'm going to add 50g of chopped pecan.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.980
Then I've got 250g of softened, unsalted butter. It's really nice and soft and squishy.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.940
These bananas have been sitting around for well over a week, they're a bit brown,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.300
that makes them perfect for baking.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Yeah just get your fork and kind of just smush them.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
It's starting to look like a puree now.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.800
In that goes as well.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160
We've got four large free-range eggs.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.920
Crack those into the bowl as well.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.760
Start mixing straight away on a low speed, and then speed it up to a medium speed and mix for a minute.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420
So now we bring it back down to a low speed.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.140
And then I've got two tablespoons of whole milk here. I'm just going to pop that in.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.820
And then increase the speed up to medium again.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.380
And just mix it for 20-30 seconds.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.120
So that's my batter ready, and as you can see it's really lovely and well combined and little bit runny but

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.120
this is just what we want. It smells really bananary.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.460
So I've got two cupcake trays which I've lined with paper. You just need to scoop it out with your spoons

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.400
two thirds of the way full, approximately.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.800
Right, so that's all my batter. Now I just need to bake these at 170 degrees  for 22-24 minutes.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Put them in the oven now.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.940
Right, so while the cakes are baking in the oven I'm going to make the most delicious treat ever. Which is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.860
pecan brittle. Prepare your baking tray  with some oil. Just a flavourless oil like groundnut or  sunflower.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.960
Get a pastry brush and brush it all around. You're going to need to do that with your spatula, so

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.260
use a heat-proof rubber spatula like this one. Brush that with oil too.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.620
Right, so that's super important. Anyway it's really easy. We're going to go over to do the hob,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.860
so follow me.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.200
I've got a little saucepan here, and I've got one cup of caster sugar, and then a quarter of a cup of water.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.260
Don't stir it, because that can contribute to crystallizing.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.700
Just give it a little shuffle around to settle it down.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.560
And then pop the heat on. Let it heat up. Let it come to the boil.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.600
It will get to a light amber colour, and that's when we turn off the eat and add a load of stuff.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.880
While your sugar and water are simmering over there I've got half a cup of pecans and I'm just going to chop them

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.680
just to chop them up a little bit. When they hit that really hot sugar, they'll kind of toast in the hot sugar.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.960
The next thing you have to have ready is a tablespoon of butter, and we're going to add that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.980
as soon as it comes off the heat. So have it ready!

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.320
Right, so it's reached that delightful amber colour, so I'm going to turn it off the heat and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.280
I've got my tablespoon of butter and I'm going to use my greased spatula to stir around and it's going to bubble

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280
up quite a lot. Quite a bit.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.840
Right, so as you can see it's pretty hot.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.140
Don't, no matter how tempting it is, stick your finger in there. It'll hurt and it'll really injure you.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.980
And now I can stick my chopped nuts in. So give it a good old stir. You want to make a nice even puddle.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.480
Then till take about 30-45 minutes to set completely and it'll go completely brittle.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.780
Now I get to make delicious maple butter cream, and that's going to be the icing on the cake.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.440
That's really going to make this cake amazing. So I've got 300g of softened unsalted butter.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.960
Pop that into the mixer. We need to beat that at quite a high speed for 3-4 min until it's really pale, white

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.460
and fluffy.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.100
That's enough.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.940
I've got 675 grams of icing sugar, which I've sifted.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.340
So just let that mix for 3-4 minutes.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:49.640
Right, so that is fluffy! So next we need to loosen it up with maple syrup. Now this is

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.200
one of the strongest ones. It's a number two.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.720
Make sure you use actual maple syrup, not maple flavoured syrup

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.300
because that's not the real deal. You need the strong, strong, strong good stuff.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300
I'm going to put 6 tablespoons of that in.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.100
While it's on a low speed.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.620
Give it one last minute or two of beating, and then it's ready to go.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
This is what your icing should look like.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.780
Sort of fluffy, not too wet. Not too stiff. If you feel like it's too stiff just add some more maple.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.020
This is just right!

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.860
Right, these are ready. Lets just double check. Ooh yeah. They're nice and springy. So we can take them out

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.500
and leave them to cool.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.180
Right, so our cakes are nice and cool, and the brittle is also cooled down and completely hard,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.080
we've got our butter cream, and now we need to put them all together.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.680
So the first thing we need to do is take the brittle off the sheet. Yeah, look at that. Big  massive bit.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.680
That's like the size of my face.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.520
Just chop up enough so you can put it on all of your cakes.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.540
Get your butter cream, give it a quick stir around. Just for today I'm going to do this.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:13.420
I'm going to grab a squash ball size, no, ping-pong ball size, just pop that amount on a cake

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.860
and I like to bounce it on and turn my cake around.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.760
Got a nice big nugget of delicious brittle.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.840
So there you go. My banana, pecan and maple cupcake. Super duper yummy. You better make this cake!

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.640
If that's not the best reason to use over ripe banana, then I don't know what is.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.860
The bananas are going to keep that moist for a couple of days as well so that's an extra bonus.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.400
So you might not be able to eat all 24 in one day.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.040
so I hope you enjoyed that. I really enjoyed making it and eating it for you. There's just one last thing.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.700

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.500
