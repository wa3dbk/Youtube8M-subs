00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.280
Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and this is
our handling bolt-on build-up for all 05-09

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.530
Mustang GTs.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.310
The goal with this build is pretty simple.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.550
We’re looking to make our 07 GT handle better
by tackling two different areas.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.630
We’re going to reduce our body roll and
lower our center of gravity using some pretty

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.070
basic suspension components.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.150
So I’m just finishing up installing this
SR Performance Black Strut Tower Brace that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.360
will really tie in the rest of the parts we’ve
used with our build.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.590
This is really going help firm up that front
end by reducing that chassis flex and body

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.590
roll.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.730
You have to admit that black powder coated
finish looks really good under the hood and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.650
it’s going to flow nicely with the black
on red theme we’ve got going on with our

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.650
07 GT.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.100
That was a piece of cake to put on; it really
only took me a couple of minutes.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.829
Let’s take a look at some of the other products
we’ve used for our build.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.710
One of the most important products of any
suspension build is a new set of lowering

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.710
springs.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.680
We’ve installed a set of these SR Performance
lowering springs on our GT, which lowered

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.850
it about 1.5 inches on all four corners.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.670
That lower center of gravity will do two things
for us.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.189
First and most importantly, it’s going to
greatly improve our handling.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.240
But another nice thing, it’s also improved
our appearance as well by getting rid of that

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.350
4x4 status and getting rid of that ugly wheel
gap.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.789
Last but not least are these front and rear
sway bars from Eibach.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.030
Sway bars are one of the biggest factors in
reducing body roll and are a great tool for

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.039
fine tuning your suspension.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.420
From the factory, these Mustangs tend to plow
or push through turns, and this is referred

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.990
to as understeer.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.299
By replacing your factory sway bar with a
larger rear sway bar and a smaller diameter

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.609
front, you’re actually going to get rid
of that understeer and induce a little bit

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.049
of oversteer.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.850
This means the tail of your car comes around
a turn a lot quicker, and it actually makes

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.029
it a little more fun to drive in the process.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.740
This is one of those builds where success
won’t be measured by a Dyno run, but rather

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.359
out on the road and in the turns.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.770
So let’s get our 07 GT out on the road and
see these mods in action.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.850
We’ve got our 07 GT out of the shop and
onto the streets with our handling pack installed,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.209
and right away the car feels so much more
solid.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.520
Steering response has been greatly improved.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.380
It just feels much, much more responsive.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.069
So the understeer has definitely been reduced;
we’ve got some turns coming up here.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.239
Let’s see how she does in terms of our handling
and even our braking.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.159
The car feels so great.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.790
The springs are reducing the dive-in from
the braking, the sway bars are definitely

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.120
reducing our body roll.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.030
All the parts are working so well together.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.610
We’ve got a pretty sharp left-hander coming
up.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.510
No more understeer; the rear end comes around
a lot quicker, the car doesn’t plow through

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.290
the turns anymore.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.490
It feels like a new car!

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.069
The install of these parts will take about
6-8 hours because those springs take a little

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.500
bit longer to install.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.660
If you don’t feel confident installing those,
your local shop should be able to take care

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.990
of that for you.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.450
When you do this much work to your suspension,
it’s a good idea to get it aligned so you

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.989
get the most out of your parts without chewing
up your tires.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.350
That does it for this handling bolt-on build
up with our 07 GT.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.941
Be sure to check out some of our other bolt-on
build ups for the 05-09 GTs where we make

00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:52.199
our 07 a lot faster, help get it off the line,
and work on our appearance.
