00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:10.470
[music]

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.480
(Male) I attended University of Arkansas Little Rock,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.519
and I went to school on a basketball scholarship.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.030
So, a friend of mine and I were just hanging out,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.800
and we went over to one of the other player's house.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.519
And our buddy was in a relationship with this young woman,

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.949
and she also came over.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:31.989
And then my roommmate and I decided to leave.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.889
So as we were leaving and going back to our rooms,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.909
as we looked up through the window--

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.089
because the window was open--

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.739
and we saw our buddy and his girlfriend

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.189
and he grabbed her, had her in the air,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.359
he was choking her, and then he struck her.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.279
As a result we -- we jumped in the car and left

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.599
because we were just so -- stunned.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.000
(Female) I'm an RA, and once I had a resident

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.979
that didn't appear to be fitting in very well.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.079
And one day she was sick.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.379
And I had a conversation with her about

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.640
why she was sick.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.000
And it turned out that she had tried to commit suicide.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.980
She wasn't very happy at App

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and her family home wasn't happy either.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.540
I encouraged her to go to the Counseling Center

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.229
she didn't really want to do that,

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.459
and so I encouraged her to keep a journal.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.079
Through rereading these journals,

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:23.879
she found that most of the situations

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.329
that she had been in weren't right for her.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.090
And that these situations were perpetuated

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.230
by the friends that she had made here.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.049
And so we had the discussion

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.909
maybe you need new friends.

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.290
And she decided that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.989
it was going to be a hard journey,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:39.989
but it was going to be her journey.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.079
[music]

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.939
(Female) My friend and I were followed home

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.980
and when we got out of the car,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.980
we had a male run up on us and attack us.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.469
He attacked my friend first, punched her.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.619
He hit me, and then I fell to the ground

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.979
and he repeated kicked me.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.819
I remember wondering

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840
when it was going to stop,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.000
when it was going to end,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.809
and the question constantly ran through my head was why.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.629
The next thing I know,

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.649
my friends were running towards me,

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.329
I could hear their feet coming towards me,

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.719
and that's when he stopped.

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.769
They told me that if he had kept going for

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.799
not even a minute longer,

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.208
that I could have died.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:39.549
We were taken to the hospital,

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.519
treated with a lot of injuries.

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.339
But the emotional and mental injuries

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:58.789
is what really stuck with us.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.109
(Male) At that time, I must admit,

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.609
I just was frozen because

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.769
this was someone that I respected,

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.519
an older student, athlete.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:10.679
And it can be debilitating.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.459
In this case, it was because,

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.739
while I felt like there was

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.189
kind of a natural obligation

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.259
for me to defend the young lady,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.609
I also felt an allegiance and an alliance to my friend,

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.819
and someone who I looked up to.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.000
Had I to do it over again,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.979
I would make a different decision.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.439
[music]

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.719
(Female) If you have a gut feeling

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:43.899
that something may be wrong

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.839
with a friend or family member,

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.219
most of the time it could be true.

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.069
And so you do need to ask

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.789
about what they're going through.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.209
And it may take more than one conversation

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.669
and you may have to ask some hard questions,

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.889
but you need to get to the root of the problem.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.349
Act on it. It could be too late if you wait on it.

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.679
There was a bystander in a nearby car,

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.549
picked up the phone immediately and called the police.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.899
And she said she was terrified

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.259
but she sat there and watched

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.979
which was amazing and incredible,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.980
and horrifying at the same time.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.610
But she had the courage to get involved and--

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.949
and to this day I can't begin to thank her enough.

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.639
And it's more-- its up and beyond anything that

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.019
I, or my friend could have asked for

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.980
in our time of need and help.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.410
[music]

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.839
(Female) Your friend may not react

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.920
the way that you think that they will

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:44.620
because they may be angry with you

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.219
that you're trying to get them help.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.470
But if they truly are your friend

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.240
and your offering this help to them,

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.980
in the long run, they're going to be thankful.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.250
[music]

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.290
(Male) Well, the advice I give to students is "be yourself".

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.000
And be comfortable within your own skin,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.920
and be empowered by those who want to empower you.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.060
To connect with people who are not afraid

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:17.759
to have courage to make some very tough decision.

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.590
(Female) No matter what you see,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.920
no matter what you hear,

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.519
do something, tell something.

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.279
its not hard to pick up a phone and call somebody

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.839
even if you think you're making something out of nothing

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.920
you never know.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.939
Even if you're standing by and you think

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.339
"someone else will call, someone else can do it,

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:36.000
"its not my place, its not me",

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.829
it is your place.

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.980
A simple phone call will change a life.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.110
The witness who saw my assault,

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.160
her phone call changed my life, it saved my life.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.060
On this campus, I absolutely feel safe.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:56.180
Around all these people who stood up for me,

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.879
I hold my head high,

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.759
and walk around knowing that

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:08.259
I am who I am, and its okay.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.599
And people here love me, and its just--

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.120
safety is an understatement

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.980
for how I feel on campus now.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
