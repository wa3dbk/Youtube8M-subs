00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.060
My name is Paul Sandberg.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm an actor, singer, and teacher in the New
York City area.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.070
For more information, please visit my website
at paulsandberg.net.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.900
We three king of Orient are, bearing gifts,
we traverse afar.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.170
Field and fountain, moor and moutain, follow
the yonder star.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.310
Oh, star of wonder, star of night.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.989
Star with royal beauty bright.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:50.190
Westward leading, still proceeding, guide
us to thy perfect light.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.730
That was We Three Kings.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.379
This is a beautiful Christmas carol that uses,
really, 3 main chords in the first half.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.910
And then it just switches to another set of
chords, but in the relative major key of E

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.910
Minor.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.810
So we have E Minor, then we have A Minor,
then B major.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.280
Then we go back to E Minor.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.390
You can play that all with just 1 hand, with
no bouncing around at all.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:35.550
If you place your pinkie, 5 finger, on E,
your 3, also middle finger, on the A. And

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.400
your index finger, or 2, on B. And then you
just add in the melody.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.900
We three king of Orient are.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.280
Then when we get to, oh star of wonder, star
of night, all these chords switch to the major.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:05.810
Which means we have D Major, G Major, C Major,
and E Minor.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.750
And those fingers can be lined up with your
pinkie finger, 5.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:18.010
Playing it C, 4 on the D, 3 on the E. And
then, let's go ahead and put our thumbs, 1

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.530
finger, on the G.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.069
And then you just pluck each one of those
finger individually when the chord changes.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.100
Which is, for the most part, once a measure.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.850
Oh, star of wonder, star of night.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.590
Star with royal beauty bright.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.840
And 1 more thing.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.370
This isn't really about playing the piano
here.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.170
But pay attention to where commas are placed
in the line of music.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.110
On the very first line, we have We three kings
of Orient are, bearing gifts, we traverse

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.110
afar.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.200
See that pause I took?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.390
99% of people will always put a pause there.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.990
But there's no comma after are.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.900
We just wanna do it because we have this dotted
quarter note, which has a bit of finality.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.030
But the phrase is actually, we three king
of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.410
So when you're singing it, try to put that
flow through it.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.360
Really resist the urge to take that deep breath
there.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:28.130
So that would just be, We three king of Orient
are, bearing gifts, we traverse afar.
