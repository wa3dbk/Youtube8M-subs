Hello Everyone,

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.310
After months of delays, here is the fourth
video in the dome greenhouse series. This

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.559
video doesn’t directly pertain to the actual
dome construction, but instead shows the site

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.870
preparation work. If you like chainsaws, tractors,
doodle bugs, and huge excavators, you’ll

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.870
love this segment!

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.519
The greenhouse is being constructed at the
edge of a field. About one and a half acres

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.401
needed to be timbered. Each tree needs to
be cut, delimbed, and removed from the area.

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.699
It’s a very time consuming process without
the aid of large logging equipment.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:01:00.530
Having a tractor with forks helps to speed
up the clearing process. All the hardwood

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.010
logs and branches larger than a couple of
inches are collected and stacked in a large

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.300
pile. They will then be cut and split and
will be used to heat the greenhouse during

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:44.060
the winter. The larger pine logs will be sawn
into lumber.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.140
All the smaller branches are collected and
placed in a large pile along the edge of the

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.240
field. This provides a habitat and shelter
area for various animals such as birds and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:33.660
fox. In a few years, the branches will decompose.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.820
My neighbor stopped by with his doodlebug
to help with some of the larger trees. A doodlebug

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.700
is a homemade piece of farming equipment that
is made from just about anything that can

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.210
be welded and bolted together.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.260
This one is used as a logging skidder and
has large ag tires with chains, and a huge

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.680
winch for dragging logs. The winch is tied
into the transmission and has an awesome pulling

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.240
capacity. It has no problem dragging a few
complete trees at the same time. It also has

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.850
no problem driving over some of the toughest
terrain.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:35.570
It’s time to bring in the big guns! The
area is filled with stumps intertwined with

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.010
large glacial boulders. They are no match
for this excavator which can easily slice

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.430
through the roots and throw around the boulders.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:57.459
For the size of the machine, surprisingly,
it was able to do precision work by perfectly

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:16.519
leveling out the foundation hole in the footing
locations.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.850
When they were done with the foundation hole,
we were left with large piles of rocks, topsoil,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.500
stumps, and gravel. A nice round and level
hole is now ready for footings and foundation

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.960
wall. Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel couldn’t
have done a better job!

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.790
As always, thanks for watching, and please
