ADRIANA BORDEA: To me,
cuddling is really intimate.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.160
When I really hug someone,
I feel very vulnerable.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.504
So I'm intrigued to
see what it's going

00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:14.670
to be like to hug strangers.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.550
My name is Adriana and I'm
going to my first snuggle event.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.550
I kind of don't know what
I'm supposed to be wearing.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.190
I have no idea who
these people are.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700
I don't know their
ages, their backgrounds.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.670
We're just going to snuggle.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.880
I don't know if
there's, like, rules.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.350
Sometimes I, like,
close people off.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.260
Like, I definitely
put a wall up.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.490
So I think for me, it's
like pushing myself out

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.460
of my comfort zone.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.130
I'm about to go in.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.255
I have no idea what's
going to happen.

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:01.450
SHANYA LUTHER: OK.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.599
I'm going to invite everybody
to get cozy for a minute.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.640
My belief about
snuggling is that we

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.570
could heal a lot of our
interpersonal wounds

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.250
it if we were more connected.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.980
In a culture that
says that you have

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.230
to be in a romantic relationship
in order to get touched,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.230
that leaves a lot of people out.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.620
This is a snuggle level event.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.379
What that means is
that we keep our energy

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:23.420
playful and affectionate.

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:37.640
ADRIANA BORDEA: My brain is
a little mushy right now.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.610
I'm shy.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.260
I'm a lot more shy than I
thought I was going to be.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.630
I'm feeling quiet,
a little insecure,

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.900
because everyone's very touchy.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.060
So that's out of
my comfort zone.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.740
KARA: My name's Kara.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
Just recently have a
relationship, and so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.915
was looking for a place
for some safe touch.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.000
SPEAKER 4: I love giving hugs.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.240
I wish I can give
hugs to everyone,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.156
every day of the week.

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:09.780
SPEAKER 5: I think
snuggling is very important.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.670
This is all about consent.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.850
Just because in this moment I
feel like I want to be spooned,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.260
maybe, you know,
half hour from now,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.890
I'm going to be, like, yeah, no.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.510
KARA: How do I touch
someone without feeling

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.770
creepy or weird?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.710
SPEAKER 5: we need touch
to thrive in our lives.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.500
It's very calming.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.970
It's relaxing.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.825
It's comforting-- healing,
you know, with some people.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.950
SPEAKER 6: There's something
about that moment when

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.920
you feel a hand or a foot
or an arm and you don't know

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.050
whose it is that is
really beautiful.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.670
It's like a connection
to the universal.

00:02:53.654 --> 00:02:55.320
ADRIANA BORDEA: I
feel very relaxed now,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.020
which I wasn't a second ago.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.820
I was really anxious.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.410
I think I'm just not used to it.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.030
I'm not used to
touching like that.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.630
And at one point, like everyone
was, like, touching me.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.550
And it was awesome.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.950
I think I lost count of how
many people I snuggled with.

00:03:16.377 --> 00:03:18.210
Think it's like we all
yearn for that touch.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.040
It's something that maybe
is not socially acceptable,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.320
but we're just, like, having
a good time snuggling.
