00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.360
Hey there and welcome to Menu’s Vlog.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.450
I’m your host the Multi- Electronic Networked
User System, don’t even ask me what that

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.450
means, Menu!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.620
So the craziest thing happened today.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.490
Some dude literally dropped out of the sky
in front of us.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.490
Well, not literally, figuratively.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.560
He figuratively dropped out of the sky.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.660
Well, not dropped out of the sky, more like
appeared out of thin air.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.580
Anyway, I says to myself, “who’s this
asshole?”

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.050
‘cause Kera’s sticking me on his wrist
without barely knowing who the hell he is.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.980
I don’t like being on people’s wrists
without knowing who they are, you have no

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.030
idea where that wrist has been.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.079
I would have been just fine chilling away,
doing my floaty head thing in cyberspace.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.140
But she had to go and give me to this dude
with a funny accent.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.329
(Mock British Accent) Oh, my name’s Don
De-Twat, I just wanna go ‘ome I say.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.329
Tally-Ho, Cherrio!

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.329
Engage!

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.300
(Make up some stuff here, I’m stumped on
trying to mock myself)

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.420
So that happened.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:11.020
And we’ve been running around dodging nazi’s
and commies and terrorists trying to blow

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.140
our heads off.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.740
Well, their heads off, mines not attached
to anything.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.759
There’s this guy about six foot - eighty-two...
or something, who’s been helping us through

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:22.759
this world.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.719
Now I should say there are a lot of explosions
in this world.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.719
I mean a lot.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.719
Like...

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.229
I’m not even sure where half of them are
coming from.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.549
And this guy is well.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.270
He’s three fries short of a happy meal.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.270
Two “O’s” short of a Cheerio.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.790
Six bannans short of a bunch, four farts short
of a... well, you get the idea, the guy’s

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.790
nuts.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.790
Like, even the noob got it.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.729
(Mock British Accent) I think this guy’s
got mental problems ‘e ‘as.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.729
Bangers &amp; Mash.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.729
Tom-ah-toes.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.729
The Quee...

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.969
I’ll stop that now.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.909
I don’t know if we can trust this new guy,
but I also think he makes a good point.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:49.909
Can we trust “The Sarge”.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.079
He seems like he’s a bit nuts.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
Well, not seems, he is.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.030
The guy had a full on mental breakdown in
front of us.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.869
TOTALLY the noob’s fault, such an ass.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.549
And now I’m stuck being shot at by a bunch
a bad guys...

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.280
Dammit, I went to college...

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.470
I could have been a legal hologram.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.430
So now I wanna hear from you guys, what do
you want to hear from ol’ Menu next.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.200
What shall I talk about - audience interaction
that’s where it’s at.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.879
Drop me a line below.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:58.709
Or just click on one of these floaty boxes
here in my hands, you can see our adventures

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.049
for yourself.
