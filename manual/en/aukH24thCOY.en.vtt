00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:11.400
DAVID: Ah, oh, Zandy,
look at this.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.060
Cute.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.975
ZANDY: So cute.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:15.360
DONNA: Oh, you like
the tea boxes?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750
I made them from this beautiful
wood I found in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.290
Buata Balone.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.650
They're filled with my own
special blend of hibiscus,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.170
lavender, rosemary, sage,
tarragon, thyme, hot dog,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.770
cumin, basil, gasoline,
cinnamon, mustard, juniper,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.770
shiraz, parsley, sassafras.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.500
ZANDY: Nice.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.130
DAVID: That sounds--

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.990
DONNA: Anise, ankle weights,
lemon balm, saffron, sorrel,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.990
vanilla, tamarind, malted
milk, dill, Coca Cola,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.850
barnacles, chicory.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.930
DAVID: Well, I mean, it's
really super cute.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.940
I think you should mass
produce them,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.720
you'd make a fortune.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.560
DONNA: Oh, no, I don't
want to get into

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.060
that kind of business.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.620
Running this little shop
is plenty for me.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.850
Besides, I haven't
had sex in longer

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.380
than I care to remember.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.380
Once my ex left me, he was out
the door jamming his jugs into

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.344
some slutty 22-year-old's
blow hole.

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:05.174
DAVID: Yeah, I hear ya.

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:07.000
DONNA: It's just as well.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.510
I love my little shop and the
menagerie of colorful

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.110
characters that come
through here.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.864
ZEKE: Hey!

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:13.241
Hey, hey!

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.405
Hey, Miss Donna!

00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:15.060
Miss Donna!

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.280
Fine day for chatterwauling
and, and uh, and uh,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.920
broomstick banging, isn't it?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.390
Yeah!

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.040
DONNA: It's nice to see
you, too, Zeke.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.820
I made you a nice grape
juice smoothie.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.070
It's right here on
this high shelf.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.410
DAVID: Let me help
you with that.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.315
DONNA: No, no, I can get it.

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:31.700
Uh, oh, oh no!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.055
Sorry!

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:34.080
DAVID: It's OK, I can get my
sister to send me another

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.870
shirt from storage.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.770
DONNA: I won't hear of it.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.370
Please, come to my house.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.460
DAVID: Oh, no, no, we
don't want to--

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.170
DONNA: Come on, come on, come
one, I can make you a cup of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.750
my famous tea.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.271
My house isn't much,
but it's mine.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.217
I'm not a rich woman, but
my needs are simple.

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:50.620
As long as I have my kitchen
and my garden, I'm happy.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.630
But I'd trade it all right now
for boobs that didn't drop

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.090
like the bond market every time
I remove my brassiere.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.550
You'll see when you
get older, kids.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.730
ZANDY: You really don't seem
that much older than us.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.720
DONNA: Oh, Zandy.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.990
Hey!

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.850
Why don't you start the
tea, and I'll get

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.740
David a clean shirt?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.600
ZANDY: Oh, uh, OK.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.710
DONNA: This is where my ex
left all of his clothes.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.700
I call it the closet of awful.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.680
I know it's so crass to call it
that, but you have to admit

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.530
it's a funny name.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.580
Here, this should fit you.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.830
I think you're about the same
size as the asshole

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.900
who ruined my life.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.782
Here, let's get this gunky
shirt off of you.

00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:28.554
Woo!

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:33.685
Uh, exactly how young are you?

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.780
DAVID: 40.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260
DONNA: Oh, God.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.000
David, we can't do this, OK?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.310
For a million reasons.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.490
You're young enough to be my
grandson, I'm a shop owner,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.422
you're a wage slave, it's just
wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:50.282
Oh, God!

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:51.250
Ah!

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.702
Oh, God!

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:55.122
Ah!

00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:57.070
I can't believe it.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.690
We should go down and
get some tea.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.580
DAVID: Can I get a milkshake?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.570
DONNA: I practically
invented the shit.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.150
Come on!

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.438
ZANDY: Tea's ready.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:04.688
DONNA: Uh uh uh.

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:23.410
Oh, it's funny.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.520
I thought my libido had taken
a one-way trip to dudsville.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.570
But as it turns out, there was
a return ticket and that date

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.985
was July 23rd.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:38.970
No, don't check your
iPad, that's today.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.140
What do you even see
in me, David?

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.160
How could you be attracted
to this?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160
My body is covered in cobwebs, I
smell like formaldehyde, and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.410
my sex is so rusty
it needs WD-40.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.495
DAVID: DW-40.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:50.480
DONNA: DW-40?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.196
DAVID: I'm DW, and I'm 40.

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:55.805
DONNA: God, I keep forgetting
you're such a baby.

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:59.800
You know, when I was your age,
the big movie out was Star

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.890
Wars, Episode I, The
Phantom Menace.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.290
DAVID: Right, like
10 years ago.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.030
DONNA: It's just so
wildly unheard of,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.430
what we're doing here.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.690
WILSON: Donna!

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.475
Are you up there?

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:11.510
DONNA: Oh no, it's my ex.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.960
I call him the jerk man.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.520
DAVID: Shh!

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.730
DONNA: Don't tell him, OK?

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.163
Come on.

00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:16.899
It's going to be so bad.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.164
WILSON: Donna!

00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:19.930
Who's the little kid?

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.260
Are you running a
nursery camp?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.000
DONNA: Oh, Wilson, you wouldn't
know a nursery camp

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.620
if it hit you in the face.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.730
WILSON: OK, OK, I'll
take the jab.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.250
But who is this guy?

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.285
DONNA: Uh, he came here to work
on the Gulfstream 450.

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:33.880
DAVID: You have a
private plane?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.040
DONNA: Yeah, I know it's
indulgent, but it's so great

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.015
to fly into the city for
dinner and the opera--

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:38.950
everyone should do it.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.585
WILSON: Donna, seeing you lying
here with this gorgeous

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:45.310
boy, I'm remembering what an
amazing woman you are.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.160
You're ripe, like
an old cheese--

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.696
pungent, bacteria-filled,
and crumbly.

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:53.295
I'm tired of fresh Buffalo

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:56.400
Mozzarella, I want aged Stilton.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.736
You're my Stilton.

00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:03.104
FEMALE SPEAKER: You are
on fire, Donna!

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:05.220
Your ex-husband and
that bald-spot

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.860
boy-toy all in one day.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.362
Ah, at this point I'd
take any sex!

00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:12.350
DONNA: Well, I feel like a
school girl again, and I don't

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.784
care who knows it!

00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:15.218
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, God!

00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:16.652
Look at you!

00:05:16.652 --> 00:05:19.510
DONNA: But I'm keeping the
BenGay people in business.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know,
I think sex during

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.680
middle age is overrated.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.120
I'd much prefer a shopping
spree at Tiffany's and a

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.790
chocolate mousse.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.756
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:33.670
DONNA: I think I peed in
my pants over that one.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.162
Woo!

00:05:34.162 --> 00:05:35.638
FEMALE SPEAKER: You did!

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:37.114
I saw it!

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:42.792
DONNA: Yes!

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.170
Oh, gosh.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.855
Well, shall we get started?

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:53.305
DAVID: What is going on here?

00:05:53.305 --> 00:05:55.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're going to
eat you so we can stay young.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.270
ZANDY: We're really not that
much younger than you.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.300
DONNA: We can just dip some
chunks of them into

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.190
this hot olive oil.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.590
I'm off the butter.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.693
Gotta watch the hips if I'm
going to keep screwing younger

00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:05.943
guys all the time!
