00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.750
Here we are.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.290
We're going to go to Question #1 which is,
I've had the opportunity to see many gymnastic

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.810
programs and their related conditioning programs
in action.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.690
Why is it that many programs fail miserably
when it comes to producing quality results?

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.600
Well, this is kind of a complex question.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.210
There are many components that go into a gymnastics
program.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.040
They have to be carefully planned, implemented,
monitored to ensure success.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.620
Failure in any one of these categories can
lead to failure in the results or less than

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.030
satisfying results.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.800
The answer to this question would require
an evaluation of all the components, you know,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.949
the training efficiency, the way your gym
is set up, coaching education, the staff communication,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.220
your event requirements, sports psychology,
nutrition, and of course, the conditioning

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.220
program.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.629
Basically, the scope of this presentation
will focus on the conditioning program and

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.840
the related reasons for the success or failure.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.720
But in all actuality, the answer for any failure
in any aspect of a program is pretty universal.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.590
Basically, it comes down to coaches.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.630
So the failure of most conditioning programs
basically falls in the lap of the individual

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.950
coaches and that's twofold.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.659
There are two reasons for that.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.340
One is a lack of knowledge.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.080
By the fact that you guys are sitting here
and listening to this webinar, obviously you're

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080
seeking knowledge.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.520
So you're definitely on the right track there.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.700
But then there's the harder aspect of a conditioning
program and that's the willingness to implement

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.700
the demands for quality on a daily basis.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Knowledge is easy to obtain.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.860
There are a lot of individual resources that
you can go out and obtain knowledge from.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:16.090
The harder thing is implementing that knowledge.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:26.310
One of the things that cause failure in the
conditioning programs is that some coaches

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.900
just feel like conditioning is an afterthought.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.040
There's no plan.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.260
There's no structure.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.319
There's no rhyme or reason.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.319
There's no content.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.010
They just throw out some exercises and expect
results.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:48.629
A lot of college coaches go to a lot of different
programs and I try to pick their brain as

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.870
to what they see when they go out to these
individual programs and they say the same

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.870
thing.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.500
They just see a lack of commitment on the
part of coaches to deliver results.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.120
You know, a lot of coaches just have unsupervised
rotations or circuits.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.580
They just send the kids out there to go do
the exercises, and this is definitely a major

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.739
flaw in any program.

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.240
Conditioning rotations require as much if
not more hands-on attention than any other

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.240
event.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.080
It has to be considered that fifth event of
training.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.750
Some coaches think it's not as glorious teaching
a push-up or a pull-up as it is a kip or a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.409
back handspring or whatever and so many times
the more experienced coaches pawn off conditioning

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.730
rotations to the less experienced, and I think
this is also a little bit of a mistake and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.640
leads to failure.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.670
Conditioning rotations are often times used
for a break, for coaches to go talk to parents

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.909
or do their coffee break.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.689
That sends the message to the athlete that
conditioning is not important and if that's

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:09.330
the underlying feeling or philosophy of your
program, you're definitely doomed for failure.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.200
You know, there's this underlying thing also
that coaches are a little gun shy about making

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.720
kids work harder than they actually want to.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.840
You know, conditioning is work.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.290
In order to get good at it, to get stronger,
it requires effort and if the coach is not

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:33.040
willing to push kids beyond their perceived
limitations, they're not going to get the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.900
results that the program needs to have and,
you know, they succumb to a kid crying.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.130
The first time a kid cries, they back off,
or the first time they get a complaining parent,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.259
they back off.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.620
If you have a standard, you have to stick
to it.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.530
You have to stick to your guns, you know?

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.660
A lot of times, you'll lose kids over your
conditioning program, but if it's what you

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.620
want and it's the standard that you've established,
you're going to have to stick to those guns.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.139
Another major problem that leads to failure
is the inconsistent expectations.

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.330
One day we work hard, the next day we have
fun and games.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.860
One day we allow bent legs, the next day we
require straight legs.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.150
This sends that mixed message to the athletes
and establishes kind of a just haphazard expectation

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.490
out there and a haphazard standard.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.660
You need to be consistent across the board
from all levels, from top to bottom, in your

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.160
program as to what you expect and accept.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.110
I've always said that, athletes will always
give you what you expect, but more importantly,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.419
what you accept out of them.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:49.480
So I guess the bottom line to Question #1,
what's the biggest cause of failure in a gymnastics

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
program?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.040
Basically the biggest cause of failure is
coaches refusing to look in the mirror, refusing

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.960
to put the effort in.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:41.410
If they're not willing to work at it, the
kids aren't going to work at it.
