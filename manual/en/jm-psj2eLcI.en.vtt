00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.760
Even though we have no place to go home to

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.620
the seas are vast, and the skies are far

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.900
Anywhere that we go, surely you were also there

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.680
For my wish to come true, I want to sleep your side

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.740
“It’s going to be alright, certainly”

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.600
Look at me running off

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:07.200
The meaning that you helped lead us with now rests in these clumsy fingertips…

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:16.540
These accelerated days heat me up, as well as the past

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.320
without even knowing what it means to fight

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.420
Even if we still had a place to go home to

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.900
a room for one still feels spacious enough

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.460
Surely out there somewhere, you are also out there

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.340
sleeping somewhere that isn’t here

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.780
Saying “It’s going to be alright”

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.740
while also hiding all of my scars

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:31.140
Depending on bravado, pretending not to have noticed anything

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.920
Soaring off to southern skies, the birds migrate

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.780
also not knowing what it’s like to have a home

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.320
One of these days, when we can meet again

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.160
we’ll smile at each other, and take each other’s hands…

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.580
Even though we have no place to go home to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.300
the seas are vast, and the skies are far

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.580
Surely out there somewhere, I will be there too

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.780
That is undoubtedly a restful fortune
