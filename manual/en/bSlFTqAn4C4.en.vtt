00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.560
Hello, everybody!

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.364
The day that we've waited for almost a year has arrived.

00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:19.903
Day of The International. Key Arena is hosting it again,

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:21.138
she's right behind my back.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:24.841
We start our review of Key Arena from here,

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:30.347
with this red carpet, to which limos deliver players every morning.

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:35.018
They high fives and smile before the cameras.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:41.858
Unfortunately, there are less teams every day, limos only deliver teams that are currently playing.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.930
Teams that have finished their participation, get here by bus.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:51.968
Let's not just stand still, let's go and see Key Arena!

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:55.572
For start, let's walk around it.

00:00:55.772 --> 00:01:00.377
Each visitor is welcomed by this tent in The International's colors.

00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:06.750
If you provide you ticket and badge, you'll receive a bag with some gifts inside.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.785
Let's take a look.

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:16.927
By the way, ticket costed $99 for all the event, but some re-sellers offered us an attractive prize of $150.

00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:21.364
Though, they asked $300 from Xeo. $150 was a prize for me.

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:31.608
VIP-tickets were not available to buy, they were only played between those who had already bought regular tickets for $99.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.614
So, you show your badge, they mark it.

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:39.015
Like in a tramway.

00:01:41.218 --> 00:01:44.321
And you receive a bag.

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:47.157
Notebook.

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:50.460
Secret Shop catalog.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:53.563
Bottle.

00:01:55.232 --> 00:02:00.270
A Secret Shop form, which you fill in order to buy stuff.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.439
Golden pen.

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:09.579
A sunscreen.

00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:14.417
A pin.

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.090
A wristband.

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:30.066
A form for stickers. If you gather them all, you'll get some courier or so.

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.770
And commercials.

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:36.439
And Aegis!

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:46.516
The main difference from the previous International is that Valve have enlarged the territory of the tournament.

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:54.991
Last time, Secret Shop was a tent with a queue that could wrap Key Arena a few times.

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.727
This time it is a separate unit.

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:05.302
People, who are waiting for the desirable merch, do not miss any match.

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:09.973
They can observe them on this huge screen, sitting on a grass.

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:14.878
A lot of people even choose this place over packed and loud Key Arena.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:19.449
Though, any random park visitors can freely join them here.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:25.655
There are a lot of activities aside from standing in line and watching Dota.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:33.530
You can eat, drink, you can even visit a trailer with a Virtual Reality which is located behind the scene.

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:40.904
We already had an opportunity to test this wunderwaffe, now Valve allowed everyone to try it out.

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:47.410
Here's the Secret Shop which opens tomorrow for crowds of people.

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:52.916
By the way, v1lat made a review of the Secret Shop during the pre-selling day.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:55.852
The video is already on our Youtube channel.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.988
Here's the entrance.

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.459
We see a banner "Welcome to The International" and Phantom Lancer.

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.095
Let's go inside.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:09.733
The security checks your badge and bag.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:14.137
Here is where workshopers hang out.

00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:19.743
They meet their fans here, present them in-game signatures and sets.

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.880
I guess, we'll make a separate movie about this place.

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:29.052
Hungry dota fans fill this hall between matches.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:30.787
They can buy food and drinks here.

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:36.126
As on any other sport event in Key Arena, beer here is $8 per one.

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:42.399
Also there is a showcase with the merch from the Secret Shop.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:46.503
Such charging stations are all over the Arena.

00:04:46.503 --> 00:04:53.109
The International visitors sure shoot tons of photos and viedos, upload them all immediately to Instagrams and other Twitters,

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.245
so, their devices are running low.

00:04:55.245 --> 00:04:59.316
As we can see, Valve have taken care of their guests.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:03.520
We just came and bumped into this banner.

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:08.224
Usually, cosplayers hang around here and people take photos of them.

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:11.628
Above us are teams pennants.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.699
Per 8 for each of two entrances.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.901
Well, let's move on.

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:21.504
You can imagine here that you are a cool mid player.

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:26.276
Take a selfie of it and post in on Instagram with #dota2ruhub.

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.320
We are in the suit.

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:43.259
Right now it is occupied by our analysts and casters, who watch dota in their free time.

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:46.963
Each team got the same room for their needs.

00:05:46.963 --> 00:05:51.634
You can have a tea or coffee, well, full service.

00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:57.607
Apart from it, it's a beautiful view on the stage. As in any point f Arena, actually.

00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.212
The coolest thing Valve have prepared this year, as all talents agreed,

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:11.621
as all fans agreed, are lighting effects, which are popping every time any hero casts his ulti.

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.292
I lied when I said that you can see dota from any spot of Key Arena.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:21.531
The only one place with a bad view is casters desks.

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:27.937
There are three of them: our guys, English-speaking and Chinese colleagues.

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:39.215
To my right is Aegis. Desirable trophy for anybody. Captain of the world's best team will raise it in just several days.

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.486
We'll watch it and enjoy the event atmosphere.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.823
Thank you for joining me in this walk around the Key Arena.
