00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.590
The brain is divided into functional

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.469
regions. Certain areas are responsible

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.510
for conducting specific functions within

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.580
the body. By observing the motor

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.920
manifestations and sensory responses

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.080
during the seizure, the neurologist may

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.000
be able to determine the brain region

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.390
affected. The Frontal Cortex, including

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.339
the motor and sensory cortices, are

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.740
responsible for consciousness, movement,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.380
and physical sensation. Seizures

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.450
occurring in this region include

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.700
posturing seizures in which the limbs

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.190
are maintained in unusual positions for

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.010
several seconds. There may be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.900
vocalizations or speech arrest. Some

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.780
seizures may include salivation,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.170
swallowing, upset stomach, and/or fear.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.780
The Motor Cortex has specific regions that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.760
direct movement of all parts of the body.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.490
If a partial seizure occurs in this part

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.680
of the brain, it will affect movement of

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.800
specific muscle groups. The Sensory

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.590
Cortex also has specific regions that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.690
direct sensations of all parts of the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.270
body. If a focal seizure occurs in this

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.100
part of the brain, it will affect

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.050
sensations to a specific part of the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.470
body. A cut section through the motor and

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.020
sensory cortices demonstrates how much

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.940
of the brain surface controls each

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.280
region of the body. The body part

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.740
affected by the focal seizure depends on

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.570
the location of the neurons involved.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.120
The Parietal Lobe processes your

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.760
sensations and determines your sense of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.640
body position. If a focal seizure occurs

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.740
in this part of the brain it may produce

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.350
numbness or tingling to a specific part

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.780
of the body. It may also affect body

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.600
position awareness, causing illusions of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.850
distorted limb position posture or

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.960
movement. The Occipital Lobe is

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.210
responsible for visual perception and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.060
processing. If a focal seizure occurs in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.860
this part of the brain, it may produce

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.080
visual disturbances or visual

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.390
hallucinations, such as multi-coloured

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.530
balls or patterns. Seizures in the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.989
temporal lobe produce a galaxy of

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.630
complex and or simple sensations of

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.230
illusions or hallucinations or both.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.970
Whirling or tenderness in the stomach,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.430
known as an epigastric aura, is most

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.130
common. Seizures may affect ability to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.230
communicate, cause them to hear buzzing

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.680
voices, music, and other sounds. Auditory

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.959
and visual hallucinations often occur

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.239
together. This type of seizure may also

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.790
produce feelings of fear and deja-vu.
