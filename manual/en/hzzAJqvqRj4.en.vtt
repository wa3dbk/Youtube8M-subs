BRANDON SARKIS: My name is Brandon Sarkis
on behalf of Expert Village. Today, I'm going

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.630
to be showing you how to use Adobe's Lightroom
Software. Now, you can see we're going to

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.540
do some work with the web module. So it's
over here at the top of the left hand cor--right

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.880
hand corner. We're going to click on that
and you'll see I've got a slide show already

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.000
opened up here. But we're going to go on the
right--on the left hand side here. You can

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.160
see our little preview window. We can go through
our template browser. Let's go through our

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.320
templates here. I want to pick the blue sky
template. So it's going to take a second for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.140
it to load up. Now, what's going to happen
here is it's--I don't have a preview set up

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.739
for it, well, let's try the classic one. So
I'm gonna--I mean, I can pick a picture but

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.750
you're not going to see anything until you
actually update it. So let's go back to--we'll

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.770
go back to blue sky and we've updated it.
It's taking just a second. And we can see

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.219
on our web page here, or it's actually a local
web page, it's hosted from inside the browser.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.170
This isn't actually posted to website yet.
You can see it what our slide show looks like

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.930
after I posted it, pretty nifty. Let's go
back to lightroom real quick though. You can

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.299
see on the right hand side, we can make either
a flash gallery, or html gallery, and go to

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.060
our site info and put our title and collection
title, and the description, and contact info,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.939
whatever e-mail links. Pull that. We can go
through our color palette, and we can change

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.000
all the colors in the actual page like the
header bar, the title bar, the side bars.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
Next to that, you're going to have your appearance.
It's going to show them that you want your

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:43.090
identity plate on there. You're also going
to have image size, thumbnail image sizes,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.880
image info. You can go to custom settings
here, like to show your titles and captions.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.560
You can have it--you can go by date, or by
equipment, or lens, or camera, or ISO, whatever.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.420
Your output settings here, you can change
your quality. And you can also--make sure

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.350
you add your watermark, which is very, very
important. Here, you'll see--oh, actually,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.229
these are your upload settings. This is uploading
to an FTP server. You'll see all your stuff

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.109
right there. I don't want to show you my website.
So I won't actually put the information in.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.269
But it's really nice to be able to just click
on export or upload here. It's really nice

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.029
to be able to do this from inside an application,
as opposed to using a separate application.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:24.709
It keeps everything nice and contained. So
all in all, it's a very nice feature to have.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.049
So you should be posting your photos online.
