00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.860
What's up, Rob Here

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.540
Man Vs. Pin

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.860
Have you seen this pin?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:12.140
It's been floating around recently, it's the wire flower nail polish..BS

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.020
XxBroadwaygonnabexX, VoxAZ and KeraKobayashi have and went as far as suggesting it in comment's below

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.360
I dunno you guys, this looks pretty unrealistic

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.400
I mean the best part really is in the instructions when they automatically jump from 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.340
Empty flower petal to magically painted awesomeness.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.420
Let's see what's up with this one

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.740
First up, I need to make the flowers

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640
I'm already disliking this project

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.940
Alright, I got a couple tips online

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.200
To start I picked up some small gauge wire,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.100
I secured a loop around the pen or if you have any sort of small circular object

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260
I wrapped it around a few times, slipped it off

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.900
I looped the loose wire there around all of them a couple of times

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.860
I created a little stem by twisting the two wires together

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.480
I got fancy and made a leaf

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.320
Then pulled down each of my loops 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.860
And twisted them individually into a petal

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, I'm not the master of wire crafts and this Man Vs. Pin is not about perfecting petals

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.340
In the end I got this thing, which looks more like a 4 leaf....clover

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.400
Deal with it.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.660
So I busted out the nail polish

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.580
Just your regular run of the mill bottle

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.380
And began to paint on the leaves

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300
Alright I'm painting the edges and hoping that I can maybe 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.120
Build up the polish somehow there and then spread it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.360
Across..kinda making this like a...this..this thin film

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.460
Run across it..That's not..that's not working..

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.500
Um..

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.140
Every reason why you thought this pin was BS when you saw it is EXACTLY true

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.960
I even tried a different brand, a little bit more expensive, same thing

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.880
Nothing.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.940
It's a good thing I did a little digging and found this video over on EasyMeWorld

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.420
She does it absolutely no problem

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.560
But here's the secret

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.860
Glue.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.920
With a bottle of Aileen's glue, which she said was best, I slowly was able to build up the glue

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.160
Spread it on over the petals with Ease

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.520
No problem

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.820
Created a little film that stretched across it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.840
Awesome

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.160
It doesn't take a lot of glue and you gotta give it a minute to get the hang of it

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980
You just slowly carry the glue over from one side of the petal to the other

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.260
You get it after the first couple and then it gets really easy

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.160
Then I let them dry for a few hours until they turned clear 

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:28.372
Pretty awesome

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.180
Then you easily just paint on the color you want covering the front and the back of the petal

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.080
Boom.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360
Four Leaf Cover

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.540
Looks..Pretty close..

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.940
You know, I'd say that this pin totally works, just gotta add that extra step of the glue and you're in business

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.400
Real quick, while I got the nail polish out, 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.340
I saw this pin from viewer MeHasCookie, suggesting this marble flower pot pin

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.680
So I thought I'd give it a shot

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.080
I got a bucket and a couple of clay pots

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.240
I filled the bucket up with water to about the height of the pots and began to add various color nail polishes

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.520
It got pretty awesome pretty fast

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.340
The paint floats up to the top, it forms these awesome pools of psychedelic color

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.600
Kinda toxic from with fumes

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.580
But still pretty cool

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.180
I dipped the pots in to the mixture and like some sort of sorcery, the paint just clings on

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.020
And secures itself..To the pot

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.940
*BLEEPING* Nuts

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.180
I did a couple of them and...they're my new favorite thing

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.200
