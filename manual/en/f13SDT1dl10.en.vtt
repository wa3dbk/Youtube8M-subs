00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.899
Globally, 1 in 5 teenage girls is out of school.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.320
Find what we can do about it now on the Youth Effect!

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.030
(music)

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.990
Hi, my name is Vivian Onano,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.050
I was born and raised in a village in rural Kenya, 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.930
where I saw so many of my girl friends drop out of school. 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.890
Fortunately, even though I was raised by a single mother who had unstable income, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.520
she made sure I got an education.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.050
In fact, I’m one of the five girls in our village to get a bachelor degree. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.160
At the recent youth forum, we asked, 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.380
can you imagine if half the girls in your class dropped out?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.420
(JeongYeon Lee) No I cannot imagine that at all.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.740
(Cecilia Simon) In my home country of Sweden, I don’t think that would ever happen.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.880
(Mirna Fernandez) Girls more than boys will sustain the family, and will take care of the next generation, 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.470
so why shouldn’t I go to school?

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.190
So why is this still happening, why do we have so many girls still out of school?

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.870
(Paulina Wojciechowska) A lot of people don’t see the potential of girls.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.300
(Kadijatou Diallo) They’re seen more as the caregivers.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.080
(Anh Nguyen) More labour is needed in the field.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.780
(Henry Ekwuruke) It’s all about the poverty and inequality. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.100
Hey I want to know more about this. Let’s talk to an expert. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.960
So why are so many girls not in school?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.060
Poverty is number one. 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.840
Poverty meaning ability to pay those school fees, 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.400
and more importantly the ability to supplement for what families

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.440
lose because the girls have gone to school. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.920
We need to address the ambition of girls themselves because

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.689
if a girl grows up in an environment where the role models

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.710
that are around suggest that it’s okay to come out of school

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.359
after 6th grade of 8th grade, then that is the attitude that she will come up with.  

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.720
A child who’s performing sub-optimally because the quality of teaching is so bad

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.799
the teachers are not teaching, there are no books in the classroom...

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.860
is likely to be withdrawn. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.280
The calculus is well she’s not in school, ah she can marry. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.850
And even when they do stay the attention that they get

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.050
going to be biased by social and cultural factors that cause them to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.660
graduate with perhaps fewer skills 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.360
and with lower earning power

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.400
then boys but they've been to school.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.600
Even after all the challenges girls face getting into school, 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.010
education is not even equal once they get there. 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.810
Is it just girl talk? What can boys do to reduce inequality? 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350
(Daniel Garay) I can just spread the word about these issues. 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.060
(Henry Ekwuruke) If I hear any parent telling any child that they can’t go to school, I’ll take it upon myself. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.620
(Jilt van Schayik) We grew up with stereotypes, which I think is completely wrong. 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.989
When you’re out for example playing football, and the girls are watching from the side, 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.889
let them join. Don’t say no football is for men. 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.440
Ok great, so we know the government should be involved and it’s important to have boys onboard. 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.450
But what can I do to help reduce gender inequality at school?

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
(Yixi Lang) Show our potential to our society.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.210
Try to show them what we are capable of. 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.520
(Elaina Estrin) Everybody should have, or mentor somebody.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.360
(Henry Ekwuruke) Young people have to be part of this global movement. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.640
(Jilt van Schayik) So they have to become active. 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.040
(Kadijatou Diallo) Whether it’s social media, whether in organizations in their own school, 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.440
whether it’s just talking to their friends about it. 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.460
(Elaina Estrin) Just help empower people. Push them to do things they believe in. Dream big.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.900
(Tionei Dziva) Because you know with women, if you empower a girl child, you empower the whole nation. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.670
(Henry Ekwuruke) Tell us we are brothers, we are sisters. And make us

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.840
to have understanding. Don’t divide us.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.020

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.340
