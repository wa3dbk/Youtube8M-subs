00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.467
Hello pilots!

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:04.000
Today's video is about a Tier Seven heavy fighter,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
the De Havilland 193 Hornet.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.233
So, we have left behind the De Havilland Mosquito.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.833
The Hornet is somewhat similar to the Mosquito,

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.833
but all we get from it are 500-pound bombs and rockets.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.733
It's not much, but better than nothing.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:35.200
But don't let the small amount of transferrable modules upset you.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.233
Even in its basic configuration,

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.333
the Hornet surpasses its predecessor in many ways.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.667
It is much faster, has a better climb rate and slightly more armor.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.700
Initial firepower is less than the Mosquito's,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.567
but quickly surpasses it

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.633
once the upgraded 20mm Mark Five Hispano cannons are installed.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.167
Even the manoeuvrability, the bane of high-tier heavy fighters,

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:02.633
has dropped only slightly.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:06.467
Let's see what niche our fighter has among

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.933
his companions at Tier Seven.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.333
If you compare its basic configuration,

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.833
the British heavy doesn't look too well.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:19.167
It lacks speed and has weak firepower.

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:20.833
However, as you upgrade it,

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.633
the ugly duckling turns into a beautiful swan,

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.033
or rather a swift Hornet.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.233
Being the least armored aircraft in its tier,

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.000
the elite Hornet is just shy of the F7F in terms of firepower.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.033
It boasts the fastest speed and the shortest time to turn 360 degrees.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.967
Such a set of specifications allows the aircraft

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:46.367
to successfully dominate the air space.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.267
Let's talk briefly about bombs and rockets.

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:52.933
Regardless of all the outboard weapons available,

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.167
they are not worth installing.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.767
They will drastically reduce the speed of the aircraft

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:05.300
and turn it from a swift Hornet into a fat sleepy fly.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.833
That's it for theory. Let's battle.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.800
Great! We're at the top of the food chain.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.867
After the countdown we shall climb about 2.5 or even 3 km up,

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:25.367
the speed of the aircraft making it quite an easy task.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:29.800
However, we shouldn't wander too far from our allies.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:34.100
This tier has lots of experienced pilots who can put up a good fight,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.867
so it's better to pick a group of allies and follow it into combat.

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:47.967
The Hornet excels in any type of combat, from intercepting enemy fighters

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.933
and attack aircraft to turning the tables on enemy heavy fighters.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:56.800
However, don't be a hero and push forward, it is better to win by being smart!

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:01.767
It's not a coincidence that our aircraft is called a Hornet:

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:05.100
you should try to approach an enemy when he least expects it,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.600
and sting him with all your guns.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.600
Even heavy fighters won't last long under the fire of four twenties.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:17.067
But do not buzz around the enemy for too long: the so called "fly-traps",

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:20.600
or enemy fighters, will be all over you pretty soon.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.633
So sting, then climb up and plan another attack.

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:25.767
Make the most of the Hornet's speed

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:28.333
and try not to lose it without a good reason.

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:33.067
Fighters can be attacked when they're passing by or even head-on.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.700
When attacking head-on, keep in mind that Hornet has four 20-mm cannon

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.200
which are best fired from 500-600 m away,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.800
so avoid engaging an enemy with longer-ranged guns.

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:54.033
You might also have rockets at you, so be ready to dodge them.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:59.400
By the way, a Hornet can also fire rockets right into an enemy,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.133
which is not easy, but certainly worth trying!

00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:06.333
Use caution when engaging heavy fighters and attack aircraft.

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:11.467
A Hornet has weak armor and can receive immense damage from their guns.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.700
Tail gunners can also damage a Hornet quite well,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.233
so it is best to pounce on heavy fighters

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.100
when they're being attacked by an ally,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.433
and attack aircraft are best intercepted

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.800
when they're closing in on a target.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:28.800
Don't forget that some fighters also carry bombs:

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.667
one of those is enough to send you back to the hangar.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.467
If you choose to mount outboard weapons,

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.533
your tactics will change completely.

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.600
Until you launch all your rockets and drop all your bombs,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.433
engaging enemy aircraft will be near suicide.

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.767
And in all seriousness, destroying ground targets

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:55.800
and AA guns is not worthy of a noble heavy fighter!

00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:01.367
Of course, if there are no allies needing help nearby,

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:07.067
and the enemy is winning, then you can stoop to it, but be ever careful!

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:10.367
The Hornet is far from the leader in firepower,

00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:13.300
and you should always keep that in mind.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.700
Sometimes you will enter a battle at the bottom of the list.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.700
Don't let this disappoint you, because your role

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.267
and tactics won't change much.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.300
Look around, try not to end up alone against several enemy planes,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.067
and keep close to the biggest allied groups.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.833
A Hornet's specifications allow it to successfully fight

00:05:37.933 --> 00:05:41.633
even against the Me.262, given good support.

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:46.633
The main thing to do is to dodge enemy attacks,

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.533
engage the enemies in their most vulnerable moments,

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:52.767
and fire all you can at them.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.133
Time to sum up the new info.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.467
The De Havilland Hornet will definitely appeal to those

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.433
who enjoy boom-n-zoom and fast attacks.

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:05.300
If you're not too good at boom-n-zoom tactics quite yet,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.000
this aircraft will help you master these tactics to perfection.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.367
Try using different approaches and tactics.

00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:14.233
A Hornet is a great aircraft both for beginners

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.833
taking their first steps towards higher tiers,

00:06:16.933 --> 00:06:20.200
and for experienced aces of aerial battles.
