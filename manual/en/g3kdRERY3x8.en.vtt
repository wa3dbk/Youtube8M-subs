“Hey everyone. I’ve got to tell you this
ride that Mike DeLancey will have by the end

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.540
of today is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately,
we can’t show it to you now because the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.750
unveiling happens at about one o’clock this
afternoon, but I can tell you that it’s

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.429
a Ford Explorer, and it is supped up. It’s
got everything, all the bells and whistles;

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.579
the paint job on this thing is absolutely
incredible.”

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.009
“It’s a one of a kind vehicle that was
developed by our two companies designed specifically

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.100
for the nedds of our U.S. veterans especially our wounded warriors, and we are here today to salute them

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.840
and  to tell them how much we appreciation their service.”

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.980
“The lance corporal, Mike DeLancey, will
get the ride of his life later on today. What

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.550
are your thoughts as you  look at that SUV. Honestly I am really excited. I can't wait until this is all said and done so I drive it home myself.
can drive this off the lot.”

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.780
“Coming back from going what you’ve went
through, you can still be sitting on the couch,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.100
enjoying benefits, but you chose not to. You know, you’re taking classes, you’re getting

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.100
back into society, there’s absolutely no
reason why you can’t get married and have kids and have a fulfilled life”  Yes sir.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.259
“Guys like him; they didn’t make it out

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:16.259
of our war. They never got to the helicopters and what not, those kind of injuries,

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:23.789
just didn’t make it, and I’m so happy
to see the guys getting what they deserve

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.049
now and instead of what we got when we came
home.”

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.719
“I think you’ll be amazed. This entire
vehicle can be accessed remotely from your

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.950
iPhone, iPad or Tablet, and he can just go
in by himself. He’s got hand controls; he

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.909
can drive it completely by himself.”
I guess, Kevin, we just yank this stuff off

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.759
or what? Do you need some help or?
Last time I saw DeLancey, it was about eight

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.899
years ago in Hawaii. It the initial event
of his injury in Haditha, Iraq. I was there

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.580
with him, and that was my friend the
whole time. We met in 2003, and we were in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.040
3-3 marines together. Now I am due to BraunAbility
flying me out, putting me out to see my friend.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.430
It’ll be the first time I’ve seen him
in that amount of time. I can’t wait. an

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.870
awesome event and an awesome thing that’s
happening out there. He went through boot

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.870
camp and was in a platoon with a close friend of his. Another Michael, Michael Guynes and he is here to help you unveil.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.370
 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.370
 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.370
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.370
 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.370
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.370
 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.370
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.370
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.370
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.370
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.370
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.370
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.370
This is the most beautiful thing, beautiful thing

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.370
 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.370
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.370
 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.370
 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.550
 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.550
So today is a great day, we unveiled the vehicle.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.260
Michael was blown away. I mean, he wasn’t really expecting what this really was.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.140
That was really the ultimate goal on why we
did this. When Sam came to me, he was like,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.120
Ryan we have to come up with a vehicle that’s
different than a van, different than these

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.610
pick ups that there doing. So let’s do an
SUV. So we figured out the Ford Explorer was

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.900
perfect to use. So we stated it and we pulled
it off. Today really speaks for itself.
