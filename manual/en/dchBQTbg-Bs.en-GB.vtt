Hi guys I'm Loz and I'm project manager at Nash

00:00:28.292 --> 00:00:33.626
This gives me quite a heavy involvement in the development side of things and bringing all the new product to market

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:37.209
I've got some brand new stuff with me today and some really exciting stuff

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.792
Let me take you through it and show you what is coming up

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:42.626
Hook Links

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.542
First of all we have got hook links

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.042
Now we have got some brand new hook link materials for you

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:49.292
To start off I'm going to show you Combilink

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.751
Combilink is your classic strippable coated braid

00:00:52.751 --> 00:01:00.501
Its semi stiff and as the name suggests it gives you a multitude of different rig combinations that allow your hook link

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.125
and your hook bait to behave exactly how you tailor it to

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:09.501
The first rig I am going to show you is my go to rig its my standard bottom bait setup

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:15.792
I've tied a blowback rig with a Fang Twister hook and a little bit of silicone tubing just to create a little kicker

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:22.501
What I have done is stripped the Combilink several inches below the hook

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:27.792
What this does is give me a stiff boom to help the hook link kick out as it is settling on the lakebed

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:34.501
But then it also gives me a nice supple movement there to allow the fish to suck in the bait and hook and get nailed

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:37.751
The next rig I have tied up is another blowback rig

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:45.501
What I have done this time is stripped the Combilink not only from the hook section but also from the swivel end as well

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:52.667
Stripping it at the swivel end gives me a nice hinge effect here and I still keep that stiff boom element for when the hook link

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.459
is settling on the lakebed

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.375
But I've got hinges at both ends allowing a lot more movement

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:05.292
For my third blowback rig what I have done is stripped a small section of the Combilink in the middle

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:10.999
What this does is give it a really nice hinged effect so if there is any debris on the bottom

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.209
rather than having a stiff hook link material lying across it

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.918
It hinges nicely and I know that it will contour to the lakebed

00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:30.125
So as you can see Combilink is really versatile and gives you a whole host of options for presenting your hook bait and hook link on the lakebed

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:35.667
Its available in three different colours: Weed green, gravel/clay and silt

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:41.792
and its available in four breaking strains: 15lb 20lb 25lb and 35lb

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.292
Next up is Armourlink

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:49.125
Now this is a really interesting one and something that a lot of people in the office are getting excited about

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:54.959
Its not a coated braid in the traditional sense it doesn't have a strippable coating like Combilink for example

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.375
but it does have a waxy PTFE finish to it

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:02.334
What this enables the angler to do is to use Armourlink in a couple of different ways

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:07.918
You can use it straight off the spool retaining its waxy coating and its a semi stiff supple braid

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:13.417
Or you can work it between your finger nails and it becomes a super-supple hook link

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:23.125
Armourlink is also very resistant to abrasion and fast sinking actually sinking three times faster than fluorocarbon so you know everything is pinned down on the lakebed

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:31.042
Armourlink is versatile its super supple and abrasion resistant it sinks well and its available in four different breaking strains and three colours

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:36.417
Weed Silt and Gravel in 15lb 20lb 25lb and 35lb

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.209
Cling On

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.667
We all know how important it is to get all your terminal tackle pinned down to the lakebed

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:56.751
Concealment is key and now we can bring you a dedicated range of Cling-On products that are tailored to pin all your end tackle down and give you the best possible presentation

00:03:57.042 --> 00:03:59.709
First up Cling-On putty

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.918
This has been around for a little while so some of you may have seen this its really easy to work with super heavy and now it comes in a cool tin

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:11.209
Its available in three different colours to suit whatever fishing situation you find yourself in

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:14.292
Next up is Cling-On leader

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:22.459
Its a leadless leader material and its super heavy and really supple so it hugs the contours of the lakebed nicely

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.083
Its available in three different colours Weed Gravel and Silt its got a 40lb rated breaking strain and its really easy to splice as well

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.501
Next we have Cling-On tungsten rig tube

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:52.542
This is really good for those waters where you might have a leader ban and you need some rig tubing

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.626
Its extra heavy so it pins everything down nicely to the lakebed

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:00.667
Next up we have got the tungsten Clingers

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:06.834
These are tungsten impregnated beads that can threaded on your mainline or onto your hook link and they have a range of uses

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:12.167
You can use them to pin your hook link down or counterbalance pop-ups

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:18.083
You can thread them up the mainline to help that sink and the large sized Clingers are particularly good for naked chods

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:23.876
As well as in tungsten the Clingers are also available in threes sizes in Diffusion Camo for extra concealment

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.667
Finally we have the Cling-On liquid

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:29.083
There has been a lot of excitement about this and rightfully so

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:34.667
It is tungsten-loaded liquid that can be painted and applied to your mainline leader hook links hooks

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.876
To keep everything pinned down and out of the way of the fish

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:46.334
So there we have it some great new additions to the Nash TT range

00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.209
They are in the shops now so go and check them out
