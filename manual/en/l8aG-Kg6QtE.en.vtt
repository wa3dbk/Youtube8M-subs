00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.160
Hello, welcome to Caseking TV. It´s quite a few years now

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.720
that a new brand came into the CPU cooler market, Xigmatek.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.560
The 1283 was one of Xigmateks first products.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.960
He was the foundation for the CPU cooler series. 
 Here we see some from the actual collection.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.520
Beside of that Xigmatek now also offers chassis, fans and power supplies.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.200
First, let´s talk about the 1283.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.360
The number already explains the cooler itself.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.240
12 is the diameter of the fan, 120 mm, so a big one.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.800
Next, 8 and 3 for the hetapipe configuration.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.720
8 mm diameter and a total of 3 heatpipes..

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.680
The cooler did win so many reviews and awards, because

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.200
he had some very special construction details.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.120
The construction of the floor is called HDT Heatpipe Direct Touch,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.520
Xigmatek developed this, others followed,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.760
In this technology the heatpipes directly touch e.g. the CPU 
 and are not fitted in the cooler itself.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.320
The pro is that the heat is taken directly 
 by the heatpipes and transferred to the cooler.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.520
A very powerful idea which is the source 
 of the high effectiveness of the 1283.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.560
Another technology that was very innovative at that time is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.880
the decoupling of the fan. Others fix the fan with clamps.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.800
Xigmatek uses these rubber pins, so the fans have some space to swing,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.920
which causes the decoupling, so that no vibration is given to the cooler.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.800
A very silent solution, optimized for silent computer cases.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:17.240
Another innovative technology, 4-Pin PWM connector.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:26.320
Opposite to the 3-Pin models, the pro is that the fan is adjustable.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.080
Depending on temperature on CPU. Higher temperature - more rounds and vice versa.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:37.080
Depending on temperature of the CPU. Higher temperature - more rounds and vice versa.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
A full automatic control, which does not need to be adjusted manually.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:50.640
All these technologies were the reason for the coolers success and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.440
became the progenitor for the whole series.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.600
As successor i would see the Balder, also a 1283 cooler.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.480
So same concept on this, 12 cm fan and three 8 mm heatpipes.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.160
If we place the two beside each other you 
 see that it is a real different construction.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.360
A different fan, with other structure and color,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.200
enlighted, so better looks with that fan, too.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.800
But also the cooler looks better. Even the 
 copper from the heatpipes is nickel plated.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.800
Very shiny, especially with lighting inside the tower makes it very attractive.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:58.080
Another new feature is that you can install two fans instead of one.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.160
More and better airflow resulting in better cooling.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.720
Next the actual top of the line product, the Aegir.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.480
More massive, more weight, as you can see bigger cooler,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.120
with bigger cooling surface, Also a 120 mm fan,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.920
but with a technology that started with Thors Hammer,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.000
dual layer heatpipe direct touch.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.360
The Aegir is fitted with two layers of heatpipes.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:51.840
The second is above the direct touching one 
 and so more heat can be dissipated.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.200
4 direct touching hetapipes and on top 4 more.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.200
High end model, when you need power for overclocking e.g.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.800
The other side of the spectrum is the Loki.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.760
Smaller model for 92 mm fans.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.840
We didn´t mount the fan to show the special structure.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.600
Little waves to enhance airflow and therefore the cooling.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.720
The Loki is intended for value for money customers.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.760
Same way go the two coolers you can see in the front.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:44.640
The Apache and the Durin. These are intended for small cases.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.920
Small towers or HTPC. The Apache has a blossom design,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.320
where the fins enclose the fan.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.600
Already available for some time.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.680
The successor with more power is the Durin.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.880
Also features direct touch heatpipes, quite big with 8 mm.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.280
Only 2, but don´t get distracted. 8 mm are 
 a huge pro compared to 6 mm diameter.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.240
Again featured with rubber decoupling mounting for the fan.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.200
Nice and good priced small cooler. Perfect choice for HTPC.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.120
Xigmatek really offers a nice range of products.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.920
They can rely on quite a history already.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.840
We couldn´t show some models, because it would have been too much.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:52.920
Little Overview, no matter if you need High End or smaller for HTPC.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:06.120
Thanks for watching. Soon we gonna show another video for Xigmatek cases.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.880
See you soon, bye.
