00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:08.509
I'm not like any other Kansai fighter.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.325
I'm Kizaemon Saiga.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.235
Not your typical fighter.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.548
And he's got a mouth on him...

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:28.278
I respected him, but there's really nothing special about him. He's kinda plain.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:33.396
All the good fighters are old, so they won't last long.

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:36.395
His sunglasses prove that he's gutless.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:41.128
His kicks are slow. He's slow. He's got no fire.

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:45.115
And what a mouth it is...

00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:49.558
When it comes to kicks, I'm the best hands down.

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.221
I shine and my kicks have fire.

00:00:53.382 --> 00:00:57.283
He's got no love for his opponent.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.654
As soon as I stood next to him, I knew I could take him.

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.963
He had the aura of loser about him.

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:06.283
Q: I've seen several of your fights...

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:07.828
Th-thanks!

00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:09.387
Q: You really get the crowd going.

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:11.678
It's nothing, really. Thanks.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.822
I'm not one of those fighters that is known for personal power.

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:27.810
I got where I am thanks to everyone who supported me.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.534
I feel like I've been living a dream.

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:32.931
And I owe it to everyone so I want to pay them back somehow.

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:38.468
So if you come and see the fight, I'll promise you a great time. An exciting time.

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:40.500
His favorite phrase

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.309
One for All

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:42.243
All for One

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.380
I'm nothing special.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.660
But I hope I can make people glad they came to see me. I hope I can inspire them.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.603
I hope they find me entertaining.

00:01:56.603 --> 00:02:00.303
I hope I can get people to watch more fightsports.

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:06.262
Get them interested in kickboxers, kickboxing, or K-1, then I've done my job.

00:02:06.262 --> 00:02:11.603
I just would like to get more people into the sport.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.517
Sorry for rambling on.

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:19.019
He brings humility and a love for the sport to the ring.

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:25.255
Let's get rid of all the old-timers and let the young fighters bring back some excitement.

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:28.301
I'll win by KOs only. Of course it means nothing unless I'm champ.

00:02:29.157 --> 00:02:31.597
Who needs the 70-kilo class?

00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:35.262
I'm gonna make them realize that if they're gonna show fighting, that the 63-kilo class is the way to go.

00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:38.827
I'll just do my best and win it all.

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:42.202
You really see someone's humanity in the ring.

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:46.979
I'll do what it takes to stay aggressive and show what Fire Harada is all about.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:52.098
I want to win and show that I have something that the young-ones don't have yet.

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:53.937
Q: Show 'em what the old man can do?

00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:56.441
Yes. You could say that.
