Hi, my name is Mitra Chester, and I'm here
at Deluxe Resale Shop in Eugene, Oregon, and

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.240
I'm going to talk about methods of softening
new jeans. If you already have purchased a

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.259
new pair of jeans that are stiff, the best
way to start softening them and breaking them

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.352
in is to wash them with some fabric softener.
If you haven't purchased them yet and you're

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:27.280
concerned about softness or stiffness, you
might think about some different fabric contents

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.840
and weaves of jeans that will be more likely
to soften more quickly. These four examples

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.570
of jeans are all 100% cotton, but these two
are examples of weaves that are not going

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.760
to be as likely to soften as easily. They're
thicker, they're kind of canvasy, they have

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.920
this very dark look to them. This is a classic
kind of denim wash. These are basic Levi's

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.190
and most of your vintage jeans originally
probably look like this. And they will soften,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:05.009
but you want to be careful with this type
of wash because if you wash them with hot

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:12.240
water and right side out you might achieve
some of this marbling effect, which in certain

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.670
people's opinion can ruin the look of your
jeans. So if you want to avoid that, you want

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.619
to wash them in cool water and turn them inside
out. But these will soften over time with

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.080
wear and washing. Again, try washing them
with a fabric softener, that will soften them

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.499
more quickly, and the more often you wash
them, of course, the more quickly they'll

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:38.560
soften. This is also 100% cotton, this already
has some pre-factory kind of fading going

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.610
on, and these are probably more likely to
soften up and to fade a little more quickly.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.619
So when you're thinking about softening your
jeans, that's usually accompanied with fading

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.849
because it is achieved through the process
of washing them. So if you don't want them

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.359
to fade and they won't soften as easily, you
want to buy a kind of this type of fabric.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.990
If you do, then you might want to buy one
of these two but keep in mind some of the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.680
side effects that come along with the different
washes. Now if you are concerned about softness

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.179
and you haven't bought a pair of new jeans
yet, you might try just buying a pair that

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.260
are already pretty stretchy and soft, which
means they're going to be a blend. So this

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.739
one is ramie, cotton, polyester, and spandex,
and you'll definitely know this type of fabric

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.600
and the difference between. This has no give
when you pull it, this obviously does. And

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.909
these are going to be softer and more comfortable
from the get go and will pretty much remain

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.269
that way through your washings. But those
are some techniques to soften your new jeans.
