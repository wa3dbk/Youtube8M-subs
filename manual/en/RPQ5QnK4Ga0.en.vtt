00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.429
Hey there. I'm so excited that you're watching

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.390
this tutorial today, so thanks for being
here. In this video we'll go over to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.880
different tools and supplies we will use to
finish these two little side tables.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.900
We're also going to cover

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.900
what kind of prep work needs to be done
before you paint pieces like this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.040
We're gonna start by
going over some of the supplies we're

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.230
going to be using today.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.440
First of all, some wood filler and a putty knife

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.079
then our paint. We're going to use
three different colors today. We're going

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.750
to use

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.379
Dark Roast, Harmony and Delightful.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.430
What I love about our paint is not only that
it is environmentally friendly

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.649
it's also super easy to work with. In the
next video I'll show you some tips 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.050
and tricks on how to create a beautiful
smooth 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.350
finish, as this is really easy to achieve

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.180
with our paint as well. It is also a very
durable paint

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.189
so if you want your project to last a long
time

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.490
then definitely this is the paint for you! We're going to be using

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.140
our Country Chic paint brushes today. This is a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.180
fabulous synthetic bristle brush. You
can create a beautiful smooth finish

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.400
with these kind of brushes.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.840
I absolutely love our Country Chic paint
brushes but you can use

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.750
other brands as well. Make sure it's a synthetic bristle 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.420
because if you use a hog hair,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.930
also called a natural bristle brush, if you use those kind of brushes you end up

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.119
getting lot texture on your piece.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.799
Maybe that's the look you're going for, great!

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.310
If you want a smooth finish, use
a synthetic bristle brush

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.460
like our Country Chic brush. I'm going to
be using

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.829
this sanding block and sanding sponge to
distress one of our

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.299
projects today. You can

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.569
use regular sand paper but I found these are 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.239
easier to use and you get a nicer finish with them.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.700
This is 120 grit.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.510
That's usually a good place to start. You can

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.849
experiment and try what you like best
but

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.209
I would suggest starting with 120 grit
and then

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.819
keep in mind though that the
lower the number, the courser the grit.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.370
So for example 80 grit sandpaper is very
rough.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.660
We're also going to be using kitchen
scrubby or scouring pad, or however you want

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.330
to call this,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050
to distress one of our pieces. You'll see
that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.610
in one of our next videos. Because we want our table tops to last a long time

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.440
I'm going to be using our Tough Coat and this is a foam brush

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.269
which I'm gonna use to apply it with.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.569
Tough Coat is a very high and durable

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.940
topcoat. It is super scratch resistant

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.720
and dries to a very hard and tough finish

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.480
without staying tacky. So it's ideal

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.300
for kitchen tables or bathroom
cabinets, kitchen cabinets

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.310
anything that gets a lot of usage you
are going to love

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.720
our Tough Coat for that. I'm also going to
show you how to use some of our different

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.549
waxes.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.400
This, for example, it is one of our
newest waxes, it's a white wax

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.940
as you can see.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.970
We're also going to use our
antiquing wax.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110
You can see this has been used before!

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.920
And we're going to use our natural wax.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.989
We're also going to use our

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.319
wax brushes. This is our large brush

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.200
that has been used for white wax, as you
can probably tell

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.330
and they are great for getting the
wax into

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.510
the nooks and crannies of your piece. If you don't have a wax brush

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.689
you can use a lint-free

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.830
painters rags, or you can cut up
an old t-shirt

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.030
It's a bit harder to get it

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.320
into the pieces or in the nooks and crannies of your piece

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.680
so that's why I like using the wax brushes.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.840
These lint-free cloths are

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.460
canvas type ones, and you just buy them at the hardware store,

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.699
I'm going to use these to buff

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.030
the wax after applying it and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.229
you can also use them to clean up spills
but actually I do prefer

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.060
paper towel if I make a mess.
Another product that we're going to be

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.490
using today

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.820
our Image Transfer Medium. We're going to apply

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.199
a graphic to one of our table tops

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.960
and this is the medium that we're going to be using for it.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.380
Okay let's start with this little green
table

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.699
It has a previously

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.990
painted surface and even though I don't think it's an

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.470
oil-based surface, I'm gonna show you a
little trick on how you can

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.410
see whether or not it oil-based or
water-based paint.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.940
What you'll do is grab regular nail
polish remover

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.240
not the acetone free kind, and put some
on a Q-tip.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.910
Then, take the Q-tip and rub it on the painted surface.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.169
As you can see my Q-tip has green paint
on it.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.250
This means that the green paint is
water-based/

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.580
If it would have been oil-based paint
the paint wouldn't have come off!

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.750
So what I did yesterday I wish I painted
this little

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.720
test section here to see how well the
paint adheres.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.150
It's a good way to test whether or not
you need to do you any more

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.140
prep work. So I'm just take my
fingernail and

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.980
run it across it and you see that I'm
not taking

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.300
the paint off and so this means that

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.330
I can paint this table without sanding it

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.920
Even though it is kind of glossy, it will adhere without problems.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.230
If you are able to remove some

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.430
the paint off your test section, or if you are dealing with an oil-based 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.480
surface then you definitely want to make
sure to 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.910
give your peace a light sanding with
120 grit

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:29.120
sand paper to remove some of the shine.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.920
As you can see I already removed the hardware and filled it up with wood filler.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.760
I'll also make sure to sand this area

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.950
nice and smooth.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.420
Now I'm going to take a cloth

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.360
and some soap and water

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.360
to clean off my piece.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.700
Before you start painting

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.070
you always want to make sure that you've properly cleaned your piece

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.230
because the paint will stick but it'll stick to the

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.430
dirt and grime on your piece and
ultimately then it's gonna

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.530
fall off. So by cleaning it you're making sure that the paint adheres

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.730
to your surface properly.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.500
Now I'm going to use these

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.000
push pins to lift the legs of my project,
which will make painting the bottom of

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.960
the legs much

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.850
easier. Okay that was it

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.220
for this video, if you want to dive in a
bit more I would suggest

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.280
going to the tutorial section on our
website.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.480
You'll find a lot more tips and tricks on
how to prepare the surface of the

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.490
piece you're painting

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.570
And make sure to check back
for our next video in which we are going

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.200
to cover how to paint your piece!
